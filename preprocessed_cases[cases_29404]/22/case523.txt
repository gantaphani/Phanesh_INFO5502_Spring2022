jeffrey kilbride and james schaffer defendants appeal their convictions and sentences for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud in connection with electronic mail,interstate transportation and interstate transportation for sale of obscene materials,and conspiracy to commit money laundering.we affirm,but remand for a clerical correction.
defendants convictions arose from conduct relating to their business of sending unsolicited bulk email,popularly known as spam,advertising adult websites.see united states kelley,cir thomas,dissenting discussing origins of spam label.defendants argue that the district court committed reversible error in its jury instructions defining obscenity,which criminalizes fraud in connection with electronic mail,is unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendants and on its face the district court committed a clerical error in its written judgment by labeling as felonies defendants convictions for fraud in connection with electronic mail defendants money laundering conspiracy convictions should be reversed because the required related activity charged in the indictment was not shown beyond a reasonable doubt to be unlawful as defined in and the district court erred in applying an obstruction of justice enhancement to kilbride sentence.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
background 
defendants bulk email advertising business 
defendants began their bulk email advertising business in.they initially operated the business through an american corporation,using servers in arizona.in response to new legislation regulating email communication,the defendants shifted the operation of their business overseas,running it through ganymede marketing ganymede,a mauritian company,and using servers located in the netherlands.although defendants used a business structure preventing a direct link to ganymede,defendants were its true owners and operators.if a recipient of defendants emails signed on to the advertised website and paid a fee,defendants earned a commission from the entity promoted.the advertisements appearing in defendants emails included sexually explicit images,two of which formed the basis for the obscenity convictions.
defendants had their employees place fictitious information in the headers of their bulk emails.defendants employee jennifer clason created nonsensical domain names and matched them with generic user names to generate a series of different email addresses that were almost certainly nonfunctional.these were placed in the from field of the headers of each email sent out another employee of defendants,kirk rogers,designed a program utilized by defendants that generated email addresses in the from field by combining the domain name used to send each email with the recipient of the email user name.in addition,the email address appearing in the from field and field of the headers of defendants emails differed,indicating at least one was false.
defendants also falsified information appearing in the registration of the domain names they used.the registrant for each of the emails was listed as ganymede marketing.the correct physical address for ganymede was listed,but the contact person and phone number listed were false.the email listed in the registration was never tested for functionality,though the evidence indicates that at some point it became invalid.a reverse of the internet provider address appearing in the email headers came back to a different entity,kobalt networks,registered in the netherlands.
indictment and trial 
on august,defendants were indicted for conspiracy to violate a through fraud in connection with electronic mail count,violation of a and a through such fraud counts and,interstate transportation of obscene materials in violation of counts and,interstate transportation of obscene materials for sale in violation of counts and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of count,and failure to meet record keeping requirements in violation of count.jennifer clason was indicted as a.she pled guilty and testified against defendants.
defendants were convicted on all counts following a jury trial.the two sexually explicit images forming the basis of the obscenity charges were introduced.jennifer clason testified to sending these images on behalf of defendants using the defendants bulk email interface.evidence was presented at trial as to the obscenity of the two images.the government called eight witnesses from various parts of the country who had complained to the federal trade commission ftc about defendants emails.these witnesses testified to the circumstances under which they received defendants emails,their reactions to and attitude towards the images sent by defendants,and their views on pornography generally.some of the witnesses did not specifically recall receiving the two images at issue.the government also presented evidence of over complaints received by the ftc from around the country concerning defendants emails,including the text of some of the complaints.defendants called jay pirouznia,a private investigator,who testified as to various digital video discs containing images similar to those at issue that he purchased in the phoenix metropolitan area and other counties in arizona.
prior to the reading of the jury instructions at trial,defendants objected to instructions relating to counts through on various grounds,some of which are raised in this appeal.following their convictions,defendants filed a motion for judgment of acquittal or a new trial raising grounds not at issue in this appeal.the motion was denied,but a separate motion to dismiss count was granted.
sentencing 
jeffrey kilbride kilbride was sentenced to months and robert schaffer schaffer was sentenced to months.the district court determined that defendants convictions under counts,and were misdemeanors under the terms of because the jury had not been asked to make the necessary findings under the statute to render defendants convictions felonies.however,despite referencing the misdemeanor penalty provisions of,the written judgments for defendants designated these convictions as felonies.
over kilbride objection,the district court applied a obstruction of justice enhancement to his sentence.the enhancement was based on kilbride attempts to prevent laval law,an officer of ganymede,from testifying.law traveled to the united states from mauritius to testify for the government in defendants trial on june,several days prior to law testimony,defendant kilbride filed an action in the courts of mauritius against law and other entities,alleging the illegal disclosure of ganymede documents.he obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting law and the other respondents from testifying concerning the affairs of ganymede and related entities and beneficiaries.kilbride filed his action shortly prior to the time for law scheduled testimony,despite the fact that the ganymede documents at issue in the action were obtained by the government in,and had been disclosed in discovery,and the fact that the government had made arrangements in may for law to travel and testify.in addition,in filing the action,kilbride asserted an interest in ganymede in contradiction to his attempts at trial to distance himself from ganymede.law subsequently declined to testify out of fear that he would be held in contempt in mauritius.on june,in light of the injunction,the government filed an emergency motion requesting that the district court enter a protective order determining the scope of law testimony.when confronted by the district court at a hearing on the matter,kilbride trial counsel agreed to take action that eventually led to the lifting of the injunction as to law,allowing law to testify.rejecting kilbride explanations for obtaining the order,the district court found that kilbride filed the action as an intentional tactical maneuver to prevent law from testifying and,therefore,merited application of the obstruction of justice enhancement.
ii.discussion 
challenge to jury instructions defining obscenity 
the defendants challenge their convictions on counts through on the ground that the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of obscene expression regulated by and.obscene expression is not protected by the first amendment.kois wisconsin,d.since the supreme court holding in miller california,the test for determining whether a work is subject to regulation as obscenity has the following three prongs 
a whether the average person,applying contemporary community standards would find that the work,taken as a whole,appeals to the prurient interest b whether the work depicts or describes,in a patently offensive way,sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable law and c whether the work,taken as a whole,lacks serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.
internal citations and quotation marks omitted.though miller involved application of a state obscenity statute,the miller test has subsequently been found to define regulated speech for purposes of federal obscenity statutes such as and,as well.see hamling united states,d united states schales,cir.
defendants challenge to the adequacy of the jury instructions definition of obscenity focuses on the instructions explication of the meaning of the term contemporary community standards.the application of contemporary community standards in defining obscenity is intended to ensure that so far as material is not aimed at a deviant group,it will be judged by its impact on an average person,rather than a particularly susceptible or sensitive indeed a totally insensitive one.miller,at.the court,in line with this view,has held,in a case involving obscenity disseminated via the regular mails,that for purposes of federal obscenity statutes no precise geographical area need be applied in defining contemporary community standards.hamling,at.as a result,in federal obscenity prosecutions,a juror may simply draw on knowledge of the community or vicinage from which he comes in determining contemporary community standards.id.
defendants raise alternative arguments as to why the district court improperly instructed the jury about the meaning of contemporary community standards.defendants first assert that the district court erred by instructing the jurors to apply the standards of communities beyond their own community or of a global community in determining contemporary community standards,contravening hamling expectation that jurors would look only to their own local community standards.second,defendants argue that as the obscenity at issue was transported via email,the district court erred by failing to hold that existing precedent was inapplicable and instructing the jury to determine contemporary community standards by reference to the national community.hence,in a sense,defendants argue the instructions fell between two stools.in the view of defendants,the instructions neither complied with the localized definition of contemporary community standards mandated by existing precedent,nor complied with the national definition of contemporary community standards that defendants propose we should now hold is applicable to expression disseminated through email.we review these alternative contentions in sequence.
standards of review 
we review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates an element of a crime,and we review for abuse of discretion a district court formulation of an instruction.united states peterson,cir.any omission or misstatement of an element of an offense in the jury instructions is constitutional error and,therefore,requires reversal unless we find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.chapman california,d see hedgpeth pulido,d.however,i n the absence of a timely objection to the jury instructions,we review for plain error.peterson,at quoting united states moran,cir per curiam.plain error review requires us to find an error that is plain and affects substantial rights.even if these conditions were met,we may only exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at quoting united states nash,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
adequacy of jury instructions 
defendants assert first that the jury instructions failed to comply with the prevailing definition of contemporary community standards for purposes of federal obscenity prosecutions outlined in hamling.defendants object specifically to various phrases in the district court jury instruction number defining obscenity,claiming they impermissibly allowed the jurors to rely on standards outside their own community or on some broad global standard in determining contemporary community standards.first,defendants object to the instruction reference to contemporary community standards as involving 
what is in fact accepted in the community as a whole that is to say by society at large,or people in general,and not merely by what the community tolerates nor by what some persons or groups of persons may believe the community as a whole ought to accept or refuse to accept.
emphasis added.second,defendants object to the portion of the instruction stating the community you should consider in deciding these questions is not defined by a precise geographic area.you may consider evidence of standards existing in places outside of this particular district.finally,defendants object to the portion of the instruction stating the parties have presented evidence concerning contemporary community standards.you should consider the evidence presented,but you may also consider your own experience and judgment in determining contemporary community standards.defendants assert this final portion is problematic because the only evidence of community standards presented by the government related to communities outside the district where the prosecution occurred.defendants objected to all these portions of the instruction in the district court.
we conclude,applying the prevailing definition of contemporary community standards put forth in hamling,that the challenged portions do not constitute prejudicial error.see chapman,at.reversal required unless error is harmless beyond reasonable doubt.the portion of the instruction stating that the relevant community lacks a precise geographic definition follows directly from hamling holding that the relevant community is not to be geographically defined in federal obscenity prosecutions,permitting the jury to apply their own sense of what contemporary community standards are,based on their own community.hamling.see also united states cutting,cir en banc stating contemporary community standards is a general standard,not a geographic one united states dachsteiner,cir neither miller nor hamling requires the trial court to define the relevant community in metes and bounds.no authority supports the defendants contrary notion that a district court must provide a clear geographic definition of the relevant community in a federal prosecution.hence,the geographic definition instruction in of itself was entirely appropriate.
similarly,the challenged portion of the instruction explicitly and implicitly allowing jurors to consider evidence of standards existing in places outside of the district is clearly permitted under hamling.there,the court found that,though jurors would most likely draw from the standards of the community they came from in determining contemporary community standards,this is not to say that a district court would not be at liberty to admit evidence of standards existing in some place outside of this particular district,if it felt such evidence would assist the jurors in the resolution of the issues which they were to decide.at.united states danley,cir while it is permissible in federal prosecution to define the state as a community,it is clear from hamling that consideration may be given to standards without the state.citations omitted.we read this statement in hamling as recognizing the entirely logical proposition that evidence of standards of communities outside the district may in a court judgment help jurors gauge what their own sense of contemporary community standards are.allowing jurors to consider such evidence is acceptable as long as jurors are properly instructed that they are to apply their own sense of what contemporary community standards are.the challenged instructions did exactly this and,therefore,in no way contravene hamling.
furthermore,at trial neither the government nor defendants argued that the jury should apply anything other than their own sense of what contemporary community standards are.both parties referenced the evidence of community standards outside the district merely as one piece of evidence to consider in determining contemporary community standards.hence,even were we to accept defendants view that the instructions could be read as permitting application of the standards of some community other than that of the jurors,neither party made any argument urging them to do so 
the instruction references to society at large and people in general are also not objectionable.defendants assert that these references indicated that the relevant contemporary community standard is a global or societal one.however,the two references instead simply form part of a general instruction to apply the standards of the community as a whole and not of specific persons or groups,which is the rationale for defining obscenity by reference to contemporary community standards.miller,at.this may have been made clearer had the instructions said the community at large,rather than society at large,but even as written we see no likelihood that the jury would have drawn from the challenged references,read in context,the view that the community standard they must apply is that of all of society or of the world.see hamling,at.j ury instructions are to be judged as a whole,rather than by picking isolated phrases from them.dachsteiner,at we have frequently held that jury instructions are to be judged as a whole,rather than by picking isolated phrases from them.
even assuming the challenged references erroneously allowed the jury to apply a global community standard,we conclude defendants were not prejudiced.the government at no point presented evidence to the jury purporting to illustrate a global or societal community standard and at no point argued to the jury for application of such a standard.the only reference to a global or communal community standard was in fact made by defendants,necessarily implying that such a standard would be more tolerant of sexually explicit material than a local standard.absent any argument or evidence presented to the jury illustrating a global or societal community standard less tolerant than that of the jurors own sense of contemporary community standards,instruction to the jury allowing application of a global standard or societal standard is harmless.cutting,at w hen an instruction has been given in terms of a national standard,the essence of the question of prejudice is whether the instruction may have led the jury to apply some specialized test that might differ to the defendant disadvantage from a generalized average person,applying contemporary community standards test.dachsteiner,at finding no probability of prejudice from instructions referencing national community standard because t he record contains no evidence that would have tended to persuade the jury that national standards of obscenity are more strict than those in the northern district of california 
hence,we conclude the district court instruction on the meaning of contemporary community standards was not prejudicial error according to the prevailing definition of obscenity in federal prosecutions.we now turn to defendants alternative claim that the district court erred in not finding the prevailing definition of obscenity inapplicable to works disseminated via email communication.
necessity of national community standard 
defendants assert in the alternative that hamling prevailing definition of contemporary community standards is not appropriate for speech disseminated via email.because persons utilizing email to distribute possibly obscene works can not control which geographic community their works will enter,defendants argue that applying hamling definition of contemporary community standards to works distributed via email unavoidably subjects such works to the standards of the least tolerant community in the country.this,defendants assert,unacceptably burdens first amendment protected speech.to avoid this constitutional problem,defendants argue,obscenity disseminated via email must be defined according to a national community standard.defendants,however,did not raise this argument in the district court.accordingly,we review the district court failure to instruct the jury to apply a national community standard for plain error.peterson,at.we agree with defendants that the district court should have instructed the jury to apply a national community standard,but we do not conclude that the district court failure to do so was plain error.
defendants argument is not an entirely novel one.in sable communications of california,fcc,d,the court rejected in part a facial challenge to a federal statute criminalizing the interstate transmission of obscene commercial telephone recordings.the appellant there offered sexually oriented telephone recordings nationally through the pacific bell telephone network.id.at.the appellant argued in part that the federal obscenity legislation under which it was prosecuted place d message senders in a double bind by compelling them to tailor all their messages to the least tolerant community.id.at.the court,relying on its previous holding in hamling,reaffirmed that the relevant contemporary community standards for defining obscenity under federal laws were not that of the national community and that the burden thereby placed on distributors of complying with varying local standards did not violate the first amendment.id.at.however,in so ruling,the court noted that the appellant was free to tailor its messages,on a selective basis,if it so chooses,to the communities it chooses to serve and that if the appellant audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards,the appellant ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages.id.at.
defendants assert that speech disseminated via email is distinguishable from the speech disseminated via regular mails or telephone at issue in hamling and sable because there is no means to control where geographically their messages will be received.hence,they can not tailor their message to the specific communities into which they disseminate their speech and truly must comply with the standards of the least tolerant community in a manner the defendants in hamling and sable did not.
the supreme court has analogously recognized that the application of localized community standards to define regulated indecent and obscene internet speech may generate constitutional concerns for exactly this reason.in reno aclu,d,the supreme court declared certain provisions of the communications decency act cda facially overbroad in violation of the first amendment.the cda provisions at issue in reno sought to regulate obscene or indecent expression on the internet relying on contemporary community standards to define regulated speech.id.at.the court listed as one among several issues of facial overbreadth in the cda that the community standards criterion as applied to the internet means that any communication available to a nation wide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.id.at.reno did not address,however,defendants argument that the application of local community standards to regulate internet obscenity by itself renders a statute fatally overbroad.
the supreme court fractured decision in ashcroft aclu,d,most directly addresses defendants argument.in ashcroft,the court reviewed the constitutionality of the child online privacy act,the narrower successor law to the communications decency act,which sought to regulate material harmful to minors transmitted via the world wide web for commercial purposes.id.at.the third circuit concluded that copa was facially overbroad on the narrow ground that it identified material harmful to minors,utilizing a test that relied on contemporary community standards.aclu reno,cir.the third circuit found that copa use of contemporary community standards was constitutionally problematic because web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular internet users.id.at.the supreme court vacated the third circuit judgment,holding that copa reliance on community standards does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for purposes of the first amendment.ashcroft,at.emphasis in original see id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.however,the eight justices concurring in the judgment applied divergent reasoning to justify the court holding.
justice thomas,joined by two other justices,recognized that,regardless of whether a national or local community standard was used for defining material harmful to minors under copa,the variance in community standards across the country could still cause juries in different locations to reach inconsistent conclusions as to whether a particular work is harmful to minors.id.at.justice thomas,nonetheless,did not find this variance in community standards constitutionally problematic because copa was,unlike the cda,narrow in application.id.at.as a result,justice thomas found controlling the rulings of hamling and sable condoning variance in local community standards.id.justice thomas did not view as constitutionally significant that distributors of potentially obscene material via the internet could not control where the material was read.id.at.justice thomas explained if a publisher wishes for its material to be judged only by the standards of particular communities,then it need only take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables it to target the release of its material into those communities.id.were justice thomas opinion the opinion of the court,we would likely be compelled to reject the defendants position.justice thomas opinion both denies the utility of and need for applying a national community standard in defining internet obscenity.
but justice thomas blanket dismissal of the overbreadth problem identified by the third circuit was not joined by a majority of the court.the remaining two justices forming the majority were much less sanguine about the application of local community standards in defining internet obscenity.justice,writing for herself,agreed with justice thomas that the respondents had failed to demonstrate on the record before the court that any variance in local community standards supported a finding that copa was facially overbroad.id.at.however,justice believed that respondents failure to prove substantial overbreadth on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the internet,for adults as well as children,in future cases.id.at.in justice view,given internet speakers inability to control the geographic location of their audience,expecting them to bear the burden of controlling the recipients of their speech,as we did in hamling and sable,may be entirely too much to ask,and would potentially suppress an inordinate amount of expression.id.justice concluded that,by contrast,the lesser degree of variation that would result from application of a national community standard does not necessarily pose a first amendment problem.id.at.as a result,justice viewed the adoption of a national standard as necessary for any reasonable regulation of internet obscenity.id.at.
justice breyer,also writing for himself,agreed with justice that 
t o read the statute as adopting the community standards of every locality in the united states would provide the most puritan of communities with a heckler internet veto affecting the rest of the nation.the technical difficulties associated with efforts to confine internet material to particular geographic areas make the problem particularly serious.
id.at.in order to avoid the serious constitutional issues raised by applying local community standards,justice breyer interpreted copa as applying a national community standard.id.at.justice and justice breyer opinions both support defendants view that application of local standards in defining internet obscenity raises a serious constitutional concern that can be alleviated through application of a national community standard.
the remaining justices in the majority joined justice kennedy opinion.justice kennedy agreed with justices and breyer that t he national variation in community standards constitutes a particular burden on internet speech.id.at.however,justice kennedy declared that w e can not know whether variation in community standards renders the act substantially overbroad without first assessing the extent of the speech covered and the variations in community standards with respect to that speech,which the third circuit had failed to do.id.at.justice kennedy opinion also disagreed with justices breyer and that application of a national community standard would eliminate any potential first amendment issue because the actual standard applied is bound to vary by community nevertheless.id.at.
the lone dissenter,justice stevens would have held that the use of varying local community standards to define speech regulated by copa rendered the law unconstitutionally overbroad for the reasons outlined by justices and breyer regardless of how it was construed.id.at.justice stevens noted that reliance on a national community standard,even if it could be read into copa,would not obviate any unconstitutional variances as jurors instructed to apply a national,or adult,standard will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country.id.at.
the divergent reasoning of the justices in and out of the majority in ashcroft leaves us with no explicit holding as to the appropriate geographic definition of contemporary community standards to be applied here.nonetheless,we are able to derive guidance from the areas of agreement in the various opinions.when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.marks united states,d quoting gregg georgia,d opinion of stewart,powell,and stevens,jj.we have previously applied this rule to construe one justice concurring opinion as representing a logical subset of the plurality.united states williams,cir.here,justice thomas opinion held broadly that application of either a national community standard or local community standards to regulate internet speech would pose no constitutional concerns by itself.none of the remaining justices,however,joined that broad holding.justices and breyer held more narrowly that while application of a national community standard would not or may not create constitutional concern,application of local community standards likely would.justice and justice breyer opinions,therefore,agreed with a limited aspect of justice thomas holding that the variance inherent in application of a national community standard would likely not pose constitutional concerns by itself.they did not join his broader conclusion,however,that application of local community standards is similarly unproblematic.in this latter disagreement,justices and breyer were joined by justice kennedy opinion,as well as justice stevens dissent.accordingly,five justices concurring in the judgment,as well as the dissenting justice,viewed the application of local community standards in defining obscenity on the internet as generating serious constitutional concerns.at the same time,five justices concurring in the judgment viewed the application of a national community standard as not or likely not posing the same concerns by itself.accordingly,following marks,we must view the distinction justices and breyer made between the constitutional concerns generated by application of a national and local community standards as controlling.
accepting this distinction,in turn,persuades us to join justices and breyer in holding that a national community standard must be applied in regulating obscene speech on the internet,including obscenity disseminated via email.a statute must be construed,if fairly possible,so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.united states,d quoting united states jin fuey moy.the constitutional problems identified by the five justices with applying local community standards to regulate internet obscenity certainly generate grave constitutional doubts as to the use of such standards in applying and to defendants activities.furthermore,the court has never held that a jury may in no case be instructed to apply a national community standard in finding obscenity.ashcroft,at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.to avoid the need to examine the serious first amendment problem that would otherwise exist,we construe obscenity as regulated by and as defined by reference to a national community standard when disseminated via the internet.id.at.breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment 
the government argues our proposed holding is foreclosed by our opinion in united states dhingra,cir.dhingra reviewed the constitutionality of b,which criminalizes enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.id.at.the defendant,who was convicted for enticing a minor through the internet,raised a first amendment challenge asserting,in part,that the statute was overbroad because it depended on local criminal laws to define the criminal sexual activity that falls within its ambit.id.at.in rejecting this challenge,we opined 
that the persuasion of others for sexual activity occurs over the internet offers no talismanic protection from the established rule that the burden of complying with the statute rests with the person doing the persuading.the fact that various community standards might apply does not make the statute unconstitutional.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.however,our analysis in dhingra is inapplicable here because we found b did not regulate speech.id.at because the statute regulates conduct,not speech,it is inappropriate to bootstrap our first amendment jurisprudence into the context of criminal sexual contact.to the extent dhingra language could be broadly interpreted as applying to regulation of internet speech,it is dictum and hence not controlling.therefore,dhingra does not preclude our reading of ashcroft.
in light of our holding,the district court jury instructions defining obscenity pursuant to hamling was error.however,this error does not require reversal because the district court error was far from plain.error is plain where it is clear and obvious.united states recio,cir quoting united states fuchs,cir.prior to our holding here,the relevant law in this area was highly unsettled with the extremely fractured opinion in ashcroft providing the best guidance.while our holding today follows directly from a distillation of the various opinions in ashcroft,our conclusion was far from clear and obvious to the district court.hence,we conclude that the district committed no reversible error in its and jury instructions.
vagueness challenge to 
defendants challenge their convictions for violation of on the ground that is unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied to defendants conduct.defendants previously raised their vagueness challenge in the district court.therefore,we review the district court determination of the constitutionality of de novo.united states naghani,cir.

a.section a provides 
whoever,in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce,knowingly registers,using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant,for five or more electronic mail accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names,and intentionally initiates the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names shall be punished 
id.a.initiates is defined by statute as to originate or transmit such message or to procure the origination or transmission of such message.the statute further provides that

d.defendants argue that the terms impair and altered or concealed as used in the statute definition of materially falsified are unconstitutionally vague.they also assert an vagueness challenge claiming these terms gave them insufficient notice that the conduct they committed was illegal under.they do not raise a vagueness challenge as to any other terms in the statute.
vagueness doctrine is an outgrowth not of the first amendment,but of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.united states williams,d.vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons to avoid punishing people for behavior that they could not have known was illegal to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by government officers and to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of first amendment freedoms.humanitarian law project mukasey,cir quoting foti city of menlo park,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied if it failed to put a defendant on notice that his conduct was criminal.united states purdy,cir.a statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face if it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.williams.at.for statutes like involving criminal sanctions the requirement for clarity is enhanced.info.providers coal.for the def.of the first amendment fcc,cir.however,even applying this heightened requirement,due process does not require impossible standards of clarity.id.quoting kolender lawson,d internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude defendants vagueness challenge fails even applying a heightened requirement of clarity.they had clear notice their conduct was a violation of a and a.defendants assert that they lacked notice that their actions would constitute material falsification under the statute.the terms defendants regard as vague in the definition of material falsification are impair,altered,and concealed.when congress does not define a term in a statute,we construe that term according to its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states grace,cir quoting united states cabaccang,cir en banc alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.impair is defined as to make worse diminish in quantity,value,excellence,or strength do harm to.webster third new international dictionary unabridged philip babcock gove et.alter is defined as to cause to become different in some particular characteristic without changing into something else.id.at.conceal is defined as to prevent disclosure or recognition of avoid revelation of refrain from revealing withhold knowledge of drawn attention from treat so as to be unnoticed.id.at.in the headers of their bulk emails,defendants intentionally replaced the email addresses from which the emails were sent with fictitious addresses.it is quite obvious that this constituted intentionally causing to be different or preventing the disclosure of the actual header information in a manner diminishing the ability of recipients to identify,locate,or respond to defendants or their agents in violation of a.defendants also intentionally replaced the actual phone and contact person for ganymede with fictitious information.again,it should have been clear to the defendants that this constituted intentionally causing to be different or preventing the disclosure of the actual domain name registration information in a manner diminishing the ability of a recipient to contact defendants or their agents as the actual registrants of the domain name directly or through ganymede.
defendants sole concrete argument in support of their challenge is that,with regard to their conviction under a,there was no attempt made by the government to determine whether the email listed in their domain registration was inaccurate.defendants assert that they had no notice under the terms of the statute that the intentional placing of a false contact person and phone number in their registration would constitute intentional impairment when the email listed may have been accurate.this argument is unpersuasive.as an initial matter,evidence was presented at trial that the email listed in the domain name registrations at issue was invalid.even were this not the case,impair clearly is not synonymous with completely obstruct.to impair,according to its plain meaning,merely means to decrease.it should have been clear to defendants that intentionally falsifying the identity of the contact person and phone number for the actual registrant constitutes intentionally decreasing the ability of a recipient to locate and contact the actual registrant,regardless of whether a recipient may still be left some avenue to do so.we therefore conclude defendants had notice that their conduct violated.
facial challenge 
defendants facial vagueness challenge is similarly unavailing.we have held that ordinarily a plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed can not complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others.williams.at quoting hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,nn,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.however,we have relaxed that requirement in the first amendment context,permitting plaintiffs to argue that a statute is overbroad because it is unclear whether it regulates a substantial amount of protected speech.id.we need not determine whether regulates protected speech,thereby permitting defendants facial vagueness challenge,as in any case defendants challenge would be unsuccessful.
in parallel to their challenge,defendants facial challenge rests on the claim that the term impair is so vague as to leave it to the complete discretion of police officers how the statute is enforced.we disagree.impair is a broad term that potentially subjects a wide swath of conduct to regulation under.nonetheless,as already discussed,it has a clear meaning that is not open to wholly subjective interpretation in the manner of other terms found to be unconstitutionally vague.kolender lawson,d concluding that a penal statute requiring that a criminal suspect provide credible and reliable identification to police was unconstitutionally vague smith goguen,d concluding that a statute criminalizing the act of treat ing contemptuously a united states flag was unconstitutionally vague.furthermore,impair is closely analogous in meaning to terms previously upheld by the supreme court in the face of a vagueness challenge.in cameron johnson,d,the court reviewed for vagueness a statute forbidding picketing in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any county courthouses.id.at.internal quotations marks and alterations omitted.the court found t he terms obstruct and unreasonably interfere were not unconstitutionally vague because they plainly require no guessing at their meaning and are words of common understanding.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.we see no basis to reach a different conclusion with regard to the similar term impair.
defendants also argue that the definition of material falsification renders unconstitutionally vague specifically as to whether it would criminalize private registration of a domain name.as testified to at trial,private registration is a service that allows registration of a domain name in a manner that conceals the actual registrant identity from the public absent a subpoena.we fail to perceive any vagueness on this point.based on the plain meaning of the relevant terms discussed above,private registration for the purpose of concealing the actual registrant identity would constitute material falsification.defendants assert that many innocent people who privately register without the requisite intent may be subject to investigation for violation of until their intent can be determined,allowing for abuse by enforcement authorities.this may be so,but it does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague.as we recently noted,w hat renders a statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved but rather the indeterminacy of precisely what that fact is.schales,at quoting williams.at.while determining as a factual matter whether the requisite intent for culpability under exists may prove difficult,this does not demonstrate that the concept of intent as used in the statute is an entirely indeterminate,subjective one.hence,the problem defendants identify is irrelevant to the vagueness inquiry.
clerical error 
defendants additionally claim there is a clerical error in the written judgment incorrectly labeling defendants counts through convictions as class d and e felonies.the written judgment as to counts and references b as the relevant penalty provision.section b provides as a penalty a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than year,or both.b.the written judgment reference to b reflects the district court prior determination that the jury was not instructed to make the requisite additional factual findings necessary for applying the more severe b or b penalty provisions.a crime punishable by a year or less in prison is classified as a misdemeanor.see id.b.hence,defendants counts and convictions are properly classified as misdemeanors.furthermore,because a conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor itself,see id,defendants count conviction is also properly classified as a misdemeanor.the government does not the district court determination that the appropriate penalty provision for defendants convictions was b.therefore,we conclude the written judgment classification of counts through as class d and e felonies is a clerical error requiring remand for correction.see.territory of guam gill,cir remanding case for correction of clerical error pursuant to rule.
challenge to money laundering conspiracy convictions 
defendants appeal their count convictions under h for conspiracy to commit money laundering,asserting instructional error.as defendants did not raise their objections to the jury instructions in the district court,we review for plain error.peterson,at.though count of the indictment charged the defendants with conspiring to commit four different money laundering offenses,the jury was instructed that defendants allegedly conspired to commit only one violation of a b i.a person violates this provision if he
