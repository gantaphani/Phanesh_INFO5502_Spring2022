in this case,we consider whether a remote search of computer files on a hard drive by a network administrator was justified under the special needs exception to the fourth amendment because the administrator reasonably believed the computer had been used to gain unauthorized access to confidential records on a university computer.we conclude that the remote search was justified.
although we assume that the subsequent search of the suspect dorm room was not justified under the fourth amendment,we conclude that the district court denial of the suppression motion was proper under the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule.
in december,scott kennedy,a computer system administrator for qualcomm corporation in san diego,california,discovered that somebody had obtained unauthorized access to or hacked into,in popular parlance the company computer network.kennedy contacted special agent terry rankhorn of the federal bureau of investigation about the intrusion.
kennedy was able to trace the intrusion to a computer on the university of wisconsin at madison network,and he contacted the university computer help desk,seeking assistance.jeffrey savoy,the university of wisconsin computer network investigator,promptly responded to kennedy request and began examining the university system.savoy found evidence that someone using a computer on the university network was in fact hacking into the qualcomm system and that the user had gained unauthorized access to the university system as well.savoy was particularly concerned that the user had gained access to the server on the university system,which housed accounts for individuals on campus and processed approximately emails each day.at that time,students on campus were preparing for final exams,and savoy testified that the disruption on campus would be tremendous if was destroyed.through his investigation of the server,savoy traced the source of intrusion to a computer located in university housing.the type of access the user had obtained was restricted to specific system administrators,none of whom would be working from the university dormitories.
savoy determined that the computer that had gained unauthorized access had a university internet protocol ip address that ended in.in addition,savoy determined that heckencamp,who was a computer science graduate student at the university,had checked his email from that ip address minutes before and minutes after the unauthorized connections between the computer at the ip address ending in,the server,and the qualcomm server.savoy determined that the computer at that ip address had been used regularly to check heckencamp email account,but no others.savoy became extremely concerned because he knew that heckenkamp had been terminated from his job at the university computer help desk two years earlier for similar unauthorized activity,and savoy knew that heckenkamp had technical expertise to damage the university system.
although savoy was confident that the computer that had gained the unauthorized access belonged to heckenkamp,he checked the housing records to ensure that the ip address was assigned to heckenkamp dorm room.the housing department initially stated that the ip address corresponded to a different room down the hall from heckenkamp assigned room.the housing department acknowledged that the records could be inaccurate but stated that they would not be able to verify the location of the ip address until the next morning.in order to protect the university server,savoy electronically blocked the connection between ip address and the server.
after blocking the connection,savoy contacted rankhorn.after savoy informed rankhorn of the information he had found,rankhorn told savoy that he intended to get a warrant for the computer,but he did not ask savoy to take any action or to commence any investigation.
later that night,savoy decided to check the status of the computer from home because he was still concerned about the integrity of the university system.he logged into the network and determined that the computer was not attached to the network.however,savoy was still concerned that the same computer could have changed its identity,so he checked the networking hardware to determine if the computer that was originally logged on at the address was now logged on at a different ip address.his search confirmed that the computer was now logged on at an ip address ending in.
based on this discovery,savoy became even more concerned that the server security could be compromised at any time,particularly because the intruder at this point knows that he being investigated and might therefore interfere with the system to cover his tracks.savoy concluded that he needed to act that night.
before taking action,savoy wanted to verify that the computer logged on at was the same computer that had been logged on at earlier in the day.he logged into the computer,using a name and password he had discovered in his earlier investigation into the computer.savoy used a series of commands to confirm that the computer was the same computer that had been logged on at and to determine whether the computer still posed a risk to the university server.after approximately minutes of looking only in the temporary directory,without deleting,modifying,or destroying any files,savoy logged off of the computer.
savoy then determined that the machine need ed to get off line immediately or as soon as possible based on a university security need.he contacted both rankhorn and a detective scheller,who worked for the university police.savoy informed them of his discoveries and concerns.asked savoy to wait to take action because he was attempting to get a search warrant.however,savoy felt that he needed to protect the university system by taking the machine off line immediately.therefore,he made the decision to coordinate with the university police to take the computer off line and to let the university police coordinate with the fbi.
together with scheller and other university police officers,savoy went to the room assigned to heckenkamp when they arrived at the room,the door was ajar,and nobody was in the room.savoy and scheller entered the room and disconnected the network cord attaching the computer to the network.savoy noted that the computer had a screen saver with a password,which prevented him from accessing the computer.in order to be sure that the computer he had disconnected from the network was the computer that had gained unauthorized access to the server,savoy wanted to run some commands on the computer.detective scheller located heckenkamp,explained the situation and asked for heckenkamp password,which heckenkamp voluntarily provided.
savoy used the password to run the commands on the computer and verified that it was the computer used to gain the unauthorized access.after savoy confirmed that he had the right computer,scheller advised heckenkamp that he was not under arrest,but scheller requested that heckenkamp waive his miranda rights and give a statement.heckenkamp waived his rights in writing and answered the investigator and detectives questions.in addition,heckenkamp authorized savoy to make a copy of his hard drive for later analysis,which savoy did.at no time did savoy or scheller search heckenkamp room.throughout his testimony,savoy emphasized that his actions were taken to protect the university server rather than for law enforcement purposes.
the federal agents obtained a search warrant from the western district of wisconsin,which was executed the following day.pursuant to the warrant,the agents seized the computer and searched heckenkamp room.
heckenkamp was indicted in both the northern and southern districts of california on multiple offenses,including counts of recklessly causing damage by intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization,in violation of a b.in separate orders,judge ware in the northern district and judge jones in the southern district denied heckenkamp motions to suppress the evidence gathered from the remote search of his computer,the image taken of his computer hard drive,and the search conducted pursuant to the fbi search
