in these appeals,we are asked to evaluate the validity of the exercise of jurisdiction by the district court in the western district of north carolina over an arizona defendant,based on that defendant contributions to a website created and maintained by a north carolina.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that jurisdiction was proper and we affirm the district court.
founded by mary baker eddy in,the first church of christ,scientist tfccs,is a religious organization with branches located throughout the world.tfccs is governed by its board of directors the board,whose broad functions include ultimate supervision and control over the church prolific publishing enterprise,the christian science publishing society.in furtherance of its religious mission,tfccs provides a variety of products and publications,many of which bear federally registered and common law trademarks owned by the board.
defendants david nolan and david robinson are active christian scientists whose beliefs diverge in significant respects from those espoused and advanced by tfccs in february,nolan,a resident of arizona,founded the university of christian science ucs as an electronic campus on the world wide web which would allow present and potential christian scientists to study the teachings of mary baker eddy and to exchange ideas about christian science.at that time,nolan began developing the content of his intended online university.lacking the technical expertise necessary to create and maintain a website,however,nolan obtained the assistance of david robinson of bakersville,north carolina,in the spring of.robinson secured a domain name for ucs and posted the files provided to him by nolan on the newly created site following the website creation,nolan maintained close contact with robinson and periodically sent revisions to the site content,which robinson posted to the ucs site.thus,while nolan apparently was solely responsible for drafting and making judgments regarding the content of the ucs website,it was robinson who physically created and maintained the site from his north carolina residence.
on july,the board filed a trademark infringement suit in the western district of north carolina against robinson and nolan and the two entities with which they were associated,the roan mountain institute of christian science trmi and ucs,respectively.more specifically,the board alleged,inter alia,that nolan and ucs collectively,the nolan defendants,without the board permission,used certain marks belonging to the board,or marks confusingly similar thereto,in printed materials and on the ucs website.the board also alleged that the nolan defendants have held themselves out as being affiliated with or sponsored by the official academic auxiliary of the board of education of the church of christ,scientist.in the board view,the nolan defendants included the terms church of christ,scientist and board of education of the church of christ,scientist in the content of the website and printed materials,knowing and intending that the use of such terms would likely cause confusion,and would mislead the public into believing that their products and services emanate from,are approved,authorized or sponsored by,or are in some way associated with the board tfccs.
although the board complaint and summons were promptly served on robinson and trmi,service of process on nolan proved more difficult.after an unsuccessful attempt to effect service by certified mail,pursuant to rule j c of the north carolina rules of civil procedure,the board retained the services of a private investigator to locate nolan.the investigator determined that nolan was residing in modesto,california,and a process server was employed to serve nolan at that location.the process server,however,was also unable to serve nolan,and the board,attesting that nolan was actively evading service of process,sought leave to serve nolan by publication,pursuant to rule of the north carolina rules of civil procedure.the magistrate judge for the western district of north carolina granted such leave to the board by order dated october,and notice was published in the november,november,and november,editions of the modesto bee a newspaper of general circulation in modesto,california.
as the nolan defendants failed to answer or otherwise respond to the board complaint,the board moved the district court for entry of default judgment against them by its judgment default judgment and accompanying memorandum and order entered on july,the district court determined that the nolan defendants had infringed certain of the board registered trademarks,in violation of the lanham act,and it permanently enjoined the nolan defendants from using those contested marks.the board thereafter moved to have the nolan defendants held in contempt by the district court,maintaining that the nolan defendants had failed to comply with the injunction order.on september,the district court entered an order finding that,although the nolan defendants had received notice of the default judgment,they had violated and continued to violate its terms and provisions.accordingly,the nolan defendants were ordered to appear on september,and to show cause,if they could,why they should not be adjudged in civil contempt of court.
nolan at last mobilized to oppose the board motion for an order of contempt,asserting that the default judgment was void for lack of personal jurisdiction or,alternatively,for invalid service of process.the district court rejected both of these assertions by order entered on september,two days later,the court addressed the balance of nolan arguments for rule relief,concluding that no exceptional circumstances were present to justify setting aside the default judgment nolan immediately noticed an appeal to this court from the september,order,and concurrently moved in the district court to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal.
accordingly,at its september,contempt hearing,the district court considered the nolan defendants motion for a stay,along with the board motion to find them in contempt of the default judgment.on october,the district court ruled in favor of the board as to both motions.see christian science bd.of dirs.of the first church of christ,scientist robinson,d.the district court held,more particularly,that its exercise of personal jurisdiction over the nolan defendants offended neither the north carolina statute nor constitutional due process concerns.see id.at.moreover,the district court ruled that the nolan defendants were unlikely to prevail on the merits of their lanham act challenge,their objections that the offending website did not satisfy the act requirement that the protected mark be used in connection with the sale distribution or advertising of any goods or services,and that,in any case,the website involved protected speech exempt from the lanham act proscriptions.see id.at.having affirmed the validity of the underlying default judgment,the district court then found the nolan defendants in continuing defiance thereof and held them both in civil contempt.see id.at.the nolan defendants timely appealed the district court contempt order of october.we possess jurisdiction over these both the september,and october,to.
the fundamental question on the nolan defendants contacts with north carolina were sufficient to support the district court exercise of personal a question of law which we review de novo.see koehler dodwell,cir citation omitted.it is axiomatic that,in order for a district court to validly assert personal jurisdiction over a defendant,two conditions must be satisfied.first,the exercise of jurisdiction must be authorized by the statute of the forum state,and,second,the exercise of personal jurisdiction must also comport with fourteenth amendment due process requirements.see,stover assocs,cir.
the north carolina statute provides,inter alia,for jurisdiction over any defendant who is engaged in substantial activity within north carolina,see.d,or whose act or omission gave rise to an action claiming injury to person or property in north carolina,see.like those of many other states,north carolina statute is construed to extend jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to the full extent permitted by the due process clause.see century data systems,mcdonald.thus,the dual jurisdictional requirements collapse into a single inquiry as to whether the defendant has such minimal contacts with the forum state that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.see int l shoe washington.citations omitted.
here,as the district court duly observed,the nolan defendants clearly were not engaged in such substantial or continuous and systematic activities in north carolina to subject themselves to the district court general jurisdiction.see christian science,d at quoting helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d our analysis must focus,then,on whether the board trademark infringement suit sufficiently arises from,or relates to,the nolan defendants contacts with north carolina to support an exercise of specific jurisdiction.see id.like the district court before us,we must examine three factors to determine whether specific jurisdiction was appropriate first,to what extent did the nolan defendants purposefully avail themselves of the privileges of conducting activities in north carolina and thus invoke the benefits and protections of its laws second,did the board claims arise out of those north activities and,finally,was the exercise of jurisdiction constitutionally reasonable.see burger king rudzewicz,d.
applying these factors,the district court concluded that the nolan defendants had indeed taken direct actions to create a connection with north carolina by enlisting robinson to download their web page design onto his domain,located and maintained in north carolina,and then consistently sending information,including solicitations for contributions and sales of merchandise,to robinson for use on the ucs website.see id.as to the second requirement,there is no dispute that the material drafted and transmitted by nolan formed the basis for the alleged infringement.arriving at the third,reasonableness inquiry,the district court restated its finding that the nolan defendants,through robinson,had targeted their activities toward north carolina.the district court characterized the website as an interactive one engaged in the transaction of business within north carolina,and thus concluded that it was proper to subject the nolan defendants to the forum jurisdiction.
we agree with the district court that the conditions set forth by the supreme court in burger king regarding the permissible exercise of specific personal jurisdiction are fully satisfied in this case.in challenging the district court decision,the nolan defendants strain to argue that the purposeful availment condition was absent here,because nolan neither actively solicited robinson services nor compensated them.instead,the nolan defendants insist,robinson volunteered to develop and maintain the offending offer which nolan passively accepted.see appellants,at.we are unconvinced by the distinction advanced by the nolan defendants.a prospective defendant need not initiate the relevant minimum contacts to be regarded as purposefully availing himself of the privileges of conducting activity in the forum state.but see burger king,at.nonresident defendant may not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts,or the unilateral activity of another party or a third person citations omitted.here,it is evident that robinson invitation was extended within the context of his friendship and ongoing correspondence with nolan,and that robinson hoped to assist a fellow christian science practitioner disseminate information and,at least prospectively,sell religious products and services although nolan was solely responsible for,periodically,content of the ucs website,he depended on robinson to establish and maintain the actual site nolan connection to north carolina was by no means fortuitous or unwitting.rather,nolan deliberately entered a collaborative enterprise with robinson,well aware that any potentially tortious content he created would be physically uploaded by a north carolina resident working on a computer in north carolina.see id.jurisdiction is proper where the defendant deliberately has engaged in significant activities within a state,or has created continuing obligations between himself and residents of the forum citations omitted 
having contented ourselves that the nolan defendants purposefully availed themselves of the privileges of conducting activity in north carolina,and that the board claims arise from that activity,we arrive at the third burger king factor.although constitutional reasonableness is a somewhat nebulous concept,we are confident that the district court assertion of jurisdiction over the nolan defendants comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.see int l shoe,at.in determining whether jurisdiction is constitutionally reasonable,we may evaluate the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the interstate judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.see burger king,at.internal quotation marks omitted.more generally,our reasonableness analysis is designed to ensure that jurisdictional rules are not exploited in such a way as to make litigation so gravely difficult and inconvenient that a party unfairly is at a severe disadvantage in comparison to his opponent.id.at.
although defending a lawsuit in north carolina was,without doubt,inconvenient for nolan,the inconvenience was not so grave as to offend constitutional due process principles.the board decision to bring suit in north carolina,rather than in its home state of massachusetts,imposed no additional burden on nolan,while reducing the burden on his robinson.thus,north carolina was a relatively sensible choice in terms of promoting judicial efficiency.moreover,we must reject the suggestion that north carolina had no interest in the suit.surely,north carolina interest in deterring trademark infringement is implicated by the postings of allegedly infringing materials by a north carolina resident to a website accessible through a north domain in short,the district court exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the nolan defendants is consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.
in their effort to resist the district court jurisdiction,the nolan defendants direct our attention to an emerging series of court decisions addressing the extent to which a nonresident defendant website may constitute the sole basis for a court exercise of jurisdiction.invoking the sliding scale of interactivity set forth in zippo manufacturing zippo dot com,under which the validity of jurisdiction depends on the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information of the defendant nolan defendants maintain that the ucs website was essentially passive and therefore should not expose them to the district court jurisdiction.see appellant,at.this court has not addressed the propriety of exercising jurisdiction over a defendant whose only contact with the forum state consists of a website accessible by residents of the forum.while this is an important one which has garnered considerable need not resolve it in this case,because the nolan defendants had specific contacts with north carolina providing an independent and valid basis for personal jurisdiction 
although the nolan defendants appeals focus primarily on their personal jurisdiction challenge,several other issues have been presented for our review.
first,the nolan defendants assign error to the district court refusal to set aside the default judgment on the grounds that nolan was never properly served.unable to serve nolan personally,the board sought and received leave of court to serve by publication.nolan concedes that he received actual notice of the litigation prior to the entry of the default judgment,
