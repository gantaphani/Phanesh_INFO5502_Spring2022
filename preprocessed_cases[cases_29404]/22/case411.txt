this case involves telephone calls placed from southwestern bell telephone company swbt telephone customers to the individual customer internet service provider isp,where the isp is a telephone customer of a different telephone company,connect communications corporation connect.all the involved telephone customers are located within the same local exchange area.after the arkansas public service commission apsc approved an interconnection agreement between connect and swbt,the parties disputed whether these ispbound calls were local calls,which would subject them to reciprocal compensation under the interconnection agreement,or whether the calls were.after years of litigation and several decisions at various administrative and judicial levels,the apsc determined that the calls were not local calls under the interconnection agreement.the district court found that determination not to be arbitrary or capricious and upheld the apsc decision.connect appeals,and we affirm.
background 
this litigation began in,shortly after swbt and connect had entered into an interconnection agreement on june.swbt,as an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec,had a duty to negotiate and enter into an interconnection agreement with connect,a competitive local exchange carrier clec,under the telecommunications act of the act.see c.rather than negotiate an interconnection agreement of its own with swbt,connect chose to adopt the interconnection agreement previously negotiated by swbt with brooks fiber communications of arkansas,brooks fiber in august,a procedure allowed under the act.see i.the apsc approved the interconnection agreement on october,and neither party sought review of the interconnection agreement in federal district court pursuant to e.
the interconnection agreement divides the telecommunications traffic between the two telephone companies into four categories local traffic,traffic,intralata interexchange traffic,and interlata interexchange traffic.appellant add.at.the interconnection agreement classifies c alls originated by one party end users and terminated to the other party end users as local traffic if the call originates and terminates in the same swbt exchange area id.and provides for reciprocal compensation for the termination of local traffic id.at.although the interconnection agreement does not define terminate,it does define terminating traffic as a switched telecommunications service which is delivered to an s as a result of another end user attempt to establish communications between the parties.id.at.
at the time that swbt and connect were entering into the interconnection agreement,the fcc had not determined whether traffic transmitted to isps was subject to reciprocal compensation as local traffic under the act or not.in an fcc order issued on may,the fcc noted that since an earlier ruling in,isps had not been required to pay interstate access charges and were allowed to purchase services from ilecs under the same intrastate tariffs available to end users.see in the matter of access charge reform price cap performance review for local exchange carriers transport rate structure and pricing end user common line charges,wl may,hereinafter fcc order.the fcc concluded in the fcc order that the existing pricing structure for isps should remain in place.id.at.thus,for tariff purposes,calls placed to isps were treated as local calls.at that time,there was debate in the industry about whether isps acted more like end users,such that a call to an isp is terminated at the isp server,or more like interexchange carriers,providing a connection to the internet.see id.at discussing aol and pactel opposing arguments.
in,the fcc determined that traffic was largely interstate,but that this conclusion does not in itself determine whether reciprocal compensation is due in any particular instance.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,wl,isp declaratory ruling.the fcc recognized that prior to this time,it had consistently treated enhanced service provider esp traffic as local for purposes of interstate access charges despite its interstate character,and that parties may have agreed,or state commissions may have mandated,that reciprocal compensation applied to traffic.thus,the fcc conclude d that parties should be bound by their existing interconnection agreements,as interpreted by state commissions.id.the fcc noted that in interpreting prior interconnection agreements,state commissions should consider all of the relevant facts,including the parties negotiations in light of the fcc longstanding policy of treating this traffic as local,and the conduct of the parties pursuant to those agreements.id.at.
the circuit vacated portions of the fcc isp declaratory ruling,concluding that the fcc did not adequately explain its reliance on an end to end jurisdictional analysis to support its conclusion that traffic was not local and thus not subject to reciprocal compensation.see bell atlantic.fcc.on remand from the circuit,the fcc again concluded that calls were not subject to reciprocal compensation,though under a different rationale.this time,the fcc concluded that congress excluded traffic listed in g from telecommunications traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.one of the items included in g is information access,which the fcc determined included traffic.see in the matter of implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,remand order.again,the fcc reiterated that its order applied prospectively only to renegotiated or expiring interconnection agreements i t does not alter existing contractual obligations.id.at.
once again,on appeal the circuit remanded the case back to the fcc.see worldcom,fcc.the court found the fcc reliance on g misplaced,as that section was merely a transitional device to preserve the status quo until the fcc could adopt rules to implement the act.id.the court did not vacate the fcc order,however,noting that there could be other legal bases to support the fcc rule it simply remand ed the case to the fcc for further proceedings.id.at.
turning back to the case at hand,swbt informed connect in march that it would not compensate connect for suspected traffic as a local call under the interconnection agreement reciprocal compensation arrangement.on june,connect filed a complaint with the apsc seeking a declaration that the ispbound traffic was subject to the reciprocal compensation provisions for local traffic under the interconnection agreement.the apsc issued its order on december,and,relying heavily on fcc decisions and the district court analysis in sw.bell.pub.util.comm of,no.mo.june,aff,cir,determined that a call from a swbt customer to an isp served by connect within the same local calling area is a local call subject to reciprocal compensation.at,apsc order.the apsc also noted that state commissions had found similar traffic to be local.id.at.swbt challenged that decision by filing suit in federal district court,naming connect and the apsc as defendants and seeking injunctive relief to prohibit enforcement of the apsc order.the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review a state commission order interpreting and enforcing an interconnection agreement because the telecommunications act grants federal district courts jurisdiction only to determine whether interconnection agreements meet the requirements of federal law.sw.bell.connect commc ns,d,swbt i.on appeal,a panel of this court reversed the district court,holding that the claim raised substantial federal law questions.sw.bell.connect commc ns,cir swbt ii.the panel did not reach the merits of the federal law claim,but remanded to the district court to address these issues.id.at.
on remand,the district court discussed the fcc orders that had been issued since the case at bar was originally before the district court,namely the fcc isp declaratory order and the fcc remand order.these were contrary to the fcc earlier position,which treated isp traffic as local for tariff purposes,and which was the most current fcc pronouncement at the time that the apsc first issued its determination that the isp traffic at issue here was subject to reciprocal compensation.the district court noted that the fcc has now taken the position that isp traffic is information access within the meaning of g,and that congress intended to exclude traffic listed in g from the reciprocal compensation requirements of b the district court noted,however,that the fcc remand order allowed the payment of reciprocal compensation for ispbound traffic to the extent provided for in an existing interconnection agreement.finding that the apsc based its prior ruling on federal regulations and fcc rulings,which turned out to be incorrect according to the latest fcc rulings,but that the apsc failed to interpret the interconnection agreement pursuant to state contract law,the district court remanded the case to the apsc for reconsideration in light of the fcc remand order and the statements made herein.at.
on remand from the district court,the apsc issued order,in which it considered the existing record and determined that the interconnection agreement was ambiguous as to whether the parties intended for calls to be subject to reciprocal compensation.applying arkansas contract law and looking for the intent of the parties,the apsc determined that swbt clearly did not intend to subject ispbound traffic to reciprocal compensation when it entered into the interconnection agreement that the record lacked any evidence of connect intent one way or the other regarding this specific traffic when it entered into the interconnection agreement and that traffic was generally accepted in the industry as being jurisdictionally interstate.the apsc then considered the fcc remand order,as it was directed to do by the district court,which,according to the apsc,clearly designates traffic as interstate.appellant add.at.based on all of these considerations,the apsc determined that the interconnection agreement did not require payment of reciprocal compensation for traffic 
this time,connect challenged the agency decision by bringing a complaint in federal district court,seeking a declaratory ruling that the apsc order misapplied federal law,violated the district court mandate,violated arkansas law,and was arbitrary and capricious.ruling from the bench,the district court found a latent ambiguity in the interconnection agreement and determined that the apsc did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding an ambiguity in the agreement.the district court then determined,based on the original record before the apsc,that the apsc determination that the parties did not intend to subject traffic to reciprocal compensation was likewise not arbitrary or capricious.the court entered judgment in favor of swbt on september.
connect appeals,arguing that the interconnection agreement is not ambiguous,and even if it is,the ambiguity should be resolved in its favor.
ii.standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over connect complaint seeking declaratory relief against the apsc decision as a misapplication of federal law pursuant to.see verizon.pub.serv.comm of,d.it also had supplemental jurisdiction to review the agency state law determinations.a qwest.pub.utils.comm n,cir qwest mpuc exercising supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that the mpuc acted beyond its statutory authority sw.bell.brooks fiber commc ns of,cir exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims in action seeking review of oklahoma corporation commission interpretation of interconnection agreement hereinafter brooks fiber.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard used by the district court.bockelman mci worldcom,cir.
we review the apsc decision for compliance with federal law de novo.see qwest mpuc,at.although federal law plays a large role in this dispute,the ultimate issue in this of the interconnection a state law issue.see sw.bell.pub.util.comm of,cir t he agreements themselves and state law principles govern the questions of interpretation of the contracts and enforcement of their provisions.although the parties agree that we review the apsc factual findings related to any state law issues under an arbitrary and capricious standard,see,they dispute the level of deference owed to the apsc application of state law.the apsc determined that the interconnection agreement was ambiguous,which generally is a legal conclusion under arkansas law.see hisaw state farm mut.auto.ins,connect urges a de novo review of that determination,while swbt argues for an arbitrary and capricious review.
in our prior panel opinion in this case,we noted that w ith regard to purely state law issues,the state commissions may have the final say.swbt ii,at citing.telecomms.regulatory,cir holding that e does not confer jurisdiction on federal courts to review state agency action for compliance with state law.since that time,several circuits have addressed the issue and have determined that federal courts can review state commission determinations of state law,giving deference to the state agency expertise in making state law determinations.see global naps,verizon new,cir w e review the board decisions as congruent with state law under the standard.sw.bell,at reviewing the state agency state law determinations under the more deferential standard.bell.mfs intelenet of,cir noting the inherent logic of allowing state agencies wider deference in state law determinations us west commc ns mfs intelenet,cir we consider all other issues under an arbitrary and capricious standard,cert.denied,d brooks fiber,at reviewing all state law determinations made by a state agency under arbitrary and capricious standard.
in this circuit,we recently held that in recognition of the state commission superior technical expertise,we review its factual determinations under the arbitrary and capricious standard.qwest koppendrayer,cir.we were not called upon,and therefore did not decide,what level of deference was owed to the state commission determinations of state law.connect relies on our statement in qwest mpuc that whether an agency acts within its statutory authority is a question of law we review de novo,at,to urge us to apply de novo review to apsc application of arkansas law.
we believe that the de novo standard applied in qwest mpuc does not compel a similar review of the apsc review of the state law issues in this case.in qwest mpuc,we were reviewing the agency actions for consistency with its authority to act under state law.it would not have made sense to give deference to the agency legal conclusions when the legal conclusions being challenged involved the agency own authority under state law even to act.
nevertheless,we need not wade through this standard of review quagmire,for regardless of the standard applied,we believe that the interconnection agreement contains a latent ambiguity as discussed more fully below,and we proceed to determine whether the apsc acted arbitrarily or capriciously in settling the ambiguity.see starpower commc ns,llc fcc,declining to settle a dispute over the proper standard of review because the contracts are so far from clearly unambiguous that we would resolve this issue in the same manner regardless whether we owe the commission any deference.
iii.is the interconnection agreement ambiguous 
a latent ambiguity arises when the contract on its face appears clear and unambiguous,but collateral facts exist that make the contract meaning uncertain.norman norman,see also coble sexton,a latent ambiguity arises from undisclosed facts or uncertainties of the written instrument.richard lord,williston on contracts,ed.a latent ambiguity is one which appear s only as the result of extrinsic or collateral evidence showing that a word,thought to have but one meaning,actually has two or more meanings.for example,a contract may include a clear description of the property to which it pertains,but extrinsic evidence reveals that the description applies to more than one estate.see norman,at see also abbott abbott,finding a latent ambiguity in a divorce decree that referred to retirement when husband employer had three types of retirement plans,and it was unclear to which plan the decree referred barry barry,cir finding a latent ambiguity in the meaning of the term sale in the context of selling shares of stock back to a corporation where the parties disputed whether a sale required an actual transfer of control,and both parties interpretations were plausible.
in this case,the interconnection agreement is clear on its face that local traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation.an ambiguity arises,however,when the parties try to define local traffic to either include or exclude traffic.similar to the interconnection agreements at issue in starpower,t he ambiguity in the agreement arises from the hybrid nature of a call to an isp and the failure of the parties expressly to state whether traffic should be treated as local or.starpower commc ns,at.the interconnection agreement does not address traffic at all.it defines local traffic as traffic originating and terminating within the same swbt exchange area.connect claims that traffic clearly falls within this definition of local traffic because the call terminates at the isp provider location within swbt exchange area.swbt counters that the calls do not terminate at the isp provider location at all,but continue on to the internet websites ultimately accessed by the calling party computer.this dispute is not resolved by the interconnection agreement,which does not define the term terminating.although the interconnection agreement does define terminating traffic as a switched communications service which is delivered to an s as a result of another end user attempt to establish communications between the parties appellant add.at,that definition likewise does not address the issues raised by calls.the parties legitimately dispute whether the end user initiating the call is attempting to establish communications with the,which is within the local exchange area,or with the world wide web,which clearly is not.
although the terms local traffic and terminating traffic are defined in the agreement,once extrinsic evidence of the nature of calls is considered,it becomes unclear whether traffic terminates within the local calling area as contemplated by the interconnection agreement.given the dispute within the industry at the time and both parties plausible interpretations of where traffic terminates in an call,we conclude that the interconnection agreement contains a latent ambiguity that must be resolved by extrinsic evidence.
iv.is the apsc decision arbitrary and capricious 
having determined that the interconnection agreement contains a latent ambiguity,we must determine then whether the apsc acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the parties intent was to treat the traffic as and thus not subject to reciprocal compensation.see qwest mpuc,at reviewing state agency fact determinations under arbitrary and capricious standard.this scope of review is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.in re core commc ns,quoting cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc,which applied the arbitrary and capricious standard to the fcc order denying a petition for forbearance.the state agency must,however,examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.id.quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
under arkansas law,the polestar of contractual construction is to determine and enforce the intent of the parties at the time the contract was made.taylor hinkle,internal citations omitted see also moss allstate ins.c ourts may consider and accord considerable weight to the construction of an ambiguous contract by the parties themselves,evidenced by subsequent statements,acts,and conduct.bishop city of fayetteville,see also taylor,considering subsequent conduct of parties in ascertaining parties intent in entering into a contract.the apsc also had an obligation to interpret the agreement within the bounds of existing federal law.brooks fiber,at.t he present telecommunications landscape makes clear that existing interconnection agreements requiring payment of reciprocal compensation for calls to isps do not conflict with and of the act or with the fcc regulations or rulings.bell,at quoting sw.bell,at.
the apsc determined that the parties did not intend to treat traffic as local traffic based on evidence of swbt intentions and actions around the time of the contract and the lack of any evidence about connect intent,since it merely adopted another parties agreement and offered no evidence of its intent at the time it adopted the interconnection agreement.the apsc also relied on the fact that ispbound traffic was generally accepted in the industry as being jurisdictionally interstate.appellant add.at.since,the fcc has recognized that traffic is under its jurisdiction as interstate traffic,but exempted the traffic from access charges generally applicable to interstate traffic.both sides use these fcc findings to support their positions swbt says the traffic is clearly interstate or the fcc would not have had jurisdiction to exempt it from access charges,while connect argues that because it is treated as local traffic for purposes of access charges,it should be treated as local traffic for purposes of reciprocal compensation.
it is clear from the record that during the time that connect and swbt negotiated and entered into the interconnection agreement at issue here,there was significant debate in the industry about whether or not traffic was to be treated as local traffic for purposes of reciprocal compensation.in june,swbt sent letters to clecs with which it had interconnection agreements,explaining its position that the access charge exemption issued by the fcc did not change the jurisdictional nature of traffic as interstate traffic,and that swbt did not believe that traffic was subject to reciprocal compensation under local interconnection agreements.see at copy of june,letter to time warner communications.during the same time frame,the association for local telecommunications sought an expedited letter clarification from the common carrier bureau to the effect that the fcc local competition order did not alter the fcc long standing rule that calls to an information service provider isp made from within a local calling area must be treated as local calls by any and all lecs involved in carrying those calls.id.at copy of june,request for expedited letter clarification.
considering the parties actions following implementation of the interconnection agreement,the evidence reveals that swbt never paid reciprocal compensation to connect for traffic under the interconnection agreement,even prior to the time swbt notified connect of its position regarding the traffic,until it was ordered to do so by the apsc in order.id.at,testimony of paul cooper.bruce sparling,who negotiated interconnection agreements for swbt,including the interconnection agreement with connect,testified that at the time that swbt entered into the interconnection agreement with connect,swbt did not intend reciprocal compensation to apply to the traffic now at issue.id.at,rebuttal testimony of bruce sparling.sparling also testified that swbt would not have agreed to pay reciprocal compensation for traffic at the time of negotiations even if connect had requested it because swbt considered internet traffic to be jurisdictionally interstate,and swbt was already losing the access charge revenue pursuant to the fcc exemption.id.at.connect offered no evidence about its intentions at the time it entered into the interconnection agreement.its evidence revolved around the issue of whether traffic in fact terminated at the isp server within the local area.
if this were all there was to the apsc resolution of the ambiguity in the agreement,we would easily uphold its decision as not arbitrary or capricious.given the evidence about the intent of the parties,their subsequent actions,and the ongoing debate within the industry at the time the interconnection agreement was adopted,we can not say that the apsc decision that the parties did not intend to apply reciprocal compensa
