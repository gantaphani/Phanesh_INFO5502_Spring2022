telesocial is a san francisco,formed in,to solve a unique telecommunications problem how to enable telephone calls between users of social media without the need for telephone numbers.to remedy the problem,telesocial created a custom software application app named call friends,which allows users of social networks such as facebook to place phone calls directly to other users.
orange,a french telecommunications provider,approached telesocial in february about a possible agreement to acquire the app.over the next several months,telesocial demonstrated its software and arranged for orange staff to test the product.to test the product,telesocial allowed orange personnel in the united states to download and use the demonstration app without restriction.because telesocial had to pay for its users international calls,it required overseas users to insert a password.on april,telesocial provided orange with the password callfriends and confirmed that orange had overseas access to test the app.
shortly after,on april,orange and telesocial executed a agreement nda.the nda specifies that the p arties desire to have certain business discussions with regards to a possible contractual relationship and that they wish to reciprocally protect and safeguard any information they may disclose to each other during their d iscussions,and intend to hold such disclosures in confidence.the nda protected all confidential information,which it defined as all information that either party disclosed during the discussions,from being disclosed to third parties,used for purposes beyond the discussions,or otherwise distributed.the nda excluded some confidential information from its scope,including information which is already known or is in the possession of the receiving party at the time it is disclosed 
the final page of the nda included a forum selection clause,which stated 
this agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with french law.any and all dispute,controversy,claim or question arising out of or relating to the agreement including the validity,binding effect,interpretation,performance or non performance thereof shall first be submitted to the respective authorized management of the parties for discussion in good faith and amicable resolution.in the event the parties can not resolve such dispute on an amicable basis within thirty days after the beginning of such discussion and after making their best efforts to do so,then the parties hereto irrevocably consent that the matter shall be submitted to the court of paris france.
for the next two months,telesocial continued to demonstrate its app to orange.while telesocial was responsive to orange information requests,telesocial asserts that it never disclosed how it implemented its technology,electing to keep that proprietary information confidential until orange and telesocial executed a partnership agreement.on july,orange told telesocial that it was going to offer telesocial a production contract to seal a development deal between the parties.
shortly after,on july,orange abruptly terminated negotiations,telling telesocial that its price of about one million dollars was a no go.instead of purchasing the app from telesocial,orange elected to create the technology itself.telesocial alleges that at this point,orange,unsuccessful in replicating the technology and under pressure to create its own social calling software,made a drastic decision instead of continuing its attempts to create the technology,orange would instead steal it from telesocial.beginning on august,orange repeatedly used fictitious names and a variety of telephone numbers to access telesocial application.by using the fictitious names,orange was able to make dozens of unauthorized telephone calls and execute certain functions to obtain information about how the telesocial platform operated.telesocial further alleges that orange hacked into its emeryville computer servers to access proprietary information about the software.
after months of probing,on november,orange announced that it had created a product called party call.telesocial immediately responded with a letter,warning orange not to proceed with the roll out of the stolen product.the media found out about the letter,and the magazine techcrunch published an article about telesocial allegations against orange.see ingrid lunden,startup claims that party call,france telecom facebook calling app,was its idea.
orange,apparently frustrated by the allegations in the article,responded by suing telesocial in the tribunal de commerce of paris tribunal on march,asserting that telesocial had disparaged orange and breached the nda.the tribunal dismissed all of orange claims,and the paris court of appeals affirmed the dismissal on april.
after orange sued telesocial,telesocial began to explore whether it should file a lawsuit of its own.on june,telesocial applied to the tribunal for ex parte document collection,a french procedure for obtaining discovery without filing suit.in its application for document production,telesocial identified two possible claims breach of the nda and brutal interruption of negotiations.the tribunal granted telesocial application,and the french authorities seized the requested documents from orange.on appeal,the paris court of appeals revoked the seizure order on the grounds that telesocial application failed to establish due cause for an ex parte seizure.telesocial elected not to pursue further its claim regarding the nda.
telesocial subsequently filed an action in the northern district of california,alleging violations of the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,california state law claims for breach of contract for violating telesocial terms of use,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,theft of trade secrets,and unfair competition.telesocial initial complaint stated that telesocial provided orange with the callfriends password solely for the purposes of evaluating the telesocial application as part of the negotiations.telesocial later amended its complaint,and removed the statements surrounding the callfriends password from the first amended complaint fac.
orange moved to dismiss telesocial first amended complaint for forum non conveniens.the district court denied the motion,and this petition followed.
