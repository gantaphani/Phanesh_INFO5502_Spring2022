background 
the technology involved in this appeal generally relates to internet billing methods.paypal offers online payment services.ebay is the parent of paypal,and offers online auction services.plaintiff netcraft sued ebay and paypal in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,alleging infringement of the and patents collectively the asserted patents.
the asserted patents are both entitled internet billing method.they also both claim priority to the same parent patent patent and share a common specification.both asserted patents are assigned to netcraft.andrew president of the named inventor on both patents.
representative claim of the patent reads 
an internet billing method for a plurality of customers and a plurality of vendors of products or services for transactions over the internet between a purchasing customer of the plurality of customers and a selling vendor of the plurality of vendors,wherein,for each purchase transaction,a transaction amount is charged to the purchasing customer,and an amount is remitted to the selling vendor,comprising the steps by a third party of

b providing a communications link through equipment of the third party between the purchasing customer and the selling vendor through which the purchasing customer obtains information from the selling vendor with respect to a purchase of a product or service by the purchasing customer from the selling vendor 
c obtaining at least one billing authorization for the purchase 
d charging the transaction amount to the purchasing customer in accordance with the billing agreement and 
e remitting an amount related to the purchase to the selling vendor in accordance with the remitting agreement.
patent emphasis added.
the phrase at issue in this appeal,providing a communications link through equipment of the third party,appears in all asserted claims of both asserted patents.neither the term communications link nor the phrase communications link through equipment of the third party is found in the parent patent or the common specification of the asserted patents.
in construing this phrase,the district court first addressed the asserted claims themselves,noting that the claim itself does not define communications link the way defendants propose.claim construction order,wl at.while the district court reasoned that the lay understanding of communications link is much broader than internet access,it recognized that courts can not look at the claims in isolation or at just the lay understanding of them,but must consider the patent as a whole.id.the district court noted that the specification makes it unmistakably clear that the invention requires that the third party provide internet access to the customer.id.at.it concluded that the phrase communications link is the only part of the claim that could incorporate this requirement,and construed the phrase providing a communications link as requiring providing customer access to the internet.id.in support of its construction,the district court cited many portions of the common specification including the abstract and the summary of the invention,and stated that i n countless instances,the specification refers to the third party as the provider,which plaintiff conceded at the claim construction hearing means internet access provider.id.at.
the district court was unconvinced by netcraft attempts to show that the specification references to the provider connecting customers to the internet were just particular embodiments,as opposed to describing the invention as a whole.id.at.it also rejected several claim differentiation arguments made by netcraft.id.at.finally,even though both parties advanced prosecution history arguments in support of their respective claim construction positions,the district court determined that it is unnecessary to consider those arguments when the patent itself is clear.id.at.because the parties agreed that defendants do not provide internet access to customers,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment of.id.at.
netcraft appealed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
this appeal involves a single question of claim construction.precisely,we must decide whether the district court erred in construing providing a communications link through equipment of the third party to require that the third party provide customers with internet access.claim construction order at.
we review a district court claim construction de novo,caraco pharm.as this court explained in phillips awh,i t is a bedrock principle of patent law that the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude,quotations omitted.claim terms are generally construed in accordance with the ordinary and customary meaning they would have to one of ordinary skill in the art.id.at.t he person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears,but in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.id.at.in addition to considering the specification,courts should consider the prosecution history of an asserted patent if it is in evidence.id.at.although we have emphasized the importance of intrinsic evidence in claim construction,we have also authorized district courts to rely on extrinsic evidence id.that being said,while extrinsic evidence can shed useful light on the relevant art,we have explained that it is less significant than the intrinsic record in determining the legally operative meaning of claim language.id.quotations omitted.mindful of these principles,we turn to the phrase at issue in the present case providing a communications link through equipment of the third party.
on appeal,netcraft maintains that the claim language itself does not support the district court construction.it also argues that the specification does not support,and is in fact inconsistent with,the district court claim construction and that the district court erred by refusing to consider the prosecution history.we address these arguments in turn.
with respect to the claim language,netcraft argues that the ordinary meaning of communications link is much broader than the district court construction,and that neither the claim language nor ordinary meaning supports including a requirement that the third party must provide internet access.defendants respond that the actual phrase construed by the district court was providing a communications link through equipment of the third party,not simply communications link,and that read in light of the specification this phrase must include a requirement that the third party provide internet access.
the asserted claims themselves do not expressly indicate whether providing a communications link through equipment of the third party requires that the third party provide internet access.indeed,the term communications link is never used in the parent patent or the common specification of the asserted patents.while the lay meaning of communications link standing alone may be broader than internet access,we are not construing this term standing alone.see phillips,at properly viewed,the ordinary meaning of a claim term is its meaning to the ordinary artisan after reading the entire patent.in order to properly determine the ordinary meaning of the entire phrase at issue in this case,we must consider the claim terms in light of the entire patent.as explained further below,based on a reading of the common specification in its entirety,along with the cited prosecution history,we conclude that the claim limitation providing a communications link through equipment of the third party requires providing customers with internet access.
construing the phrase in dispute to require providing customers with internet access is supported by the summary of the invention,which states 
the main object of the present invention is to create a new business opportunity for telephone companies,cable television companies,existing internet access providers,and companies offering financial services by creating a way for them to offer to their subscribers a method of securely buying and selling goods and services of any value over the internet.
another object of the present invention is an internet billing method which is cost effective for transactions having transaction amounts ranging from pennies to a few dollars.
still another object of the present invention is to provide a secure method of billing commercial transactions over the internet.
a further object of the present invention is an internet billing method which is simple to use from both the customer point of view and that of vendors on the internet.
yet another object of the present invention is a billing method which can be used by a large number of existing internet users without requiring major changes in how the users customarily behave and conduct commercial transactions.
these and other objects of the present invention are achieved by an internet billing method in accordance with the present invention.a provider establishes an agreement with a customer,and a second agreement with a vendor,wherein the provider agrees with the customer and the vendor to bill for products and services purchased over the internet by the customer from the vendor.associated with the customer agreement are one or more billing accounts to which purchases may be charged.associated with the vendor agreement are one or more methods of remitting funds to the vendor.the provider creates access to the internet for the customer through the provider equipment.when the customer orders a product or service over the internet from the vendor,the provider obtains transactional information transmitted between the customer and the vendor including a transaction amount relating to the ordered product or service and the provider then bills the transaction amount to a customer billing account and remits a portion of the transaction amount to the vendor.
patent emphases added.
netcraft argues that there is no general rule that any use of the present invention in the specification automatically limits the claims,as defendants seem to believe.appellant reply br.see also id.at defendants contend that the case law supports the draconian result that any use of the phrase present invention limits the claims to the embodiment described.we agree with netcraft that use of the phrase the present invention does not automatically limit the meaning of claim terms in all circumstances,and that such language must be read in the context of the entire specification and prosecution history.see rambus infineon techs.ag.for the reasons below,however,we agree with the district court that the common specification repeated use of the phrase the present invention describes the invention as a whole,see claim construction order at,and,as will be discussed further below,that the prosecution history does not warrant a contrary result.
the first two sentences of the abstract also support the district court construction.these sentences read an internet billing method comprises establishing an agreement between an internet access provider and a customer the provider creates access to the internet for the customer.patent,at.netcraft attempts to minimize the significance of this language by noting that the asserted patents abstract is the same as the original abstract in the parent patent.it submits that b ecause the patent claims are directed to a third party that provides internet access to customers,the original abstract naturally includes a discussion of this aspect.appellant reply br.according to netcraft,t his does not mean that every claim in the entire patent family should be limited to the features of the common abstract as defendants suggest.id.at.netcraft arguments on this point,however,illustrate the following underlying problem with its claim construction position the common specification,including the abstract,consistently describes the invention in terms of a third party providing internet access to customers.
while netcraft concedes that the third party in the asserted patents detailed examples is an internet access provider,it claims that other embodiments do not require that the third party provide customers with internet access.id.at.specifically,netcraft points to and of the asserted patents,and argues that the use of the language connect customer to internet in,step,should be differentiated from the use of the language customer connects to internet in,step.id.at.thus,netcraft claims that the difference in language between,step,and,step,expressly demonstrates that the invention does not require providing internet access to the customer.id.at.we disagree.
there is no language in the specification,much less express language,indicating that the words customer connects to internet used in,step,were meant to disclose an alternative embodiment not requiring that the third party provide internet access to customers.in fact,there are other differences between and,including steps and respectively,which more clearly differentiate the two methods.additionally,we note that the specification appears to describe the methods shown in and in context of the system illustrated in.see patent.in that context,while the specification indicates that certain vendors may access the internet directly using their own equipment,the only way for customers to access the internet is through the equipment of the provider.accordingly,we reject netcraft arguments that the specification includes additional embodiments that do not involve the provision of internet access to customers by the third party.
moreover,as defendants argue,the district court construction is further supported by the language of the phrase at issue,which requires that the communications link be provided through equipment of the third party.the common specification consistently uses the term equipment in reference to equipment that enables internet access.for example,the summary of the invention states that t he provider creates access to the internet for the customer through the provider equipment.patent see also id.these providers invest in the equipment needed to provide access to the internet for subscribers who pay the providers a fee for the access.id.a party desiring to connect to the internet by means of a provider typically connects via a modem over a telephone network to the provider equipment which then connects the party,through the provider equipment,to the internet.id.once the prearrangements have been completed,using the provider service to connect to the internet typically involves calling a telephone number of the provider and being automatically connected through the provider equipment to the internet.
turning to claim of the patent,netcraft makes several claim differentiation arguments.claim of the patent reads the method according to claim,or,wherein the third party is an internet access provider,a cable television company,a telephone company,or a company offering financial services.netcraft argues that if claim were truly limited to third parties that provide internet access,claim would be redundant in listing an internet access provider as a possible third party.appellant br.it also argues that within claim the differentiation between internet ac
