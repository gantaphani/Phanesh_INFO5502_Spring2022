this case requires careful consideration of the affirmative defense of entrapment.under the entrapment doctrine,g overnment agents may not originate a criminal design,implant in an innocent person mind the disposition to commit a criminal act,and then induce commission of the crime so that the government may prosecute.jacobson united states,d.if the government undertakes such measures,the stealth and strategy of particular criminal investigations can,under certain circumstances,become as objectionable police methods as the coerced confession and the unlawful search.sherman united states,d.
the entrapment doctrine recognizes that it is necessary and indeed,appropriate for the police to act affirmatively in attempting to prevent the commission of crimes.criminal activity is such that stealth and strategy are necessary weapons in the arsenal of the police officer.united states russell,d quoting sherman,at.while the supreme court has recognized that a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal,sherman,at,the application of the entrapment defense has sharply divided the supreme court on a number of occasions.see lopez united states,d collecting cases.
in the instant case,matthew adam brand brand claims that he was an unwary innocent and that the government induced him to commit the crimes for which he was charged and convicted traveling across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity with a minor and attempting to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.he also contends that the district court erred in admitting images of child pornography,found on his computer,as evidence of his intent to commit the crimes or his predisposition to do so.lastly,brand contests the sufficiency of the government proof with regard to enticement,as well as several aspects of the district court jury instructions.we hold that,even assuming brand established government inducement,he can not succeed on his entrapment defense.the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the prosecution had established that brand was predisposed to commit the charged crimes.we also hold that the district court did not err in admitting images of child pornography as evidence of brand intent or his predisposition.further,we reject brand challenges to the sufficiency of the enticement evidence and the jury instructions.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.

brand internet chats with sara and julie 
on the night of january,brand,then a voice instructor from new jersey,logged onto america online aol instant messenger using his screen name,tempoteech,and entered a chat room named i love older men.in the chat room,brand encountered sara,who used the screen name xxxxpartygurlooo and whom brand believed was a girl from long island.in reality,sara was stephanie good,a private citizen who had previously assisted the federal bureau of investigation fbi in several child exploitation investigations.
shortly after midnight on january,brand initiated contact with sara by sending her an instant message.in this first chat,brand asked sara if she was single and could date and whether she liked older guys.he also suggested meeting in manhattan.one week later,on january,brand again contacted sara via instant messenger.the message began,hi sara its matt again remember me single from jersey.during this second conversation,brand and sara discussed the logistics of meeting for singing lessons,as well as the possibility of sara modeling.brand suggested that they could meet at the port authority bus terminal in manhattan and that he could take her back to his house in new jersey or,in the alternative,that she could take the bus to his house and he would reimburse her for the bus fare.
three days later,on january,brand once again contacted sara via instant messenger.in addition to discussing their plans for singing lessons,brand wrote that he and sara were a perfect match and that we might like each other a lot.during the course of the conversation,brand eventually asked sara to be his girlfriend and then asked if he could hug sara when he saw her and maybe give her a kiss.brand stated i only want to kiss you and later announced that if you still love me when your sic we could get married.brand and sara also discussed what sara would tell her mother about coming to brand place,and brand advised do what you have to.
good,the private citizen posing as sara,later testified that,when she finds someone on the internet whom she believes is interested in a sexual relationship with a young girl,she introduces the suspect to her friend julie.in reality,julie was special agent austin berglas,an fbi agent working in an undercover capacity on the internet by posing as a girl who lives in new york.based on her three internet chats with brand,good decided that she should turn brand over to agent berglas.good told berglas that she believed that brand was interested in meeting an underage girl for the purpose of sexual activity,and berglas agreed with good assessment.
consequently,on january,sara initiated a chat session with brand during which she mentioned her friend julie.sara gave brand julie screen name,and told brand that her friend julie likes music and singing and was interested in taking lessons.sara later told brand on february,that she had been in a car accident and had broken some bones and indicated that she would not be able to meet him for some time.
meanwhile,on january,one day after sara mentioned julie to brand,brand initiated contact with julie by sending her an instant message.brand and julie discussed the possibility of singing lessons and having julie model in a children calendar,in which children pose with puppets and giant toys like a huge gameboy.brand indicated that julie should contact him either through an instant message or via.
twelve days later,on february,julie sent an instant message to brand.within five minutes of the initiation of the conversation,brand asked what about your boyfriend after julie indicated that she did not have a boyfriend,brand replied well thats ok i am single too.brand then asked julie whether she wanted to date an older man and,when julie responded yea well someone who knows stuff,brand replied well i am free.brand requested that julie send him her picture and,after receiving it,he indicated that i would be lucky to have a girl like you.brand proceeded to ask julie out on a date,and julie accepted.julie inquired whether he had ever previously dated anyone her age.brand responded never,and when julie asked why,brand responded cause no one was ever interested and i could get in trouble.
one week later,on february,brand sent julie an instant message.brand indicated that i ca wait to take you out,i would love to have you as a girlfriend,and i would be honored to date you,and he asked julie to say you will be my valentine.at trial,agent berglas testified that he believed that by saying,i want you to be my valentine and i want you to be my girlfriend,that to me implied that this individual had the intention of engaging in sex with julie.as a result,julie asked brand whether he would teach her stuff,and brand responded if you would like that i would love to.brand further responded that we could fool around and explore and we could do it all and indicated that he could show julie how to be a woman and make her feel so good.when julie inquired where brand would show her this stuff,brand replied that we could go to my place in new jersey if you wanted.brand indicated that he would love to see julie that day.when julie responded that her mother was unlikely to let her go out,brand suggested meeting on the weekend.brand and julie made plans to speak by cell phone approximately one hour later.
ii.brand telephone conversations with julie 
during brand telephone conversations with julie,the fbi enlisted good,the same private citizen who had previously posed as sara,to play the voice of julie because of good skillfulness in imitating the voices of teenage girls.julie called brand and talked to him using the instructions of agent berglas,who communicated with julie via instant messenger.all three telephone conversations between brand and julie took place on february,the day before the two were scheduled to meet in new york city.
during their first telephone conversation,brand discussed the logistics of meeting julie the following day.brand suggested that they meet at the port authority.specifically,he suggested that julie take a taxicab there,where he would wait for her,hold a sign with her name,and pay the cab.brand also told julie that he could pick her up in his red convertible and that she could ride in it all summer.brand hinted that julie should sneak a call later that evening so we can make definite,definite plans so i know if you comfortable with this or not.julie called back a short time later,and brand asked her to call back again in fifteen minutes.
when julie called back,brand confirmed their plan to meet at the port authority.julie continued to ask brand what stuff he was going to show her.brand responded well,what do you want what do you wan na do you tell me do be shy,whatta you wan na do with me tell me i wan na hear you say it,whatta you wan na learn and tell me what you want me to do to you,come on do be embarrassed,tell me.at this point,julie responded well,cause like i do know so much,you know like,sex stuff and everything.brand responded so,whatta you wan na learn sexually 
brand proceeded to enumerate the sexual acts that he could engage in with julie.he asked julie if she wanted him to touch her breasts and crotch,whether she had nice breasts and a nice ass,and whether he should touch her crotch with my penis,my fingers,or my tongue.when julie asked whether it would hurt,brand said that maybe using my penis would hurt because maybe it too big and because you a virgin.brand assured julie that he wanted to use his penis but told her that he did not have to use it right away because he could use his fingers or tongue instead.brand continually urged julie to tell him where she wanted him to put his tongue and indicated that it gets him excited if she says it.when julie inquired whether she would get pregnant or anything,brand told her that she would not,assuring her that he would use a condom as protection.brand also admonished julie to not go learnin all this stuff that i,sic that you want me to teach you and then go finding some other man.
during the same conversation,brand and julie further discussed the logistics of meeting the next day and the plan to have julie stay over.brand reiterated that julie could ride in his convertible and promised that he would even bring a movie so we can watch a movie while we drive.brand also instructed julie to check her in the morning just to make sure,but brand continued to offer assurances that i not changing my mind and i definitely,definitely be there.
iii.brand meeting with julie 
just after the following morning,february,brand julie and told her that a meeting prevented him from meeting at noon later that day but that julie should call me when you get home and we can work something out.julie sent brand an instant just before julie asked brand if he was still coming and complained i new u did wan na see me.brand assured her that he was still coming and told her to call him.bran also mentioned the possibility of taking a vacation with julie in massachusetts during the coming summer.after julie reiterated that i wan na do that stuff,brand responded that i said yesterday we would do that stuff today and we will and that he was already thinking about kissing and touching her.
at noon,julie called brand to see if brand was still coming and,if so,what time they would meet.brand proposed meeting at at the port authority.brand then instructed julie to call him back in half an hour,indicating that he would be on his way in the car and could then give her an exact time.when julie called brand back approximately thirty minutes later,brand told julie that he would be near the taxicab stand in front of the port authority with a sign at 
fbi agents set up surveillance at the port authority bus terminal.after they observed brand walking along and looking into taxicabs at the taxi stand,brand was placed under arrest.the fbi agents removed a handwritten sign with julie name on it from brand pocket,as well as three condoms from the glove compartment of brand car.the agents also found a number of pictures of young girls in brand car,including three suggestive pictures of a young girl lying on a bed holding a large toy video game and standing in front of a mirror holding a large toy toothbrush and tube of toothpaste there was also a series of autographed modeling headshots of young girls.
brand waived his miranda rights and admitted that he was at the port authority to meet someone he believed to be a thirteen or girl named julie whom he had met over the internet.brand proceeded to make several other admissions.he told the agents that,while he initially talked to julie about voice lessons,the conversation turned to a sexual nature.he confessed that he had told julie she would not get pregnant because he would use a condom and that he had asked if he could lick her breast and crotch.he admitted to using the tempoteech screen name to chat over the internet with other girls as young as ten years old and to engaging in sexually explicit communications with those girls.brand also admitted that he knew that arranging to meet julie was wrong and illegal and that he was afraid of being caught by the police.
brand told the agents that on the night before the scheduled meeting he had second thoughts and had julie in order to give himself a possible way out of the meeting.he also asserted that he had been kind of hoping that julie would show up at the port authority bus terminal because he did know what he was actually going to do when she arrived.he indicated that he had come to the port authority because he did not want julie standing there alone.he also admitted,however,that he could have told julie that what they were doing was wrong and illegal and cancelled their meeting.
brand further confessed to receiving and viewing images of child pornography over the internet and his home computer using his tempoteech screen name.consequently,after his arrest,the fbi seized brand computer.on the computer,agents discovered approximately eighty images of child pornography and child erotica,many of which brand had deleted and some of which were in temporary files.the majority of the pictures that the police recovered,however,were,or had been,in the same folder,or location on the hard drive of his computer,in which brand had saved the picture of julie.
iv.the trial 
the district court resolved a number of the government motions.see united states brand,wl.the government sought a ruling that images of child erotica and child pornography from brand computer were admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged alternatively,that the images were admissible under rule b to prove motive,intent,plan,knowledge,and absence of mistake or accident and that two transcripts of internet communications between brand and two other undercover agents posing as girls,jenny and mizbonnie,were similarly admissible pursuant to rule b.id.at.
on january,the district court leisure,issued a preliminary ruling on one of the government in limine motions.the district court held that the images of child pornography and child erotica were not admissible as direct proof of either of the crimes charged.id.at.however,the court concluded that the images were admissible under rule b because the government was planning to offer the images for a permissible purpose other than to show a propensity to commit the crimes charged.id.at.the court,noting that defendant state of mind would likely be a central issue at trial,determined that the images were probative of brand intent.id.the court found that evidence that brand exhibited an interest in child erotica and child pornography on the internet in the period leading up to the charged conduct is pertinent to whether he used the internet in an attempt to engage in sexual conduct with julie.id.subsequently,at trial,the district court allowed the government to introduce the sixteen images of child pornography and child erotica from brand computer.at that time,the district court also issued a limiting instruction,to which brand objected,regarding the limited evidentiary purpose of the images.
in ruling on the government in limine motion,the district court also considered the admissibility of two transcripts involving previous instant message communications between brand and two other undercover agents.in the first transcript,brand,using the screen name tempoteech,chatted with,an agent posing as a girl from los angeles,in the chat room i love much older men.id.at.brand asked jenny whether she like d to hold hands and kiss and indicated that they would have fun.id.he also asked jenny whether she ever traveled to new jersey and suggested that they could see the city.the district court found the transcript admissible,concluding that,i n light of the fact that brand is charged with attempting to persuade a minor to engage in sex acts,this is sufficiently similar to the charged conduct to permit a reasonable jury to draw from it an inference that brand was motivated by a sexual intent in his interactions with julie.id.at trial,the undercover agent who posed as jenny testified about the details of this chat session and explained that it was his practice not to initiate a second chat or conversations about sex.
however,the district court concluded that the second transcript of a conversation between brand and an undercover agent was inadmissible.in the second transcript,brand,again using the screen name tempoteech,chatted with,another agent posing as a girl.id.the court concluded that,although the transcript of the is admissible primarily because of its sexual character,the transcript of the mizbonnie is not sufficiently relevant,and therefore inadmissible,due to its subject matter.id.
following the government,which included testimony from agent berglas,the defense argued that the government had entrapped brand into traveling to new york to engage in illicit sexual conduct with julie and attempting to entice julie.in addition,brand called a psychiatrist,sasha bardey,who testified that,based on his training,experience,and his review of the literature,no relationship exists between possessing or viewing child pornography and committing an illegal sexual act against a minor.however,on by the government,bardey admitted that he had read a study that showed that of individuals arrested for sex crimes against minors also possessed child pornography he also noted that he was not a member of any of the professional societies focused on the treatment of sex offenders and had also not published or presented anything related to the treatment of sex offenders.
before the government rebuttal,the district court announced that it would charge the jury with brand entrapment defense.the court ruled that brand had made a sufficient showing of government inducement and,thus,that the burden now shifted to the government to prove brand predisposition to commit the charged crimes.the district court therefore allowed the government to introduce evidence on rebuttal,which the court had earlier deemed inadmissible,in order to show brand predisposition.specifically,the government called detective sherry kiszewski,a member of the buffalo police department sex offense squad,who acted in an undercover capacity as the girl mizbonnie.detective kiszewski testified that,on december,brand had initiated contact with mizbonnie,asked her whether she dated older guys,suggested that she visit him in new jersey,and offered to pay her bus fare.detective kiszewski explained that she had been taught never to bring the subject of sex up and that,under her understanding,entrapment included asking an adult to come and have sex with you or broaching the subject.in addition,the government recalled agent berglas and,through him,the district court allowed the government to introduce the containing additional images of child pornography and child erotica found on brand computer.
the district court instructed the jury on the nature of brand entrapment defense and the limited purpose of the rule b evidence.brand counsel objected to each set of instructions.the case was submitted to the jury,which ultimately found brand guilty on both counts.on july,the district court sentenced brand to the mandatory minimum sentence of months imprisonment,to be followed by five years of supervised release,and imposed the mandatory special assessment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
brand raises four issues on appeal.first,brand contends that he was entrapped by the government.he argues that the government induced him to commit the offenses of which he was convicted and that the government evidence was insufficient to establish that he was predisposed to commit these offenses independent of the government own actions.second,brand contends that the district court erred in finding the images of child pornography sufficiently similar to the crimes charged to make the introduction of these images probative of either intent under rule b or of predisposition.third,brand contends that the government evidence was insufficient to prove that he attempted to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity in violation of b.fourth,with respect to both his entrapment defense and the district court evidentiary rulings,brand asserts that the district court jury instructions were erroneous and constitute reversible error.
entrapment 
entrapment is an affirmative defense that requires a defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the government inducement to commit the crime.united states williams,cir.if a defendant carries his burden of establishing entrapment,the government can still defeat the defense of entrapment if it can show that a defendant was predisposed to commit the crime.if a defendant presents credible evidence of government inducement,then the prosecutor must show predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.united states bala,cir.thus,the inquiry centers on whether the agent induce d the accused to commit the offence charged in the indictment and if so,was the accused ready and willing without persuasion and was he awaiting any propitious opportunity to commit the offence.united states mayo,cir quoting united states sherman,cir.
inducement 
the first element of brand entrapment defense requires him to establish that he was other words,that it was the government,not he,that originated the criminal design.jacobson,at.the government argues that brand has not satisfied this preliminary burden,arguing that brand lurking in the chat room i love older men,as well as his unsolicited contact of sara and julie,demonstrate that the government did not implant in an innocent person mind the disposition to commit a criminal act.id.brand disagrees and asserts that he set forth sufficient evidence,including evidence that the government initiated the communication beyond brand original offer of voice lessons and that the government constantly turned the discussion to sex and the possibility of meeting to engage in sexual activity.indeed,brand asserts that the district court charged the entrapment theory to the jury because there was no doubt that agent berglas induced brand and that the real issue for the jury was brand predisposition.
absent a concession of inducement by the government a defendant hoping to assert the entrapment defense bears the burden of establishing inducement by a preponderance of the evidence.see williams,at see also united states steinberg,cir.to satisfy the relatively slight burden,the defendant must demonstrate that the government initiated the crime.mayo,at internal quotations and citations omitted.judge learned hand wrote that inducement includes soliciting,proposing,initiating,broaching or suggesting the commission of the offense charged.sherman,at.or,put another way,a defendant must establish that it was the prosecution that set the accused in motion id.
a defendant burden of proof on inducement should not be treated as a hollow requirement in those cases where the government has not conceded the issue.to satisfy the burden on inducement,a defendant can not simply point to the government use of an undercover agent or confidential informant.while stealth and strategy are necessary weapons in the arsenal of the police officer,russell,at.quoting sherman,at,and a rtifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises,sorrells,at.internal citations omitted,that the government employed either does not necessarily mean that it was the government that initiat ed the crime,united states licursi,cir quoting riley,cir,or set the accused in motion.sherman,at.although a defendant burden of proof on inducement may be relatively easily satisfied,this element of entrapment still must be established.
much of brand conduct in his initial contacts with sara and julie asking if they dated older men,would be his girlfriend,or would pose for be seen as preparation for a later sexual encounter.in the words of one witness,brand was grooming the girls for later sexual activity we need not decide the issue,however,because as the government argues,even if brand was induced,the record nonetheless shows that there was more than ample evidence to demonstrate brand predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt to entice minors to have sex with him.
predisposition 
brand contends that the government evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that he was predisposed to commit the offense charged independent of the government actions.brand contends that jacobson,d,is determinative and points out that,under jacobson,predisposition is measured independently of the government actions.under this standard,brand argues,the government did not present any evidence that,in the past,he had either attempted to entice a minor or traveled across state lines to meet underage girls.brand further maintains that the evidence that the government did present could not establish predisposition because it either did not involve a discussion of sexual activity or merely suggested a general inclination to act within a broad range,not all of which is criminal.id.at.
the government argues that the record clearly shows that more than ample evidence exists to demonstrate brand predisposition.the government contends that brand,in asserting that the evidence was not sufficient to establish predisposition,erroneously implies that the internet chats with jenny and mizbonnie and the images of child pornography found on his computer are the only pieces of evidence.the government points to brand communications with sara and julie and his statements to the police,each of which,the government maintains,are independently sufficient to establish predisposition.thus,according to the government,brand course of conduct with sara and julie,his admissions of explicit chats with other young children,his chat sessions with jenny and mizbonnie,as well as brand images of child pornography,amply demonstrated brand predisposition to attempt to entice and meet a minor to engage in sexual activity.
the supreme court has made clear that government agents may not originate a criminal design,implant in an innocent person mind the disposition to commit a criminal act,and then induce commission of the crime so that the government may prosecute.jacobson,at.citing sorrells,at,and sherman,at.as noted above,if a defendant presents credible evidence of government inducement,then the prosecutor must show predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.bala,at.because brand argument is in substance an attack on the sufficiency of the government evidence of predisposition,salerno,at,that evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government,and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the government favor,id.citing united states aulicino,cir.
we have established that predisposition may be shown by evidence of an existing course of criminal conduct similar to the crime for which the defendant is charged,an already formed design on the part of the accused to commit the crime for which he is charged,or a willingness to commit the crime for which he is charged as evidenced by the accused ready response to the inducement.united states brunshtein,cir quoting salerno,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.whether the government has demonstrated predisposition,however,depends to a great degree on the nature and scope of the relevant inquiry into a defendant predisposition.
brand relies heavily on the supreme court decision in jacobson,d.in that case,over the long span of years,the government engaged in repeated efforts,through five fictitious organizations and a bogus pen pal,to explore jacobson willingness to break the law by ordering sexually explicit photographs of children through the mail.id.at.eventually,jacobson was arrested after he ordered a copy of boys who love boys,a pornographic magazine depicting young boys engaged in various sexual activities.id.at.although the court acknowledged that petitioner eventually became predisposed to break the law,the court concluded that the government did not prove that this predisposition was independent and not the product of the attention that the government had directed at petitioner.id.at.applying this rule,the court rejected any evidence that the government developed during the course of the investigation.id.the court subsequently concluded that the government could not establish predisposition because the sole piece of preinvestigation evidence,petitioner order and receipt of the bare boys magazines,the possession of which was legal when jacobson obtained them,merely indicate d a generic inclination to act within a broad range,not all of which is criminal and thus was of little probative value in establishing predisposition.id.
because we are bound by the court holding in jacobson,brand is correct in pointing out that the government reliance on certain evidence of acts that occurred after brand initial contact with government agents is misplaced.this evidence would not be probative of petitioner state of mind prior to the commencement of the government investigation.id.at.however,even under jacobson,the government can still establish predisposition based on the accused ready response to the inducement.brunshtein,at quoting salerno,at.we have recognized this characteristic of predisposition both before and after jacobson 
in mayo,a case,we noted that p ropensity can be established in many ways,among them proof of a willingness to commit the crime for which he is charged as evidenced by the accused ready response to the inducement.at quoting united states viviano,cir emphasis in mayo.mayo had been convicted previously of violating the federal firearms law and,as a consequence,was not licensed to deal in modern firearms.id.at.an undercover agent offered to purchase a machine gun and other modern weapons from mayo.id.at.we noted that mayo jumped at the opportunity.id.ultimately,we held that the government had established predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt because of mayo ready and unhesitating response to the informant inducement and his unhesitating willingness to commit the crimes for which he was convicted.id.at.we indicated that,because t he government evidence of propensity established mayo unhesitating willingness to commit the offenses charged,id.at,t his is not a case where the government deception actually implant ed the criminal design in the mind of the defendant,id.quoting russell,at.second alteration in mayo.
we have also recognized this ready response aspect of predisposition in cases.see,salerno,at united states harvey,cir.in harvey,we noted that jacobson did not change the law so that when a suspect promptly avails himself of a opportunity to commit a crime,that suspect thereafter can successfully claim he was entrapped as a matter of law.at citing jacobson,at.indeed,even in jacobson,the supreme court pointed out that h ad the agents in this case simply offered petitioner the opportunity to order child pornography through the mails,and must be presumed to know the promptly availed himself of this criminal opportunity,it is unlikely that his entrapment defense would have warranted a jury instruction.at.emphasis added citing mathews united states,d.
applying this rule in harvey,we held that i t is clear to us that the jury,in this case,was free to conclude from the government evidence that harvey requests for a catalog of material featuring younger performers,young performers,and your youngest performers were oblique requests for child pornography reflecting predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.at.harvey made these requests only after the government had sent him a specific interest response letter,which asked harvey for his preferences and areas of interest.id.at.in response to harvey requests,the government mailed him a catalog advertising videotapes that depicted young girls engaging in sexual activity with men.id.at.despite these facts,we held that harvey prompt acceptance of the invitation to purchase child pornography,as reflected in the order form,provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that harvey was predisposed to commit the crime charged.id.at.we also found jacobson easily distinguishable 
based upon harvey prompt response to the government single invitation to him to purchase child pornography,the jury could rationally find that he possessed the requisite predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.such was not a permissible inference in jacobson since,in that case,it took over two and years of various governmental efforts directed toward the defendant before he placed an order for child pornography.
id.at.we thus made clear that jacobson had not changed the law regarding a suspect who promptly avails himself of a opportunity to commit a crime.id.
likewise,in salerno,we were confronted with a situation in which a confidential informant ci contacted,at the government request,defendant digirolamo as part of an undercover operation targeting heroin distributors.at.digirolamo claimed entrapment,and,on appeal,the government conceded inducement.id.at.we pointed out that a defendant is predisposed to commit a crime if he is ready and willing without persuasion to commit the crime charged and awaiting any propitious opportunity to do so,id.quoting harvey,at internal quotation marks omitted,and that predisposition can be shown by the accused ready response to the inducement,id.quoting united states valencia,cir.we therefore found it determinative that the government introduced evidence that digirolamo readily agreed to the transaction.id.while digirolamo attempted to point to evidence that he had been reluctant to be involved in the deal,we noted that there was evidence that digirolamo displayed no such hesitation in his initial discussions with the ci,when the ci first proposed the deal.id.at.we also found it significant that whatever reluctance digirolamo displayed quickly evaporated after digirolamo contacted a friend.id.as a result,we held that there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that digirolamo was ready willing and predisposed to commit the crime proposed by the ci.id.
applying the supreme court decision in jacobson,as well as our decisions in mayo,harvey,and salerno,we have no difficulty concluding that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that brand was predisposed to travel across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity with a minor and to attempt to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.as an initial matter,we note that the manner in which brand contacted both sara and julie specifically,in an internet chat room entitled i love older men does bear on brand predisposition.he did not encounter them until he had chosen to log onto a chat room with a very suggestive name.once in the chat room,brand believed that sara was a girl from her screen profile and that julie was a girl from her screen name.indeed,brand confessed to using his tempoteech screen name to chat over the internet with other girls as young as ten years old and to engaging in sexual and explicit communications with those girls.moreover,brand also admitted to receiving and viewing images of child pornography over the internet,which,as we discuss below,are relevant to brand predisposition.all of these events occurred prior to,and were independent of,any contact by government agents,as required under jacobson.based on these circumstances,the jury could rationally find that brand was predisposed to commit the crimes charged.
in any event,brand prompt response to the undercover agents definitively establishes his predisposition under jacobson and our subsequent cases.brand correctly points out that the transcripts of his telephone conversations with julie reveal that it was good,the private citizen pretending to be the voice of julie,who first broached the topic of sexual activity.however,brand jumped at the opportunity,mayo,at,and his unhesitating response,id.at,included offers to touch julie breasts,crotch,and ass.brand displayed no hesitation,salerno,at,in assuring julie that,if sexual intercourse with his penis hurt,he could use his fingers or tongue.brand also promised julie that she would not get pregnant or anything because he would use a condom.indeed,even before julie broached the topic of sexual activity,the jury could have interpreted brand use of sexual innuendo as oblique requests of enticement to engage in sexual activity.harvey,at.moreover,brand statements to julie were not idle chatter.rather,brand planned the logistics of meeting with julie and,ultimately,traveled to meet julie at the appointed time and place.finally,whatever reluctance brand may have had quickly evaporated,salerno,at,as brand reassured julie that i said yesterday we would do that stuff today and we will.thus,even assuming arguendo that brand established inducement by a preponderance of the evidence,based on the circumstances of the internet chat room and brand prompt response to julie single mention of sex stuff,the jury could rationally find that brand possessed the requisite predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt.harvey,at.
ii.evidentiary rulings 
brand contends that the district court admission of images of child pornography and child erotica was erroneous and highly prejudicial he argues that his possession of these images is not sufficiently similar to the crimes charged to make it probative of either intent under federal rule of evidence b or of predisposition for purposes of entrapment.as noted above,the district court initially admitted a binder of sixteen images found on brand computer under rule b.after brand claimed entrapment,the court admitted the remaining pictures as evidence of brand predisposition 
the government argues that both of the district court evidentiary rulings were correct.specifically,it contends that the images of child pornography and child erotica brand possessed were properly admitted as relevant to the primary issue in dispute,namely brand intent to meet a minor for sex.the government further asserts that,even if the district court erred in admitting the images under rule b,these images,as well as the remaining images,were properly admitted at trial to show brand predisposition.
the supreme court has noted that federal rule of evidence b generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that might adversely reflect on the actor character,unless that evidence bears upon a relevant issue in the case such as motive,opportunity,or knowledge.huddleston united states,d.however,in huddleston,the court was careful to point out that e xtrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the establishment of the truth as to a disputed issue,especially when that issue involves the actor state of mind and the only means of ascertaining that mental state is by drawing inferences from conduct.id.
since a district court is in the best position to evaluate the evidence and its effect on the jury,its rulings on admissibility under rule b will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.united states pitre,cir citing united states smith,cir.an abuse of discretion under rule b requires a determination that the district court acted arbitrarily and irrationally.pitre,at.the second circuit evaluates rule b evidence under an inclusionary approach and allows evidence for any purpose other than to show a defendant criminal propensity.united states garcia,cir quoting pitre,at.in reviewing whether a district court properly admitted evidence under rule b,we consider whether the prior acts evidence was offered for a proper purpose the evidence was relevant to a disputed issue the probative value of the prior act evidence substantially outweighed the danger of its unfair prejudice and the court administered an appropriate limiting instruction.id.at citing huddleston,at.
before trial,during the government in limine motion,and at trial,the government contended that brand intent to commit the charged offenses will be the primary dispute.brand,wl,at.similarly,in making its evidentiary rulings,the district court concluded that brand put his intent to commit the charged crimes at issue.id.brand does not challenge the fact that his intent was at issue.instead,brand challenges the district court admission of sixteen images of child pornography on the basis that these images were not relevant to a disputed issue.specifically,he claims that these images were not sufficiently similar to the crimes charged to be relevant to the issue of intent.we disagree.
we have long acknowledged that prior act evidence is generally admissible to prove that the defendant acted with the state of mind necessary to commit the offense charged.united states zackson,cir.the government is required to establish only a similarity or some connection to establish that a prior act is relevant to one of the elements in this case,intent of the crime charged.garcia,at.relevant evidence includes any evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
the images brand possessed on his computer were relevant to determining whether,in traveling across state lines to meet julie and in attempting to entice julie,brand intended to engage in illicit sexual activity or,alternatively,some more innocuous act.as the government points out,t hese images provided a glimpse into brand sexual interest in children and,as such,were highly probative of whether he wanted to have sex with julie or simply to give her voice lessons,as brand essentially contended at trial.that is,the fact that brand had images of child pornography on his computer made it more probable than it would be without the evidence,that brand intent was to travel to new york to engage in illicit sexual activity and to attempt to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.of course,this relevance is dependent on a similarity or some connection between brand possession of the photographs and his actions at port authority.in this case such a connection is present.
the similarity or some connection requirement is satisfied in the instant case because a direct connection exists between child pornography and pedophilia.we note that other courts have recognized a link between child pornography and pedophilia,united states byrd,cir upholding the admissibility of defendant pedophilia to show his predisposition and rebut the claim that the defendant was entrapped into ordering and receiving child pornography the fifth circuit noted that the two were linked by an abnormal sexual attraction to children.id.the child pornography found on brand computer certainly suggests just such an abnormal sexual attraction by brand.brand abnormal sexual attraction encompassed not only possession of child pornography but the desire to meet a young girl for a sexual encounter the same urge that brand satisfied by obtaining child erotica also inclined brand to commit sexual crimes against children.we believe this abnormal sexual attraction to children establishes the similarity or connection required to show relevance.
in addition to indicating a broader abnormal sexual attraction to children,child pornography shares a strong nexus with pedophilia.in the child pornography prevention act of,congress found that child pornography is often used by pedophiles and child sexual abusers to stimulate and whet their own sexual appetites,and as a model for sexual acting out with children,stat.this is wholly consistent with earlier findings that child pornography may induce viewers to commit sex crimes on children.byrd,at citing david johnson,why the possession of child pornography can be constitutionally prohibited.tech,citing dep t of justice,attorney general commission on pornography final report in our view,possession of child pornography by itself shares a connection or similarity with pedophilia here,the record indicates that not only did brand possess child pornography but also that he kept the images of child pornography,currently at issue,in the same computer folder in which he kept julie photograph.a reasonable juror could conclude that brand was whetting his own sexual appetite for his encounter with julie.a causal link between possession of child pornography and the commission of sexual crimes need not be proven conclusively for the evidence in question to be admissible.in this case,we are confident that there is enough similarity or connection between the two so as to make the pictures on brand computer relevant to his intent in driving to another state to spend time with a young girl he had met in an internet chat room entitled i love older men.the district court did not abuse its discretion.
we emphasize the limited nature of our holding today with regard to rule b.we need not decide whether it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court not to allow the pornographic images as evidence of brand intent under rule b.we hold only that,under the inclusionary approach that our court has adopted,garcia,at quoting pitre,at,the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that evidence that brand possessed child pornography was admissible under rule b to show whether brand intent in attempting to entice julie and traveling across state lines to meet with her involved an intent to engage in sexual activity with a minor or,alternatively,for a more benign reason.
predisposition 
because we conclude that the binder of images of child pornography and child erotica found on brand computer is admissible under rule b,our review of the remaining predisposition evidence is relatively circumscribed.we need address only those remaining images of child pornography and child erotica that the district court initially found relevant,yet unduly cumulative,with regard to brand intent but that the court later admitted as predisposition evidence when brand raised his affirmative defense of entrapment.
predisposition evidence is reviewed under a standard first articulated by judge hand in sherman and later reaffirmed by this court in harvey 
predisposition evidence can be established by evidence of a defendant past conduct this past conduct should be near enough in kind to support an inference that his purpose included offenses of the sort charged although it is not necessary that the past conduct be precisely the same as that for which the defendant is being prosecuted.
harvey,at quoting sherman,at.w e review the admission of potentially prejudicial evidence,such as predisposition evidence,for an abuse of discretion.id.citing united states gantzer,cir.
in harvey,the defendant claimed that government officials had entrapped him into receiving visual depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity.at.the district court allowed the government agent to testify as to the nature and contents of several videotapes of simulated child pornography,as well as several videos containing adult pornography that harvey had in his possession.id.at.applying the aforementioned standard,we concluded in harvey that the government evidence of simulated child pornography was near enough in kind to receiving child pornography.we noted that harvey did not claim in the district court,nor does he claim on appeal,that no reasonable person would have mistaken any of the females in these simulated child pornography materials as being underage.id.at.we therefore held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence because we are unwilling to conclude that the admission of the simulated child pornography evidence unduly prejudiced harvey.id.
under this standard,we have no difficulty concluding that brand past possession of images of child pornography and child erotica is near enough in kind to support an inference that brand purpose included sexual offenses against children.inquiries into a defendant intent to commit a crime and his predisposition to do so are closely related and,to a significant extent,overlap.the same prior acts evidence that is relevant to establishing a defendant intent under rule b will very often also be near enough in kind for the purpose of determining a defendant predisposition.indeed,in russell,the supreme court noted that the thrust of the entrapment defense requires a focus on the intent or predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime.at.emphasis added.while a defendant intent and predisposition need not be so tightly intertwined,in the present case,brand intent and predisposition are.brand intent and predisposition share a common temporal preparation for and travel to new york for the purpose of meeting his girlfriend.more importantly,though,they share a unique locus an abnormal sexual attraction to children,as demonstrated by the child pornography on brand computer.indeed,this was really the same link that existed in harvey the simulated child pornography also evinced an abnormal sexual attraction to children.as noted,there is a strong link between possession of child pornography and sexual crimes against children.both congress and at least one other court have concluded that possession of child pornography signals the abnormal sexual attraction to children underlying a person motivation to commit sexual crimes against children.this link is certainly strong enough to support the inference required by harvey and sherman.indeed,it would be difficult for us to conclude in this case that brand possession of child pornography and the crimes with which he is charged were similar or in some way connected,for purposes of b,without also concluding that his possession of child pornography was near enough in kind to support an inference that his purpose,satisfying his abnormal sexual attraction to children,included offenses of the sort charged.in our view,the evidence at of child pornography found on brand relevant not only to the issue of brand intent to commit the charged crimes but also to the issue of brand predisposition to do so.
finally,we note that in harvey we found the predisposition evidence of simulated child pornography admissible but indicated that it might not have been sufficient to establish predisposition.however,in this case the remaining images of child pornography and child erotica represent merely a small fraction of the predisposition evidence offered to rebut brand claim of entrapment.as discussed above,the remaining evidence indicates that,because of the circumstances of brand initiating contact with sara and julie and brand prompt response to julie solitary mention of sex stuff,the jury could rationally find that brand possessed the requisite predisposition.harvey,at.thus,while we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these images as predisposition evidence,the government also offered more than enough evidence to establish brand predisposition beyond a reasonable doubt even without the admission of these images.
iii.sufficiency challenge 
brand also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to his conviction for attempting to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity in violation of b.a defendant who challenges his conviction based upon the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden.united states griffith,cir.not only must the evidence be viewed in the light most favorable to the government and all permissible inferences drawn in its favor,but if the evidence,thus construed,suffices to convince any rational trier of fact of the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,then the defendant conviction must stand.united states dae whan kim,cir per curiam alteration omitted quoting united states martinez,cir.
to establish enticement under b,the government must prove four elements that an individual i used a facility of interstate commerce ii to knowingly persuade,induce or entice,or to attempt to persuade,induce or entice iii any individual who is younger than old iv to engage in sexual activity of a criminal nature b.brand challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence of the second element,contending that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that he attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.he presses that it was the undercover fbi agent that actually did the enticing.
a conviction under b requires a finding only of an attempt to entice or an intent to entice,and not an intent to perform the sexual act following the persuasion.see united states thomas,cir united states bailey,cir.in order to establish that a defendant is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime,the government must prove that the defendant had the intent to commit the crime and engaged in conduct amounting to a substantial step towards the commission of the crime.united states yousef,cir quoting united states rosa,cir quoting united states martinez,cir.a substantial step must be something more than mere preparation united states manley,cir.the step must be necessary to the consummation of the crime and be of such a nature that a reasonable observer,viewing it in context could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it was undertaken in accordance with a design to violate the statute.id.at.
several factors demonstrate that brand attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.first,the government showed that brand initiated the contact with both sara,whose profile indicated that she was a girl,and julie,whose screen name indicated that she was a girl.in fact,julie mentioned that she was thirteen.brand initiated contact in a chat room entitled i love older men,a forum in which adult men frequently seek children for sex.see,united states chriswell,cir man contacts fbi agent posing as girl in the i love older men chat room united states root,cir man contacts fbi agent posing as girl in the i love older men chat room.the fact that the chat room is a hotbed of illegal more specifically,of attempted enticement of relevant in reviewing brand sufficiency challenge.the jury could have reasonably inferred that the nature of the forum,coupled with brand sexually explicit chats with sara and julie,established that brand attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.united states martin,cir noting the significance,in a probable cause determination,of the fact that the girls welcome message unabashedly announced that its essential purpose was to trade child pornography,reh g en banc denied,cir.
second,in addition to making the initial contact with both sara and julie,brand repeatedly made sexual advances towards both girls.brand asked sara for her picture,inquired whether she would be his girlfriend,asked if he could hug her,and then indicated that i only want to kiss you.similarly,brand initially asked julie to send her picture.during their next conversation,brand asked julie if she wanted to date an older man,indicated that he was free,and then asked julie out on a date.during another chat session,brand told julie that i would love to have you as a girlfriend and asked her to say you will be my valentine.brand continuously steered the conversation in the direction of sexual contact.brand stated that he would love to kiss julie,touch and play,do anything you want,fool around and explore,and do it all.he later told julie over the phone that she could ride in his red convertible and watch a movie as they drove.
overall,during his chat sessions with sara and julie,brand pictures,flirting,and attempting to gain classic grooming behavior in preparation for a future sexual encounter.child sexual abuse is often effectuated following a period of grooming and the sexualization of the relationship.sana loue,legal and epidemiological aspects of child maltreatment,legal med.we have noted the government interest in preventing pedophiles from grooming minors for future sexual encounters.am.booksellers found.dean,cir.brand sexual advances and grooming behavior provide additional evidence in support of the jury finding that brand attempted to entice a minor.united states munro,cir holding that defendant statements that he had money,his own place,a car,an x box,a play station,and a dvd player could reasonably be interpreted as attempts to impress a minor and give her incentives to meet and engage in sexual activities.
third,brand statements regarding the sex acts that he planned to perform on julie provided further evidence of brand attempt to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.although agent berglas first mentioned the word sex,brand immediately proceeded to tell julie the sexual acts he was going to engage in with her.he detailed that he would fondle her breasts,ass,and crotch,suggested that if sex with his penis hurt he could use his fingers or tongue instead,and explained that he would use a condom so that julie would not get pregnant.these sexually explicit conversations with julie provided overwhelming evidence to support the jury finding that brand attempted to entice a minor.see united states patten,cir holding that defendant asking about minor sexual preferences and whether she would like to hook up constitutes sufficient evidence under b munro,at holding that defendant statements and questions regarding virginity,sexual experiences,and his desire to perform oral sex constitute sufficient evidence under b.
fourth,brand also attempted,on several occasions,to set up a meeting with julie.he repeatedly asked when can i see you,inquired when julie mother would be away,discussed the fact that julie mother would be working the next evening,and suggested that they go to his home in new jersey.brand and julie settled on a meeting the next,at brand suggestion,a meeting port authority bus terminal.brand actions in attempting to set up a meeting with julie further support the jury finding that brand attempted to entice a minor.thomas,at holding that defendant crossed the line from harmless banter to inducement the moment he began making arrangements to meet.
finally,brand took a substantial step towards the completion of the crime because brand actually went to the port authority bus terminal,the meeting place that he had established with julie.see patten,at holding that clear authority for the government position that defendant act of driving to the arranged meeting place was relevant evidence of a substantial step citing root,at munro,at holding that defendant took a substantial step towards completion of the crime by actually going to the prearranged meeting place.brand not only had a sign with julie name on it in his possession but also had three condoms in the glove compartment of his car.brand was not the victim of a series of innocent coincidences that converged to cast him wrongfully into the hands of the fbi.there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that brand attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of b 
iv.jury instructions 
brand also raises four objections to the district court jury instructions.we note that the trial court enjoys broad discretion in crafting its instructions which is only circumscribed by the requirement that the charge be fair to both sides.united states russo,cir quoting united states gaf,cir.although a defendant is entitled to have the court charge the jury on any defense theory for which a foundation existed in the record,he is not necessarily entitled to have that instruction communicated to the jury in the language of his choice.salerno,at citing united states johnson,cir.rather,a charge is sufficient if it adequately appraises the jury of the crime and the defense.id.quoting johnson,at.we review a claim of error in jury instructions de novo,reversing only where,viewing the charge as a whole,there was a prejudicial error.united states quattrone,cir quoting united states,cir.
brand first contention focuses on the district court instruction regarding the elements of entrapment.the district court instructed the jury that a defendant may not be convicted of a crime if it was the government who gave the defendant the idea to commit the crime,if it was the government who also persuaded him to commit the crime,and if he was not ready and willing to commit the crime before the government officials or agent first spoke with him.brand argues that the district court erred in using the phrase the idea to commit the crime rather than the readiness and willingness to commit the crime.he contends that the court instruction erroneously suggests that predisposition can be shown simply by proof that he had the idea to commit a crime.we disagree.
the district court instruction explicitly and accurately articulates the two prerequisites of entrapment inducement by the government and a defendant lack of predisposition.in fact,in the very same sentence about which brand complains,the district court conveys that predisposition turns on whether the defendant was ready and willing to commit the crime.the district court repeated this requirement elsewhere in the charge,instructing the jury that the inquiry turns on whether you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed,that is ready and willing,to commit the offenses charged united states williams,cir concluding that even an erroneous statement in a jury charge did not warrant reversal because,among other things,the isolated remark complained of was followed by a rereading of the full charge on entrapment,which correctly set forth the applicable principles footnote omitted.our conclusion that the district court did not err in defining entrapment is supported by the fact that the charge mirrors the model language from sand modern federal jury we have previously approved.see united states han,cir.
brand next objection is to the placement of the investigative techniques charge.the district court charge on investigative techniques describes the government legitimate use of covert agents.brand contends that the district court placement of this instruction immediately following the entrapment charge undermined the very factfinding task that the jury was supposed to undertake with respect to his entrapment defense.
contrary to brand argument,the district court did not err in its placement of the investigative techniques charge.it is a well established proposition that a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.united states torres,cir quoting cupp naughten,d.in united states braver,cir,a defendant mounted a challenge similar to brand contention.braver claimed that a portion of the district court charge explaining the rationale of the entrapment defense in essence told the jury that the government activities in this case were proper.id.at.in rejecting braver challenge,we held that t he district court merely explained the policy behind the entrapment defense and clarified the proper relationship of that defense with such law enforcement stratagems as undercover investigation and informers.id.while in braver the district court placed the investigative techniques charge immediately before the entrapment charge,id.at,the district court placing this charge immediately after the entrapment charge was certainly within the court broad discretion in crafting jury instructions.russo,at.since the composition of jury instructions is not an exact science,many formulations may be adequate.united states smith,cir.a reasonable juror clearly would have understood from the placement and overall context of the jury instruction,as well as from the trial as a whole,that it was permissible for the government to use covert agents but that it was impermissible for the government to use covert agents to entrap brand.we reject brand suggestion that a reasonable jury could have interpreted the court instructions as precluding the possibility of entrapment.
brand final two objections involve the district court limiting instruction regarding the purpose of the child pornography evidence under rule b.the district court instructed the jury 
the government is offering evidence tending to show that on a different occasion the defendant matthew adam brand engaged in conduct similar to the charges in the indictment.
in that connection,let me remind you that the defendant is not on trial for committing this act not alleged in the indictment.accordingly,you may not consider this evidence of the similar acts as a substitute for proof that the defendant committed the crime charged,nor may you consider this evidence as proof that the defendant has a criminal personality or bad character.the evidence of other,similar act was admitted for a much more limited purpose,and you may consider it only for that limited purpose.
brand challenges the district court description of the government evidence as tending to show rather than offered to show.he asserts that the district court instruction erroneously suggested that the government evidence had already proven the facts in dispute.brand also challenges the district court use of the phrase similar acts rather than other or prior acts.he contends that the use of this phrase improperly presumed a similarity,which was contested,between the rule b evidence and the charged offenses.
both of brand arguments are without merit.as an initial matter,the challenged language in the district court limiting instruction was drawn almost verbatim from the model language of the sand federal limiting instruction that,as noted above,we have endorsed on several occasions.see united states la flam,cir united states livoti,cir.while brand contends that the sand limiting instruction should be tailored to the circumstances of each case,the district court rejection of the specific tailoring brand suggested was,once again,within the district court broad discretion in crafting jury instructions.russo,at.
specifically,brand challenge to the phrase tending to show is without merit because,in addition to being drawn from the sand federal charge,the phrase tending to show modifies the government act of offering evidence.thus,the district court use of the word tending describes and describes accurately the government argument regarding its purpose for introducing this evidence rather than the ultimate factual issue,which the district court charged to the jury.indeed,we have previously used the same phrase,tending to show,in describing rule b evidence that a district court had properly admitted.see united states warren,cir affirming the district court holding and concluding that evidence,tending to show acts similar to those charged in the indictment,was admissible to show intent to violate the law and to negate the defense of entrapment emphasis added.thus,the district court use of the phrase tending to show did not constitute reversible error.
similarly,brand challenge to the phrase similar acts also fails and does so for comparable reasons.the phrase similar acts is also drawn from the sand federal charge.in addition,it is highly unlikely that the jury would have utilized the reading of similar acts that brand suggests.indeed,throughout the trial,the district court allowed the parties to argue about the degree of similarity between the rule b evidence and the charged offenses.moreover,as discussed above,prior acts evidence admitted under rule b does not have to comprise precisely the same act at issue in the crimes charged if there is some connection between the reason for introducing the prior act and the nature of the crimes charged.thus,if anything,the district court limiting instruction and its jury instruction were more narrow than necessary.as a result,the district court use of the phrase similar acts rather than other or prior acts does not constitute reversible error.
conclusion 
we hold that brand entrapment defense can not succeed because the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the prosecution had established predisposition.we also hold that the district court did not err in admitting brand child pornography as prior acts evidence under rule b to show brand intent to commit the crimes charged and as predisposition evidence.we hold as well that there was more than sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that brand attempted to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of b.finally,we hold that the district court,in instructing the jury as to the entrapment defense and rule b,did not commit reversible error.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

the district court found that the images of child erotica and child pornography were admissible subject to an evidentiary hearing so that the court may determine the number of images to be admitted and how those images will be presented to the jury.brand,wl,at.on the next day,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing,and,on the following day,issued a supplemental memorandum order.see united states brand,wl,at.in the supplemental order,the district court addressed whether the government proposal to present each juror with a binder of sixteen images and to introduce,upon the jury request,a containing images,eighty of which involved child erotica and child pornography,was unduly cumulative.see id.after reviewing the government binder of sixteen images,the court held that the binder would be a fair and appropriate method for presenting this evidence to the jury because the number of images was not exceedingly large and the presentation of images would not burden or confuse the jury.id.at.however,the court rejected the government attempt to introduce the.id.the court found that the images on the are cumulative of the binder images that will be admitted and concluded that these additional images would only serve on the present record to confuse the jury and waste time,without any meaningful benefit.id.
