introduction 
mark ferguson ferguson sued respondents for violating california law by sending him unsolicited advertisements that were allegedly deceptive and misleading.the superior court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend with respect to each of ferguson causes of action.in reaching its decision,the lower court found that section of the business and professions code violates the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.
in the published portion of this decision,we hold that section does not violate the dormant commerce clause.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court erred by sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend as to each of ferguson causes of action except for the cause of action in which he purported to state a negligence claim.
ii.statement of facts 
a.the statute 
section regulates conduct by persons or entities doing business in california who transmit unsolicited advertising materials.section,which originally applied only to faxed documents,was amended in to extend to.
the statute defines unsolicited documents as any document or documents consisting of advertising material for the lease,sale,rental,gift offer,or other disposition of any realty,goods,services,or extension of credit when the documents a are addressed to recipients who do not have existing business or personal relationships with the initiator,and b were not sent at the request of or with the consent of the recipient,subd.e.
section requires that a person or entity conducting business in this state who causes an unsolicited document to be sent establish a telephone number or valid sender operated return address that recipients may use to notify the sender not to further unsolicited documents include as the first text in the document a statement informing the recipient of the number or return address that may be used to notify the sender not to any further unsolicited material not send any further unsolicited advertising material to anyone who has requested that such material not be sent and include in the subject line of each message adv as the first four characters or adv adlt if the advertisement pertains to adult material,subd.a g.
section applies to unsolicited documents that are delivered to a california resident via an electronic mail service provider service or equipment located in this state.electronic mail service provider is defined as any business or organization qualified to do business in this state that provides individuals,corporations,or other entities the ability to send or receive electronic mail through equipment located in this state and that is an intermediary in sending or receiving electronic mail,subd.d.
section states that the section,or any part of it,shall become inoperative when federal law is enacted that prohibits or otherwise regulates the transmission of unsolicited advertising by electronic mail,subd.i.although congress has considered several bills addressing this subject,federal law does not currently regulate the transmission of unsolicited advertising by electronic mail.
b.the complaint 
ferguson,a california resident,filed a complaint on october,which he amended on january,on behalf of himself and all other persons similarly situated,ferguson sued friendfinders,and conru interactive,two california businesses located in palo alto,andrew conru,a california resident,and doe defendants jointly,respondents.
ferguson alleged that respondents sent him and others unsolicited advertisements that did not comply with the requirement set forth in section.specifically,ferguson alleged that the subject lines of the email messages failed to begin with the characters adv the first line in the text of the messages failed to contain information about how recipients could have their email addresses removed from future advertising campaigns the email messages failed to provide a valid return email address to which plaintiffs could respond and the headers of the email messages were altered to mask the identity of the sender.
ferguson attempted to allege four distinct causes of action for which he sought general and special damages,injunctive relief,and attorneys fees.in his first cause of action for negligence,ferguson alleged that respondents violations of section and other california statutes constituted negligence per se.in his second cause of action,ferguson alleged respondents were liable for trespass for taking possession and control of plaintiffs computer processors,hard drives,random access memory and internet email accounts without plaintiffs consent by sending the unsolicited commercial advertising.
in his third cause of action,ferguson alleged respondents transmission of the unsolicited advertisements constituted an unfair business practice under california law because respondents were designed to deceive and mislead plaintiffs as to the origin of the transmission,were actually misleading and deceptive,and violated section.citing these same reasons,ferguson alleged a fourth cause of action for unlawful advertising practices.
proceedings in the lower court 
respondents filed their demurrer to the complaint on march.they argued that ferguson failed to state a cause of action for negligence,that sending unsolicited can not constitute a trespass as a matter of law,and that ferguson third and fourth causes of action for unfair business practices and unlawful advertising practices were flawed in several respects.among other things,respondents alleged that the relief sought with respect to ferguson third and fourth causes of action would constitute an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce.in this regard,respondents argued that the internet can not be regulated by individual states because it is a national infrastructure without territorial boundaries.
a hearing on respondents demurrer was held on march.at that hearing,the trial court indicated that ferguson had failed to state a cause of action for negligence because respondents conduct was intentional,and that ferguson could not prove that plaintiffs were actually damaged by the alleged trespass.the discussion as to the third and fourth causes of action was limited to the question whether section violates the dormant commerce clause of the federal constitution.after taking the matter under submission,obtaining additional briefing on this discrete issue,and holding a second hearing on may,the court issued an order on june.that order sustained respondents demurrer without leave to amend on the following ground california business and professions code section unconstitutionally subjects interstate use of the internet to inconsistent regulations,therefore violating the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.judgment was entered on july and this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
ferguson disputes the lower court conclusion that section is unconstitutional,as does the attorney general,who has filed an amicus curie brief in this court.ferguson also argues his entire complaint is viable without section.we begin our analysis by addressing the constitutional issue presented and will then consider the adequacy of ferguson pleading.
respondents did not establish that section is unconstitutional 
scope of review 
the trial court found that respondents sustained their burden of proving that section is unconstitutional on its face.a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.the challenger must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.ibid.
dormant commerce clause 
the commerce clause provides that congress shall have power t o regulate commerce among the several states,art.i,cl.t his affirmative grant of authority to congress also encompasses an implicit or dormant limitation on the authority of the states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.healy v.the beer institute,d,fn.healy.in other words,the dormant commerce clause precludes state regulation in certain areas even absent congressional action.cts dynamics of america,d.
a s the volume and complexity of commerce and regulation have grown in this country,the court has articulated a variety of tests in an attempt to describe the difference between those regulations that the commerce clause permits and those regulations that it prohibits.citation.cts dynamics of america,supra,at.supreme court authority establishes two primary lines of inquiry first,whether the ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce,citation,and second,whether the ordinance imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,citation.c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d c a carbone.
with respect to the first inquiry,regulations that discriminate against actors are subject to rigorous scrutiny.c a carbone,supra,at.see also cts dynamics of america,supra,at.the principal objects of dormant commerce clause scrutiny are statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce.discrimination against interstate commerce in favor of local business or investment is per se invalid,save in a narrow class of cases in which the municipality can demonstrate,under rigorous scrutiny,that it has no other means to advance a legitimate local interest.citation.c a carbone,supra,at.
this first level inquiry,which applies a strict scrutiny analysis,has been extended to state regulations that directly regulate interstate commerce.see,healy,supra,at.distillers new york state liquor authority,d see also myers,city and county of san francisco.state laws that regulate commerce occurring outside state borders have been found to offend the dormant commerce clause.ibid.
the second inquiry,which is employed to evaluate regulations that do not discriminate against interstate commerce or directly regulate it,is a balancing test which requires that a court uphold a state regulation that serves an important public interest unless the benefits of that regulation are outweighed by the burden imposed on interstate commerce.c a carbone,supra,at.pike bruce church,d.in the court own words,w here the statute regulates to effectuate a legitimate local public interest,and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental,it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.pike bruce church,supra,at.see also edgar mite,d people hsu th,d.
strict scrutiny analysis 
in the present case,respondents concede that section does not discriminate against actors.the statute applies equally to and actors who a do business in california and b transmit unsolicited commercial uce to a california resident,c via equipment located in california.
however,respondents contend that section directly regulates interstate commerce.citing healy,supra,d,they argue that,when section is viewed in the context of internet reality,the statute regulates beyond california borders and that its extraterritorial reach violates the dormant commerce clause.
in healy,the united states supreme court struck down provisions of a connecticut statute that required shippers of beer to affirm that their posted prices for products sold to connecticut wholesalers were no higher than the prices at which those products were sold in states bordering connecticut.the healy court found that connecticut price affirmation statute violated the dormant commerce clause because it discriminated against brewers and shippers of beer engaged in interstate commerce and it directly controlled commerce occurring wholly outside the state.healy,supra,d.
in support of the latter of these two holdings,the healy court identified several principles from prior cases concerning the extraterritorial effects of state economic regulations healy,supra,at.first,a state statute that directly regulates commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of the state violates the commerce clause.id.at.second,a state statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of the state also violates the commerce clause.third,to determine whether a statute impermissibly controls commerce outside the state,a court should evaluate the practical effect of the statute by considering the consequences of the statute itself and how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other states and what effect would arise if not one,but many or every,state adopted similar legislation.ibid.applying these principles,the healy court found that connecticut price affirmation statute violated the dormant commerce clause because it had the practical effect of controlling beer prices in other states.id.at.
section does not violate the principles discussed in healy because it does not directly regulate commerce occurring wholly outside the state.it expressly applies only when uce is sent to a california resident by means of an service provider who has equipment in the state.respondents contend,however,that the practical effect of section is to control commerce occurring wholly outside california because the geographic limitations set forth in section are ineffectual and,therefore,senders of uce who do business in california must always comply with section regardless of the actual residence of the uce recipient.respondents offer several theories to support their claim that section has an impermissible extraterritorial reach.
first,respondents argue that the geographic limitations on the scope of section are ineffectual because of the very nature of the internet.uce is transmitted via the internet which functions in cyberspace,a place respondents characterize as being wholly insensitive to geographic distinctions.american libraries association pataki,pataki.thus,respondents maintain,an address simply does not logically correspond to a geographic residence.
the problem with this argument is that section does not regulate the internet or internet use per se.it regulates individuals and entities that do business in california,utilize equipment located in california,and send uce to california residents.the equipment used by service providers does have a geographic location.and recipients are people or businesses that function in the real world and have a geographic residence.
respondents mistakenly rely on pataki,supra.in that case,the court found that a state law making it a crime to use a computer to disseminate obscene materials to a minor violated the dormant commerce clause.id.at.the court found that the law regulated conduct occurring wholly outside the state and that its burden on interstate commerce exceeded its local benefit.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the pataki court emphasized that the nature of the internet,particularly its insensitivity to geographic distinctions,makes it impossible to restrict the effects of the new york act to conduct occurring within new york.id.at.more generally,the court concluded that the internet is an area of commerce that must be marked off as a national preserve to protect users from inconsistent legislation that,taken to its most extreme,could paralyze development of the internet altogether.id.at.
initially,we join the other california courts that have addressed this issue by rejecting pataki holding that any state regulation of internet use violates the dormant commerce clause.see hatch superior court th,d penal code section,which makes it a crime to transmit harmful matter over the internet to a child,does not violate the commerce clause people hsu,supra,th at,d same.the internet is undeniably an incident of interstate commerce,but the fact that communication thereby can affect interstate commerce does not automatically cause a state statute in which internet use is an element to burden interstate commerce.people hsu,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
in any event,the pataki court conclusions about the extraterritorial effects of the new york law in that case do not apply to section.the statute at issue in pataki applied to all internet activity and the court comments about the absence of geographic sensitivity were made in that context.pataki,supra.at.as we have
