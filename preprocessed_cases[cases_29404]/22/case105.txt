background 
ca is in the business of designing and marketing computer software products.in july,ca chairman,charles wang,approached the chairman and chief executive officer of,jack berdy,to discuss the possibility of ca acquiring on line,which berdy founded in,was also in the software business.berdy owned million shares of stock,representing approximately of the company outstanding shares.berdy and wang,as well as sanjay kumar,the chief operating officer of ca,negotiated extensively over the price that ca would pay for stock.
negotiations over the terms of a agreement proceeded concurrently with negotiations over the purchase price.ca insisted that berdy and other executives,who would be leaving the company following the acquisition,agree not to compete with ca for a specified period of time,but berdy initially resisted entering into a agreement.at one point in the negotiations,ca offered to purchase stock which was then trading at approximately per share on the new york stock exchange the nyse for per share and to pay berdy million for a agreement.board of directors felt that ca offer of per share was too low and that the million offered to berdy for his agreement not to compete was too high.the board sought per share,and the negotiations continued.negotiations stalled when ca offered per share and insisted on.ca and ultimately agreed that ca would offer to purchase stock for per share,and that ca would pay berdy million for a agreement.the central issue in this litigation is whether the million was compensation for berdy agreement or unlawful additional compensation for his stock.
on august and,there was an unusually large amount of trading in stock.on august,the stock price rose,and the nyse asked about the unusual trading activity.on the morning of august,when the stock price rose another dollar,told the nyse that it was in discussions with ca and that a press release might be issued shortly.berdy told ca that was under pressure from the nyse to issue a press release.around noon on august,on line and ca reached their agreement at per share,told the nyse that it would issue a press release,and trading in stock was halted.later that day,each company issued a press release announcing that it had reached an agreement with the other.ca press release stated in relevant part that ca 
has reached an agreement in principle with the management of whereby ca will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of for per share in cash.the transaction is subject to the approval of the boards of directors of and ca,the execution of definitive agreements and regulatory approval.
press release was very similar to ca,except it also noted that no assurance can be given that a transaction between and computer associates of any sort will occur.
after issuing their august press releases,ca and continued to negotiate the terms and conditions of their agreement.they agreed that the transaction would take the form of a tender offer and a merger.on august,ca board of directors approved a merger agreement,a stock purchase and non competition agreement the berdy agreement,and several related agreements.the ca board also authorized the requisite securities and exchange commission sec filings and the dissemination to shareholders of an offer to purchase.on august,board unanimously approved the merger agreement,recommended the transaction to shareholders,and authorized the necessary filings with the sec.
pursuant to the berdy agreement,which was executed by ca,lwb,and berdy,lwb purchased berdy stock for per share,the same price that ca offered to all other shareholders.the berdy agreement also provided that he could not tender his shares in the tender offer,and that,if another bidder made a better offer,lwb retained an option to purchase berdy shares for per share.the berdy agreement contained a provision prohibiting him from engag ing in any business activities which are competitive with the computer software business activities of ca,lwb,or for a period of five years,in consideration for which ca agreed to pay berdy million.berdy,who in addition to being chairman had been a medical student since,was not restricted from engag ing in the design,development,marketing,licensing or sale of computer software designed for use in the medical industry,in the biological sciences or as a teaching aid for educational purposes.gerber argues that,because berdy was disengaging from the business to pursue his medical studies,ca was not genuinely concerned about the possibility of his competing and that the million payment to part of actually additional compensation to ensure that ca acquired berdy large block of shares.ca,on the other hand,insists that it genuinely feared potential competition from berdy and that the entire million was consideration for berdy agreement not to compete.
on august,ca and executed the merger agreement,obligating ca to commence the tender offer as promptly as practicable,and ca,lwb,and berdy executed the berdy agreement.on august,ca and issued a joint press release announcing that the two companies had entered into an agreement and that ca will make a tender offer today and conduct a merger.the same day,august,ca filed with the sec and disseminated to shareholders the offer to purchase,offering to purchase all shares of stock not owned by berdy for per share.the offer to purchase stated that it would remain open until september.a majority of shareholders tendered their shares to ca,and ca and lwb completed the acquisition of with the merger.
gerber is an shareholder who tendered his stock in response to ca tender offer.he brought this action individually and on behalf of a class of shareholders excluding the defendants,their directors,certain employees,and their immediate families who tendered stock to ca in the tender offer.the complaint alleged that several defendants including ca,wang,kumar,and berdy had violated section d of the securities exchange act of,d,and sec rule,collectively,the williams act claims,as well as various other provisions of the federal securities laws,by offering and paying more consideration to berdy for his shares than it offered or paid to other shareholders 
the gravamen of gerber williams act claims is that the million that ca paid to berdy,while nominally consideration for berdy agreement,was actually additional consideration for berdy stock.the defendants moved to dismiss the williams act claims,arguing that the tender offer did not begin until august,and that the berdy agreement,which was executed on august,preceded the tender offer.the district court denied the motion,concluding as a matter of law that the tender offer commenced on august,when ca issued its first press release.gerber computer assocs.int l.the court subsequently certified a class under.b consisting of all persons who tendered stock of pursuant to the tender offer announced by computer associates on august.gerber computer assocs.int l,cv sj,wl,at.following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in part but,finding genuine issues of material fact,the court denied the motion with respect to the williams act claims.
the case went to trial before judge wolle.in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of berdy agreement,ca sought to introduce evidence of other transactions in which it had entered into agreements.finding that this evidence would waste time and confuse the jury,the district court excluded it.at the close of trial,the district court instructed the jury,without objection,to consider whether the payment of million dollars under the berdy agreement was paid to berdy for his shares,or his agreement not to compete,or partly for the shares and partly for the agreement not to compete.trial transcript tr.at.the jury returned a special verdict in favor of the plaintiff class,finding that million of the million that ca had paid to berdy was compensation for berdy shares,while the remainder was legitimate consideration for the agreement.judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff class in the amount of.the district court awarded the plaintiff class prejudgment interest of.ca moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial,and the district court denied the motion.ca and lwb appealed.
discussion 
ca and lwb make three arguments on appeal.first,they argue that gerber williams act claims are insufficient as a matter of law because the berdy agreement was not executed during the tender offer and because the million was not paid to berdy during the tender offer.second,they argue that the district court erred in excluding the evidence of other ca transactions involving payments.third,they argue that the district court erred in permitting the jury to find that part of the million that ca paid to berdy was compensation for the agreement and part was additional consideration for berdy shares.we address each of these arguments in turn.
sufficiency of williams act claims 
defendants challenge the legal sufficiency of gerber williams act claims.section d provides 
where any person varies the terms of a tender offer or request or invitation for tenders before the expiration thereof by increasing the consideration offered to holders of such securities,such person shall pay the increased consideration to each security holder whose securities are taken up and paid for pursuant to the tender offer or request or invitation for tenders whether or not such securities have been taken up by such person before the variation of the tender offer or request or invitation.
d.rule provides in relevant part 
a no bidder shall make a tender offer unless 
the tender offer is open to all security holders of the class of securities subject to the tender offer and 
the consideration paid to any security holder pursuant to the tender offer is the highest consideration paid to any other security holder during such tender offer.
section d and rule collectively are commonly referred to as the all price rule.see field trump,cir michael ebert,during the tender offer or some other time near it insider transactions under the all price rule,vill.rule a codifies the all holders requirement,and rule a codifies the best price rule.field,at.
whether the berdy agreement was executed during the tender offer 
defendants arguments regarding the legal sufficiency of the williams act claims focus primarily on timing.first,defendants argue that ca million payment to berdy could not have violated the best price rule because the berdy agreement was executed prior to the commencement of ca tender offer,and the best price rule is not triggered until a tender offer has begun.according to defendants,the tender offer did not begin until august,when ca disseminated the offer to purchase and issued a joint press release with explicitly announcing a tender offer.gerber argues that the best price rule was triggered on august,when ca and on line issued press releases announcing that they had reached an agreement in principle.if defendants are correct,and the tender offer did not commence until august,then the berdy agreement preceded the tender offer and is not subject to the best price rule.if gerber is correct,and the tender offer commenced on august,then the berdy agreement was executed during the tender offer and must satisfy the best price rule.
in order to determine when the tender offer commenced,we turn to sec rule.in,rule b provided 
a public announcement by a bidder through a press release,newspaper advertisement or public statement which includes the information in paragraph c of this section with respect to a tender offer in which the consideration consists solely of cash securities exempt from registration under section of the securities act of shall be deemed to constitute the commencement of a tender offer 
b.rule c provided 
the information referred to in paragraph b of this section is as follows 
the identity of the bidder 
the identity of the subject company and 
the amount and class of securities being sought and the price or range of prices being offered therefor.
c.under rule b,if ca august press release include d the information in rule c,then the august press release shall be deemed to constitute the commencement of the tender offer.ca august press release states 
computer associates international,ca announced today that it has reached an agreement in principle with the management of software international,whereby ca will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of for per share in cash.the transaction is subject to the approval of the boards of directors of and ca,the execution of definitive agreements and regulatory approval.
this press release includes all the information listed in rule c it identifies ca as the bidder it identifies as the subject company and it identifies all outstanding common stock as the amount and class of securities being sought,and per share in cash as the offer price.ca nonetheless contends that its august press release should not be deemed to have commenced a tender offer because the press release was not made with respect to a tender offer,because the press release states that the transaction is subject to future conditions,and because ca issued the press release to fulfill certain disclosure obligations.for the reasons discussed below,we reject each of these contentions.
in arguing that its august press release was not made with respect to a tender offer,ca confuses the test for whether a tender offer has occurred with the test for when a tender offer commences.ca argues that,under the totality of the circumstances test of hanson trust plc scm,cir,and the test of wellman dickinson,the tender offer began on august,not august,because those tests were not satisfied until august.as the district court correctly found,however,hanson and wellman both involve the issue of whether a tender offer has occurred,not when a tender offer starts,and the parties here do not dispute that a tender offer occurred.gerber.at.rather,the only question is when the tender offer commenced,a question which is answered by rule c,not by hanson or wellman.see lerro quaker oats,cir noting that our case is about when rather than what.for the same reason,ca reliance on weeden continental health affiliates,is misplaced.the court in weeden concluded that,although the defendant press release included all the information listed in rule c,the press release had not been made with respect to a tender offer,and therefore did not commence a tender offer,because no tender offer ever occurred.weeden.at.here,however,it is undisputed that a tender offer occurred,and ca august press release announced a transaction that undisputedly was a tender offer.thus,we have no trouble concluding that ca august,press release was made with respect to a tender offer.
ca also argues that its august press release was not made with respect to a tender offer because the press release does not contain the words tender offer.while the august press release does not contain the words tender offer,rule c imposes no such requirement.because the entire purpose of that rule is to prescribe the information that a public announcement must
