in this anti slapp case,the trial court determined plaintiff complaint,which alleges a single defamation cause of action,arises from defendant exercise of her constitutional right of free speech and that plaintiff failed to establish a probability he would prevail on those claims.we agree with the trial court that plaintiff claims arise from the exercise of defendant right of free speech.we also agree that plaintiff failed to establish a probability of success on the merits of his defamation claim.thus,the trial court did not err in granting defendant motion to strike plaintiff complaint.
factual and procedural background 
the indicates plaintiff and appellant darren chaker had a brief romantic relationship with nicole mateo nicole,who resides in texas.during the relationship,nicole became pregnant and delivered chaker child.the record also indicates that following the birth of the child,chaker and nicole engaged in a contentious paternity and child support dispute in the texas courts.
in a series of derogatory statements about chaker,and his forensics business,appeared on an internet web site where members of the public may comment on the reliability and honesty of various providers of goods and services and on another social networking web site which provided an open forum for members of the public to comment on a variety of subjects.the following are statements which refer to chaker and appeared on one of the sites you should be scared.this guy is a criminal and a deadbeat dad.as you can see,i am the child grandma so i know.if you should eve sic come across this person,be very careful.he may be taking steroids so who knows what could happen.i would be very careful dealing with this guy.he uses people,is into illegal activities.i would let him into my house if i wanted to keep my possessions or my sanity.chaker attributes both of these statements,as well as others which accuse him of fraud,deceit and picking up street walkers and homeless drug addicts,to defendant and respondent wendy mateo wendy,nicole mother and the grandmother of his child.the internet web sites contained other derogatory statements apparently posted by other defendants,including nicole.
on june,chaker filed a complaint against wendy and nicole,among others.as we indicated,chaker complaint alleges a single cause for defamation based on the statements which appeared on the internet web sites.
wendy appeared in the action and moved to strike the complaint under the anti slapp law.code civ.among other matters,wendy argued that chaker has been previously determined to be a vexatious litigant.wendy also submitted excerpts from a number of web sites on which wendy asserted chaker had made derogatory statements about nicole and nicole attorney.the trial court granted her motion and,as to her,struck the complaint.chaker filed a timely notice of appeal.
s ection requires the trial court to undertake a process in determining whether to grant a slapp motion.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold prima facie showing that the defendant acts,of which the plaintiff complains,were ones taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citation.
if the court finds the defendant has made the requisite showing,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim by making a prima facie showing of facts that would,if proved,support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.citation.the court also considers the defendant opposing evidence,but only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff showing as a matter of law.citation.that is,the court does not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.citations.finally,in assessing the probability the plaintiff will prevail,the court considers only the evidence that would be admissible at trial.citations.
whether section applies,and whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing,are both questions we review independently on appeal.citation.kashian harriman,supra,th at,d.
initially,chaker claims that because wendy allegedly posted her statements on internet web sites and they were about matters which concerned his dispute with her daughter,they were not statements which implicated her right of free speech.like the trial court,we reject this contention.
the leading case with respect to internet postings on consumer oriented web sites,such as the ones where wendy allegedly posted her statements,is wilbanks wolk th,d wilbanks.in wilbanks the plaintiff was an insurance broker who specialized in viaticals,an arrangement by which a viatical firm purchases life insurance policies from individuals who are near death.the defendant in wilbanks,wolk,was a former insurance agent who,acting as a consumer watchdog,established her own web site which provided the public information about viaticals and the insurance brokers who provide them.wolk posted a statement highly critical of the plaintiff business practices and reported the plaintiff was under investigation by the california department of insurance.on appeal from an order striking the plaintiff defamation complaint,the court found that the web site statements were made in a public forum and were of public interest.
in finding that the internet was a public forum,the court stated in our view,whether a statement is made in a place open to the public or in a public forum depends on whether the means of communicating the statement permits open debate.we agree that wolk web site and most newspapers are not public forums in and of themselves.it does not follow,however,that statements made on a web site or in a newspaper are not made in a public forum.where the newspaper is but one source of information on an issue,and other sources are easily accessible to interested persons,the newspaper is but one source of information in a larger public forum.
in a sense,the web,as a whole,can be analogized to a public bulletin board.a public bulletin board does not lose its character as a public forum simply because each statement posted there expresses only the views of the person writing that statement.it is public because it posts statements that can be read by anyone who is interested,and because others who choose to do so,can post a message through the same medium that interested persons can read.here,while wolk controls her web site,she does not control the web.others can create their own web sites or publish letters or articles through the same medium,making their information and beliefs accessible to anyone interested in the topics discussed in wolk web site.
we conclude,therefore,that wolk statements were made in a public forum.wilbanks,supra,th at,d.
in finding wolk statements were in the public interest,the court stated that the information provided here is in the nature of consumer protection information distinguishes this case from others recognizing that a publication does not become connected with an issue in the public interest simply because it is widely disseminated,or because it can be used as an example of bad practices or of how to combat bad practices.the statements made by wolk were not simply a report of one broker business practices,of interest only to that broker and to those who had been affected by those practices.wolk statements were a warning not to use plaintiffs services.in the context of information ostensibly provided to aid consumers choosing among brokers,the statements,therefore,were directly connected to an issue of public concern.wilbanks,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
more recently,cases which have considered the public interest requirement of the anti slapp law have emphasized that the public interest may extend to statements about conduct between private individuals.see hecimovich encinal school parent teacher organization th,d hecimovich terry davis community church th,d terry.in finding a public interest within the meaning of the statute in statements criticizing a volunteer basketball coach treatment of his players,the court in hecimovich noted like the slapp statute itself,the question whether something is an issue of public inte
