question certified 
pursuant to rule a of the california rules of court,we respectfully request the california supreme court to exercise its discretion to adjudicate a question of california law related to internet domain names and the tort of conversion.this particular case centers on the domain name.the decisions of the california appellate courts provide no controlling precedent regarding the certified question,the answer to which may be determinative of this appeal.we respectfully request that the california supreme court answer the certified question presented below.we acknowledge that your court may decide to reformulate the question,and our phrasing of the issue is not intended to restrict your court consideration of the case.we agree to follow the answer provided by the california supreme court.
we invoke the certification process only after careful consideration and do not do so lightly.the certification procedure is reserved for state law questions that present significant issues,including those with important public policy ramifications,and that have not yet been resolved by the state courts.we request certification not because a difficult legal issue is presented but because of deference to the state court on significant state law matters we have noted,in reference to arizonans for official english arizona,d,that we have an obligation to consider whether novel questions should be we have been admonished in the past for failing to do so.parents involved in community schools seattle school district,cir certifying question despite parties unanimous request not to certify oral arguments heard on certified question in washington state supreme court on october.
although we are quite capable of resolving the issue presented,we should not reach out to grab the question in the first instance simply because the case involves a novel and sexy issue.we are not,of course,unmindful of the burgeoning caseload of the california supreme court,and we recognize that the decision to accept certification lies solely within the discretion of your court.but it is not our role to pass advance judgment on the court priorities.we would not presume to certify a mill case to your court nor would we use the certification process to sidestep our diversity jurisdiction.in a case such as this one that raises a new and substantial issue of state law in an arena that will have broad application,the spirit of comity and federalism cause us to seek certification.we accordingly invoke this procedure under the california rules of court.
the question of law to be answered is 
is an internet domain name within the scope of property subject to the tort of conversion 
a for the tort of conversion to apply to intangible property,is it necessary that the intangible property be merged with a document or other tangible medium 
b if the answer to question a is yes,does the tort of conversion apply to an internet domain name,or,more specifically,is an internet domain name merged with a document or other tangible medium 
statement of facts 
this action stems from gary kremen kremen suit against network solutions,nsi for the fraudulent transfer of his internet domain name,to a third party.
a short background regarding the internet will assist in putting this case in context.the internet has been described as a vast system of interconnected computers and computer networks.see,network solutions,cir.each computer that is connected to the internet has a unique internet protocol ip number that functions as a kind of internet address.id.an ip number consists of four sets of numbers separated by periods.id.at.early internet innovators created the domain name system dns,a system designed to relate easily remembered domain names with ip numbers.domain names are comprised of alphanumeric fields separated by,where the field farthest to the right.gov in the example is the top level domain tld.id.at.the field second from the tld is the second level domain and the field third from the tld is the third level domain.id.
under a cooperative agreement entered into with the national science foundation nsf on january,nsi became the exclusive registrar for various tlds,including.by accepting the role of registrar,nsi took primary responsibility for ensuring the quality,timeliness and effective management of the registration services provided under the agreement.the agreement expired in september,thereafter other entities have shared the role of domain name registrar.from april until september,nsi provided its registration service to the public at no cost.during this period,nsf paid nsi a fixed fee and costs for registering domain names.
under its agreement with nsf,nsi undertook responsibility to compile and maintain an authoritative,reliable,and database of registered domain names in addition to the conversion tables that index registered domain names to ip numbers.
on may,kremen registered the domain name with nsi.kremen did so by filling out and electronically submitting a short registration form.no payment was necessary in order to effect the registration.kremen registered under his online classifieds,oci and listed himself as the administrative and technical contact person.kremen did not use the domain name for any significant purpose during the months that it was registered to oci.
in october,nsi received a letter on oci letterhead and putatively signed by oci president.the letter was addressed to stephen cohen cohen and purportedly authorized him to notify nsi on oci behalf that nsi should delete the domain name from its database,thereby terminating oci registration.the letter further stated that oci had no objection to cohen registering in his own name.
upon receipt of the letter,nsi deleted oci registration of and it to sporting houses management,one of cohen alter ego corporations,with cohen listed as the administrative contact.cohen proceeded to use the domain name as a platform upon which to build a lucrative pornography business.as it turned out,the authorization letter was a forgery concocted by cohen or at his behest.nsi claims that there was no evidence to question the authenticity of the letter,although cohen disputes that characterization.
approximately eight months after nsi registered in cohen name,kremen demanded that nsi reinstate his registration of.nsi informed him that it would not do so absent a court order.in october,kremen brought suit against cohen and nsi seeking injunctive relief and damages.kremen alleged,among other things,that by honoring cohen fraudulent instruction to transfer the registration,nsi was liable in tort for conversion and as a bailee.kremen also brought other state law claims that are not at issue in this certification request.
judge ware,of the district court for the northern district of california,granted summary judgment in favor of nsi,concluding that there was no evidence establishing that a domain name,including,is merged in or identified with a document or other tangible object thus,under the traditional precepts governing the tort of conversion,a domain name is not protected intangible property.in the district court view,extending the tort of conversion to include internet domain names involves a complex policy question that is more appropriately the subject of legislation.the district court also expressed concern that because the tort is one of strict liability,extending the tort to include domain names would essentially scrap any requirement of tangibility consistently associated with the tort,and,in its view,there are methods better suited to regulate the vagaries of domain names.the court rejected the bailment claim on the basis that nsi mere registration of names does not convert its function to a bailee.
on kremen claims against cohen regarding the transfer letter and the appropriated domain name,the district court found that the purported transfer letter was a forgery and that the transfer of the domain name was void and a nullity.the court restored registration of to kremen,and rendered a judgment in favor of kremen for million,a judgment that kremen has had very limited success in enforcing due to cohen fugitive status.
on appeal to our court,kremen argued,among other claims,that the district court erred in concluding that no cause of action for conversion or bailment exists against nsi for its unauthorized registration of to cohen.consideration of kremen claims against nsi are stayed pending this certification request.we resolved the remaining claims between kremen and cohen and related entities in an unpublished memorandum disposition in which we affirmed the district court judgment in favor of kremen.kremen cohen.cir.neither cohen nor any of his related entities are parties to the remaining proceedings,including this certification request.
statement of reasons for certification 
we respectfully request that the california supreme court provide an authoritative answer to the certified question for the following reasons 
the certified question presents an issue of significant precedential and public policy importance.although both california state courts and the federal courts have broadly considered conversion in connection with intellectual property,such as trade secrets,neither has specifically considered the state law tort of conversion in the context of an internet domain name.with the growing ubiquity and importance of the internet and the number of domain names increasing are now some million domain names clarity in the application of california state law to domain names presents an important question for resolution.the scope of state law claims relating to domain names extends not only to the relationship between a domain name holder and a domain registrar,but also to the relationship between domain name holders and other third parties.your court has counseled that courts should be cautious in imposing new tort duties where novel legal claims implicate serious public policy considerations.moore v.the regents of the of,cal d,noting,in holding that patient did not hold ownership interest in cells after they left his body,that the novelty of moore claim demands express consideration of the policies to be served by extending liability rather than blind deference to a complaint alleging as a legal conclusion the existence of a cause of action citations omitted.we believe that regulation of the internet under state law presents such considerations,and consequently that this issue should be addressed in the first instance by your court.
following is a discussion of the background regarding the tort of conversion,as well as a summary of the parties arguments and the relevant case law with respect to the application of conversion to internet domain names.appropriately,this recitation does not take the form of an advocacy memorandum.instead,our role as the requesting court is to provide the california supreme court with the relevant legal landscape.we reference only california cases because california law is at issue although we acknowledge that reasonable arguments exist on both sides of the issue,we do not advocate for a particular resolution to the question presented.
the parties do not dispute that domain names are a kind of property.this proposition appears to be consistent with california broad definition of property.see cal.property includes all inanimate things which are capable of appropriation or of manual delivery.the parties disagree,however,whether a domain name like is the kind of intangible property that can support a claim for conversion.at issue is whether such intangible property constitutes a sufficiently definite right and whether such intangible property must also be merged into a document or other writing.
historically,the tort of conversion exclusively protected rights in tangible property.at least one commentator has called the tangibility requirement a hoary limitation without valid and essential reason.val ricks,the conversion of intangible property bursting the ancient trover bottle with new wine,byu,quoting prosser and keeton on the law of torts page keeton,ed.california courts have,however,long extended the tort to certain forms of intangible property such as stocks,bonds,notes,recorded performances,and warehouse receipts.see,a m records,heilman,d.recorded performances ralston v.the bank of california,cal,stock and dividends payne elliot,cal,wl stock see also witkin summary cal.law ed.torts.
kremen analogizes the domain name to a stock interest or warehouse receipt,thus putting the domain name firmly within the scope of property covered by the tort of conversion.nsi argues that the domain name,as a reference point in a computer database,does not rise to the level of a definite or certain property right.
in payne,your court stated that the tort no longer exists as it did at common law,but has been developed into a remedy for the conversion of every species of personal property.cal.at.the question then arises as to the scope of coverage for intangible property.years after payne,the california court of appeals stated that the language in payne was too broad a statement as to the application of conversion.olschewski hudson,concluding that conversion exists only for property which is specific enough to be identified,and not to such indefinite,intangible and uncertain property rights as the mere goodwill of a business,or trade secrets.the fact that payne has stood the test of time provides little comfort in this situation as the case does not answer the question at,the application of payne to an internet domain name that is categorized as intangible property.this area would thus greatly benefit from certification by your court.
question a 
an analysis of the scope of intangible rights requires answering whether the rights must be reflected in some documentary form.
the restatement of torts provides that 
where there is conversion of a document in which intangible rights are merged,the damages include the value of such rights.
one who effectively prevents the exercise of intangible rights of the kind customarily merged in a document is subject to a liability similar to that for conversion,even though the document is not itself converted.
restatement second of torts.at least one california court of appeal has favorably viewed the restatement approach.in,bezenek,th,d,the court suggested that tangible and intangible property may be treated differently for purposes of conversion the application of the language in is unclear,however,because the court decided not to answer the question of w hether an intangible computer access code,which was never reduced to paper or reflected on a computer disk could be the subject of conversion.id.at,d.
two california court of appeals cases touch on the subject of documentary merger in connection with customer lists but do not address the issue presented in this certification.see palm quinta dev.kieberk,d,concluding that destroying tangible personal property consisting of a cabinet of lead cards containing the names and valuable information regarding prospective and actual customers was conversion olschewski.at,finding no cause of action in conversion for the unlawful interference with a laundry route,or any similar property because there is nothing definite or tangible in the character of the ordinary list of laundry customers.
thus,there do not appear to be any california cases squarely addressing whether the merged with requirement is a part of california law,nor have we been able to locate any cases from your court indicating whether california follows the restatement approach.
question b 
if your court determines that,for purposes of conversion,intangible property must be merged with or reflected in a document or something tangible,we will then have to address a secondary question whether the tort of conversion applies to an internet domain name.
california courts have recognized a cause of action for intangible goods that have been merged with various kinds of tangible media.see,th at,d trade secrets on a floppy disk a m records,d at.recordings payne,cal.at stock certificates.nonetheless,we have been unable to locate any cases addressing whether a domain name is sufficiently merged with tangible media to give rise to a claim for conversion.although the parties briefs detail the intricacies of the dns database and competing arguments as to the appropriate portion or registry at issue,we do not take any position at this juncture.the positions of the parties serve to juxtapose the argument on both sides.
according to kremen,a domain name is a unique functional object that serves to access the corresponding ip address.kremen argues that a domain name is merged with and identified with a document,namely the dns database or a portion thereof.the dns database is described as a decentralized but hierarchical database that correlates a domain name with the appropriate ip address.america online,huang,d.kremen characterizes the database as akin to a sophisticated compilation of several documents,albeit in electronic form.kremen likens the embodiment of the domain name in the database to the right to possess property which is embodied by a warehouse receipt.
nsi counters that the dns database is not like a warehouse receipt.relying principally on the description in america online,nsi notes that although the dns matches domain names with ip numbers,this simple description incorrectly suggests that the dns is a central database to which other computers may refer,when the dns is instead a decentralized,albeit hierarchal,process for correlating a domain name with the appropriate ip address.d at.nsi instead likens a domain name to a phone number or address,not the type of property subject to conversion.see lockheed martin network solutions,cir characterizing nsi registration and routing services as service rather than product.nsi relies on the fact that there is no master directory of domain names and ip addresses to which a computer refers instead,the domain database is distributed across the internet,on a multitude of name servers,each responsible for correlating the ip addresses and domain names of computers with its particular zone of the domain name space.d at.nsi argues that the dns,which consists of multiple servers distributed around the globe,does not qualify as the type of document necessary for embodiment.
again,our development of tort law on this novel issue would benefit from your court elucidation of the proper treatment of domain names under california tort law.we advance no legal position on the competing arguments but simply offer a neutral characterization of the competing positions.the dissent discussion of the details of the.com registry and internet architecture provides a useful backdrop but only serves to highlight the merits of the question and goes beyond the judicial dialogue central to the certification process.
the clerk of this court shall forward a copy of this order,under official seal,to the california supreme court,along with copies of all briefs and excerpts of record that have been filed with this court.the parties shall notify the clerk of this court within days of any decision by the california supreme court to accept or to decline certification.if the california supreme court accepts certification,the parties shall file a joint report six months after the date of acceptance and every six months thereafter advising us of the status of the proceedings.the parties shall notify the clerk of this court within days of the issuance of an opinion by the california supreme court.
it is so ordered.
when a federal court certifies a case to a state supreme court,it draws from a limited reservoir of comity.certifying the case shifts the difficult work of deciding it to the state court,which is often so busy keeping its own house in order that it scarcely has time for our overflow laundry.certification also burdens litigants,forcing them to reargue the case in a different process that is costly and full of delay.none of the parties or amici in our case has so much as hinted that we should certify kremen explicitly urged us not to,citing the many years already spent in litigation.
i am aware of the prevailing infatuation with this procedural sacred cow in our modern judicial barnyard.bruce selya,certified madness ask a silly question,suffolk.but we have a duty to use it sparingly and sensibly that a case raises difficult legal questions is not enough.see cohen dun bradstreet,cabranes.certification is justified only when the state supreme court has provided no authoritative guidance,other courts are in serious disarray and the question cries out for a definitive ruling.
these circumstances are not present here.we are perfectly capable of answering both questions ourselves,and there is no indication that courts are overrun with lawsuits raising the issue.cyberspace will not implode if the supreme court confronts the majority questions at some point in the future rather than today the issues may well be sharpened by common law development in the meantime 
the certified questions 
by long common law tradition,those who give away the property of others do so at their peril this case is not about regulation of the internet under state law,as the majority believes,see order at.it about general principles of tort law that happen to apply to the internet because that the type of property that nsi gave away.kremen asks only that we afford him the same remedial rights that california law gives other property holders 
the majority poses two questions.they are of middling difficulty at best neither merits certification.the california supreme court long ago answered the first in kremen favor that precedent alone resolves the dispute before us.the answer to the second we do even need to equally obvious.
conversion of intangibles 
the majority first question is whether,f or the tort of conversion to apply to intangible property,it is necessary that the intangible property be merged with a document or other tangible medium.order at.the quaintness of the question,couched in language more reminiscent of postillions than pop servers,gives a pretty good clue that the majority is disinterring legal arcana long since laid to rest.conversion originated in the fifteenth century as a remedy against one who found a plaintiff lost goods and put them to his own use.see prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at page keeton,ed ames,the history of trover,harv.because of this pedigree,the tort became encrusted with legal rules that assumed that the property taken was tangible the sort of thing that one could find in a field and later sell at a market.val ricks,the conversion of intangible property bursting the ancient trover bottle with new wine.this limitation was harmless enough when people worldly goods consisted of livestock and farm tools,but today it a relic.
our first question,then,is whether california still clings to the dated distinction between tangibles and intangibles.some states do,albeit with significant ad hoc exceptions to accommodate commercial reality.the restatement extends conversion only to intangible rights merged in a document.restatement second of torts see also cases cited in ricks,supra,at.many courts,however,have rejected this distinction altogether and extend conversion to intangibles without regard to the restatement test 
the california supreme court made quick work of the question more than a century ago in payne elliot,cal,wl,and has not seen fit to revisit it.defendants in payne were trustees accused of appropriating plaintiff securities.they argued for dismissal on the ground that plaintiff had alleged only conversion of the shares,not conversion of the share certificates.the court rejected the argument t he action no longer exists as it did at common law,but has been developed into a remedy for the conversion of every species of personal property.id.at emphasis added.one can almost hear justice mckee chortle at counsel hapless argument as he elegantly disposes of this common law anachronism.
the majority today quotes this passage from payne and ventures that t he question then arises as to the scope of coverage for intangible property.order at.i would have thought this was precisely the question that payne answered,and that its response was every species.personal property,after all,is a ny movable or intangible thing that is subject to ownership and not classified as real property.black law dictionary ed emphasis added,we all agree,is property subject to,kremen.and,obviously,it not real estate payne therefore squarely controls.
courts applying california law have followed in payne tracks,recognizing conversion of intangible property without inquiring whether it was merged in a document.a m records,heilman,d,applied conversion to a defendant who sold unauthorized recordings,holding broadly that such misappropriation and sale of the intangible property of another without authority from the owner is conversion.id.at.in rasmussen associates,kalitta flying service,cir,we relied on a m records and held that unauthorized use of someone else regulatory approval is without asking whether the right in question was merged in a document.id.at.in fmc capital,cir,the seventh circuit,applying california law,explicitly rejected the distinction.id.at.it quoted with approval prosser and keeton observation that there is perhaps no very valid and essential reason why there might not be conversion of intangible property.id.at quoting prosser and keeton on the law of torts,supra,at.
most telling,however,is our own recent decision in bancroft masters,augusta national,cir.not only did we recognize conversion of intangibles we recognized conversion of the very intangible at issue domain name.a majority of the panel held that conversion of a domain name is tortious conduct under california law.id.at sneed trott,concurring.and,yet again,we made no reference to any requirement that the property be merged in a document.if this is an issue worth pestering the california supreme court about today,why did we certify it two years ago nothing has changed in california conversion law since then.
as the majority notes,payne has not been universally followed.in olschewski hudson,california intermediate appellate court declared with remarkable audacity that payne did really mean what it said that the every species very ratio decidendi of the too broad a statement as to the application of the doctrine of conversion.id.at.it adopted instead the rationale that stock is subject to conversion only because it is represented by tangible documents.id.another case,adkins model laundry,followed olschewski on similar facts.
if olschewski and adkins had pointed to intervening cases where the california supreme court had retreated from payne,they might give us pause.but they did nothing of the sort they simply refused to apply controlling precedent by incorrectly labeling it dicta.we are bound by the pronouncement of the state highest court unless there are convincing reasons to believe that it would no longer adhere to its earlier rationale.olschewski and the majority in our nothing to suggest it would not.certification is inappropriate when the supreme court of a state has already ruled and its decision is unambiguous.united states pend oreille pub.util.dist,cir see also estate of madsen comm r,cir norris,dissenting from certification order.
searching for another reason to doubt payne meant what it said,the majority invokes the restatement.our order implies that,unless a state explicitly disclaims the restatement rules,we assume that any deviations from that canonical text must have been an oversight.poor justice brandeis,whose fifty state laboratories have been amalgamated into a single research park run by the american law institute 
the majority identifies no convincing reason to believe that the california supreme court would overrule payne.speculation that a state supreme court might revisit a precedent and mail its tort jurisprudence back to the dark ages is not a ground for certification.if it were,we would certify nearly every diversity case we hear.
ii.the merged in a document test 
none of this matters anyhow,because kremen wins even under the restatement.the majority analysis on this point is lacking.it cites a handful of state decisions,observes that none involves a domain name and proclaims our interpretive faculties exhausted.this is not a frugal use of the privilege the california supreme court affords us.certification is for resolving true uncertainties in state law it presupposes that we made a diligent effort to apply the traditional judicial tools of analogical reasoning.
kremen can sue for conversion under the restatement because his domain name is in fact merged in a document,and nsi frustrated his use of it.see restatement second of torts one who effectively prevents the exercise of intangible rights of the kind customarily merged in a document is subject to liability.his intangible property is among other things the right to have people who type into their web browsers sent to his website.it is,in standard geek,the right to have the.com domain sex associated with his ip address in nsi.com registry the majority does dispute,nor could it,that nsi prevented kremen use of his property when it handed over to cohen.the only question under the restatement is whether kremen property is merged in nsi.com registry 
it most certainly is.nsi registry is the master list that associates.com domains like sex with particular ip addresses.it essentially a ledger with domains in one column and ip addresses in another.see thomas,at.the fact that the ledger is electronic rather than does make it any less a document this dissent is still a document even if you reading it online.see,th at,d ebay,bidder edge,d.web browsers determine what server is associated with a particular.com domain from the information in nsi registry modify an ip address in the registry,and you change the server with which a domain is associated someone expecting to find my web page will be sent to yours instead.it hard to imagine an intangible right that more closely merged in a document.
there are several analogues to nsi.com registry in the case law,but the closest is a corporate share register.a share register qualifies as a document in which shares are merged.see phansalkar andersen weinroth,d,deriving this point from payne payne,cal.at t he certificate is only evidence of the property and it is not the only evidence,for a transfer on the books of the corporation,without the issuance of a certificate,vests title in the shareholder the certificate is,therefore,but additional evidence of title the relationship between a share and a share register is quite similar to that between a.com domain and nsi.com registry.both documents are databases whose entries identify who gets the benefits of a particular intangible shareholder gets dividends whose computer gets internet traffic 
california courts have long held that a shareholder can sue a corporation for conversion if it wrongfully refuses to transfer title to shares on its books.ralston bank of,cal.a corporation that actually gives away a shareholder stock by wrongfully amending its share register is similarly liable.see witkin,summary of california law,at ed.an owner of a domain registry who wrongfully gives away a registrant domain name is in precisely the same position.
cases where a defendant is held liable for converting a document are also instructive.grocery terry,for example,cited with approval in the restatement,see restatement second of torts cmt.b reporter notes,involved a defendant who took the plaintiff account book,preventing him from collecting his receivables.grocery,at.the court allowed damages for the lost accounts,not merely for the paper they were recorded on.id.at see also pioneer commercial funding united airlines.under the restatement,an account receivable is thus merged in an account book.kremen domain name and nsi.com registry are at least as closely related as an account receivable and an account book.in both cases,the document is merely a list of intangibles that instrumental to enjoyment of the plaintiff rights 
one can imagine arguments against recognizing conversion of all intangibles,but none applies to domain names.some intangibles are vaguely defined and may not give the defendant fair notice of the plaintiff property right.see olschewski.at,alluding to the need for evidence of a definite interest.but domain names,like corporate stock,are clear and discrete property rights.one who alters title to a registered domain name is fairly on notice that he may be affecting someone else property.
a second difficulty arises when the property is a nonexclusive intangible like a trade secret,the theft of which does not actually prevent the plaintiff use.see ricks,supra,at.but domain names are exclusive intangibles again,just like corporate stock.a defendant who wrongfully takes a domain name deprives the plaintiff of its use entirely.domain names are much more like corporate stock or accounts receivable than they are like customer goodwill or trade that many courts applying the restatement have declined to protect,see restatement second of torts cmt.f reporter notes.
these considerations merely reinforce a conclusion that the case law compels.we do need the california supreme court to spell out the inevitable consequences of the state jurisprudence every time a new species of property emerges.california law,even narrowly construed,recognizes conversion of property that shares all the relevant features of domain names.that all we need to know to decide the case.
comity and responsibility 
although the great majority of all those in our have certification procedures,california came to the process late.it adopted its rule less than five years ago,and only after endless carping from the bar.see,jerome braun,a certification rule for california,santa clara.even then,california adopted a rule much narrower than those of other states in our circuit.other states permit certification from any federal court,but california accepts only questions certified by a court of appeals or the united states supreme court.compare cal.rules of court a with.a.the california supreme court has also been more parsimonious in accepting certified questions.it practically unheard of for a supreme court of another state to reject a certified question of our court california,though,has rejected of the cases we certified to it since the rule went into effect.see appendix tbl.
the california supreme court evident ambivalence toward the certification process reflects the brutal realities of supervising the judiciary of the most populous state in the nation.congestion in the california supreme court has been a fixture ever since the state was admitted to the union.see karl manheim,the business of the california supreme court a comparative study,loy.the court delivers about written opinions per percent more than the united states supreme court,with two fewer justices.compare judicial council of,annual report court statistics report tbl hereinafter court statistics opinions for,with admin.office of the courts,judicial business hereinafter judicial business opinions for.overall,the court disposes of some cases per year,up more than sixty percent from ten years ago,and once again more than the corresponding figure for the united states supreme court.compare court statistics,supra,at tbl dispositions for,compared to for,with judicial business,supra,at dispositions for.
the seven justices of the california supreme court sit atop a judiciary with approximately justices in the courts of appeal and judicial officers in the superior courts.court statistics,supra,at tbl justice full time equivalents id.at tbl judge,commissioner and referee ftes.by comparison,washington,the next most populous state in our circuit,has a supreme court but only thirty judicial officers in the courts of appeals and only about in the superior,district and municipal courts combined.see washington courts,at http last visited,court of appeals directories listing judges and commissioners superior court annual caseload report,at caseload judges plus commissioner ftes courts of limited jurisdiction annual caseload report,at judge ftes plus commissioner ftes.
the california supreme court is further hamstrung by its mandatory death penalty jurisdiction it reviews an automatic direct appeal from every case where a death sentence is imposed.see court statistics,supra,at tbl.this is a daunting prospect,with california death row now numbering and still growing.see gerald uelmen,courtly manners,cal,july,at,as we know from our own experience,capital raising dozens of far more burdensome than most.the supreme court death penalty docket has at times strained its ability to act as the architect of california case law.gerald uelmen,the lucas court a first year report card,cal,june,at,see also stephen barnett,california justice,cal,book review.
even if the california supreme court turned down our certification request,we would still have taken up a disproportionate amount of the court time and attention.our requests are doubtless given far closer scrutiny than the petition of an ordinary litigant.the supreme court has turned down a significant number of our certified cases,but this can not have been an easy or pleasant task,and it would surely grant review if at all possible.we should avoid forcing the court to make the awkward choice between agreeing to answer a question that really does deserve its attention and telling us we out to lunch.in some instances,all reasonable minds will agree that the court intervention is needed.but here,no party or amicus has suggested certification,and even our own panel is divided.we surely have a poor candidate for imposing on the california supreme court goodwill 
the crowded california docket also means that certification is a less efficient mechanism for ascertaining state law.the cases we send to the california supreme court are beset by the same delays that plague the rest of its caseload.the average length of time from certification order to decision is well over a year and a half.see appendix tbl stephen barnett,docket,cal,may,at,average time on docket for all penalty cases of days.this is approximately triple the national average computed by one comprehensive study from the.see carroll seron,certifying questions of state law experience of federal judges tbl fed.judicial,fjc staff paper,six to seven months one case was gone for more than two and a half years.see vu prudential prop.cas.ins,cir,certified question answered,cal th,d,conformed to answer,cir.none has taken less than days.see appendix tbl.even to deny a certification request takes on average close to three months.see id.given the unique pressures facing the california supreme court,these statistics are easy to understand.delays are an unavoidable consequence of this procedure,but they are far longer when the state court is already overburdened with its own work.
certification burdens litigants,who foot the bill while their lawyers reargue the controversy in a different forum.the parties will now file briefs in the california supreme court,explaining why it should or should not accept the certification request.cal.rules of court e.next,they will reply to
