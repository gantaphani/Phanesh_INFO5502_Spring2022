an employer provided two computers for an employee use,one for the office,the other to permit the employee to work at home.the employee,who had signed his employer electronic and telephone equipment policy statement and agreed in writing that his computers could be monitored by his employer,was terminated for misuse of his office computer.after the employee sued the employer for wrongful termination,the employer demanded production of the home computer.the employee refused to produce the computer and the trial court refused to compel production.on the employer petition,we conclude that,given the employee consent to his employer monitoring of both computers,the employee had no reasonable expectation of privacy when he used the home computer for personal matters.we issue the writ as prayed.
for about years,robert zieminski worked as a senior executive for tbg insurance services corporation.in the course of his employment,zieminski used two computers owned by tbg,one at the office,the other at his residence.zieminski signed tbg electronic and telephone equipment policy statement in which he agreed,among other things,that he would use the computers for business purposes only and not for personal benefit or purposes,unless such use was expressly approved.under no circumstances could the equipment or systems be used for improper,derogatory,defamatory,obscene or other inappropriate purposes.zieminski consented to have his computer use monitored by authorized company personnel on an as needed basis,and agreed that communications transmitted by computer were not private.he acknowledged his understanding that his improper use of the computers could result in disciplinary action,including discharge.
in december,zieminski and tbg entered a shareholder buy sell agreement,pursuant to which tbg sold shares of its stock to zieminski at per share of the stock was to vest on december,on december,and on december,each vesting contingent upon zieminski continued employment if zieminski employment terminated before all of the shares had vested,tbg had the right to repurchase the shares at per share.as part of the transaction,zieminski signed a confidentiality agreement and gave tbg a covenant not to compete.of zieminski shares vested on december.in march,tbg shareholders including zieminski sold a portion of their tbg shares to nationwide insurance companies more specifically,zieminski sold of his vested shares to nationwide for a cash price of.
on november,three days before another shares were to vest,zieminski employment was terminated.according to tbg,zieminski was terminated when tbg discovered that he had violated tbg electronic policies by repeatedly accessing pornographic sites on the internet while he was at work.according to zieminski,the pornographic web sites were not accessed intentionally but simply popped up on his computer.zieminski sued tbg,alleging that his employment had been wrongfully terminated as a pretext to prevent his substantial stock holdings in tbg from fully vesting and to allow tbg to repurchase his stock at per share.
tbg answered and through its lawyers asked zieminski through his lawyer to return the home computer and cautioned zieminski not to delete any information stored on the computer hard drive.in response,zieminski acknowledged that the computer was purchased by tbg and said he would either return it or purchase it,but said it would be necessary to delete,alter,and flush or destroy some of the information on the computer hard drive,since it contains personal information which is subject to a right of privacy.tbg refused to sell the computer to zieminski,demanded its return without any deletions or alterations,and served on zieminski a demand for production of the computer.code civ.zieminski objected,claiming an invasion of his constitutional right to privacy.
tbg moved to compel production of the home computer,contending it has the right to discover whether information on the hard drive proves that,as claimed by tbg,zieminski violated his employer policy statement.in tbg words,zieminski repeated voluntary and access of sexually explicit is one of the foremost issues in the case.as such,a significant piece of evidence in this action is the home computer,as its hard drive may confirm that zieminski has,in fact,accessed the same or similar sexually explicit at home,thereby undermining zieminski story that,at work,such sites popped up involuntarily.tbg suggested that,in light of zieminski agreement to be bound by tbg policy statement,and in light of the fact that the home computer belongs to tbg,zieminski could not seriously claim that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy when he used it for personal matters.
zieminski opposed the motion,accused tbg of pursuing a scorched earth defense policy,demanded sanctions,and insisted that notwithstanding the policy statement he retained an expectation of privacy with regard to his home computer.according to zieminski,the home computer was provided as a perk given to all senior executives.he said that,a lthough the home computer was provided so that business related work could be done at home,it was universally accepted and understood by all that the home computers would also be used for personal purposes as well.he said his home computer was used by his wife and children,and that it was primarily used for personal purposes and contains significant personal information and data subject to his constitutional right of privacy including the details of his personal finances,his income tax returns,and all of his family personal correspondence.zieminski who had admitted at his earlier deposition that he had signed the policy statement did not mention the policy statement in his opposition memorandum or his declaration 
the trial court denied tbg motion,finding the information on the computer was merely corroborative of facts already in tbg possession since tbg already has extensive evidence,any additional evidence that the home computer may disclose does not outweigh the fact that the computer contains personal information.tbg then filed a petition for a writ of mandate,asking us to intervene.we issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing.
discussion 
tbg contends it is entitled to inspect zieminski home computer.we agree.
a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,subd.a.in the context of discovery,evidence is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case,preparing for trial,or facilitating a settlement.admissibility is not the test,and it is sufficient if the information sought might reasonably lead to other,admissible evidence.glenfed development superior court th,d.in the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing,the party who asks the trial court to compel production must show good cause for the unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product,that burden is met simply by a showing of relevance,subds.a,l glenfed development superior court,supra,th at,d.
here,the home computer is indisputably relevant zieminski does not seriously contend otherwise and the trial court finding that tbg already has other extensive evidence misses the mark.tbg is entitled to discover any information,cumulative or not,that may reasonably assist it in evaluating its defense,preparing for trial,or facilitating a settlement.admissibility is not the test,and it is sufficient if the information sought might reasonably lead to other,admissible evidence,superior court th,d a party may use multiple methods to obtain discovery and the fact that information was disclosed under one method is not,by itself,a proper basis to refuse to provide discovery under another method.zieminski offers no authority to the contrary,and we know of none.the issue,therefore,is whether he has a protectible privacy interest in the information to be found on the computer.
zieminski privacy claim is based on article i,section i,of the california constitution,which provides all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.when affirmative relief is sought to prevent a constitutionally prohibited invasion of privacy,the plaintiff must establish a legally protected privacy interest a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances and conduct by defendant constituting a serious invasion of privacy.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.here,we assume the existence of an abstract privacy interest in zieminski financial and other personal information but conclude,by the reasons explained below,that the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court implied finding that zieminski had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances.as we also explain,the trial court may in any event make such orders as are necessary to minimize tbg intrusion.
assuming the existence of a legally cognizable privacy interest,the extent of that interest is not independent of the circumstances,and other factors including advance notice may affect a person reasonable expectation of privacy.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d.a reasonable expectation of privacy is an objective entitlement founded on broadly based and widely accepted community norms,and the presence or absence of opportunities to consent voluntarily to activities impacting privacy interests obviously affects the expectations of the participant.id.at,d.accordingly,our decision about the reasonableness of zieminski claimed expectation of privacy must take into account any accepted community norms,advance notice to zieminski about tbg policy statement,and whether zieminski had the opportunity to consent to or reject the very thing that constitutes the invasion.id.at,d.
the community norms aspect of the reasonable expectation element of an invasion of privacy claim is this the protection afforded to the plaintiff interest in his privacy must be relative to the customs of the time and place,to the occupation of the plaintiff and to the habits of his neighbors and fellow citizens.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d,quoting rest d,torts,com.in hill,where the issue was whether drug testing constituted an invasion of privacy,the community was intercollegiate athletics,particularly in highly competitive postseason championship events,which by their nature involve close regulation and scrutiny of the physical fitness and bodily condition of student athletes.required physical examinations including urinalysis,and special regulation of sleep habits,diet,fitness,and other activities that intrude significantly on privacy interests are routine aspects of a college athlete life not shared by other students or the population at large as a result of its unique set of demands,athletic participation carries with it social norms that effectively diminish the athlete reasonable expectation of personal privacy in his or her bodily condition,both internal and external.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d.
we are concerned in this case with the community norm within century businesses.in,the member american management association ama reported that more than of this country major firms monitor,record,and review employee communications and activities on the job,including their telephone calls,internet connections,and computer files.companies that engage in these practices do so for several reasons,including legal compliance in regulated industries,such as telemarketing,to show compliance,and in other industries to satisfy due diligence requirements,legal liability because employees unwittingly exposed to offensive material on a colleague computer may sue the employer for allowing a hostile workplace environment,performance review,productivity measures,and security concerns protection of trade secrets and other confidential information.american management,ama survey,workplace monitoring surveillance,summary of key findings april hereafter ama findings as of,and see mcintosh,the future of communication privacy in the minnesota workplace,hamline,fn.
it is hardly surprising,therefore,that employers are told they should establish a policy for the use of and the internet,which every employee should have to read and sign.first,employers can diminish an individual employee expectation of privacy by clearly stating in the policy that electronic communications are to be used solely for company business,and that the company reserves the right to monitor or access all employee internet or usage.the policy should further emphasize that the company will keep copies of internet or passwords,and that the existence of such passwords is not an assurance of the confidentiality of the communications.an electronic communications policy should include a statement prohibiting the transmission of any discriminatory,offensive or unprofessional messages.employers should also inform employees that access to any internet sites that are discriminatory or offensive is not allowed,and no employee should be permitted to post personal opinions on the internet using the company access,particularly if the opinion is of a political or discriminatory nature.fernandez,workplace claims guiding employers and employees safely in and out of the revolving door practising law institute,litigation and administrative practice course handbook series,litigation see also gantt,an affront to human dignity electronic mail monitoring in the private sector workplace spring harv.tech,numerous commentators recommend that employers establish corporate policies addressing privacy,and many employers have done just that.for these reasons,the use of computers in the employment context carries with it social norms that effectively diminish the employee reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to his use of his employer computers.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d.
tbg advance notice to zieminski the company policy statement gave zieminski the opportunity to consent to or reject the very thing that he now complains about,and that notice,combined with his written consent to the policy,defeats his claim that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy 
several months after zieminski started using the home computer,he signed tbg policy statement,thereby acknowledging his understanding that the home computer was the property of the company and,as such,to be used for business purposes only and not for personal benefit or purposes.he agreed that the computer would not be used for improper,derogatory,defamatory,obscene or other inappropriate purposes,acknowledged his understanding that communications transmitted by company systems were not considered private,and consented to tbg designation of authorized personnel to enter such systems and monitor messages and files on an as needed basis.he was notified that this monitoring could include the review,copying or deletion of messages,or the disclosure of such messages or files to other authorized persons.his signature shows that he read tbg policy,understood it,and agreed to adhere to it.
as can be seen,zieminski knew that tbg would monitor the files and messages stored on the computers he used at the office and at home.he had the opportunity to consent to tbg policy or not,and had the opportunity to limit his use of his home computer to purely business matters.to state the obvious,no one compelled zieminski or his wife or children to use the home computer for personal matters,and no one prevented him from purchasing his own computer for his personal use.with all the information he needed to make an intelligent decision,zieminski agreed to tbg policy and chose to use his computer for personal matters.by any reasonable standard,zieminski fully and voluntarily relinquished his privacy rights in the information he stored on his home computer,and he will not now be heard to say that he nevertheless had a reasonable expectation of privacy.hill national collegiate athletic,supra,cal th at,d,see al
