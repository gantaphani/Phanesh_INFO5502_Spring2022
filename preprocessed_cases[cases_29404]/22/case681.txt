a federal jury convicted appellant john allen root of one count of attempting to persuade a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity,in violation of b,and one count of traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in a criminal sexual act with a minor,in violation of b.root appeals his conviction and sentencing enhancement based on the fact that the minor involved was not an actual minor,but an undercover law enforcement officer.after review and oral argument,we affirm root conviction and sentence.
background 
root conversations with jenny 
waylon howell is an investigator with the sheriff department of gwinnett county,georgia,and was assigned to the fbi innocent images task force.under the screen name,agent howell logged on to an america online aol chat room entitled i love older men.agent howell had listed himself in his aol profile as jenny,a single female student of an unspecified age living in lawrenceville,georgia,who was interested in music,chatting,movies and shopping agent howell did not send any private or distribute any messages immediately upon entering the chat room.but within five minutes he received instant addressed to jenny from multiple aol users in the chat room.one of the messages came from root,whose screen name was.in his first private message to jenny,root said good afternoon jenny.intriguing profile you have.big john here from nc.how are ya 
over the next three days,jenny and root then engaged in numerous private conversations.the agent portraying jenny engaged in a steady repartee with root designed to mimic a child ignorance,insecurities and mannerisms,including misspellings and popular internet slang on the fourth day,root traveled from his home in north carolina to meet jenny in georgia,where he was arrested.we first review root conversations with jenny during the three days prior to his arrest.
december conversations 
after root introduced himself as big john on the afternoon of tuesday,december,root said he was a man who had just turned and lived in the charlotte,north carolina,area.shortly thereafter,root asked,how old are you jenny,and the agent responded,im sic.
on that first afternoon,between and,root traded instant messages with jenny from his office.at trial,the transcript of those messages showed root did the following 
told jenny that she was at the age you need to learn some things such as how to have pleasure and experiment with your body on what makes it feel good.
said he wished he could feel her small breasts,wanted to kiss her little nipples,offered to kiss in between your legs,and asked if she would let me finger you jenny if i was there now.
asked jenny to rub my cock with your little hands and lick it too.he said that touching a man genitalia gives you power and that he knew girls your age who have already done it.all the way.he added that he had never been with one your age but would like to.
said i want to do you so bad,and asked jenny if she want ed to f me.he explained that sex might hurt a little,but that he would be gentle and patient and not put in more than you can take.
said that everything would be fine long as we dont sic get caught.
during this conversation,which also involved root describing masturbation,ejaculation,orgasms and his being fixed,root asked if jenny could get away for part of a day or nite to meet him.root,who also asked jenny to send him a picture of herself,said he would drive to georgia if you will f me.jenny,who said she was unfamiliar with some of the sexual terms root was using and did not have many friends because she was home schooled,suggested meeting root that friday at the mall of georgia when her mother dropped her off at the movies.root said that would be perfect,adding,if you will get my cock off i will meet you anywhere.
december conversations 
the next afternoon,root reinitiated the conversation at,and the ensuing three instant message sessions concluded at.during these sessions,root did the following 
said he was horny and excited thinking about their planned meeting,during which he would teach you.he added that jenny should think of spreading your legs so i can put my cock in you.
told jenny he cant sic wait to feel your tiny little body in my arms and cant sic wait to feel your pussy around my cock jenny.
received jenny picture,which was an actual picture of a teenage girl sent by agent howell.root said jenny was beautiful and a smart young pretty lady.he added,i want you so bad even more after i saw you.
told jenny she would love f ing,that he would be very gentle,and that once you have my cock in you,it will feel so good.you will love to ride it and feeel sic it in you.
set a definite time and location for meeting jenny on friday,december,outside the mall of georgia old navy store.root told jenny he would be the tall guy with a bulge in his crotch.
told jenny he would have you on friday,that she would learn lots,did not need to be nervous and did not need to worry about how much money to bring.
this conversation also included references by root to jenny rubbing his genitalia to make big john feel good and ejaculate,kissing him and learning how to give blowjobs.he said he wanted to touch her little nipples,make her moan and scream,and put a finger in you,and reassured her that sexual activity would not cause pain.i f it starts to,i will go easier,root stated.
december conversations 
on thursday,december,root and jenny engaged in a final instant message session between and root again initiated the conversation,during which he 
told jenny,who said she could not sleep because she was thinking about their planned meeting,that he was nervous too because i could get in a lot of trouble if we get caught cause you are so young.he added,if your parents found out they could lock me up for years this is just between you and me.
said he wanted to kiss jenny,lick her nipples and engage in oral sex with her.he added that he would teach you to perform oral sex.
confirmed for jenny that other girls her age performed oral sex,saying,some do it to their boyfriend every week or so not just to please their boyfriend,but because they like to do it themselves.turns em on.
explained to jenny what she could do with him on friday go to the movies,to his car,unzip my pants and play,and listen to cds in his car while we play.
said,i want to rub your pussy we will find a secluded spot.
root concluded the conversation that morning by saying,the plan is still on in front of old navy at i will find you jenny.
december travel to meet jenny 
the next day friday,december,root traveled from north carolina to the mall of georgia in buford,georgia.when he arrived at the mall,fbi task force agents arrested him outside the old navy store.after being informed of his rights under miranda arizona,d,and waiving them,root told fbi agent allen sosebee that he drove to the mall from north carolina to meet jenny,whom he had met in the aol chat room entitled i love older men.according to agent sosebee,root stated that he planned to take her to a movie,then take her to his car to listen to some cd,and to engage in some sexual play.when agent sosebee asked root to define sexual play,root said,well,rub each other private parts.root further stated that he knew it was wrong to meet a year old girl for sex,but considered it a notch on his belt and exciting.
ii.procedural history 
on january,the grand jury indicted root on one count of attempting to persuade a minor to engage in sexual activity for which he could be charged with a criminal offense,in violation of b and one count of traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in a sexual act with a minor that would violate,in violation of b.root pleaded not guilty 
at trial,the government presented three witnesses agents howell and sosebee,and the office manager at root place of employment,who testified about root computer usage.when the government rested,root moved for judgment of acquittal on both counts under federal rule of criminal procedure.root argued,inter alia,that an actual child victim is required for commission of both charged offenses.thus,he asserted,the government had failed to introduce evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction under either count of the indictment.the district court denied the motion.root presented no evidence.
the jury then convicted root on both counts.on august,the district court sentenced root to concurrent terms of months in prison on each count,three years of supervised release and in fines.this sentence included enhancements under the sentencing guidelines of two levels for unduly influencing a minor to engage in a sexual act,ussg b b,and another two levels for using a computer or device in a sex crime with a minor,ussg b.root objected to the former,but not the latter,enhancement.root timely appealed.
iii.conviction 
on appeal,root contends that an actual minor was required for both his convictions and the sentencing enhancement under b b of the sentencing guidelines we discuss each challenge in turn 
in count one,the grand jury charged root with attempting to violate b between december and.we conclude that an actual minor victim is not required for an attempt conviction under b.
section b plainly criminalizes the attempt conduct at issue here as follows 
whoever,using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce,or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states knowingly persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of years,to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,or attempts to do so,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b emphasis added internal footnote added.in,congress added the or attempts to do so language,which created the crime of attempt the fact that root crime had not ripened into a completed offense is no obstacle to an attempt conviction.root belief that a minor was involved is sufficient to sustain an attempt conviction under b.
this circuit has long held that to convict a defendant of the crime of attempt,the government need only prove the defendant was acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the commission of the crime for which he is charged with attempting and the defendant was engaged in conduct that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of the crime.united states carothers,cir per curiam citing united states mandujano,cir.this court has clarified that for the second element to be satisfied,the defendant objective acts,without reliance on the accompanying mens rea,must mark the defendant conduct as criminal.carothers,at citing united states oviedo,cir.thus,the defendant acts,taken as a whole,must strongly corroborate the required culpability they must not be equivocal.id.quoting united states mcdowell,cir 
here,the government proved both elements necessary to convict root.first,it demonstrated,and root does not challenge,that he had the specific intent to engage in the underlying criminal conduct.it introduced a transcript of root instant messages with a person who identified herself to root as a year old girl in which he stated that he wanted to be touched on his genitalia by her little hands,feel her little nipples and hold her tiny little body,he had never been with one your age,but that girls that age were engaging in various sexual activities,and he knew he could get in a lot of trouble for engaging in the sexual activity he proposed to engage in because she was so young.root also accepted a picture of a teenage girl that agent howell sent him as jenny picture.and root statement to task force agents upon his arrest confirmed that he believed he would meet a year old girl for sex,which he said he knew was wrong but exciting.
second,the government showed root took substantial steps toward the commission of the underlying crime.he engaged in actual,objective acts that independent of root mental state strongly corroborate and provide unequivocal evidence of root culpability.he repeatedly asked in his instant messages that jenny kiss him,touch his genitalia,perform and receive oral sex,and engage in sexual intercourse with him.he drove five hours from north carolina to georgia to meet jenny at the appointed time and place.and,when arrested by task force agents,root stated that he was at the old navy store to engage in sexual play with a year old girl.these actions,taken as a whole,speak of only one plan of action.they mark the defendant conduct as criminal in nature and are unique rather than so commonplace that they are engaged in by persons not in violation of the law.oviedo,at.root has not even attempted to offer a theory under which his acts were consistent with a noncriminal enterprise as the defendant did in oviedo.id.at.
on many occasions,this court has affirmed attempt convictions even when a defendant did not actually commit the final act required for conviction for the underlying crime.see,for example,united states baptista rodriguez,cir that the cocaine transaction was not consummated is immaterial to the inchoate offenses of conspiracy and attempt.united states forbrich,cir holding that although no delivery of the document occurred,forbrich did take a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of delivering sensitive defense information to foreign government sufficient to sustain his attempt conviction.
and,of even more relevance here,this court has affirmed attempt convictions when the defendant could not have achieved the final required act because it would have been impossible to commit the actual crime.see,for example,carothers,at simply because defendant convicted of attempt to possess ecstasy received no illegal drugs from his supplier on this occasion and received legal substances instead does not provide a defense to a crime for which his objective acts clearly demonstrate an intent to commit.mcdowell,at finding defendant objective acts sufficiently corroborative of guilt to sustain his conviction for attempted possession of cocaine even though defendant had refused to accept sham cocaine offered to him by undercover agent.compare oviedo,at finding evidence of attempted distribution of heroin insufficient when defendant acts negotiating to sell heroin but actually transferring a substance to an undercover agent did not mark his conduct as criminal in nature because he might have simply been seeking to rip off buyer.
fifth circuit farner decision 
the only other appellate court to have considered this issue reached the same result that an actual minor is not required for an attempt conviction under b.see united states farner,cir.in farner,the fifth circuit affirmed the conviction of a dallas man whose case was analogous to root.the man met someone who identified herself as cindy,a year old girl,via aol.he asked her if she was looking for an older man,and she said she was.they spoke via instant messaging and telephone over a period of three months.the man sent her pornographic pictures and arranged to meet her at a houston restaurant to engage in sexual activity.the girl was actually an adult female fbi agent.id.at.
on appeal,the fifth circuit found that the evidence satisfied both of the requirements for an attempt conviction under mandujano and oviedo even though the minor involved was not an actual child,but an undercover law enforcement officer.id.at in this case,the district court correctly concluded from the stipulated evidence,beyond a reasonable doubt,that farner intended to engage in sexual acts with a year old girl and that he took substantial steps toward committing the crime.this conclusion is also in accord with reported district court opinions interpreting b as not requiring an actual minor for an attempt indictment or conviction.see united states miller,d,refusing to dismiss indictment,stating that b makes unlawful attempts to induce those believed to be minors even if they turn out to be federal agents into sexual activities the defendant belief that an element is met is sufficient to meet the element if attempt is charged united states powell,d,aff,cir stating that argument that defendant could not be indicted under b for attempting to lure two undercover agents posing as minor females on aol to engage in sexual activity was not supported by current federal law 
legislative history 
root asserts that an unenacted legislative proposal to amend helps prove b forbids convictions when actual underage victims are not involved,despite the plain language of the statute attempt provision.he points to language introduced in the house of representatives in that would have amended to explicitly criminalize knowingly contact ing an individual,who has been represented to the person making the contact as not having attained the age of years,sess.this proposal,however,was not enacted,leading root to argue that congress did not intend to cover such conduct in.
this argument does not lead us to alter our conclusion.first,we do not resort to legislative history when the statute language of attempt is clear.see harris garner,cir en banc when the import of the words congress has used is clear,as it is here,we need not resort to legislative history,and we certainly should not do so to undermine the plain meaning of the statutory language.united states weaver,cir finding that court should not look beyond plain meaning of the statutory language except when confronted with absurdity of results citations omitted.
second,even if we succumb to the temptation to review the legislative history proffered by root,it relates to a form of criminal activity involving minors mere contact for the purposes of engaging in illegal sexual activity that is not criminalized in b.instead,b,as passed by congress,condemns attempts to persuade,induce,entice or coerce them to engage in illegal sexual activity without any mention of contact.any inferences to be drawn from such an attenuated history are merely speculative.even if the proposed language were more similar to the final version of b,congress may decline to enact proposed amendments for a multitude of reasons.see,for example,weaver,at observing that passage of amendment to criminal statute might only make clear that an individual could always have been charged with the crime under the statute,and that the addition of new language does not change this and that this court does not give even clear legislative history more weight than clear statutory language quotations omitted united states sepulveda,cir observing that plain language governs statutory interpretation because amendments may be made to clarify existing law,to correct a misinterpretation,or to overrule wrongly decided cases.thus,an amendment to a statute does not necessarily indicate that the unamended statute meant the opposite.quoting hawkins united states,cir.in sum,this legislative history does not aid root case.
for the same reasons,we also affirm root conviction under b.root makes very similar arguments concerning his conviction under b,which punishes travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile 
a person who travels in interstate commerce,or conspires to do so for the purpose of engaging in any sexual act as defined in section with a person under years of age that would be in violation of chapter if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b internal footnote added.he asserts that this statute also requires the government to prove an actual person under years of age was the object of the interstate travel as an element of the offense.and he cites similar unenacted language in that would have recognized criminal interstate travel related to sexual acts with a victim above the age of whom the person believes has not attained the age of years.thus,he argues again that it is not a federal crime to act as he did when an actual child is not involved.
we agree with the district court that root may be convicted of violating b based on the evidence presented at trial.although root was charged with and convicted of actual commission of this offense and not merely attempt root conviction turns simply on the illegal purpose for which root traveled.see united states vang,cir noting that b punishes mere travel in interstate commerce even if no transportation of a minor was involved if the requisite intent is found root does not dispute that he traveled in interstate commerce on the relevant day.and,from the government evidence,there can be no doubt as to why root drove from north carolina to georgia on that day.the government established,based on root instant messages and confession,that he traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in criminal sexual activity with a person under age.further,the proffered legislative history argument is just as irrelevant and,alternatively,as unpersuasive,in relation to this count of the conviction as it was in connection with b.
iv.sentence 
the application of b b of the sentencing guidelines to root conviction presents a sentencing issue of first impression in this,or any other,circuit.after review of the relevant authorities,we also find no error in the district court imposition of a enhancement under b b of the sentencing guidelines.we first review the content of this guideline,and then evaluate the district court application of its presumptions and standards to root 
undue influence enhancement under the sentencing guidelines 
section b provides for a number of sentencing enhancements for defendants convicted of criminal sexual abuse of a minor under the age of years or attempt to commit such acts.in subsection b,it provides for a enhancement if the victim was in the custody,care,or supervisory control of the defendant.ussg b.but,when that enhancement does not apply as in this case subsection b provides for two other possible enhancements.one of these is a enhancement if a participant otherwise unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.ussg b b the district court imposed this enhancement in calculating root sentence.
in crafting this guideline,the sentencing commission specifically defined the term victim for the purposes of this guideline as including an undercover law enforcement officer,as follows 
victim means a an individual who,except as provided in subdivision b,had not attained the age of years or b an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of years.
ussg,note.the sentencing commission explained that the purpose of this expanded definition of victim was to ensure offenders who are apprehended in undercover operations,like root,are appropriately punished,as follows 
this amendment is clarifying that victim includes an undercover police officer who represents to the perpetrator of the offense that the officer was under the age of years.this change was made to ensure that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are appropriately punished.
the sentencing commission also instructed district courts applying the undue influence enhancement to closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant influence over the victim compromised the voluntariness of the victim behavior.ussg,note.it created a rebuttable presumption that a victim has been unduly influenced for the purposes of b b when a participant is at least years older than the victim.id.the sentencing commission added that,when such an age difference exists,some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and victim.id.
in its commentary,the sentencing commission noted its research showed that cases of both consensual and nonconsensual sexual acts with minors involved conduct such as coercion,enticement,or other forms of undue influence by the defendant that compromised the voluntariness of the victim behavior.amend,cmt.these actions increased the defendant culpability for the crime.id.the commission added that its research showed the rebuttable presumption was appropriate because persons who are much older than a minor are frequently in a position to manipulate the minor due to increased knowledge,influence,and resources.id.
root sentence 
in this case,the district court reviewed these authorities before granting the government motion for a enhancement of root base offense level under b b the court first recognized that the definition of victim included an undercover law enforcement officer portraying a child online.second,the court interpreted the phrase unduly influenced the victim to focus on the actions of the defendant,regardless of whether the victim was a real person or a hypothetical person.
the court also applied the presumption of undue influence because root,at age,was more than years older than jenny,who identified herself as being years old.in addition,the district court found that root failed to rebut this presumption.the court further found that i n fact,the evidence shows a rather graphic over reaching conduct.
minor victim under the guideline 
on appeal,root reasserts his objection at sentencing that this undue influence enhancement is not applicable because there was no real victim whose will was overborne.the government concedes that agent howell will certainly was not compromised.but,as the government points out,the guideline states that an actual child victim need not be on the receiving end of the relevant persuasion.indeed,the commentary to explicitly instructs that for all enhancements under this guideline,an undercover officer playing the role of a minor victim qualifies as a victim,thereby making an actual victim unnecessary.ussg,note moreover,the sentencing commission noted that it added this definition for the very purpose of ensuring that offenders who are apprehended in undercover operations are appropriately punished.
the guideline then creates an enhancement when an offender unduly influenced the victim to engage in illegal sex acts.ussg b b.this provision applies both when actual sexual abuse is committed,as well as when an attempt to commit such an act is involved.ussg.thus,a victim need not actually engage in any sex acts for an offender to receive an enhancement.instead,he may,like root,be apprehended prior to the commission of the complete offense and charged with an attempt to commit a sex crime,in violation of b,or charged with an offense requiring a action such as traveling taken with a specific intent to commit a sex crime,in violation of b.in such a case,the identity of the victim of an attempt conviction is irrelevant for purposes of a sentence enhancement under b b.the offender need only have exerted undue influence aimed at convincing the victim to engage in future improper sexual activities 
thus,when an undercover officer is the recipient of communications related to the commission of a sex crime offense and no actual child is involved,a district court considering an undue influence enhancement,under b b,must focus on the offender conduct.the officer identity or feelings about the offender conduct are irrelevant.certainly,the voluntariness of a real child victim actions would be dispositive if an undercover agent were not involved.but if an undercover agent is allowed to be the sole victim of a crime for which an enhancement under may be given,it would be illogical to interpret b b to require that agent will actually be overborne.such an interpretation would also undermine the sentencing commission stated purpose in amending the definition of victim under of ensuring that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are appropriately punished.a real victim is not needed under b b when an undercover agent is involved,as the focus is on the offender conduct in assessing whether an offender conduct constitutes undue influence,the district court may look to a variety of factors,including whether it displays an abuse of superior knowledge,influence and resources.
application of the rebuttable presumption 
we further conclude that a sentencing court may also employ the rebuttable presumption of undue influence created by the sentencing commission when there is a year difference between the offender age and the age of the child portrayed by an undercover agent.
the sentencing commission specifically provides for this rebuttable presumption when a participant is at least years older than the victim.ussg,note emphasis added.a victim can be an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of years.id.at note.thus,the presumption applies here.indeed,there is no specific exclusion for operation of the presumption when the victim is an undercover agent.
given that the presumption applies here,the only real question is to whose age do we look when employing the presumption.because looking to the age of the actual undercover agent would be illogical and,in essence,write the rebuttable presumption out of this guideline,we decline to read this guideline in that way.instead,we conclude that the only logical reading to give effect to this presumption is to look to the age of the child as portrayed by the agent.this reading is also consistent with the overall focus of this guideline on the offender,and not the victim.it is also consistent with the reason why the definition of victim was amended to include undercover agents to ensure that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are appropriately punished.amend,cmt.
here,regardless of whether jenny was a real year old or a hypothetical year old portrayed by an undercover officer,the presumption applied because root had been convicted of offenses involving sexual activity with a person defined as a victim under the guideline who he believed to be,and had represented herself to be,years old.thus,the district court here correctly applied the guideline presumption of undue influence given the year age difference between root and jenny.
sufficiency of evidence concerning undue influence 
the district court also did not err in finding root did not rebut the presumption of undue influence.as he did at sentencing,root appears to maintain that even if an actual victim is not necessary,his conduct would have repulsed an actual year old girl and not persuaded her to engage in sexual activity.therefore,root argues that regardless of whether the rebuttable presumption applies,his conduct did not qualify as undue influence under b b 
root own words,however,provided more than sufficient evidence to support the district court finding of undue influence.we look to facts related to the three types of power the sentencing commission stated sex offenders frequently use to manipulate minors.first,root displayed increased knowledge to influence jenny.when jenny told root in her instant messages that she was not sexually experienced and was not familiar with some of the terms root was using in his messages,he described a variety of sexual activities in detail to her including masturbation,ejaculation,orgasms,cunnilingus,fellatio,manual penetration and sexual intercourse.root also said he had participated in these activities before,they would feel good,and they would not cause pain or pregnancy because he was fixed.
second,root used persuasive powers to influence jenny.he said girls jenny age engaged in the sexual acts he had described and invited her to perform,which he described as playing.he told her she was at an age when she needed to learn some things,but that he would love to teach you some of these things and experiment with you.he also promised he would be gentle and patient.and root explained to her that although he could get in a lot of trouble for meeting jenny and engaging in sexual acts,everything would be ok because he trust ed her not to tell anyone about it.moreover,root conversations with jenny are peppered with reassuring comments about jenny appearance,personality and his interest in her.he also made statements to bolster jenny,commenting on her sexual vitality and responding to her statements of nervousness.all of these messages were phrased by root to win over the insecure teenager portrayed by agent howell.ultimately,he said he would truly like jenny especially if you f me.
third,root used superior resources to influence jenny.he used his office computer to conduct his instant message sessions with her and send his picture to her.he planned to,and did,drive his dodge sedan across three states to meet
