appellant united states government appeals the sentence imposed upon defendant appellee michael sadolsky sadolsky following his plea of guilty to computer fraud in violation of a.at issue is whether the district court erred in granting a downward departure under of the united states sentencing guideline based on defendant alleged gambling disorder.we affirm 
sadolsky was a regional carpet manager for sears roebuck sears.over a period of six months,he accessed sears computers on thirteen occasions and fraudulently credited amounts for returned merchandise to his personal credit card,resulting in a loss to sears of.his activities came to sears attention after he executed a fraudulent credit transaction to his visa account using sears cash registers and another salesperson associate number.sears reported the fraud to the secret service office in louisville.when sadolsky was interviewed by the secret service,he admitted that he defrauded sears to pay off his gambling debts,which were approximately in january.
on december,sadolsky was charged in a seven count felony information with violations of.he waived indictment by the federal grand jury and pled guilty to the seven counts pursuant to a rule e b plea agreement pa.
the parties agreed that sadolsky base offense level under a was a his offense level should be increased by four levels under b e for a loss of more than,and the offense level should be increased by two levels under b a for more than minimal planning.this resulted in a total offense level of.
under the terms of the pa,the parties left several issues to be argued at sentencing,including sadolsky request for a downward departure under on the grounds that he committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity srmc as a result of his gambling problem.the government opposed this request.
sadolsky was scheduled to be sentenced on may,and a presentence investigation report psr was prepared.the psr indicated that sadolsky criminal history category was i,and that the government request for a adjustment for abuse of a position of trust was applicable.the psr also discussed the information reported by sadolsky regarding his gambling compulsion,but did not make any recommendation regarding a downward departure pursuant to.
sadolsky called three witnesses at sentencing to establish an srmc based on his compulsive gambling,including himself,his wife,and william thomason,thomason,a member of gamblers anonymous ga.the government argued that when a defendant is convicted under a,the minimum guideline sentence,notwithstanding any other adjustment,shall be six months imprisonment.c.the trial court subsequently granted a downward departure pursuant to,which resulted in an offense level of and a sentencing range of six to twelve months of imprisonment.sadolsky was then sentenced to five years of probation,with a special condition of six months of home detention.he was also ordered to pay restitution to sears in the amount of and a assessment.had the downward departure not been granted,sadolsky offense level would have been a resulting in a sentencing range of ten to sixteen months of imprisonment.the government timely appeals.
section of the united states sentencing guidelines reads 
diminished capacity policy statement a sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted if the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity.however,the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants the facts and circumstances of the defendant offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence or the defendant criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public.if a departure is warranted,the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.
united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,emphasis added.
the district court granted the departure under after finding that sadolsky capacity was sufficiently impaired to be able to control this particular kind of behavior.it stated 
it seems as though the essence of this provision is a diminished capacity to control a certain kind of illegal behavior.i think it has got to involve something which can be corrected in some way or another,otherwise it would make sense to reduce the sentence because then it could could continue to go uncorrected and that the degree of diminished capacity must be so great that even though one knows it wrong at some level,they still ca stop the behavior.i not sure that could involve a whole lot of factors from how great the diminished capacity is to how bad the behavior is to how involved the behavior is,whether it connected to other bad things as well.
on appeal the government argues that the district court erred in granting a downward departure pursuant to based on sadolsky gambling problem the government makes two related arguments.first,it argues that the lower court committed a legal error in holding that a gambling disorder is a permissible basis for departure under.second,the government contends that the district court erred in finding that sadolsky proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to a departure for diminished capacity.we review for an abuse of discretion.see koon united states,d holding that t he abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.
in united states hamilton,cir per curiam,we held that a compulsive gambler who pled guilty to possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute did not qualify for a downward departure under because he was able to absorb information in the usual way and to exercise the power of reason.he took to selling drugs illegally not because of any inability to understand his situation,but because he needed money.id.at.
the government would easily prevail if hamilton were still the law of this circuit.however,in,the sentencing commission added the following application note defining the previously undefined term significantly reduced mental capacity.
significantly reduced mental capacity means the defendant,although convicted,has a significantly impaired ability to a understand the wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason or b control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.
comment.the commission described its definition of an srmc as follows 
the amendment defines significantly reduced mental capacity in accord with the decision in united states mcbroom,cir.the mcbroom court concluded that significantly reduced mental capacity included both cognitive impairments,an inability to understand the wrongfulness of the conduct or to exercise the power of reason and volitional impairments,an inability to control behavior that the person knows is wrongful.the application note specifically includes both types of impairments in the definition of significantly reduced mental capacity.
c,amendment internal citations omitted.
hamilton focused on the cognitive grounds for an srmc.however,the amendment to expanded the definition of an srmc to include volitional impairments.moreover,the third circuit decision in mcbroom,which was adopted by that amendment,declined to follow our decision in hamilton and its rule limiting srmcs to cognitive deficiencies.see mcbroom,at see also united states wheeler,wl,at cir,unpublished per curiam noting that mcbroom questioned the holding in hamilton by finding that the phrase mental capacity,as used in,had both a volitional and a cognitive component.accordingly,our decision in hamilton is no longer good law after the amendment 
the government contends that sadolsky gambling problem would only justify a downward departure if he had been arrested for gambling,rather than for fraud.more precisely,the government argues that t he question is whether this new volitional test requires
