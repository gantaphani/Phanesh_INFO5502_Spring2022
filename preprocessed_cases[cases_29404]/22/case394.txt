susan and robert johnson filed a state civil suit making multiple claims against several defendants as a result of allegedly defamatory statements posted on an internet discussion board.the defendants removed the case to federal court.the original complaint included six defendants however,the johnsons located and served only inmotion hosting,inmotion,melanie lowry,and kathleen heineman.
the district dismissed the claims against inmotion with prejudice,finding that the communications decency act cda of,c and e protects inmotion.the court dismissed the claims against lowry and heineman without prejudice,finding that lowry and heineman had insufficient contacts with the state of missouri to be subjected to personal jurisdiction in missouri.finally,the district court set aside a state court default judgment against lowry under federal rule of civil procedure b.on appeal,the johnsons argue that the district court erred in dismissing the claims against inmotion,heineman,and lowry and erred in setting aside the default judgment against lowry.for the reasons stated below,we disagree and affirm.
background 
the johnsons reside in unionville,missouri,where they own and operate the exotic cat breeding business known as the cozy kitten cattery.the cozy kitten cattery is a missouri limited liability company formed in.its principal office and place of business is located in missouri,and the johnsons are its sole members.around december,the johnsons obtained a registered federal trademark and service mark for cozy kitten cattery.the johnsons operate their cat breeding business under that trademark and licensed the use of that trademark and service mark to cozy kitten cattery,llc.the johnsons advertise their business on the internet and have a website with the web address.
someone posted several allegedly defamatory statements about the cozy kitten cattery on the interactive website.in response,the johnsons and cozy kittens cattery filed suit against elizabeth arden.com,michelle reitenger,inmotion,lowry,and heineman in putnam county,missouri.counts i,ii and iii allege that all six defendants conspired to use to post false statements about the johnsons,including statements that the johnsons kill cats,the johnsons rip off cat breeders,the johnsons steal kittens,the johnsons cats and kittens are infected,and the johnsons are con artists.the johnsons assert that they requested all defendants to remove the statements but that the statements were not removed for more than hours.the johnsons assert that they suffered lost sales of kittens and cats,lost revenue and lost goodwill and will continue to suffer damages because of the statements posted on the interactive website.
the johnsons assert that inmotion,lowry,and heineman were all served with the summons and,although all three dispute service.the johnsons were unable to locate or serve defendants elizabeth arden,michelle reitenger or.
heineman,lowry,and inmotion moved in district court to dismiss the action based on lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of process.heineman and inmotion also asserted improper venue as an additional ground for dismissal.
kathleen heineman 
heineman is a resident of the state of colorado and has been since.heineman is a cat breeder and also works as an accountant.in both capacities,she works out of her home in colorado.she maintains no offices in missouri,owns no property in missouri and does not pay taxes in missouri.she also alleges that she does not own any domain name registrations and does not own or operate any website.however,the website,and the related cat breeding and selling business are licensed by the state of colorado to heineman,and thus for the purpose of this appeal,we will assume that heineman owns the website in question.
the johnsons assert that heineman sells cats and kittens throughout the united states,including the state of missouri,while advertising on the internet using the web address.the johnsons allege that heineman advertises and sells cats and kittens under the name cozy kittens and cuddly cats.
heineman had a limited business relationship with the johnsons,which ended in march.the johnsons never employed heineman or paid her a salary.she provided administrative assistance to the johnsons from her home office in colorado,including proofreading services and other miscellaneous work on an intermittent basis,such as helping them to acquire cats.
between and,the johnsons contend that heineman purchased about cats for them from breeders throughout the united states.heineman did not profit from the purchase of these cats.some of these cats were shipped to heineman in colorado and then eventually shipped to susan johnson in missouri other cats were picked up from the sellers directly by the johnsons or their relatives.in,heineman twice delivered cats to the johnsons in missouri.during the course of their relationship,the johnsons contend that they shipped seven cats to heineman and charged her only for their expenses.
in the course of their relationship,heineman also purchased advertising space from the johnsons on for a fee of per kitten advertised.the johnsons website then listed heineman email address as the contact email for persons interested in those cats.these advertisements were not targeted to missouri residents,and heineman did not place any cats or kittens or do any other business in missouri.heineman advertised approximately cats in this manner.heineman asserts that she has not posted or authorized anyone else to post anything about the johnsons on or on any other website.
inmotion hosting.
inmotion is a california corporation and maintains its principal place of business there.inmotion,as an internet service provider isp,only hosted the website.inmotion does not operate or create any of its content.inmotion does not monitor or control the content of its customer websites,including.
the website is published worldwide on the internet.the website is interactive,permitting and encouraging individuals to post complaints about businesses and business owners.individuals seeking to post complaints on the website are required to register with the website and provide identifying information,such as their name and email address.
melanie lowry 
lowry resides in california and does not own any property in missouri,does not have any bank accounts or telephone listings in missouri,has never paid taxes in missouri,and has never transacted business in missouri.lowry asserts that she has never done business with the johnsons,does not know them,and has only spoken to susan johnson one time on the call initiated by susan johnson.
the johnsons assert that lowry postings on included statements that susan and robert johnson had sold a breeder cat without providing the papers,offered a refund but refused to pay it,stolen money from their customers,and fed their cats tylenol,causing them to suffer horrible deaths and injuries.
the record contains one alleged posting by lowry on.that alleged posting does not mention missouri,and there is no other evidence in the record indicating that the focal point of this particular posting,or any of lowry other postings,was missouri.
the johnsons filed a state court complaint against lowry,who they assert was properly served on july.lowry did not respond or file a pleading.a missouri default judgment was filed against lowry on september.lowry filed a motion to set aside the judgment on november.
procedural history 
the defendants removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.heineman filed a motion to dismiss contending that she was not properly served and that the district court had improper venue and lacked personal jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted heineman motion for lack of personal jurisdiction.the johnsons then filed a motion for an order of default against inmotion,which had not yet filed any pleadings in the district court.the district court denied the motion.
inmotion then filed its motion to dismiss under rule b,contending that it was not properly served,the district court did not have venue,the complaint failed to state a claim for relief,it had insufficient contacts with missouri to be sued there,and missouri was an inconvenient forum.inmotion did not raise the cda as a defense.the district court raised the cda sua sponte in its order granting inmotion motion to dismiss.
finally,lowry,pro se,filed a moving to dismiss the complaint against her,claiming that she was not properly served and that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction because she had insufficient contacts with the state of missouri.in the same motion lowry moved to set aside the default judgment on liability pending against her.
the district court entered an order dismissing the claims against inmotion with prejudice and dismissing the claims against lowry and heineman without prejudice.the district court found that lowry and heineman had insufficient contacts with the state of missouri to be subjected to personal jurisdiction there and that the cda barred claims against inmotion.the district court also set aside the state court default judgment against lowry under federal rule of civil procedure b but made no specific finding in support of that ruling.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the johnsons argue that the district court erred in dismissing the claims against inmotion,after finding that inmotion was immune from suit under the cda dismissing the claims against heineman for lack of personal jurisdiction dismissing the claims against lowry for lack of personal jurisdiction and abused its discretion in setting aside the default judgment against lowry.
communications decency act 
the johnsons first argue that the district court erroneously dismissed their claims after concluding inmotion is immune under the cda.the johnsons contend that c and e merely provide that a provider of internet services shall not be treated as the publisher or speaker of information on the internet provided by another party but does not immunize a provider from suit.the johnsons assert that missouri law provides for joint liability where a wrong is done by concert of action and common intent and purpose.according to the johnsons,the cda would only bar actions against website operators deemed to be the publisher or speaker of defamatory material.
inmotion responds that the district court correctly found that inmotion was immune from suit under the cda.additionally,inmotion asserts that it maintained no control and had no influence over the content that the johnsons alleged was posted on by unrelated third parties.because of this,inmotion maintains,it could not have acted in concert or intentionally inflicted emotional distress in a manner that caused any damage to the johnsons.
this case presents an issue of first impression for this court,as we have not previously interpreted c.statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review de novo.supply raymond,cir.the cda states that n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,c,and expressly preempts any state law to the contrary,id.e the cda defines an information content provider as any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service.id.at f.
read together,these provisions bar plaintiffs from holding isps legally responsible for information that third parties created and developed.see fair hous.council of san fernando valley,llc,cir holding that cda immunity did not apply to website that was designed to force subscribers to divulge protected characteristics,but that cda immunity did apply to the additional comments section of the website where the information was created by third parties and not required by the website isp.congress thus established a general rule that providers of interactive computer services are liable only for speech that is properly attributable to them.nemet chevrolet,cir.
the majority of federal circuits have interpreted the cda to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.almeida,cir quoting zeran am.online,cir.the district court,following majority circuit precedent,held that c blocks civil liability when web hosts and other isps refrain from filtering or censoring the information that third parties created on their sites.green am.online,cir holding that under the cda the defendant isp is not liable for failing to monitor,screen,or delete allegedly defamatory content from its site.
it is undisputed that inmotion did not originate the material that the johnsons deem damaging.inmotion is not a publisher or speaker as c uses those terms,therefore,the district court held that inmotion can not be liable under any theory to the persons harmed by the allegedly defamatory material.five circuit courts agree.see universal commc,lycos,cir affirming dismissal of a claim brought by a company against an internet message board operator for allegedly false and defamatory postings by pseudonymous posters batzel smith,cir holding that even if operator of internet services could have reasonably concluded that the information was sent for internet publication,he was immunized from liability for the defamatory speech as a provider or user of interactive computer services under the cda green am.online,at ben ezra,weinstein am.online,cir finding that defendant isp was immune to the defamation claim under the cda when it made its own editorial decisions with respect to information published on its website zeran,at holding that the cda barred claims against defendant isp that allegedly delayed in removing defamatory messages posted by unidentified third party,refused to post retractions of those messages,and failed to screen for similar postings thereafter.
district courts in this circuit have reached the same conclusion.see,patentwizard,kinko,d,holding that of the communication s decency act errs on the side of robust communication and prevents the plaintiffs from moving forward with their claims that a company that allowed users to access the internet via its computers could be held liable for the actions of one of those users.
the johnsons cite chicago lawyers committee for civil rights under law,craigslist,cir,for support.craigslist held that c as a whole can not be understood as a general prohibition of civil liability for operators and other online content hosts id.at.however,while the seventh circuit construes c to permit liability for isps,it limited that liability to isps that intentionally designed their systems to facilitate illegal acts,such as stealing music.id.at citing studios grokster,in re aimster copyright,cir.specifically,craigslist held that an isp could not be held liable for allowing third parties to place ads in violation of the fair housing act on its website if the isp did not induce the third party to place discriminatory ads.id.at.
the record contains no evidence that inmotion designed its website to be a portal for defamatory material or do anything to induce defamatory postings.we conclude that the cda provides isps like inmotion with federal immunity against state tort defamation actions that would make service providers liable for information originating with users of the service such as the other defendants in this case.
therefore we decline the johnsons invitation to construe c as permitting liability against inmotion for material originating with a third party.see zeran,at stating that precludes courts from entertaining claims that would place a computer service provider in a publisher role.thus,lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter barred.
because inmotion was merely an isp host and not an information content provider,the johnsons claims against inmotion fail as a matter of law under c,and the district court properly dismissed the claims.
personal jurisdiction 
kathleen heineman 
the johnsons next argue that the district court erred by dismissing the claims against heineman for lack of personal jurisdiction.the johnsons maintain that heineman purposefully directed internet activities at missouri citizens.the johnsons also assert that the record establishes personal jurisdiction under the missouri long arm statute.
heineman responds that the johnsons can not challenge the district court ruling because they waived any opposition by not filing a timely objection.in the alternative,heineman argues that the district court correctly ruled it lacked personal jurisdiction over her.according to heineman,the record does not reflect that she had systematic or continuous contacts with missouri or,even if she did,that they were aimed or purposefully directed at missouri.
first,as a threshold question,we address whether the johnsons may challenge the district court decision to grant heineman motion.heineman contends that the johnsons have waived any challenge to the district court order dismissing her from the lawsuit because they failed to file a timely opposition to the motion to dismiss at the district court.
heineman filed a motion to dismiss all counts against her,and the johnsons did not file a timely response.instead,two weeks after their deadline passed,the johnsons filed a motion for additional time.the johnsons then filed a response to heineman motion before the district court ruled on the johnsons motion for additional time.an affidavit from susan johnson was attached with the response.the district court denied the johnsons motion for additional time and struck the response from the record.the district court subsequently granted heineman motion to dismiss,finding that the johnsons did not respond in a timely manner,but nevertheless,out of caution,the district court stated that it considered susan johnson affidavit before ruling on heineman motion to dismiss.
it is a rule that issues not raised in the trial court can not be considered by this court as a basis for reversal.edwards hurtel,cir per curiam.the primary purpose of the rule is promptly to inform the district judge of possible errors,and thus give the judge an opportunity to reconsider the ruling and make desired changes.id.this rule is followed in all but exceptional cases where the obvious result would be a plain miscarriage of justice or inconsistent with substantial justice.kelley crunk,cir per curiam.
in shanklin fitzgerald,a plaintiff filed certain exhibits without properly authenticating the exhibits,cir.the defendant made a motion to strike the exhibits,and the plaintiff did not oppose.id.the district court granted the motion to strike,and on appeal the plaintiff contended that the district court erred in striking the motion.id.we held that a bsent exceptional circumstances,we can not consider issues not raised in the district court.id.
the johnsons distinguish shanklin by pointing out that the district court considered the affidavit from susan johnson in making a ruling on the motion to dismiss,while the shanklin court did not review any documents.also,the johnsons did attempt to oppose the motion to dismiss,although in an untimely fashion.in shanklin the plaintiff did not even attempt to file an opposition.we find merit in this argument,because the district court acknowledged that it considered some opposition to the johnson the johnsons clearly submitted for the purpose of opposing the motion to dismiss.therefore,the trial court had an opportunity to reconsider the issue of whether to dismiss knowing that the johnsons opposed dismissal.in fact,in the district court order,it specifically stated that out of caution,and because the court must construe the jurisdictional facts in the light most favorable to the johnsons,the court has considered the affidavit of sue johnson therefore,we hold that the johnsons sufficiently preserved their argument for appeal.

in missouri,to obtain personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the cause of action arose out of an activity covered by missouri statute,and the defendant had sufficient minimum contacts with missouri to satisfy the requirements of due process.

general jurisdiction 
heineman contacts with the state of must be found to be continuous and systematic before general jurisdiction is be summarized as follows she purchased cats in missouri for delivery to the johnsons personally delivered cats to the johnsons in missouri on two separate occasions conducted her cat breeding and sale business with the johnsons,using the johnsons from the johnsons location in unionville,a period of about four years,which ended two years before this lawsuit was initiated and engaged in numerous telephone conversations and email exchanges with the johnsons during that period.
heineman is a citizen and resident of colorado who sells cats and kittens throughout the united states,and advertises her business on the website.the johnsons and heineman first made contact when heineman purchased a cat from the johnsons in late or early.around april,they began a business relationship that lasted until march.during this time,heineman provided the johnsons administrative assistance with their website.she also purchased advertising space for cats she sold from colorado on the johnsons website,advertising approximately cats thereon.between and,heineman purchased about cats for the johnsons from breeders throughout the united states.these cats were generally shipped to colorado,then eventually shipped to missouri.heineman never worked as an employee of the johnsons.
applying the aftanase factors,see lakin,at,we do not find sufficient contacts between heine
