opinion of the court 
adrian peter stock appeals from the district court order denying his motion to dismiss his indictment under federal rule of criminal procedure b b for failure to state the offense of transmitting a threat in interstate commerce under c.stock argues that the term threat means the expression of an intent to inflict injury in the present or future,and that the statement attributed to him does not meet that definition.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
on august,stock was charged in a indictment that alleged 
on or about february,in the western district of pennsylvania,the defendant,adrian peter stock,did knowingly and willfully transmit in interstate commerce a communication containing a threat to injure the person of another,that is,the defendant,adrian peter stock,posted a notice on craig list,an internet web site,that contained the following statements,among others,
i went home loaded in my truck and spend the past hours looking for this douche with the expressed intent of crushing him in that little piece of shit under cover gray impala hooking up my tow chains and dragging his stupid ass down to creek hills and just drowning him in the falls.but alas i ca fine that bastard anywhere i really wish he would die,just like the rest of these stupid fucking asshole cops.so if you read this i hope you burn in hell.i only wish i could have been the one to send you there.
in violation of title,united states code,section c.
stock moved to dismiss his indictment under rule b b for failure to state an offense,arguing that his alleged statement did not constitute a threat under c as a matter of statutory interpretation,but disclaiming any first amendment challenge after holding a hearing and ordering supplemental briefing,the district court denied stock motion to dismiss.although the district court concluded that a threat must evince an intent to injure in the present or future,the court also determined that a reasonable jury could find that stock statement was a threat.
stock then executed a plea agreement with the government pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c c,in which he generally waived his appellate rights,but specifically preserved his right to seek review of the district court denial of his motion to dismiss.the district court accepted stock guilty plea and imposed a term of imprisonment of one year and one day and a term of supervised release of two years.stock timely appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction over stock case under,and we have jurisdiction over his appeal under.
we apply a mixed standard of review to a district court decision on a motion to dismiss an indictment,exercising plenary review over legal conclusions and clear error review over factual findings.united states huet,cir.in this appeal,stock attacks the sufficiency of his indictment,presenting a legal question over which we have plenary review.united states mcgeehan,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.in particular,stock challenges the sufficiency of his indictment on the basis that the specific facts alleged therein fall outside the scope of the relevant criminal statute as a matter of statutory interpretation,and statutory interpretation is a legal question over which we have plenary review.united states zavrel,cir.therefore,we exercise plenary review over this appeal.
in this appeal,both parties ascribe errors to the district court opinion.the government argues that the indictment is facially sufficient and that the term threat in c does not include a temporal element.stock,in turn,asserts that the issue of whether his statement is a threat is a question of law and that his statement does not express an intent to injure in the present or future.we address these points below.
in reviewing stock motion to dismiss,the district court considered whether the word threat in c contains a temporal component.the government argues that this analysis was unnecessary because stock indictment is facially sufficient.we disagree.
under federal rule of criminal procedure c,an indictment must be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.it is true that a n indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.huet,at emphasis omitted quotation omitted.a facially sufficient indictment contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged,sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,and allows the defendant to show with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution.id.at quotation omitted.usually,a recitation of the statutory language satisfies the first requirement,so long as there is sufficient factual orientation to permit a defendant to prepare his defense and invoke double jeopardy.id.quotation omitted.and typically,a factual orientation that includes a specification of the time period of the alleged offense is sufficient for the second and third requirements.id.in short,detailed allegations are unnecessary.id.at.
under rule b b,a defendant may contest the sufficiency of an indictment on the basis that it fails to state an offense in at least two ways.first,a defendant may contend that an indictment is insufficient on the basis that it does not satisfy the first requirement in that it fails to charge an essential element of the crime.huet,at citation omitted.second,because an indictment that merely recites in general terms the essential elements of the offense does not satisfy the second and third requirements,a defendant may also claim that an indictment fails to state an offense on the basis that the specific facts alleged fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation.united states panarella,cir.
the government asks us to ignore the statutory interpretation issue because,according to the government,the indictment is facially sufficient.the government relies on huet,in which we were asked to decide whether a district court may find facts in ruling on a motion to dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense under rule b b.responding in the negative,we reversed the district court dismissal of the indictment,which we concluded was facially sufficient.
however,huet is distinguishable because the only potential question of statutory interpretation in that case was not at issue on appeal.at.for that reason,we had no need to address whether the facts alleged in the indictment f e ll beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute as a matter of statutory interpretation.id.at citing,inter alia,panarella,at.nonetheless,we reaffirmed that a defendant may attack the sufficiency of an indictment on that basis.id.at.
here,stock is making the unmade challenge in huet namely,that as a matter of law,the indictment fails to state an offense,opening br.at,because the statements alleged in the indictment are not threats and thus fall beyond the scope of c,id.at.our precedent has recognized such attacks as an appropriate,alternative way in which to challenge the sufficiency of an indictment.see mcgeehan,at the sufficiency of an indictment may be challenged not only on the basis that it fails to charge the essential elements of the statutory offense,but also on the ground that the specific facts alleged fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation.emphasis added quoting panarella,at.thus,the district court did not err in considering whether the term threat in c includes a temporal element,a question to which we now turn.
the district court concluded that the word threat in c means an express ion of an intention to inflict injury at once or in the future.app.at quoting zavrel,at the government counters that,under controlling precedent,the term threat in c is a statement made by a speaker who means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group.response br.at quoting virginia black,d.we hold that the word threat in c encompasses only communications expressing an intent to inflict injury in the present or future.
the government proffered definition of the word threat is pulled from precedent concerning whether certain communications constitute true threats unprotected by the first amendment.the supreme court true threat jurisprudence originated in watts united states,d per curiam.there,the defendant was charged with making a threat to harm the president in violation of a.in reversing the denial of the defendant motion for judgment of acquittal,the court instructed that a statute that makes criminal a form of pure speech must interpreted with the commands of the first amendment clearly in mind.id.at.thus,the court held that a threat statute may criminalize only a true threat,id.at,which must be distinguished from constitutionally protected speech,id.at.
contrary to the government contention,the definition of the word threat and the definition of the phrase true threat are not.to be sure,watts taught us to interpret threat statutes in light of the first amendment.but by distinguishing a true threat from a threat that would otherwise fall within the scope of a statute were it not protected by the first amendment,watts shows that true threats are a specific subset of threats.thus,the plain meaning of a threat under c is distinct from the constitutional meaning of a true threat under the first amendment see united states jongewaard,cir noting that because the defendant argued that c,not the first amendment,required that a communication be made to achieve a goal through intimidation in order to constitute a threat,the court did not need to address the question of whether the statement constituted a true threat united states alkhabaz,cir concluding that the indictment failed,as a matter of law,to allege violations of section c,a nd accordingly declining to address the first amendment issues raised by the parties united states havelock,cir en banc reinhardt,concurring in part and dissenting in part explaining that because the communications were not a threat in any sense of the word,there was no need to reach the first amendment question.
the government also claims that the ordinary meaning of the word threat in c does not contain a temporal component.section c prohibits the trans mission in interstate commerce of any communication containing any threat to injure the person of another.the term threat was not defined by congress in c or in any of the related federal threat statutes.see generally.
our interpretation of the word threat in c begins with an inquiry into whether the language used has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.zavrel,at quotation omitted see also perrin united states,d a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.citation omitted.when c was last amended in,one definition of the term threat expressly included a temporal element.see black law dictionary ed.the term,threat means an avowed present determination or intent to injure presently or in the future.emphasis added.while other definitions did not do so explicitly,see,id.a threat is a communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm on any person or on property,they did so implicitly by defining threat with reference to the speaker intent,which is an inherently prospective concept,see id.at defining the word intent as a state of mind in which a person seeks to accomplish a given result through a course of action.thus,the plain meaning of the word threat in c suggests that it is confined to communications expressing an intent to injure in the present or future.
this conclusion is confirmed by a consideration of the placement and purpose of the term threat in c.zavrel,at quotation omitted.turning to the placement of the word threat,the government argues that congress criminalized any threat,which includes past as well as present and future threats.the government cites cases from two other courts of appeals adopting an expansive understanding of the noun threat based on the adjective any.in united states jeffries,the sixth circuit held that a music video was a threatening communication under c because the statute covers any threat,making no distinction between threats delivered orally in person,by phone or in writing letters,emails,faxes,by video or by song,in ways or in the most,cir.and in jongewaard,the eighth circuit held that a threatening communication under c need not be made to effect some change through intimidation because the phrase any threat criminalizes a broad spectrum of threats to injure the person of another.at.
jeffries and jongewaard do not advance the government argument for several reasons.first,neither the sixth circuit nor the eighth circuit analyzed whether the word threat in c contains a temporal component,since the communications in those cases were expressly prospective.jeffries,at jongewaard,at.second,and more significantly,the adjective any can broaden the scope of the noun threat to its natural boundary,but not beyond.alkhabaz,at to emphasize the use of the term any without acknowledging the limitation imposed by the term threat ignores the intent of congress.and third,jeffries and jongewaard lend some support to an interpretation limiting the term threat to communications revealing an intent to injure in the present or future by demonstrating that such a definition would no render the word any superfluous.havelock,at citing duncan walker.thus,the placement of the word threat within c does not counsel an interpretation contrary to the plain meaning of that term.
pushing on to the purpose of c,the government voices two concerns about cabining the word threat to its plain meaning.the government first points out that the purpose of the true threat exception to the first amendment is to protect individuals from the fear of violence,from the disruption that fear engenders,and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.response br.at quoting jeffries,at.but even if the purposes of c are identical to the purposes of the true threat exception to the first amendment,one of those purposes is expressly prospective.see city of paul,d explaining that the reason true threats are outside the first amendment is to protect people from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur emphasis added.with respect to the other two purposes,a communication demonstrating an intent to injure in the past may excite some fear of violence and may engender some disruption from that fear.but the quantum of fear and the level of disruption experienced by the victim would usually be less for an expression of an intent to injure in the past than in the present or future.for example,it seems uncontroversial that the statement,i tried to murder you yesterday,but i will never do so again,would normally provoke less fear and disruption than the statement,i will murder you tomorrow.
the government further posits that because we apply an objective test to determine whether a communication is a true threat,united states kosma,cir,under which the speaker need only have a general intent to communicate his statement,united states himelwright,cir it can not matter when,in a temporal sense,the defendant intended to injure the victim,response br.at.again assuming the applicability of the true threat test to the definition of the term threat,the sender intent would normally be indiscernible to a reasonable recipient,while the retrospective or prospective nature of the message would typically be obvious to a reasonable recipient.thus,the purposes of c do not conflict with the plain meaning of the word threat.
our interpretation of the term threat in c is also consistent with the reasoning of the other courts of appeals that have addressed this issue.for example,in havelock,the defendant was convicted of mailing,a half hour before opening kickoff,communications threatening to injure spectators at the super bowl,in violation of c.on appeal,the defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on the basis that the indictment alleged insufficient facts to state an offense because the communications did not threaten to injure immediately or in the future,but instead contained a confession or explanation of his actions,which never came to fruition,and so were devoid of a threat to injure.at.a minority,concurring in the majority judgment,but dissenting from its rationale for reversing the convictions determined that the word threat is by definition prospective,id.at reinhardt,concurring in part and dissenting in part citation omitted,because that term is defined as an indication of impending danger or harm,id.quoting united states davila,cir.in other words,the minority would have ruled that threats may include announcements of future or impending action,but not statements regarding past events or retrospective harm.id.according to the minority 
having deposited the communications in a united states postal service mailbox on the very day of the superbowl,a mere thirty minutes before his intended rampage at the stadium,the defendant communications could not have reached their intended destinations in time to put the recipients in fear of imminent danger or to constitute a threat of future action.
id.at.for this reason,the minority would have held that the communications did not contain a threat.id.at.
further,in united states landham,cir,the sixth circuit reached the same result,albeit under a true threat analysis.there,the defendant was convicted of,inter alia,transmitting a threat in interstate commerce in violation of c based on his statement,i done more to you with a parker than what happened to your father with a goddamn taurus.id.at emphasis added.on appeal,the defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because the alleged statement was not a true threat.reasoning that it was that the defendant wa s referring to damaging remarks he had previously made by transmitting written communications,the sixth circuit determined that the alleged statement refer red to past conduct,not present or future conduct.id.thus,the sixth circuit concluded that the statement was not a communication containing a threat,and held that the indictment failed,as a matter of law,to allege a violation of c.id.based on our own statutory interpretation and this persuasive authority,we hold that the term threat in c refers to the expression of an intent to inflict injury in the present or future 
notwithstanding the district court adoption of stock preferred definition of the word threat,the court determined that the case d id not turn on the statutory construction of section c,because a reasonable jury could conclude that the communication posted by defendant on craigslist constituted a threat.app.at citing huet,at.according to stock,this conclusion was erroneous because a determination of whether the facts set forth in the indictment are threats as used in c presents a question of law,not a question of fact for a jury.opening br.at citations omitted although we hold that a court may conclude that a communication does not constitute a threat as a matter of law in certain cases,we are also satisfied that the district court recognized its ability to do so here.
in the usual case,whether a communication constitutes a threat or a true threat is a matter to be decided by the trier of fact.kosma,at citations omitted see also united states white,cir united states parr,cir united states floyd,cir united states viefhaus,cir united states malik,cir.nonetheless,a few cases may be so clear that they can be resolved as a matter of law.kosma,at quoting united states merrill,cir see also viefhaus,at malik,at.
it is not unprecedented for a court to conclude that a communication does not legally qualify as a threat or a true threat.indeed,in watts,the supreme court held as a matter of law that the defendant statement was merely political hyperbole that did not fit within the definition of the phrase true threat.at.additionally,in landham,the sixth circuit reversed the district court denial of the defendant motion to dismiss,concluding that the indictment failed,as a matter of law,to allege a violation of c since the alleged statement was not a communication containing a true threat.at.
especially relevant is the decision in alkhabaz,where the sixth circuit affirmed the district court dismissal of the indictment charging the defendant with violations of c.ruling that a communication can not constitute a threat unless it is made to achieve a goal through intimidation,and reasoning that the defendant messages did not satisfy this requirement,the court concluded that those messages d id not constitute communications containing a threat under section c.at.thus,the sixth circuit held that the indictment fail ed to set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished and had to be dismissed as a matter of law.id.emphasis omitted quotation omitted.in light of this precedent,we reaffirm that a court may properly dismiss an indictment as a matter of law if it concludes that no reasonable jury could find that the alleged communication constitutes a threat or a true threat.see huet,at.
here,the record reflects that the district court clearly recognized its authority to dismiss the indictment as a matter of law.app.at the court does not foreclose the possibility that an indictment charging an individual with a violation of section c may fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation if the specific facts charged in such an indictment are clearly deficient.quoting huet,at.the district court simply declined to exercise this authority because it determined that reasonable jurors could certainly conclude that these statements constitute a serious statement or communication which expresses an intention to inflict injury on jkp at once or in the future.id.at quoting zavrel,at.we agree that,based on this underlying determination,the district court properly concluded that the question necessarily became one of fact for the jury to resolve.the propriety of the district court underlying determination is the final issue we now address.
the district court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude that the communication posted by defendant on craigslist constituted a threat based on a consideration of the alleged statement as a whole,and in the context in which the statements were made.app.at citing huet,at.stock,however,claims that,viewed in its entirety,the alleged posting reveals only statements that describe past conduct with an intent to harm,followed by a statement indicating a resignation or abandonment of purpose,followed,in turn,by expressions of ill wishes and hopes,and does not evidence an intent to injure in the present or future.opening br.at.we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that the posting,in context and as a whole,constitutes a threatening communication.
at the outset,stock contends that the district court erred in assum ing the truth not just of the making of the statement,but of the content of the statement.opening br.at.in other words,stock believes that the district court erroneously assumed that he actually engaged in the conduct described in the first sentence of his posting.in evaluating a rule motion to dismiss,a district court must accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the indictment.huet,at emphasis added citing,inter alia,united states sampson,d.here,the only fact alleged in the indictment was that stock posted a notice on craig list,an internet web site,that contained specific statements.app.at.the description of certain conduct was part of the statement that stock allegedly made,not a second factual allegation.thus,under normal circumstances,we would agree that,to the extent the district court assumed that the communication was an admission of the conduct described therein,it did so in error.
here,however,even if the district court committed the alleged error,it is doubtful that the error affected the court analysis.as the court correctly observed,an objective test is applied to determine whether the defendant sta
