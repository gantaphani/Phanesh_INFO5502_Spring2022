the united states district court for the northern district of illinois granted final judgment to eolas technologies incorporated and the regents of the university of california collectively,eolas after a jury found that microsoft corporation microsoft infringed claims and of patent the patent and actively induced united states users of internet explorer to infringe claim.the district court also invoked f to include foreign sales of internet explorer in the royalty awarded to eolas.because the district court improperly granted judgment as a matter of law jmol in eolas favor on microsoft anticipation and obviousness defenses and improperly rejected microsoft inequitable conduct defense,this court vacates the district court decision and remands for a new trial on these issues.in addition,this court affirms the district court claim construction of executable application and finds the district court did not err in its jury instruction with regard to the claim limitation utilized by said browser to identify and locate.finally,this court affirms the district court holding that components,according to section f,includes software code on golden master disks.
on february,eolas brought an infringement action against microsoft.in particular,eolas alleged infringement of claims and of the patent the patent carries the title distributed hypermedia method for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document.eolas alleged that certain aspects of microsoft internet explorer ie product incorporate its invention.microsoft denied infringement and asserted that the claims were invalid and unenforceable.
essentially,the claimed invention allows a user to use a web browser in a fully interactive environment.for example,the invention enables a user to view news clips or play games across the internet.the claims require a web browser with certain properties.specifically,the invention calls for a browser located in a distributed hypermedia environment.
in operation,the claimed browser locates a web page,or distributed hypermedia document,with a uniform resource locator url.then the browser parses the text of the web page including an embed text format specifying an object external to the web page that has type information associated with it,spreadsheets,databases.the browser next uses that type information to identify and locate an executable application that automatically enables interactive viewing of the object.the inventors have consistently maintained that t his invention was the first instance where interactive applications were embedded in web pages.the district court found that the invention was reduced to practice no later than january,when it was presented at a web conference.
during prosecution of the patent,the examiner rejected the claims several times for obviousness.besides the world wide web,http and html,the examiner cited three main prior art references during prosecution the mosaic web browser,which allows users to go from one website to another by clicking links on web pages and has some capability to display objects patent to khoyi et.khoyi,which describes an object linking and embedding system ole and patent to koppolu et.koppolu,which covers some ole technology where the application displaying data may be a component,such as an object handler that is implemented as a dynamically linked library dll the examiner allowed the claims on march.
microsoft invalidity defenses 
at trial,microsoft presented evidence that the viola web browser viola,invented by wei wei,was in public use more than one year before eolas invention.microsoft asserted that this prior art would invalidate the invention under b.microsoft also used the viola reference to challenge validity on the basis of sections a,g and.wei testified at trial that he had written code for viola so that the browser could handle embedded interactive programs in may.wei testified as well that he demonstrated that capability to sun microsystems engineers at that time.microsoft corroborated existence of this code at trial through a computer demonstration of an archived file,dated may.the parties refer to this version of viola as.wei demonstrated to two sun microsystems engineers on may.
wei also demonstrated a different version of viola to the district court.this second exhibit,was allegedly wei attempt on may,to improve.apparently due to a bug in the program,wei could not make the version function in the courtroom in conjunction with the internet.microsoft technical expert testified that both versions of the viola code taught all of the limitations of the claims at issue.
the district court found as a matter of law that wei abandoned,suppressed or concealed within the meaning of section g because wei disclosed that version only to the sun engineers and then changed it.the district court extended this finding to section b and found as a matter of law that since was abandoned,showing it to the sun engineers could not constitute a public use.the district court prevented microsoft from presenting any evidence of to the jury and later granted eolas rule motion for jmol in ruling that neither the anticipation nor obviousness defenses could be presented to the jury after hearing testimony on those issues from microsoft expert.
microsoft inequitable conduct defense 
michael doyle doyle,one of the inventors of the patent,knew of viola yet did not disclose any information regarding that reference to the united states patent and trademark office pto.on august,doyle issued a press release to an list indicating that researchers at the university of california had created software for embedding interactive program objects within hypermedia documents.that same day,wei contacted doyle via in response to the press release.wei alleged that his may demonstration of viola version to sun microsystems engineers exhibited a way to embed interactive objects and transport them over the web.wei directed doyle to his paper about viola the viola paper,which was available on the internet at least by august.doyle downloaded and read the paper.in a later email exchange,doyle attempted to get wei to concede that he was not the first to invent.additionally,doyle told wei the inventions were different.
on october,the university of california filed the patent application.in,before issuance of the patent,doyle did more research on viola and made a folder labeled viola stuff.this folder included press releases of two beta versions of viola from february and march of.although available on the internet,doyle never obtained the viola code.
the district court found that doyle knowledge of viola was not enough to trigger his obligation to bring it to the attention of the examiner of the patent.the district court determined that viola was not prior art and as such not material.although questioning doyle credibility about his role in the prosecution of the patent,the trial court nonetheless found that he had acted with candor before the pto because it was the law and it was too dangerous not to do so.
claim construction for infringement 
claim is a method claim claim a product claim.the parties and the district court focused on claim to interpret the claims because eolas asserted that the computer program product in claim embodies the method of claim.claim reads 
a computer program product for use in a system having at least one client workstation and one network server coupled to said network environment,wherein said network environment is a distributed hyperrnedia environment,the computer program product comprising 
a computer usable medium having computer readable program code physically embodied therein,said computer program product further comprising 
computer readable program code for causing said client workstation to execute a browser application to parse a first distributed hypermedia document to identify text formats included in said distributed hypermedia document and to respond to predetermined text formats to initiate processes specified by said text formats 
computer readable program code for causing said client workstation to utilize said browser to display,on said client workstation,at least a portion of a first hypermedia document received over said network from said server,wherein the portion of said first hypermedia document is displayed within a first window on said client workstation,wherein said first distributed hypermedia document includes an embed text format,located at a first location in said first distributed hypermedia document,that specifies the location of at least a portion of an object external to the first distributed hypermedia document,wherein said object has type information associated with it utilized by said browser to identify and locate an executable application external to the first distributed hypermedia document,and wherein said embed text format is parsed by said browser to automatically invoke said executable application to execute on said client workstation in order to display said object and enable interactive processing of said object within a display area created at said first location within the portion of said first distributed hypermedia document being displayed in said first window.

utilized by said browser to identify and locate means that the enumerated functions are performed by the browser the inventors contemplated the browser use of some outside resources such as the operating system as operating systems are always involved in the operation of computer programs.nevertheless it must be the browser,not the operating system,that must do the heavy lifting of identifying and locating 
statutory construction of f 
eolas claimed royalty damages for both foreign and domestic sales of windows with ie.microsoft moved,in limine,to prevent eolas from seeking damages based on foreign sales under section f.
microsoft exports a limited number of golden master disks containing the software code for the windows operating system to original equipment manufacturers oems abroad who use that disk to replicate the code onto computer hard drives for sale outside of the united states.the golden master disk itself does not end up as a physical part of an infringing product.the district court denied microsoft motion,finding that source code is the legal equivalent of a piece of computer hardware and that in a legal sense,a sic source code is a made part of a computer product.the district court determined that the code on the golden master disks constitutes components of an infringing product for combination outside of the united states under section f.
after a jury trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of eolas.the district court found that microsoft did not show invalidity of the claims microsoft did not proffer clear and convincing evidence of inequitable conduct microsoft infringed claims and and actively induced united states users of ie to infringe claim and eolas royalty for microsoft infringement should include foreign sales of the patented computer code under section f.the jury awarded eolas a royalty of per unit of infringing product,which amounted to a total award of.in its order,the district court issued a permanent injunction against microsoft and awarded interest on the award.the permanent injunction has been stayed pending this appeal.this court has jurisdiction under a.

prior art defenses 
as explained above,the district court found as a matter of law that was abandoned,suppressed or concealed within the meaning of section g because wei disclosed that version to sun microsystems engineers and then changed it.the district court extended this finding to section b,finding that abandonment of meant that the disclosure to the sun microsystems engineers could not constitute a public use.the district court prevented microsoft from presenting any evidence of to the jury and later granted eolas rule motion for jmol that did not anticipate or render the patent obvious.consequently,the jury did not consider microsoft anticipation and obviousness defenses.
the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that was abandoned,suppressed,or concealed within the meaning of section g.the relevant portion of section g states 
a person shall be entitled to a patent unless 
g before such person invention thereof,the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned,suppressed,or concealed it.
this court case law distinguishes between two types of conduct that invoke the exception within section g.apotex usa,merck.the first arises when an inventor actively conceals his invention from the public.fujikawa wattanasin.active concealment refers to situations in which an inventor designedly,and with the view of applying it indefinitely and exclusively for his own profit,withholds his invention from the public.id.the second occurs when abandonment,suppression,or concealment may be inferred based upon the prior inventor unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known.dow chem.
this case does not fit into either category.the record contains no evidence that wei either intentionally withheld from the public or unreasonably delayed a patent application or public disclosure.in contrast,the record indicates wei not only demonstrated to two sun microsystems engineers without a confidentiality agreement on may,but only days later on may,posted on a internet site and notified a sun microsystems engineer that was available for downloading.the district court erroneously concluded that the creation and public disclosure of,an improved version of,abandoned the invention under section g.
the district court conclusion inappropriately narrowed the definition of invention,as used in section g.this court interference case law illustrates this point.in interference cases,one party will sometimes assert that the other party abandoned the invention by unreasonably delaying disclosure of the invention after first reducing it to practice.however,this court excuses delay between the first reduction to practice and public disclosure if the inventor continued to refine,perfect,or improve the invention.lutzker plet,an inference of suppression or concealment may be overcome with evidence that the reason for the delay was to perfect the invention.the law does not punish an inventor for attempting to perfect his process before he gives it to the public.in fact,reasonable experimentation is frequently encouraged.frey wagner.
in this case,which includes the same contested feature as,represents an improved version of wei invention,not an entirely new invention,as the district court suggests.because creating an improved version of an invention does not in any sense abandon the original invention,the district court erroneously excluded as prior art.improvements may enhance an invention prior to disclosure or patent application.if improvements caused loss of the original invention under the erroneous rule adopted by the district court,the public would lose the benefit of diligent efforts to produce a more useful product.eolas arguments that wei changes to the functionality and architecture of show abandonment are unpersuasive because such changes merely reflect improvements in advancing versions of software code.thus,this court remands for proceedings to consider whether is prior art and,if so,whether it invalidates the patent.
this court also reverses the district court finding that wei may,demonstration to two sun microsystems employees without confidentiality agreements did not constitute a public use under section b.public use under b includes any use of the claimed invention by a person other than the inventor who is under no limitation,restriction or obligation of secrecy to the inventor.netscape communications konrad.because the sun microsystems employees were under no limitation,restriction or obligation of secrecy to wei,this court determines the demonstration may constitute a public use.
the district court erred in linking its section b public use finding to its section g abandonment finding.a public use under section b can not be undone by subsequent actions.the inquiry into a section b public use proceeds independent of the inquiry into a section g abandonment.n otwithstanding abandonment of the prior may preclude a challenge under section g prior knowledge or use by others may invalidate a patent under section a if the prior knowledge or use was accessible to the public.woodland trust flowertree nursery.similarly,third party prior use accessible to the public is a section b bar.see baxter int l,cobe.
netscape communications konrad,informs the application of these principles to this case.in netscape,konrad owned three patents.at.this court affirmed a finding of invalidity based on konrad prior demonstration of the invention to two employees at the university of california without any obligation of confidentiality.id.at.similarly,in the case at bar,wei demonstrated to two sun engineers who were under no confidentiality obligation.indeed,the sun engineers informed wei that they intended to share information gleaned from wei with other people at sun.eolas attempts to distinguish netscape on the basis that konrad was the patentee in that case,whereas here,wei is a third party.however,a third party may,and often does,initiate a public use.see,baxter,at.therefore,wei disclosure may erect a public use bar.
eolas further points to gore associates,garlock,to advance its position that section b does not apply in this case.in gore,a third party used the patented invention more than one year prior to the patentee application date and the court found no public use.id.at.gore represents a different factual situation.the third party in gore deliberately chose to keep the invention as a trade secret and avoid disclosure through a patent application.accordingly,the gore third party had a confidentiality agreement in place with its employees to prevent public disclosure of the method whose subject matter could not otherwise be publicly discerned.id.this court found the gore third party could not both elect to avoid the patent system and still invoke that system to erect a public use bar to an inventor who disclosed the invention for patenting.thus,the secret activity in gore did not constitute public use.id.this case,however,is very different.wei made no attempt to maintain confidentiality or to deliberately evade disclosure.wei activities may erect a third party public use bar.
in addition,this court vacates the district court jmol that did not anticipate the patent.to anticipate,a single reference must teach each and every limitation of the claimed invention.see emi group,cypress semiconductor.when viewed in a light most favorable to microsoft,the testimony by microsoft expert,kelly,presents a question of fact as to whether anticipates the patent.see mahurkar bard.
kelly testified that is in a computer usable medium with a program for use in a distributed hypermedia environment.further,kelly observed key features in,such as a method to parse a hypermedia document to identify text formats,to display at least a portion of the hypermedia document on a client workstation,to include an embed text format that specifies the location of an object external to the hypermedia document,to identify and locate an executable application,and to automatically display the object and enable the user to interact with it.this testimony arguably supports microsoft argument that teaches all of the limitations of the patent.the district court dismissed kelly testimony as conclusory.this court hesitates to disturb the district court role in assessing evidence,but anticipation is a question of fact.accordingly,this particular determination lay within the province of the jury.
the district court also erred in its granting jmol on obviousness.kelly testimony provided sufficient evidence to survive jmol.in his testimony,kelly discussed the scope of and the potential differences between and and the claimed invention and the state of the art and the level of skill in the art in.kelly testimony could also be read to provide a suggestion to use a browser in a distributed hypermedia environment as in the claimed invention.although microsoft direct examination of kelly focused on anticipation,the information solicited from kelly might also support an argument of obviousness in the alternative.in light of this court determination that was not abandoned or concealed,microsoft should also have the opportunity to present as part of its obviousness defense.see panduit dennison,indicating that a key preliminary legal inquiry in obviousness analysis is what is the prior art.weighing the facts in favor of the party,as required by rule,a reasonable jury should have the opportunity to determine whether the claimed invention would have been obvious at the time of invention based on the record.
in sum,with respect to the district court prior art rulings,this court finds the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that was abandoned,suppressed or concealed within the meaning of section g wei may,demonstration to two sun microsystems employees without confidentiality agreements was a public use under section b and the district court erred in its jmol that did not as a matter of law anticipate or render the patent obvious.as a result,this court remands for additional proceedings on these issues.
inequitable conduct 
this court also vacates the district court decision on inequitable conduct.again the district court based its inequitable conduct finding on the misunderstanding that viola could not possibly constitute prior art.relying on that erroneous determination,the district court concluded that viola could not be material to patentability.as discussed above,the district court erred in determining that was abandoned,suppressed or concealed within the meaning of section g.further,the district court did not explain a reason for declining to consider,also created prior to doyle invention,as immaterial to patentability of the patent.in respect to potential prior art software under section b,this court has explained that the software product constitutes prior art,not necessarily the later published abstract associated with that software product.in re epstein.similarly,in the case at bar,the viola browser itself,not the later developed viola paper or viola stuff file,constitutes prior art.on remand,the district court will have an opportunity to include this potential prior art in its inequitable conduct inquiry.at the same time,the district court may reconsider its findings on doyle intent to deceive the pto.
claim construction 
when interpreting disputed claim terms,this court accords claim terms their customary meaning in the art at the time of invention.home diagnostics,lifescan.further,a construing court should consult the specification to determine whether the patentee gave a claim term a meaning inconsistent with that customary meaning in the proper technological and temporal context.metabolite,lab.of am.holdings.
the district court construed executable application to mean any computer program code,that is not the operating system or a utility,that is launched to enable an end user to directly interact with data.microsoft asserts that this term should be construed as standalone programs.because,absent a disclaimer,the claims of the patent are not limited to the embodiments listed in the specification,this court affirms the district court construction.
as construed by the district court,executable application includes applications or components that are not standalone,dlls such as spell check.such applications or components can only run when invoked by some other application.microsoft asserts that its construction is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term and that the specification does not otherwise define the term.microsoft correctly points out that all of the disclosed embodiments in the specification describe standalone programs,word processors and spreadsheets.nonetheless,absent a clear disclaimer in the specification,the embodiments in the specification do not limit broader claim language.medrad.
the record shows that the term executable application does not have a customary meaning in the computer science field.therefore,the district court appropriately declined to impose a sharp limitation on its scope.accordingly,the trial court correctly perceived that application means a computer program,that is not the operating system or a utility,that is designed to allow an to perform some specific task.the district court also found support for this meaning in technical dictionaries.for instance,the microsoft press computer dictionary defined application as a computer program designed to help people perform a certain type of work.an application thus differs from an operating system which runs a computer,a utility which performs maintenance or chores,and a language with which computer programs are created microsoft press computer dictionary ed.a few years later,the same dictionary defined application as a program designed to assist in the performance of a specific task,such as word processing,accounting,or inventory management.compare utility.microsoft press computer dictionary ed.still another source on the meaning of technical language defines application as a program or group of programs designed for end users.zd webopaedia,at http.
neither the specification nor the prosecution history disclaims the district court construction of executable application.the patent makes no reference to the phrase executable application except in the claims.see generally the patent.in addition,the specification repeatedly indicates that the preferred embodiment is only one possibility for practice of the invention.id.because this court consistently declines to construe claims according to the preferred embodiment,this court agrees with the district court that microsoft proposed construction,limiting executable application to standalone programs,does not comport with the entire technological and temporal context for this term.telecom samsung elecs.
the prosecution history does not disclaim the district court construction of executable application,and thus supports the trial court reading of the term.according to microsoft,the applicants argued that the khoyi patent used library routines,components,while their invention did not.in addition,microsoft claims the applicants argued the koppolu patent taught away from using standalone applications.a review of the prosecution history does not show any disclaimer as microsoft contends.
the applicants distinguished khoyi on the grounds that the display of the data object provided by the khoyi functionality was not interactive,and in the invention such interactivity could be achieved without requiring capabilities in the operating system.thus,the applicants distinguished khoyi on the feature of interactivity,not on its use of standalone programs.while the applicants included language about library routines and dlls in their response,they did not distinguish the invention based on these features,rather such features were merely included in language that outlined khoyi operation.similarly,the applicants distinguished koppolu by pointing out that the particular kind of object handlers of koppolu did not allow interactive processing of the object,because koppolu did not enable such editing of the object.
in light of the applicant arguments distinguishing khoyi and koppolu,the examiner statement that the claimed external executable application is not a code library extension nor object handler windows dll and ole as pointed out in applicant argument.paper pages,appears in the context of the applicant narrow argument.thus,the examiner statement also does not evince a clear disclaimer.the arguments the examiner cited in the reasons for allowance simply describe ole object handlers.the applicants cite problems with ole object handlers,but do not disclaim anything.they simply argue that the cited references do not disclose or suggest the missing features.in addition,the applicant has no obligation to respond to an examiner statement of reasons for allowance,and the statement of an examiner will not necessarily limit a claim.acco brands,micro sec.devices,see also telecom,at requiring that prosecution history statements have reasonable clarity and deliberateness to narrow claim scope.overall,without a narrow customary ordinary meaning for executable application,the district court correctly gleaned the proper definition of the term from the intrinsic evidence including the patent claims and prosecution history.
turning next to the jury instruction on utilized by said browser to identify and locate,the district court informed the jurors that t he inventors contemplated the browser use of some outside resources such as the operating system.a review of the trial record shows that microsoft waived its right to appeal this issue.
microsoft commented on the proposed jury instructions to the district court.in discussing the particular sentence microsoft now takes issue with,microsoft counsel stated to the district court,it undisputable,but it also immaterial the fact that operating systems are involved in the operation of computer programs,so what the district court sought at that point to clarify the record n o one is arguing here that the browser can not use the operating system it simply ca be done and,in essence,microsoft is not taking the crazy position that what they mean is the browser ca use the operating system at all.microsoft counsel responded,that correct.
thus,the record shows that microsoft did not properly preserve this issue for appeal.it is rare indeed for appellate relief to be granted when no objection was raised at trial under such circumstances,the question devolves into whether an error occurred in the conduct of the trial that was so grievous as to have rendered the trial unfair.norian stryker,internal citation and quotation omitted.this court detects no grievous unfairness in this instruction despite microsoft argument that a properly instructed jury could not have possibly found that the accused products infringe.as a whole,the jury instruction properly guided the jury.thus,the district court did not err in its jury instruction on this disputed claim term.
this court must also decide whether software code made in the united states and exported abroad is a component of a patented invention under section f.section f states
