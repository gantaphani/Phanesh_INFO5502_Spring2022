justin hill conditionally pled guilty to possession of child pornography subject to his challenge to the admission of evidence that he contends was seized in violation of the fourth amendment.his appeal involves the validity of a warrant to search his computer and storage media for evidence that he possessed pornographic,lascivious images of children.we must also decide whether it was reasonable under the fourth amendment for the police to take all of hill computer storage media from his home they did not find his computer so they could conduct their search offsite in a police laboratory,rather than carrying out the search onsite and taking only whatever evidence of child pornography they might find.as we recently discussed in united states adjani,cir,because computers typically contain so much information beyond the scope of the criminal investigation,searches can raise difficult fourth amendment issues different from those encountered when searching paper files.judge kozinski,sitting as the district court in this case,thoughtfully addressed some of these issues in a published opinion upholding the validity of the search warrant and its execution.united states hill,d.we affirm the district court ruling in most but not all respects for the reasons judge kozinski stated to the extent we do agree with that reasoning,we adopt it verbatim in this opinion.in sum,we affirm the district court denial of the defendant motion to suppress evidence.
background 
as the district court explained 
a computer technician was repairing defendant computer when she discovered what she believed to be child pornography.she called long beach police,and the detective who took the call obtained a search warrant from a judge of the long beach superior court.the warrant authorized a search of the computer repair store and seizure of the computer,any work orders relating to the computer,all storage media belonging to either the computer or the individual identifying himself as defendant at the location,and all sexually explicit images depicting minors contained in the storage media.by the time the detective arrived at the store to execute the warrant,defendant had picked up his computer t he detective submitted an affidavit,which included the computer technician sworn statement describing the images.on the basis of this affidavit,the officer obtained a second warrant,this one directed at defendant home,authorizing seizure of the same items.
the affidavit on which the warrants were based described two images of child pornography 
is a color picture of a female,white,approximately years old,with long dark brown hair.the female is in a room standing between a couch and a coffee table.there is a framed picture on the wall above the couch.she is wearing only a long blouse and pair of socks.the blouse is open and she is exposing her breast and pubic area to the camera,which she is facing while leaning to her left.
is a color picture of a sic in affidavit two females,white,approximately years of age,both with dirty blond hair.these females are standing on a beach during the daytime.the shorter of the two females is standing to the right of the picture while the other female is standing behind her.both females are facing the camera askew and wearing only a robe,which is open exposing the undeveloped breast and pubic area of both girls.they both are turning their faces away from the camera preventing the viewer from seeing their faces.
officers executed the search warrant but did not find the computer in defendant apartment in what appeared to be defendant bedroom,they found and seized computer storage media,specifically floppy disks,two,floppy disks and six zip disks.two of the zip disks were eventually determined to contain images of child pornography officers also seized other evidence consistent with the warrant.defendant was subsequently charged with one count of possession of child pornography in violation of a b.
hill,d at alterations in original.
in the district court,the defendant moved to suppress the evidence recovered from the two zip disks on the grounds that,contrary to the magistrate finding,the warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause to believe the defendant was guilty of criminal activity and the warrant was overbroad in allowing seizure of all discovered computer storage media with no regard to whether such media contained child pornography,and in placing no limitation on the police officers search of the seized disks.id.at the district court denied the motion to suppress and the defendant conditionally pled guilty to the charge,reserving the right to appeal the district court evidentiary ruling this timely appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
probable cause 
the defendant argues first that the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause to believe the defendant was guilty of criminal activity.we do not agree.
n o warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.the constitution is clear a magistrate may authorize a search of a location only if officers establish probable cause to believe evidence of a crime may be found there.probable cause means only a fair probability,not certainty,and requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances.illinois gates,d.accordingly,we must determine whether the officer affidavit,which described the two images from the defendant computer as showing three different,minor girls with their breasts and pubic areas exposed,established a fair probability that there was child pornography or evidence thereof to be found in computer hardware or software at the defendant home.we agree with the district court that the affidavit did establish probable cause,but reach that conclusion somewhat differently.
child pornography is a particularly repulsive crime,but not all images of nude children are pornographic.for example,a family snapshot of a nude child bathing presumably would not be criminal.hill,d at.moreover,the law recognizes that some images of nudity may merit first amendment protection because they serve artistic or other purposes,and possessing those images can not be criminal.see osborne ohio,d upholding ohio child pornography law because it had been interpreted to criminalize possession of images depicting not just nudity,but nudity constitut ing a lewd exhibition new york ferber,d n udity,without more,is protected expression.images depicting minor s engag ed in sexually explicit conduct are,however,prohibited.a.s exually explicit conduct,in turn,is defined to include graphic or simulated lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.a v emphasis added.thus the more precise question we must answer is whether the officer affidavit established probable cause that the images on the defendant computer see hill,d at.in answering that question,it is important to remember that in issuing the search warrant,the magistrate had to make a practical,commonsense decision,based on the totality of the circumstances presented to him in the affidavit,that there was a fair probability that the images were lascivious.see united states gourde,cir en banc 
various courts have attempted to articulate a test for determining lasciviousness.many have relied upon a test originated in united states dost 
whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child genitalia or pubic area 
whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive,in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity 
whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose,or in inappropriate attire,considering the age of the child 
whether the child is fully or partially clothed,or nude 
whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity 
whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.

the district court,analyzing each of these six factors,found dost to be not particularly helpful in determining whether a given image is or as applied to the images here.see hill,d at.instead,the court fashioned a new test that would create a presumption of lasciviousness,and therefore probable cause,i f an image of a minor displays the minor naked genital area,unless there are strong indicators that the image is not lascivious.id.at.although we appreciate the district court careful analysis and critique of dost,we do not think it necessary to adopt a new test or to deny the utility of dost in the context of this case.
the dost factors can be a starting point for judges to use in determining whether a particular image is likely so presented by the photographer as to arouse or satisfy the sexual cravings of a voyeur.wiegand,at.but the factors are neither exclusive nor conclusive.dost itself acknowledged that it did not seek to offer a comprehensive definition of lasciviousness,because a determination of lasciviousness ha s to be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction.at.the factors are merely general principles as guides for analysis.id.for instance,we have already recognized that,in some instances,the factors may be over generous to defendants.wiegand,at see also united states amirault,cir we believe that the dost factors are generally relevant and provide some guidance in evaluating whether the display in question is lascivious.we emphasize,however,that these factors are neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation.although dost provides some specific,workable criteria,there may be other factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains a lascivious exhibition.the inquiry will always be.
ultimately,probable cause is a fluid and nontechnical conception not readily susceptible to multifactor tests or rebuttable presumptions.see maryland pringle,d t he standard is a nontechnical conception and a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules it is incapable of precise definition or quantification internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the magistrate,relying on dost as a guidepost or on some other test for lasciviousness,need only make a practical,decision that the description presented in the affidavit demonstrates a fair probability that the images are lascivious.gates,at.see also gourde,at wiegand,at the definition of lasciviousness is a matter of law.
based on our independent review of the affidavit describing the two images,we are satisfied that the state judge finding of probable cause was well within his discretion.there was a fair probability that the images were so presented by the photographer as to arouse or satisfy the sexual cravings of a voyeur.wiegand,at see also id.necessarily in deciding whether the district court erred as to the facts in determining that the images were lascivious,we must view the pictures ourselves and must interpret the statutory term.the affidavit described in some detail the images of three partially nude children,who were provocatively and unnaturally dressed in light of the photographs settings.the girls clothing was opened so as to reveal their breasts and pubic areas,with the girls appearing in sexually suggestive poses moreover the descriptions themselves did not raise doubts that the images served some purpose other than that proscribed in wiegand battershell,at holding that an affidavit describing a young female yoa naked in a bathtub is insufficient to establish probable cause to believe the image is lascivious.the affidavit was sufficient to create a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to believe that evidence of a violation of a b could be found on the defendant computer.see gates,at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
overbreadth 
seizure of all computer media 
the defendant argues that the search warrant was overbroad because it authorized the officers to seize and remove from his home his computer and storage media without first determining whether they actually contained child pornography.given the nature of computers and storage media,this argument sweeps too broadly,as the district court explained in addressing the defendant suggested limitations on the nature and scope of the search 
search warrants must be specific.specificity has two aspects particularity and breadth.particularity is the requirement that the warrant must clearly state what is sought.breadth deals with the requirement that the scope of the warrant be limited by the probable cause on which the warrant is based.united states towne,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a warrant describing a category of items is not invalid if a more specific description is impossible.united states spilotro,cir.the level of specificity required varies depending on the circumstances of the case and the type of items involved.id.
the warrant here commanded the officers to search for and seize an ibm clone medium tower personal computer all storage media belonging to either item or the individual identifying himself as defendant at the location.all sexually explicit images depicting minors contained in item.defendant argues the warrant was overbroad because it authorized seizure of storage media whether or not they contained child pornography.he suggests it should have authorized seizure only of media containing child pornography.but it is impossible to tell what a computer storage medium contains just by looking at it.rather,one has to examine it electronically,using a computer that is running the appropriate operating system,hardware and software.the police had no assurance they would find such a computer at the did they,for that that,if they found one,they could bypass any security measures and operate it.
defendant suggests that the police could have brought their own laptop computer having probable cause to seize only computer storage media that contained certain types of files,the police should have been required to bring with them the equipment necessary to separate the sheep from the goats.defendant argument raises an important question about how police must execute seizures pursuant to a warrant.because seizable materials are seldom found neatly separated from their counterparts,how much separating must police do at the scene to avoid taking items that are neither contraband nor evidence of criminal activity 
as always under the fourth amendment,the standard is reasonableness.to take an extreme example,if police have probable cause to seize business records,the warrant could not authorize seizure of every piece of paper on the premises on the theory that the police conducting the search might not know how to read 
t he court concludes that the police were not required to bring with them equipment capable of reading computer storage media and an officer competent to operate it.doing so would have posed significant technical problems and made the search more intrusive.to ensure that they could access any electronic storage medium they might find at the scene,police would have needed far more than an ordinary laptop computer.because computers in common use run a variety of operating versions or flavors of windows,mac os and linux,to name only the most would have had to bring with them a computer or computers equipped to read not only all of the major media types,but also files encoded by all major operating systems.because operating systems,media types,file systems and file types are continually evolving,police departments would frequently have to modify their computers to keep them.this would not be an insuperable obstacle for larger police departments and federal law enforcement agencies,but it would pose a significant burden on smaller agencies.
even if the police were to bring with them a properly equipped computer,and someone competent to operate it,using it would pose two significant problems.first,there is a serious risk that the police might damage the storage medium or compromise the integrity of the evidence by attempting to access the data at the scene.as everyone who has accidentally erased a computer file knows,it is fairly easy to make mistakes when operating computer equipment,especially equipment one is not intimately familiar with.the risk that the officer trying to read the suspect storage medium on the police laptop will make a wrong move and erase what is on the disk is not trivial.even if the officer executes his task flawlessly,there might be a power failure or equipment malfunction that could affect the contents of the medium being searched.for that reason,experts will make a copy of the medium before they start manipulating its contents.various other technical problems might arise without the necessary tools and expertise to deal with them,any effort to read computer files at the scene is fraught with difficulty and risk.
second,the process of searching the files at the scene can take a long time.to be certain that the medium in question does not contain any seizable material,the officers would have to examine every one of what may be thousands of files on a process that could take many hours and perhaps days.taking that much time to conduct the search would not only impose a significant and unjustified burden on police resources,it would also make the search more intrusive.police would have to be present on the suspect premises while the search was in progress,and this would necessarily interfere with the suspect access to his home or business.if the search took hours or days,the intrusion would continue for that entire period,compromising the fourth amendment value of making police searches as brief and as possible.
hill,d at alteration in original and internal citation omitted.
we agree with the district court that under the circumstances here,the warrant was not fatally defective in failing to require an onsite search and isolation of child pornography before removing storage media wholesale.that does not mean,however,that the government has an automatic blank check when seeking or executing warrants in searches.although computer technology may in theory justify blanket seizures for the reasons discussed above,the government must still demonstrate to the magistrate factually why such a broad search and seizure authority is reasonable in the case at hand.there may well be situations where the government has no basis for believing that a computer search would involve the kind of technological problems that would make an immediate onsite search and selective removal of relevant evidence impracticable.thus,there must be some threshold showing before the government may seize the haystack to look for the needle.
our cases illustrate this principle.in united states hay,for example,we held permissible a generic classification authorizing seizure of an entire computer system and virtually every document in the defendant possession without referencing child pornography or any particular offense conduct because,although officers knew that a party had sent images of child pornography directly to the defendant computer,they had no way of knowing where the images were stored,cir.similarly united states lacy allowed blanket seizure of the defendant entire computer system,cir.we reasoned that no more specific description of the computer equipment sought was possible,because the agents did not know whether the images were stored on the hard drive or on one or more of the defendant many computer disks.accord united states upham,cir holding,in a child pornography case,that the seizure and subsequent search of the computer and all available disks was about the narrowest definable search and seizure reasonably likely to obtain the images.significantly,in both hay and lacy we carefully noted the critical role played by the officers affidavits supporting the warrants.see hay,at t he affidavit explained why it was necessary to seize the entire computer system in order to examine the electronic data for contraband.it also justified taking the entire system off site because of the time,expertise,and controlled environment required for a proper analysis.lacy,at in the affidavit supporting the search warrant application,a customs agent explained there was no way to specify what hardware and software had to be seized to retrieve the images accurately.
by contrast,although the warrant in this case authorized a wholesale seizure,the supporting affidavit did not explain why such a seizure was necessary.see united states adjani,at noting favorably an affidavit computer search and seizure protocol explaining when a computer had to be searched offsite,because s uch specificity increases our confidence that the magistrate judge was well aware of what he was authorizing and that the agents knew the bounds of their authority in executing the search dep t of justice,searching and seizing computers and obtaining electronic evidence in criminal investigations,july recommending that if agents expect that they may need to seize a personal computer and search it to recover the relevant evidence,the affidavit should explain this expectation and its basis to the magistrate judge.the affidavit should inform the court of the practical limitations of conducting an search,and should articulate the plan to remove the entire computer from the site if it becomes necessary.united states tamura,cir if the need for transporting the documents is known to the officers prior to the search,they may apply for specific authorization for removal of material,which should be granted by the magistrate issuing the warrant only where on site sorting is infeasible and no other practical alternative exists.
we do not approve of issuing warrants authorizing blanket removal of all computer storage media for later examination when there is no affidavit giving a reasonable explanation,such as that provided in hay and lacy,as to why a wholesale seizure is necessary see tamura,at t he wholesale seizure for later detailed examination of records not described in a warrant is significantly more intrusive,and has been characterized as the kind of investigatory dragnet that the fourth amendment was designed to prevent quoting united states abrams,cir.without such individualized justification being presented to the magistrate,we can not be sure that the judge was aware of the officers intent and the technological limitations meriting the indiscriminate thus was intelligently able to exercise the court oversight function.an explanatory statement in the affidavit also assures us that the officers could not reasonably describe the objects of their search with more specificity.see united states kow,cir generic classifications in a warrant are acceptable only when a more precise description is not possible.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also upham,at of course,if the seized images themselves could have been easily obtained through an inspection,there might have been no justification for allowing the seizure of all computer equipment,a category potentially including equipment that contained no images and had no connection to the crime.accordingly,we hold that the warrant here was overbroad in authorizing a blanket seizure in the absence of an explanatory supporting affidavit,which would have documented the informed endorsement of the neutral magistrate.see tamura,at the essential safeguard required is that wholesale removal must be monitored by the judgment of a neutral,detached magistrate.
nonetheless,as in tamura,we conclude that suppression of the evidence of child pornography found on the defendant seized zip disks is not an appropriate remedy.tamura involved an indiscriminate seizure of all files found in an office even though the warrant authorized the officers to search for only three categories of records for evidence of various alleged crimes.see id.at.although we refused to sanction the wholesale seizure for later det
