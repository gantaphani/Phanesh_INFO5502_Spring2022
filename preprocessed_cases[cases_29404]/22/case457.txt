appellant christopher osinger osinger challenges his conviction for stalking in violation of.osinger asserts a facial challenge to as unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to his conduct.
osinger also maintains that the district court sentence of months imprisonment was unreasonable because his acceptance of responsibility and a sentencing disparity warranted a more lenient sentence.we affirm osinger conviction and sentence.
background 
osinger was indicted for engaging in a course of harassing and intimidating conduct in violation of a and b.the indictment alleged that osinger sent several threatening and sexually explicit text messages,emails,and photographs of,a former girlfriend,to,as well as to her and friends.the indictment also alleged that osinger used the internet to create a facebook page in a name close to.name to post suggestive and explicit photos of and demeaning statements,purportedly made by 
prior to trial,osinger sought dismissal of the indictment,asserting that a was unconstitutionally vague.the district court ruled that a was not unconstitutionally vague and denied osinger motion to dismiss the indictment.
at trial,testified that she was introduced to osinger through a mutual friend.osinger subsequently became roommate and they became romantically involved.during their relationship,allowed osinger to take nude photographs of her.
osinger told that he had divorced his wife in.eventually moved out of the apartment she shared with osinger and ended their relationship when she discovered that osinger was still married.did not provide osinger with her new address because she did want him to contact her.osinger contacted and told her that he knew where lived and that he wanted to be with.according to,osinger repossessed cars and could easily find addresses after osinger spoke with,telephoned osinger because she wanted him to stop looking for her family or friends,and she wanted to hear what he had to say.
osinger later came to new residence in an attempt at reconciliation.osinger arrived in the early hours of the morning,like,in the morning.did not answer when he knocked on her window or door because she did want to speak to him.osinger also came to her work a few times.
when eventually agreed to meet with osinger,he told her that he was getting a divorce.osinger left copies of divorce papers in mailbox,but doubted their authenticity because they lacked the signature of osinger wife or any court stamps.informed osinger that she was not interested in continuing their relationship and moved in with her sister.did not tell osinger that she was living with her sister and did not provide him with the address.nevertheless,osinger called and texted and eventually came to her sister home.informed him that she was not interested in reviving their relationship.
after received an offer for a new position in california,she informed osinger that she was leaving illinois.osinger told her that he would do anything for them to be back together,and was upset that left without saying goodbye.did not provide her california address to osinger.
following her relocation to california,continued to receive text messages from osinger,including messages that he wanted one last chance.contacted osinger when he stated that he would move to california.told osinger to stop texting her,to stop calling 
continued to receive text messages from osinger despite her remonstrations.considering the content of the messages,inferred that osinger had sexually explicit videos of her.construed the text messages as a threat.she subsequently received a telephone call from an exboyfriend who informed her that someone had posted a facebook page with nude pictures of and horrible content when viewed the facebook page,she recognized the photographs as ones that osinger had taken of her.feared that her family might see the photographs,as one of her cousins had already accepted the facebook posting.
contacted carlos enriquez,her supervisor,to assist her in removing the facebook page.was crying hysterically and could not believe what osinger had done,and she was just shocked.enriquez removed the facebook page and informed that he had been contacted by another employee who had received an through his company web with nude pictures of.received a telephone call from a former in chicago that he had also received an with nude pictures.
eventually reported the incidents to the torrance police department because she was scared.she did not know what else osinger was going to try to do.ultimately obtained a restraining order against osinger.
enriquez corroborated testimony regarding her emotional state and his assistance in removing the facebook page.enriquez stayed with because she was really bad,still shaking and kind of desperate.enriquez also received an email at work with some pictures and with really bad content enriquez contacted company headquarters to have the email blocked.when enriquez informed about the email,she started to cry and shake.
jason roberts,former in chicago,testified that he received some pretty disturbing on his corporate account.roberts informed,who was very,very disturbed,very upset 
darek pawelek,testified that he received a facebook invite that he thought was from,although the name was spelled differently.when pawelek informed of the facebook page content,s he got really upset.she started crying,saying things like she did know why he is doing this.why wo he leave her alone 
the jury found osinger guilty of stalking in violation of a and b as alleged in count one of the indictment.
at sentencing,osinger objected to the recommendation from the probation officer that a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility was unwarranted.osinger also asserted that a more lenient sentence was supported by the month sentence of another defendant convicted of violating osinger requested a prison sentence and twelve months in a halfway house.
the district court calculated a base offense level of,an adjusted offense level of,and a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.the district court rejected osinger request for a downward adjustment premised on acceptance of responsibility.after considering the requisite a factors,the district court sentenced osinger to months imprisonment,at the low end of the guidelines range,and three years of supervised release.
osinger filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standards of review 
a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is reviewed de novo.united states berry,cir citation omitted.we also review de novo when a criminal statute is challenged for vagueness.id.citation omitted.
we review a sentence for both procedural error and substantive reasonableness united states joseph,cir citation omitted.we review for clear error the district court finding that osinger did not accept responsibility for his crime.united states ramos medina,cir,as amended,cert.denied.citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
constitutionality of 
facial challenge 
osinger contends that is facially unconstitutional because it prohibits speech protected by the first amendment.osinger also argues that a is overly broad because it does not define substantial emotional distress or harassment.
in a facial challenge,a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement united states harris,cir,as amended,cert.denied.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.although we have not extensively addressed the first amendment implications of a,other circuits have rejected similar facial challenges.
for example,in united states petrovic,cir,the eighth circuit observed that a n overbreadth challenge will rarely succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct necessarily associated with speech such as picketing or demonstrating.id.at citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.section a is directed toward courses of conduct,not speech,and the conduct it proscribes is not necessarily associated with speech id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.most,if not all,of the statute legal applications are to conduct that is not protected by the first amendment.id.citation and alteration omitted.additionally,t he rare application of the statute that offends the first amendment can still be remedied through litigation.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.because a substantial number of the statute applications will not be unconstitutional,the eighth circuit decline d to use the strong medicine of overbreadth to invalidate the entire statute.id.citations,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.
we agree with the eighth circuit rationale that,because.proscribes harassing and intimidating conduct,the statute is not facially invalid under the first amendment.in particular,specifically criminalizes a course of conduct that causes substantial emotional distress to the harassee.b emphasis added.additionally,provides that t he term course of conduct means a pattern of conduct composed of or more acts,evidencing a continuity of purpose.thus,the proscribed acts are tethered to the underlying criminal conduct and not to speech.moreover,we concur in the eighth circuit reasoning that,b ecause the statute requires both malicious intent on the part of the defendant and substantial harm to the victim,it is difficult to imagine what speech would fall under these statutory prohibitions.petrovic,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see also united states sayer,wl,at cir.may,rejecting facial challenge to a on similar grounds 
osinger argument that a is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define harass or substantial emotional distress is equally unavailing.vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons to avoid punishing people for behavior that they could not have known was illegal to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by government officers and to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of first amendment freedoms united states kilbride,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.none of these reasons applies here.
contrary to osinger argument,harass and substantial emotional distress are not esoteric or complicated terms devoid of common understanding.see,adams ford motor,f d,cir black dictionary ed defines harassment as words,conduct,or action usu.repeated or persistent that,being directed at a specific person,annoys,alarms,or causes substantial emotional distress in that person and serves no legitimate purpose see also veile martinson,cir describing substantial emotional distress to be understood by persons of common intelligence to mean mental distress,mental suffering,or mental anguish,and includes depression,dejection,shame,humiliation,mortification,shock,indignity,embarrassment,grief,anxiety,worry,fright,disappointment,nausea,and nervousness,as well as physical pain in the context of a state stalking statute citations omitted.as the fourth circuit observed in united states shrader,cir,cert.denied,w hatever other definitions one might hypothesize for the meaning of harass or intimidate,there can be little doubt that the defendant stalking falls within the conduct the statute is intended to proscribe.the defendant own words evince his intent to cause substantial emotional distress in short,we reject the defendant contention that his stalking convictions must be overturned on vagueness grounds.id.at citation,alteration,footnote reference,and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,requires that the defendant act with the intent to harass,intimidate,or cause substantial emotional distress.see a.this scienter requirement,which the jury found had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt,thoroughly undermines osinger contention that he was unable to discern that his harassment of was proscribed by.see united states jae gab kim,cir,as amended a scienter requirement may mitigate a law vagueness,especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed citation omitted.
osinger threats,creation of a false facebook page with sexually explicit photographs of,and emails to and friends containing explicit photographs evinced osinger intent to cause substantial emotional distress.thus,osinger unrelenting harassment and intimidation of was not based on conduct that he could not have known was illegal.kilbride,at 
as applied challenge 
osinger next contends that a was unconstitutionally applied to his protected speech.
in an challenge,a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to put a defendant on notice that his conduct was criminal.for statutes involving criminal sanctions the requirement for clarity is enhanced.harris,at citations,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
osinger challenge is unpersuasive given the nature of the implicated speech.the first amendment prohibits any law abridging the freedom of speech.however,the supreme court has carved out some limited categories of unprotected speech,including obscenity,defamation,fraud,incitement,and speech integral to criminal conduct.united states meredith,cir,cert.denied.sub.nom.giordano united states citations,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.at issue here is the first amendment exception that allows the government to regulate speech that is integral to criminal conduct id.at.
in meredith,we considered whether the defendants convictions for advocacy of tax evasion violated the first amendment.see id.at.in addition to selling books explaining how to avoid taxes,the defendants sold a particular type of financial trust which they claimed was exempt from taxes id.at.the defendants were charged with conspiring to defraud the united states by impeding,impairing,obstructing,and defeating the lawful functions of the irs in the ascertainment,computation,assessment,and collection of federal taxes,in violation of id.in rejecting the defendants first amendment argument,we observed that in those instances,where speech becomes an integral part of the crime,a first amendment defense is foreclosed even if the prosecution rests on words alone.id.at citation,alteration,and footnote reference omitted.because the defendants conduct involved far more than mere advocacy of tax evasion,the first amendment was not implicated by the defendants speech integral to criminal conduct.id.at,citation omitted.
although meredith implicitly undermines osinger argument that he engaged in protected speech,other circuits have explicitly rejected challenges to a.in petrovic,the defendant sent the victim text messages stating that he had sexually explicit images of her,which the defendant subsequently mailed as postcards to the victim family and workplace.see petrovic,at.the defendant also designed a website containing links to the images.see id.at.in rejecting the defendant challenge,the eighth circuit reasoned that the defendant communications fall outside the first amendment protection because t he communications for which the defendant was convicted under a were integral to this criminal conduct as they constituted the means of carrying out his extortionate threats id.at citation omitted.
in shrader,the fourth circuit similarly rejected the defendant challenge.in that case,the defendant made a series of harassing phone calls to the victim and her family.see shrader,at.the fourth circuit observed that t he statute contains three important elements.first,the defendant must possess either the intent to kill,injure,harass,or place under surveillance with intent to kill,injure,harass,or intimidate,or cause substantial emotional distress to a person in another state id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.second,the defendant must pursue that intention through a course of conduct,defined as a pattern of conduct composed of or more acts,evidencing a continuity of purpose,that makes use of a facility of interstate commerce.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the defendant conduct must in fact cause substantial emotional distress to the intended victim or place that person in reasonable fear of the death of,or serious bodily injury id.citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.based on the defendant harassing and intimidating conduct,the fourth circuit held that the statute clearly proscribed the defendant particular conduct in this case.there can be little doubt that the defendant conduct was harassing and intimidating id.at.as a result,the defendant own words evince his intent to cause substantial emotional distress id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we reach a similar conclusion in this case.pursuant to a,osinger engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to harass,or intimidate,or cause substantial emotional distress to told osinger repeatedly that she no longer wanted to be contacted by him.nonetheless,osinger was unrelenting in his pursuit and harassment of her,including threatening text messages.osinger designed a false facebook page and sent emails to containing nude photographs of any expressive aspects of osinger speech were not protected under the first amendment because they were integral to criminal conduct in intentionally harassing,intimidating or causing substantial emotional distress to meredith,at.pursuant to a,osinger was on notice that his harassing and intimidating conduct was criminal.harris,at 
in the limited context of,osinger speech is not afforded first amendment protection for the additional reason that it involved sexually explicit publications concerning a private individual.in petrovic,the eighth circuit observed that the victim was a private individual and that the defendant communications revealed intensely private information about the victim.at citation omitted.the eighth circuit opined that the interstate stalking statute is viewpoint neutral.it proscribes stalking and harassing conduct without making the further content discrimination of proscribing only certain forms of that conduct.id.at citation omitted.t he intimately private facts and photographs revealed by the defendant were never in the public domain before the defendant began his campaign to humiliate the victim.id.at.additionally,the public has no legitimate interest in the private sexual activities of the victim or in the embarrassing facts revealed about her life,and the information the defendant publicized to the community was highly offensive.id.citations omitted.the communications for which the defendant was convicted under a may be proscribed consistent with the first amendment.the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.id.
osinger challenge is similarly unavailing given his intent to harass and intimidate a private individual by circulating sexually explicit publications that were never in the public domain.applying the logic of petrovic and shrader,we reject osinger challenge to.
osinger sentence 
acceptance of responsibility 
osinger asserts that the district court erred in denying his request for a downward departure premised on acceptance of responsibility.according to osinger,he intended to plead guilty and proceeded to trial only to preserve his constitutional challenge to.
the sentencing guidelines allow district courts to grant a downward adjustment to a defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.ramos medina,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the defendant bears the burden of showing that he has accepted responsibility for his actions.id.citation omitted.
at trial,osinger did not simply pursue his first amendment challenge to.instead,osinger asserted that his actions were the legal equivalent of being prosecuted for ripping the label off a mattress his counsel argued that osinger was charged with stalking in the absence of evidence to prove it.there is no history of any violence.there is no history of any threat of violence.there is no history that he ever waited outside her house.there is no history that he ever visited her in los angeles.his counsel maintained that w hat the government is asking in this case is that the conviction rest solely on the fact that somebody hurt somebody else feelings really,really badly.osinger also challenged the jurisdictional basis for the charges by arguing that he thought that he was communicating only with individuals in chicago where osinger resided.osinger asserted that there was no evidence of any threats and that he did not direct the to,as he sent them only to her.osinger argued that there was n o evidence of repetitious conduct and no evidence of malice.a love obsession is not malice finally,osinger maintained that he was not guilty of stalking because he did not contact after sending the pictures.on this record,the district court did not clearly err in finding that osinger actions were inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility ramos medina,at.
in addition to challenging his guilt at trial,osinger failed to demonstrate the requisite contrition to warrant a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.see united states dhingra,cir,as amended holding that the defendant did not meet his burden of demonstrating genuine contrition for his acts citation omitted.osinger expressed that he deeply regret ted his conduct.however,he conveyed his regrets in the context that as in many breakups things were said and done that people regret.here,osinger said and did things out of anger rather than directly accepting responsibility for his conduct,osinger intimated that his actions stemmed from refusal to reconcile.such equivocal expressions of contrition did not meet the defendant burden of demonstrating genuine contrition for his acts,and it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to deny downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.dhingra,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
sentencing disparity 
finally,osinger contends that his sentence was unreasonable because another defendant received a more lenient sentence despite engaging in more extensive and intrusive stalking.however,osinger was not similarly situated to the defendant who received a more lenient sentence after pleading guilty in a different case.see united states espinoza baza,cir it does not matter for the purposes of a that the defendant can point to other criminal defendants who may have received lighter sentences under materially different circumstances citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.osinger sentencing disparity argument is undermined by his more extensive criminal history.see id.observing that the defendant was not similarly situated to other defendants because t here is nothing in the record suggesting that these other defendants had comparable criminal histories citation omitted.moreover,osinger sentence was at the low end of the guidelines range.see united states green,cir we have trouble imagining why a sentence within the guidelines range would create a disparity,since it represents the sentence that most similarly situated defendants are likely to receive.citation and alteration omitted.we hold that osinger sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable.
iv.conclusion 
we adopt the reasoning articulated by the eighth and fourth circuits in petrovic and shrader and hold that osinger facial and challenges to are unavailing.osinger threatening messages to and his sending of sexually explicit photographs to and friends unquestionably evinced osinger intent to harass and intimidate and to cause substantial emotional distress.osinger course of conduct was unmistakably proscribed by,and any related speech was not afforded first amendment protection,as it was integral to osinger criminal conduct and involved sexually explicit publications concerning a private individual.
the district court sentence of months imprisonment,at the low end of the guidelines range,was reasonable because osinger was not entitled to any downward adjustment premised on acceptance of responsibility or on sentencing disparity.
i agree with my colleagues that christopher osinger conviction and sentence for violating should be affirmed,notwithstanding his first amendment objections.i write separately to add a few additional thoughts on why osinger challenge fails.
i agree with the court that osinger speech is entitled to first amendment protection because it was speech integral to criminal conduct.see united states stevens,giboney empire storage ice.this exception to the first amendment has been and remains controversial its boundaries and underlying rationale have not been clearly defined,leaving the precise scope of the exception unsettled.see eugene volokh,speech as conduct generally applicable laws,illegal courses of conduct,situation altering utterances,and the uncharted zones,cornell.but whatever difficulties may arise from application of the exception in other contexts,it surely applies when the defendant commits an offense by engaging in both speech and conduct,and the sole objective of the speech is to facilitate the defendant criminal behavior.in those circumstances,the defendant speech loses whatever first amendment protection it might otherwise have enjoyed,even if the speech,considered in isolation,would be fully protected.
that,in my view,is the proper reading of giboney.there,a labor union engaged in conduct that amounted to,as the court later put it,a secondary boycott which a state had validly outlawed.new york ferber.specifically,the union orchestrated a series of agreements among kansas city ice distributors under which they pledged not to sell ice to nonunion peddlers,conduct that violated missouri law.giboney,at.when the lone holdout distributor empire refused to join the boycott,the union informed empire that it would use other means at its disposal to force empire to come around to the union view.id.union members began picketing empire with placards protesting its willingness to deal with peddlers.the avowed immediate purpose of the picketing was to compel empire to agree to stop selling ice to nonunion peddlers an agreement that would have been punishable as a felony under missouri law.id.empire sought an injunction prohibiting the picketing.
although the union was engaged in peaceful picketing that publicize d truthful facts about a labor dispute speech which,standing on its own,would have been fully protected under the first court held that the union speech could not be treated in isolation.id.at.the union speech lost whatever first amendment protection it might otherwise have enjoyed,the court concluded,because it was used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute,and its sole immediate object was to facilitate the union commission of that offense.id.that the union unlawful course of conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language mattered not for first amendment purposes.id.at.
osinger case fits comfortably within this formulation of the exception for speech integral to criminal conduct.as in giboney,we dealing with a valid criminal statute no one disputes that,as a general matter,congress has the power to punish those who engage in interstate stalking.and the court properly rejects osinger facial challenge to the particular variant of that crime at issue here engaging in a course of conduct intending to harass or inflict substantial emotional distress on a person in another state.a.as i sketch out below,osinger committed the crime of interstate stalking by engaging in a course of conduct that consisted of both speech and conduct.true,osinger engaged in some speech that,considered in isolation,might have been entitled to first amendment protection.but as the court correctly holds,that speech lost whatever protection it might have enjoyed because its sole immediate object was to facilitate his commission of the stalking offense.giboney,at.
like many stalking offenses,this one began with a failed relationship.the victim in this case,broke up with osinger when she discovered that he was married to another woman.a few months after ended their relationship,osinger began showing up uninvited at home.on multiple occasions,he arrived around or and telephoned her or knocked at her window or door.refused to speak with him,but osinger continued to make unwanted visits to her home anyway.he also appeared several times at the restaurant where worked.after these encounters,moved to another neighborhood,hoping that osinger unwanted visits to her home,at least,would stop.
they did.as a repossession agent,osinger could easily get addresses for people he wanted to find,and he successfully tracked down at her new home.the two briefly reconciled,but that ended when concluded that osinger had given her fraudulent divorce papers and was seeing other women.after ending their relationship for the final time,moved in with her sister,hoping osinger would be able to find her there.but despite decision to conceal her new address from osinger,he surprised her by showing up at her sister apartment.he also called her and sent her text messages.responded by telling osinger their relationship was over.
after a year of dealing with osinger harassing behavior,moved from illinois to california,in part to get away from him.she did tell osinger where she was moving,and she did give him her new address.for months,she had no direct contact with him.appeared to have made a clean break she had a new job,a new home,and what she believed was a fresh start with osinger out of her life.
then,out of the blue,osinger started contacting again.over the course of two days,she received approximately text messages from him.the messages started out with declarations of love,but they quickly turned nasty,you truly are the devil.i hate you i hate when made it clear that she would not give him another chance.from there,osinger messages took on a threatening tone 
trust me after this weeknd ur going to feel like i ass fukd 
am going to make sure u fucking hate me.after this weeknd.
so buckle up.this ride is over just yet 
if i was you i get a big bottle.to drink.ur going to need it.
so enjoy what to come.
a m about to pull the rug from rite under ur sexxy lil feet 
that weekend,osinger made good on his threats.got a call from an who told her that he had received a friend request from what appeared to be a fake facebook account set up under her name with a minor spelling error.when accessed the facebook page,she was horrified by what she saw.someone osinger,it turned out had posted over photos of,many of them sexually explicit,organized into two albums titled whore and.some of the photos showed topless or bottomless.others showed her partially or fully nude and masturbating.still others showed her performing oral sex.the statements posted on the page,purportedly made by,included i like to go out and be the whore i am i uslly get a job and fuck my bosses rite now i work for company name redacted look me up pass my pix around i just move to city redacted,and if you want video,just send me ur email.osinger sent friend requests to family members and friends to encourage them to view the facebook page.
immediately called her boss to enlist his help in taking the facebook page down before any more of her friends or family members saw it.during that call,boss told her that one of her,who also happened to be roommate,had just received a disturbing email sent to his company account.the email,sent by osinger,stated that he knew the recipient was working with,offered supposed tips on what to do if the recipient wanted to sleep with,and ended by saying,if you want video send a mesg back i got tons.the email attached some of the photos osinger had posted on the facebook page,depicting partially or fully nude and performing oral sex.osinger later sent the same email,lewd photos included,to boss and one of former in chicago,before the company it department blocked osinger email address.
after learning about the fake facebook page and the disturbing emails osinger had sent to her,was understandably distraught.as she testified at trial,i was scared.i did not know what else he was going to try to do.quickly sought and received a restraining order against osinger.
as these facts show,osinger engaged in a course of conduct that amounted to interstate stalking.it began in illinois when he harassed by repeatedly showing up at her home and workplace,despite her efforts to avoid him.it continued after she moved to california,initially through a string of unwelcom
