the state of illinois sued hemi group llc for selling cigarettes to illinois residents in violation of state laws and for failing to report those sales in violation of federal law.the district court denied hemi motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,finding that the internet transactions sufficed to establish personal jurisdiction over hemi in illinois.we affirm.
background 
hemi,based out of new mexico,sells discount cigarettes through its many websites.customers may place orders online or through mail,telephone,or fax.customers online may determine their shipping costs by inputting their zip codes on the website.illinois alleges that hemi sold cigarettes to illinois residents through its websites.the only specific sales to an illinois resident that illinois identified in its complaint were instigated by a special senior agent of the illinois department of revenue,who purchased more than three hundred packs of cigarettes from websites in and.
on several of its websites,hemi states that it will not sell cigarettes to new york residents on one of those sites,it explains that ongoing litigation in new york led to the decision not to sell cigarettes there.on another of those sites,hemi notes that it sells to every state except new york.hemi does not specifically single out illinois residents on any of its websites.
hemi pays the federal tax on the cigarettes that it sells via its websites,but illinois law leaves it to the buyers to pay the applicable state tax on cigarettes purchased over the internet or by mail,phone,or fax.hemi websites direct customers to check with their states to determine their responsibility for paying state taxes.
the parties agree that hemi is not a resident of illinois.it is not incorporated or organized under illinois law,it is not registered to do business in illinois,it does not have any offices or employees in illinois,it does not bank in illinois,and it has not advertised in print media in illinois.
illinois sued hemi in illinois state court for failing to submit to illinois monthly reports of sales to illinois residents as required by the jenkins act,for violating the prevention act by shipping cigarettes to illinois residents that were not licensed distributors or export warehouse operators,and for violating the enforcement act and the consumer fraud act by selling brands of cigarettes to illinois residents that were not in the illinois directory.
hemi removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court denied hemi motion,finding that hemi purposefully availed itself of the opportunity to do business with illinois residents and that due process was not offended by exercising personal jurisdiction over hemi.the district court,however,stayed the proceedings below to allow hemi to pursue this interlocutory appeal of the district court order.
ii.analysis 
the sole question on appeal is whether the district court in illinois may properly exercise personal jurisdiction over hemi.we review questions of personal jurisdiction de novo.kinslow pullara,cir.
scope of illinois constitution 
because the jenkins act does not provide for service of process,the district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over hemi only to the extent that a court of general jurisdiction in illinois could.k a.illinois statute provides for jurisdiction on any basis now or hereafter permitted by the illinois constitution or the constitution of the united states.ilcs c.the district court may exercise jurisdiction only if both the state and federal constitutional requirements are satisfied.see sabados planned parenthood of greater indiana.
the illinois constitution allows a state court to exercise personal jurisdiction only where it is fair,just,and reasonable considering the quality and nature of the defendant acts which occur in illinois or which affect interests located in illinois.citadel group washington reg l med,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the illinois supreme court has stated that the scope of illinois statute may not be with the jurisdictional aspect of the federal due process clause in any particular situation,rollins ellwood,subsequent courts have noted that no case has yet arisen where federal due process would allow the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant but the illinois constitution would not.see kinslow,at hyatt int l coco,cir sabados,at.hemi argues,however,that a series of recent illinois appellate court decisions demonstrates that illinois does in fact require more than federal law.see estate of isringhausen prime contractors and associates,hanson ahmed,sabados,bolger nautica int l.
we are not convinced.none of the cases cited by hemi even suggests,much less holds,that there is a meaningful difference between the federal and illinois due process standards.in fact,the court in case cited by hemi in support of its that the distinction was theoretical,and that it was unaware of any case actually holding that personal jurisdiction could be satisfied under the federal constitution,but not the illinois constitution.at citing kostal pinkus dermatopathology,ill.we are not interested in usurping illinois conceptualization of due process.however,we are still unable to discern an operative difference between the limits imposed by the illinois constitution and the federal limitations on personal jurisdiction.hyatt int l,at.therefore,we will limit our analysis to whether exercising jurisdiction over hemi comports with the federal guarantee of due process.see citadel group,at.
federal constitutional limits on personal jurisdiction 
we recently described the current state of the constitutional dimension of personal jurisdiction 
t he defendant must have minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.those contacts may not be fortuitous.instead,the defendant must have purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum state before personal jurisdiction will be found to be reasonable and fair.crucial to the minimum contacts analysis is a showing that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in the forum state,because the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities there.
kinslow,at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court held,and illinois does not appear to disagree,that hemi does not have the continuous and systematic general business contacts with illinois to justify exercising general jurisdiction over hemi.illinois hemi group llc,wl,at,see also rar,turner diesel,cir.therefore,we consider only whether the district court may exercise specific jurisdiction over hemi.
minimum contacts 
we find that hemi contacts with illinois were sufficient to satisfy due process.hemi maintained commercial websites through which customers could purchase cigarettes,calculate their shipping charges using their zip codes,and create accounts.hemi stated that it would ship to any state in the country except new york.this statement is important for two reasons.first,hemi expressly elected to do business with the residents of states.although listing all states by name would have made a stronger case for jurisdiction in this case,inasmuch as it would have expressly stated that hemi wanted to do business with illinois residents,the net result is the stood ready and willing to do business with illinois residents.neogen neo gen screening,cir.and hemi,in fact,knowingly did do business with illinois residents.in light of this,hemi argument that it did not purposefully avail itself of doing business in illinois rings particularly hollow.
second,the fact that hemi excluded new york residents from its customer pool shows both that hemi knew that conducting business with residents of a particular state could subject it to jurisdiction there and also that it knew how to protect itself from being haled into court in any particular state.due process requires that potential defendants should have some control certainly should not be surprised jurisdictional consequences of their actions.rar,a
