respondent department of commerce commerce removed petitioner neal bross bross from his position as a computer specialist for illegally downloading child pornography from the internet to his government computer.bross seeks review of the decision by the merit systems protection board board upholding his removal.bross dep t of commerce,final order.we affirm.
background 
bross was employed by the department of commerce,bureau of the census census where he worked as a computer specialist.on september,bross entered a census bureau building at approximately,accessed an illicit internet web site from his government computer,and downloaded images of child pornography.based on this conduct,bross was subsequently charged and pled guilty in federal district court to a one count violation of,which prohibits the possession of visual images depicting individuals less than years of age engaged as subjects of sexual conduct.he was sentenced to three years probation on conditions that included,inter alia,regular counseling,the possibility of searches by a probation officer of any computer home or work that he might use,and notification of his employer of these conditions and restrictions on his computer use.
before this incident,bross employment record was unblemished he had even been awarded the census bureau bronze medal for exemplary performance.the parties do not dispute that bross took responsibility for his actions was involved in counseling and was in compliance with the terms of his probation.bross conviction for use of his government computer to access child pornography was the first case of this nature for census.
bross was covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and his union.the procedures for designating officials for disciplinary action were therefore governed by the memorandum of understanding,dated september,the mou that had been negotiated between census and bross union.under the mou,division chiefs or their equivalents will normally serve as both proposing and deciding official on actions,although a higher level management official may be the proposing and deciding official for cases.at.
the parties agree that,pursuant to the mou,bross division chief,thomas wright wright,would normally serve as both the proposing and deciding official in actions such as bross,unless he was replaced by a higher management official in a case.
in initial discussions of bross case with the agency,it appeared that wright and bross more immediate were favoring an adverse action short of removal,while the agency human resources and legal officials were advocating removal.after these initial meetings,wright informed his supervisor,cynthia clark clark of the matter.clark testified that she noted the serious nature of the case and that upon hearing wright support for an adverse action short of removal,indicated to wright that she would likely be the proposing and deciding official in the case.at.clark stated that she understood her authority to displace wright as the proposing and deciding official in bross case to be based upon the mou.id.at.
ultimately,clark acted as both the proposing and deciding official.on march,clark sent bross a letter proposing removal based on his conduct unbecoming a government employee and misuse of government equipment.bross and his lawyer provided an oral response to the proposal,noting bross previously unblemished employment history and the alleged victimless nature of his offense.they also furnished written documents in support of bross reply,including a letter from his counselor describing treatment of bross sexual addiction.
clark subsequently removed bross for his misconduct,in accordance with the advance notice and final decision procedures required by statute in.clark final decision letter made bross removal effective as of april.she noted that bross response had been unable to direct her to a single case where an employee accessed images of minors,under the age of years,engaged in sexual acts,who was not removed from service and that a ccessing possessing child pornography,which victimizes children,is decidedly more serious than accessing or possessing a pornographic image of an adult.at.
in reaching her final decision for removal,clark weighed mitigation factors including bross thirteen years of service,commendable performance,and the absence of any prior disciplinary actions in his record.she found these factors outweighed by the nature and seriousness of the offense,its relationship to his job as a computer specialist,and its effect on his ability to satisfactorily perform his duties and the notoriety of the offense and its impact upon the reputation of the agency.id.she further found that bross was unable to convince her that he would not repeat this type of misconduct.id.
bross timely appealed the agency removal action to the merit systems protection board the board.on january,an administrative judge reversed the agency action,sustaining the merits of the agency charges against bross but nonetheless finding that the agency had violated the mou and committed harmful error by ordering the removal of bross by decision of an agency official other than his division chief,in a case that was not.bross dep t of commerce,slip op.at,initial decision.on february,commerce filed a petition for review,to which bross responded on april,and subsequently filed a for review on april.
on september,the board issued its final order,sustaining the agency removal action and reversing the initial decision insofar as it found that the agency committed harmful procedural error affirming the initial decision insofar as it found that the agency proved its charge and denying bross for review.bross,at.
the board final order held that census did not violate the terms of the mou.id.at.specifically,the board found that the mou vested the authority in the agency to remove cases at the agency discretion to a official,and that bross case was because no census bureau employee had ever been accused of or charged with the type of misconduct and the criminal nature distinguishes this case significantly from the other cases of unauthorized computer use.id.at.
bross timely filed an appeal on november.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and b.
discussion 
we must sustain the board decision unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
the sole question presented by this case is purely procedural,that is,whether the petitioner was removed in violation of procedures specified in a labor agreement,the memorandum of understanding we find that substantial evidence on the record supports the board conclusion that the memorandum of understanding was not violated.
the statute and the office of personnel management regulations do not designate which level of agency official should make a decision on an adverse action proposal.however,the statute does provide that the agency and the union may negotiate procedures regarding adverse actions.specifically,b states nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.the supreme court has held that the board is required to enforce the procedural protections provided by labor agreements.cornelius nutt,d.thus,we must determine whether the labor agreement in this case was violated.
paragraph of the mou provides 
division chiefs or their equivalents will normally serve as both proposing and deciding official on actions.at.
paragraph a of the mou states,in relevant part 
a higher level management official may be the proposing and deciding official for actions in cases.at emphasis added.
we think the agreement is clear that the question of discipline must be addressed by the division chief or equivalent,unless a higher level of manage
