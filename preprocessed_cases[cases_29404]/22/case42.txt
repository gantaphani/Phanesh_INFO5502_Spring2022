this case involves a dispute over the simultaneous use of two similar internet domain names by two separate entities.northern lights club,jeff burgar and alberta collectively northern lights or defendants appeal a preliminary injunction entered by the district court requiring the posting of a specified disclaimer on their world wide web site portal page.the court entered the injunction after finding that northern light technology,northern light or plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits of its state and federal trademark claims and its claim under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,d acpa.
defendants assert three bases for relief in this interlocutory appeal that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction,and hence the power to enjoin them that the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims and that the injunction currently in place is overly broad and consequently infringes their rights.finding that the district court properly acquired jurisdiction over defendants when their agent was served with process within the forum state,and discerning no basis for disturbing the district court determination on the likely success of plaintiff suit,we uphold the district court issuance of a preliminary injunction.and because defendants only obliquely pressed their first amendment argument before the district court,we decline to decide the issue for purposes of this appeal.
background 
the facts of this case are extensively chronicled in the district court opinion,see northern light,northern lights club,d,and so we confine our discussion to the events relevant to this appeal.on september,plaintiff registered the internet domain name with network solutions,nsi,which at that time was the organization exclusively entrusted with the task of registering domain names on the world wide web plaintiff also filed registration papers for the northern light service mark with the united states patent and trademark office pto during that same month nearly a year later,in august,plaintiff began its operation of the website and,consequently,its use of the northern light mark in commerce as a search engine.search engines are popular tools that match a search query submitted by an internet user with the websites whose content best corresponds to the submitted search terms.the site has remained in continuous existence as a search engine since august.
defendant jeff burgar,a resident of high prairie,alberta,canada,is the president and principal shareholder of alberta,an alberta corporation that owns the domain name.burgar,a internet entrepreneur,has,since the,registered thousands of catchy domain names,internet addresses appropriating,in identical or slightly modified form,the names of popular people and organizations.he is also the president of northern lights club,an unincorporated association with a listed address in las vegas,nevada.while northern lights club stated mission is to bring together devotees of the northern lights,or aurora borealis,including businesses that take their name from the famous celestial phenomenon,burgar testimony indicates that the club has no actual individual members.
in october,approximately one month after plaintiff registered its website,burgar,on behalf of northern lights club,registered the domain name with nsi soon after registration,burgar licensed the name to flairmail,a vanity service that he manages and that is owned by a local alberta newspaper burgar believes that this newspaper is owned by his wife.under this arrangement with flairmail,defendants offered accounts under the domain name that users could access through some other website,such as,although internet users who attempted to visit the page on the world wide web would find that no such site existed 
the two similar registrations enjoyed a peaceful coexistence until march,when a usa today story on internet search engines erroneously identified plaintiff website as.after ascertaining that defendants were the owners of this domain name,plaintiff marketing director contacted burgar to find out whether defendants might be interested in selling it.the parties exchanged a series of proposals and counterproposals by over a period but ultimately no sales or licensing agreement was consummated.soon thereafter,in april,defendants posted an active page on the world wide web site.visitors to the site saw,among other things,a function near the top of the screen that enabled users to perform a search of the site for specific words or phrases,as well as links to flairmail and other members of the northern lights community.plaintiff web site was placed third in the list of the northern lights community business listings.plaintiff had not agreed to this listing.
on july,plaintiff sent burgar a letter,demanding that the site be deactivated.defendants chose not to respond to this letter.fifteen days later,plaintiff asked nsi to strip defendants of the domain name based on the similarity of their respective marks,but nsi declined,citing the discrepancy between the name of defendant website and plaintiff trademark.on august,plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit under federal and state theories of unfair competition,trademark infringement,and trademark dilution.in its complaint,plaintiff sought both a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.in december,plaintiff amended its complaint to add a claim under acpa which had been enacted into law less than one month earlier and to abandon its federal claim and its claims of unfair competition and trademark dilution.
moments before the district court hearing on september,to consider the merits of plaintiff claims and the court personal jurisdiction over defendants,plaintiff agent physically served process upon burgar,who had traveled voluntarily to boston from alberta to witness the proceedings and to make himself available for testimony if needed.although the hearing itself focused largely on the convoluted issues of personal jurisdiction arising from internet activities,it also touched upon the merits of plaintiff request for preliminary injunctive relief.at the end of the hearing,the district court indicated that it would issue a temporary restraining order modifying the content of the site to prevent further public confusion,and solicited advice from both parties as to the appropriate substance of that order.
true to its word,the district court imposed the tro the following day,stating that northern light had successfully demonstrated probable personal jurisdiction,that it would be likely to succeed in its suit,and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored temporary relief.the court ordered that defendants remove all content from the site and post in its place a screen containing only an image of the aurora borealis and links to three websites where users could access their accounts plaintiff site and the content page that formerly existed at,to be described,for purposes of the link,as businesses that are listed with the northern lights community.on the same day that this ruling was issued,the parties jointly moved the court for a continuance of at least days.in this joint motion,defendants acquiesced in an extension of the restraining order against them until discovery and further hearings in the matter were conducted,and the parties agreed to a schedule governing the completion of discovery and the filing of any additional motions.the court granted this motion,and both parties submitted further motions during this period.after granting several motions for extensions of time,the district court ultimately held hearings on january and,on the issue and the merits of plaintiff request for preliminary relief.
in its written opinion issued on march,the district court ordered,inter alia,that what had become a de facto preliminary injunction should remain in place in so doing,the court began by holding that it had personal jurisdiction over defendants it determined that plaintiff had satisfied sections c and d of the massachusetts statute,see.laws ch,because defendants had likely caused tortious injury to plaintiffs in massachusetts,both through their acts within the commonwealth in the form of their website and their regular solicitation of business through acts outside of the commonwealth by virtue of,inter alia,the site entice ment to users to post material.see d at.the court also found that defendants had sufficient contacts with massachusetts to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction under international shoe washington,thereby satisfying the constitutional element of personal jurisdiction.see northern light,d at.
on the merits of plaintiff suit,the district court found that,based on the likelihood of confusion between the two websites because of their similar form and function,plaintiff state and federal and causes of action would probably succeed.see id.at.the court further opined that plaintiff was likely to succeed on its acpa claim,based on the confusing similarity of the two domain names and proof of defendants intent to profit from plaintiff mark.see id.at.on the latter issue,the court reasoned that,although burgar initial reluctance to sell the site and defendants uninterrupted use of the name for vanity accounts militated against a finding,defendants historical practice of targeting trademarked names,creating fictional entities to register them,and offering dubious explanations for the selection of these domain names ultimately tipped the scales in favor of such a preliminary determination.id.at.finally,the district court found that plaintiff had established a likelihood of irreparable harm,that the balance of hardships favored the plaintiff,and that the public interest favored the preservation of the preliminary injunction already in place.see id.at.
on appeal,defendants dispute the district court ruling and aspects of its decision regarding the likelihood of plaintiff success on the merits.defendants also pursue their argument,not expressly considered by the district court,that the present injunction unduly burdens their first amendment rights.
ii.personal jurisdiction 
defendants first challenge the injunction entered by the district court on the ground that the court was without personal jurisdiction to order such a remedy.at each stage of the proceedings,the parties have contested whether defendants activities,both in terms of the content of their website and their discussions with the plaintiff regarding a potential business venture,meet the criteria of the massachusetts statute and the requirements of due process.plaintiff also posited a more conventional basis for personal jurisdiction in the district court namely,the service of process effected upon burgar just prior to the september,preliminary injunction hearing.we afford plenary review to the district court determination of personal jurisdiction,and may affirm its judgment for any independent reason supported by the record.see,phillips exeter acad.howard phillips fund,cir.
the district court expressly declined to consider the validity of personal jurisdiction based on physical service of process.see d at.on appeal,however,plaintiff continues to press its case that,under the doctrine of transient jurisdiction,it has satisfactorily created jurisdiction through its service of process on burgar prior to the september,hearing.see burnham superior court of,d plurality opinion schinkel,holding that personal jurisdiction in massachusetts need not be predicated on statute when defendant served with process while in forum under doctrine.defendants dispute this proposition,claiming that this method of service of process is fundamentally unfair in that it represents a trap for the unwary litigant who travels to the forum state solely to contest the issue of personal jurisdiction.defendants also argue that permitting service of process under these circumstances is unwise from a perspective in that it discourages the litigant from actively assisting the district court in the jurisdictional discovery process.
although they do not specifically ask for process immunity,defendants argument against personal jurisdiction essentially boils down to a request that burgar be deemed immune from service of process since,at the time he was served,he was present in massachusetts only for the purpose of attending a hearing in this lawsuit.this argument enjoys some measure of historical pedigree,albeit in a related context.long before the supreme court in burnham affirmed that personal jurisdiction can be sustained against a defendant solely on the basis of his presence in the forum state at the time of service of process,it had recognized that some parties temporarily in the forum state enjoy immunity from service by virtue of their status as participants in ongoing litigation.for instance,in lamb schmitt,the court noted the potential peril of allowing an individual who is attending a proceeding in one suit to be served with process in conjunction with another 
t he due administration of justice requires that a court shall not permit interference with the progress of a cause pending before it,by the service of process in other suits,which would prevent,or the fear of which might tend to discourage,the voluntary attendance of those whose presence is necessary or convenient to the judicial administration in the pending litigation.
id.at.internal citations omitted.similarly,justice scalia plurality opinion in burnham referred to several states historical imposition of statutory or prohibitions on the service of process of those individuals present in the forum as parties or witnesses in unrelated judicial proceedings a practice that led him to conclude that transient jurisdiction comported with constitutional due process.see at.
accompanying the courts repeated recognition of the validity of the immunity exception,however,has been a persistent acknowledgment of the exception limitations.the lamb court itself noted that,because the privilege exists for the convenience of the district court in its exercise of judicial administration,rather than to protect the individual seeking to avoid service of process,courts enjoy the discretion to confer or deny immunity in such instances.see at.citing stewart ramsay.just as importantly,the extension of the privilege has been limited by the majority of courts to cases in which the party or witness was participating in an unrelated litigation at the time that he was served with process in the forum state.see,arw exploration aguirre,cir denying process immunity where party was served with process in second lawsuit while attending deposition in first lawsuit alleging similar facts in re fish neave,cir similar lacroix american horse show ass n,applying lamb and denying defendants claim of entitlement to immunity based on appearance in forum state solely to contest personal jurisdiction charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.there is generally no immunity from service of process when the suit in which immunity is sought is part of,or a continuation of,the suit for which the person claiming immunity is in the jurisdiction.see also lamb,at.t he privilege should not be enlarged beyond the reason upon which it is founded,and should be extended or withheld only as judicial necessities require.the rationale for the prerequisite to process immunity in this context is relatively straightforward while a court can,in cases before it,choose to protect the jurisdictional status of a party or witness who is reluctant to come to the forum state by issuing protective orders or subpoenas,it can not wield such power in other cases.the exception therefore fills the gap only where it needs to be filled that is,in cases where a district court wishes to shield an individual from service of process to encourage his or her travel to the forum state,but would be unable to do so absent the power to grant immunity.
turning to the facts of this case,several features of defendants litigation posture counsel against a finding that burgar is entitled to process immunity.first,and most apparent,is the fact that defendants have never asked the district court for such immunity on behalf of burgar,either prior to or following the hearing at which burgar was served with process.in lieu of a
