while executing a search warrant at the home of defendant christopher adjani to obtain evidence of his alleged extortion,agents from the federal bureau of investigation seized adjani computer and external storage devices,which were later searched at an fbi computer lab.they also seized and subsequently searched a computer belonging to defendant jana reinhold,who lived with adjani,even though she had not at that point been identified as a suspect and was not named as a target in the warrant.some of the emails found on reinhold computer chronicled conversations between her and adjani that implicated her in the extortion plot.relying in part on the incriminating emails,the government charged both adjani and reinhold with conspiring to commit extortion in violation of and transmitting a threatening communication with intent to extort in violation of d.
the defendants brought motions to suppress the emails,arguing that the warrant did not authorize the seizure and search of reinhold computer and its contents but if it did,the warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad or,alternatively,the emails fell outside the scope of the warrant.the district court granted the defendants motion to suppress the email communications between reinhold and adjani,finding that the agents did not have sufficient probable cause to search reinhold computer,and that once they discovered information incriminating her,the agents should have obtained an additional search warrant.the government appeals this evidentiary ruling,but only with respect to three emails dated january.
the district court ruling on the motion to suppress is subject to de novo review.united states,cir.we review de novo a district court determination regarding the specificity of a warrant,including whether it is overbroad or not sufficiently particular.united states wong,cir.we hold that the government had probable cause to search reinhold computer,the warrant satisfied our test for specificity and the seized communications fell within the scope of the properly issued warrant accordingly,we reverse the district court order suppressing the january,email communications between reinhold and adjani.
background 
a.the extortion scheme 
adjani was once employed by paycom billing services formerly epoch,which facilitates payments from internet users to its client websites.as a payment facilitator,paycom receives and stores vast amounts of data containing credit card information.on january,a woman later identified as reinhold delivered envelopes to three paycom partners,christopher mallick,clay andrews and joel hall.each envelope contained a letter from adjani advising that he had purchased a copy of paycom database containing its clients sensitive financial information.the letter threatened that adjani would sell the paycom database and master client control list if he did not receive million.to prove his threats were real,adjani included samples of the classified data.he directed the paycom partners to sign an enclosed agreement attesting to the proposed quid pro quo and fax it back to him by january.the letter included adjani email address,and a fax number.agents later learned that adjani email address was billed to reinhold account.
evidence suggested that adjani left los angeles on january,and ultimately ended up in zurich,switzerland.from switzerland,adjani sent an email on january to joel hall to confirm that hall and the others had received the envelopes.adjani followed up on this email on january by instructing hall to contact him through ichat instant messaging if he wanted to discuss the settlement agreement.with the fbi monitoring,hall conversed several times with adjani on the internet and over the telephone.in spite of adjani insistence that he remain overseas,hall convinced him to come to los angeles on january to pick up million in exchange for the database.
adjani returned to los angeles on january,under fbi surveillance.reinhold,driving in a car that the fbi had earlier identified as adjani,was observed leaving adjani residence in venice,california,picking him up from the airport and returning to his residence.the fbi also observed reinhold using an apple computer,the same brand of computer adjani used to email and chat with paycom.
obtaining and executing the search warrant 
on january,based on the facts recited above and attested to in fbi agent cloney affidavit which was affixed to the warrant,a federal magistrate judge granted the government an arrest warrant for adjani and a search warrant covering adjani venice residence,his vehicle,his person and the residence of the individual who had stolen the confidential information from paycom.the warrant specifically sought evidence of violations of d transmitting threatening communications with intent to commit extortion.further,the warrant expressly authorized seizure of 
records,documents and materials containing paycom or epoch master client control documents,paycom or epoch email database,or other company information relating to paycom or epoch.
records,documents and materials which reflect communications with christopher mallick,clay andrews,joel hall or other employees or officers of paycom or epoch.
any and all evidence of travel,including hotel bills and receipts,gasoline receipts,plane tickets,bus tickets,train tickets,or any other documents related to travel from january,to the present.
computer,hard drives,computer disks,cd,and other computer storage devices.
with respect to the computer search,the warrant prescribed the process to be followed in searching the data,the computer personnel will examine all of the data contained in the computer equipment and storage devices to view their precise contents and determine whether the data falls within the items to be seized as set forth herein.additionally,it noted that i n order to search for data that is capable of being read or intercepted by a computer,law enforcement personnel will need to seize and search a ny computer equipment and storage device capable of being used to commit,further,or store evidence of the offense listed above.
on january,agents observed reinhold driving adjani,in a car registered to him,to his meeting with paycom.while adjani went into a hotel,reinhold slipped into the backseat of his car,placing curtains over the windows.at this point,agents proceeded to search adjani car.that same day,agents executed the search warrant for adjani venice residence.there they found and seized various computers and hard drives,including reinhold computer,which were later sent to an fbi computer lab to be searched.during that search process,the hard drive from reinhold computer revealed certain email correspondence between reinhold and adjani,implicating reinhold in the extortion plot and supporting a charge of conspiracy against both of them.
the defendants successfully sought suppression of these seized email communications in the district court.this appeal requires us to determine whether the agents permissibly searched reinhold computer whether the warrant satisfied our specificity standards and whether the emails seized fell within the scope of the otherwise properly issued warrant.
ii.analysis 
probable cause 
the government principally argues that contrary to the district court finding and the defendants assertions,the search warrant affidavit established probable cause to search all instrumentalities that might contain evidence of violations of d,including reinhold computer and emails.reinhold counters that the affidavit may have generally established probable cause,but did not do so with respect to her computer,because i n the affidavit,reinhold was not labeled as a target,suspect,or.
probable cause to issue the warrant 
a search warrant is issued upon a showing of probable cause to believe that the legitimate object of a search is located in a particular place,and therefore safeguards an individual interest in the privacy of his home and possessions against the unjustified intrusion of the police.steagald united states,d.as the supreme court has explained,the probable cause standard is a practical,nontechnical conception.illinois gates,d quoting brinegar united states.furthermore,probable cause is a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.id.at.see also united states gourde,cir en banc employing the principles of,common sense,a fluid and nontechnical conception of probable cause,and deference to the magistrate conclude that the search warrant was supported by probable cause.the warrant here was supported by probable cause,because the affidavit submitted to the magistrate judge established that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in computers at adjani residence see gates,at.the extensive supporting affidavit described the extortion scheme in detail,including that adjani possessed a database and communicated with paycom over email,requiring the use of a computer.gourde,at the details provided on the use of computers by child pornographers and the collector profile strengthen th e inference that probable cause supported the warrant and help provide context for the fair probability that gourde received or downloaded images.internal citation omitted.furthermore,the agent affidavit explained the need to search computers,in particular,for evidence of the extortion scheme i know that considerable planning is typically performed to construct and consummate an extortion.the plan can be documented in the form of a simple written note or more elaborate information stored on computer equipment.
probable cause exists if it would be reasonable to seek the evidence in the place indicated in the affidavit.united states wong,cir quoting united states peacock,cir.the crime contemplated by the warrant was transmitting a threatening communication with intent to extort.see d.to find evidence of extortion,the government would have probable cause to search for and seize instrumentalities likely to have been used to facilitate the transmission.the magistrate judge could rightfully assume that there was a fair probability that such evidence could be contained on computers or storage devices found in adjani residence.
probable cause to search reinhold computer 
having held that the affidavit supporting the warrant established probable cause to search for and seize instrumentalities of the extortion including records,files and computers in adjani residence,we turn to reinhold contention that the probable cause for the adjani warrant did not extend so far as to permit a search of her property.we disagree.the agents,acting pursuant to a valid warrant to look for evidence of a crime,searched computers found in adjani residence and to which he had apparent access.that one of the computers actually belonged to reinhold did not exempt it from being searched,especially given her association with adjani and participation however potentially innocuous in some of his activities as documented in the agent supporting affidavit the officers therefore did not act unreasonably in searching reinhold computer as a source of the evidence targeted by the warrant.see illinois rodriguez,d holding fourth amendment requires officers to act reasonably in executing a search warrant brinegar united states.
reinhold argument that there was no probable cause to search her computer,a private and personal piece of property,because the warrant failed to list her as a target,suspect,or misunderstands fourth amendment jurisprudence although individuals undoubtedly have a high expectation of privacy in the files stored on their personal computers,we have never held that agents may establish probable cause to search only those items owned or possessed by the criminal suspect.the law is to the contrary.the critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific things to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.zurcher stanford daily,d united states ross,d a lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search.
in united states hay,cir,the defendant made an argument similar to reinhold,challenging the district court ruling allowing evidence of child pornography found on his computer to be used against him at trial.hay claimed that the affidavit submitted by officers to obtain a warrant did not establish probable cause to engage in a search of hay computer because there was no evidence that he fell within a class of persons likely to collect and traffic in child pornography because the affidavit does not indicate that he was a child molester,pedophile,or collector of child pornography and sets forth no evidence that he solicited,sold or transmitted child pornography.id.at.we rejected hay challenge,holding that i t is well established that a location can be searched for evidence of a crime even if there is no probable cause to arrest the person at the location.id.citing zurcher,at.see also united states taketa,cir t he correct inquiry is whether there was reasonable cause to believe that evidence of misconduct was located on the property that was searched.united states tehfe,cir property owned by a person absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing may nevertheless be searched under a valid warrant.united states melvin,cir holding the zurcher rule applies to a person who the police do indeed suspect but do not have probable cause to arrest such a person property may be searched upon probable cause to believe that fruits,instrumentalities,or evidence of the crime are present,even though the products of the search may implicate him.
likewise,there was no need here for the agents expressly to claim in the affidavit that they wanted to arrest reinhold,or even that reinhold was suspected of any criminal activity.the government needed only to satisfy the magistrate judge that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of the crime in be found on computers accessible to adjani in his home,it computer by setting forth the details of the extortion scheme and the instrumentalities of the crime,augmented by descriptions of reinhold involvement with adjani,the government satisfied its burden.the magistrate judge therefore properly approved the warrant,which in turn encompassed all the computers found at adjani residence.
specificity requirement 
the defendants argue that if the warrant did authorize a search that properly included reinhold computer,the warrant was fatally overbroad,justifying the district court exclusion of the reinhold emails.the government counters that the warrant satisfied the particularity standards articulated by this court,so exclusion was improper.
the fourth amendment specificity requirement prevents officers from engaging in general,exploratory searches by limiting their discretion and providing specific guidance as to what can and can not be searched and seized.see united states mcclintock,cir g eneral warrants are prohibited.internal quotation marks omitted united states cardwell,cir nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,the level of detail necessary in a warrant is related to the particular circumstances and the nature of the evidence sought.see united states spilotro,cir.warrants which describe generic categories of items are not necessarily invalid if a more precise description of the items subject to seizure is not possible.id.
in determining whether a warrant is sufficiently particular,we consider one or more of the following factors 
whether probable cause exists to seize all items of a particular type described in the warrant whether the warrant sets out objective standards by which executing officers can differentiate items subject to seizure from those which are not and whether the government was able to describe the items more particularly in light of the information available to it at the time the warrant was issued.
id.at internal citations omitted.
spilotro involved a warrant issued against individuals suspected of loan sharking and gambling activities.see id.at.the warrant authorized the seizure of address books,notebooks,notes,documents,records,assets,photographs,and other items and paraphernalia evidencing violations of the multiple criminal statutes listed.id.at.it failed,however,to state the precise identity,type,or contents of the records sought.id.partly because of this reason,we held that the warrant was not sufficiently specific to pass muster under the fourth amendment.more could have been done to tie the documents sought to the crimes alleged by,for example,stating that the police were searching for records relating to loan sharking and gambling,including pay and collection sheets,lists of loan customers,loan accounts and telephone numbers id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in contrast to spilotro,the warrant to search adjani residence satisfied our specificity criteria.first,we have already held that there was probable cause to search the computers.as to the second factor,the warrant objectively described the items to be searched and seized with adequate specificity and sufficiently restricted the discretion of agents executing the search.the warrant affidavit began by limiting the search for evidence of a specific threatening communications with intent to commit extortion.see id.reference to a specific illegal activity can,in appropriate cases,provide substantive guidance for the officer exercise of discretion in executing the warrant.see also united states wong,cir the specificity of the items listed in the warrant combined with the language directing officers to obtain data as it relates to this case from the computers is sufficiently specific to focus the officer search.cardwell,at holding impermissibly general a warrant where the only limitation on the search and seizure of appellants business papers was the requirement that they be the instrumentality or evidence of violation of the general tax evasion statute,but noting that if the warrant is cabined by a preambulatory statement limiting the search to evidence of particular criminal episodes,it may fulfill the particularity requirement.further,unlike in spilotro,the adjani warrant provided the precise identity and nature of the items to be seized.spilotro,at.for example,paragraph of the warrant instructed agents to search for documents reflecting communications with three individuals or other employees of a specific company.also,paragraph authorized seizure of any evidence of travel but provided a specific,though not exhaustive,list of possible documents that fell within this category and temporally restricted the breadth of the search.united states abrams,cir cited favorably in cardwell,at holding a warrant was not sufficiently particular because t he officers discretion was unfettered,there is no limitation as to time and there is no description as to what specific records are to be seized.moreover,the extensive statement of probable cause in the affidavit detailed the alleged crime and adjani unlawful scheme.see spilotro,at considering favorably warrants describing the criminal activit y rather than simply referring to the statute believed to have been violated.
with respect to the final spilotro factor,we conclude that the government described the items to be searched and seized as particularly as could be reasonably expected given the nature of the crime and the evidence it then possessed.the adjani warrant describe d in great detail the items one commonly expects to find on premises used for the criminal activities in question spilotro,at see also united states mann,cir while a search warrant must describe items to be seized with particularity sufficient to prevent a general,exploratory rummaging in a person belongings,it need only be reasonably specific,rather than elaborately detailed.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
center art,united states,cir,the principal case defendants rely upon in making their overbreadth argument,is distinguishable.in that case,we held that a warrant providing for the almost unrestricted seizure of items which are evidence of violations of federal criminal law without describing the specific crimes suspected is constitutionally inadequate.id.at quoting spilotro,at.in contrast,the government here did describe at some length both the nature of and the means of committing the crime.further,unlike in center art galleries,the affidavit was expressly incorporated into the warrant.id.an affidavit can cure the overbreadth of a warrant if the affidavit is attached to and incorporated by reference in the warrant.quoting spilotro,at,and citing united states leary,cir 
we understand the heightened specificity concerns in the computer context,given the vast amount of data they can store.as the defendants urge,the warrant arguably might have provided for a less invasive search of adjani email inbox and outbox for the addressees specifically cited in the warrant,as opposed to the wholesale search of the contents of all emails purportedly looking for evidence reflecting communications with those individuals.avoiding that kind of specificity and limitation was not unreasonable under the circumstances here,however.to require such a pinpointed computer search,restricting the search to an email program or to specific search terms,would likely have failed to cast a sufficiently wide net to capture the evidence sought.ross,at.when a legitimate search is under way,and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined,nice distinctions between closets,drawers,and containers,in the case of a home,or between glove compartments,upholstered seats,trunks,and wrapped packages,in the case of a vehicle,must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand.moreover,agents are limited by the longstanding principle that a duly issued warrant,even one with a thorough affidavit,may not be used to engage in a general,exploratory search.see united states rettig,cir where evidence is uncovered during a search pursuant to a warrant,the threshold question must be whether the search was confined to the warrant terms t he search must be one directed in good faith toward the objects specified in the warrant or for other means and instrumentalities by which the crime charged had been committed.it must not be a general exploratory search internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also franklin foxworth,cir t he reasonableness of a search or seizure depends not only on when it is made,but also on how it is carried out.internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis in original.
computer files are easy to disguise or rename,and were we to limit the warrant to such a specific search protocol,much evidence could escape discovery simply because of adjani or reinhold labeling of the files documenting adjani criminal activity.the government should not be required to trust the suspect when executing a warrant.see guest leis,cir defendants may legitimately have checked to see that the contents of the directories corresponded to the labels placed on the directories.suspects would otherwise be able to shield evidence from a search simply by misfiling it in a directory labeled.united states tamura,cir a ll items in a set of files may be inspected during a search,provided that sufficiently specific guidelines for identifying the documents sought are provided in the search warrant and are followed by the officers conducting the search.
scope of the warrant 
even assuming that the warrant was supported by probable cause and was adequately specific such that a search of reinhold computer and emails were permissible,reinhold argues that the actual emails sought to be introduced into evidence were outside the scope of the warrant.again,we disagree.
the three seized emails the government seeks to admit clearly fall within the scope of paragraph of the warrant affidavit,authorizing seizure of r ecords,documents and materials which reflect communications with christopher mallick,clay andrews,joel hall or other employees or officers of paycom or epoch,which are relevant evidence of violations of d.each email specif
