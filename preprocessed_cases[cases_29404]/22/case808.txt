for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
introduction 
dsl technology is a relatively new data transfer technology that can turn a single pair of copper telephone wires a copper pair into a,data delivery system.a basic dsl system consists of two modems located at each end of a conventional telephone at the telephone company end,and one at the customer end.this technology allows customers to gain access to large sources of data,including the internet,without the need for expensive additional wiring.
prior to the advent of dsl technology,copper telephone wiring transmitted simple voice data at frequencies below four kilohertz khz.the transmission of this common residential telephone service is known as pots plain old telephone service.it has been known for some time that additional communications streams can be carried on the same wire with pots through a technique called frequency division multiplexing.frequency division multiplexing is a scheme in which numerous signals are combined for transmission on a single communications line by assigning each signal a different frequency.until recently,much of the available range of frequencies,or bandwidth,on copper telephone wiring remained unused.dsl technology enables transmissions over common copper telephone wiring by exploiting the unused,higher frequencies over wires.
in order to take advantage of the higher frequencies,dsl technology employs modems,or transceivers,to modulate and demodulate the data.the transceivers allow the low frequencies to be used for traditional pots communication,while simultaneously using the higher frequencies for digital communications.a transceiver must be employed at each end of the subscriber loop the customer end and the telephone company switching office.
currently,there are two major types of dsl technology.symmetric or digital subscriber line sdsl technology uses a range of frequencies as a single channel,and transmits and receives data on this channel at the same rate.asymmetric digital subscriber line adsl technology allocates different amounts of bandwidth based on the needs of the customer.sdsl technology may be more suitable for videoconferencing applications,because equal upstream and downstream data transmission rates are preferable.however,adsl technology may be more suitable for services and for customers who download more data in the downstream direction than they upload in the upstream direction.traditionally,adsl systems have allocated more bandwidth for downstream communication than for upstream communication.indeed,prior art adsl systems allocate only a small amount of bandwidth approximately khz to the upstream channel,also referred to as the control channel.
figure of the patent specification illustrates how conventional adsl systems have divided common telephone lines into different channels using frequency division multiplexing 
the diagram illustrates that in prior art adsl systems,pots service uses only khz,the control channel uses about khz,and the downstream data channel uses most of the remaining bandwidth.
b.the patent claims 
the invention disclosed by the patent concerns data transmission systems that can be used to provide dsl services with variable rates and modes without replacing the underlying hardware and equipment.the written description of the patent notes that prior art adsl systems were not well suited for other services in which the nature and amount of data and control signal transfer is substantially different and changes frequently.patent,ll.the specification observes that the control channel may be unacceptably slow for services such as interactive,distance learning,or accessing a server in a remote local area network lan over a pots line using a single copper pair.one or more of these services may require a control channel of up to,for example,kbps kilobits per second in order to allow substantially communications so that a subscriber is not waiting for information to be transmitted.id.at,ll.
thus,the invention disclosed by the patent adds capabilities to current dsl technology by providing an adsl system with adjustable variable rate functionality.the patent notes in the summary of the invention that such a network has the advantages of conventional adsls,while allowing the data rate of the reverse control signaling channel to be controllably increased so as to have a higher rate transmission than adsl in a mode.id.at,ll.in other words,the adsl system described by the patent allows customers to access any file server,download files,store information,and perform any other functions permitted in the optimum mode and at the optimum rate for that function.id.at,ll.
claims and are the two independent claims at issue in this appeal.the claims read as follows 
a transmission system for variably transmitting information data in a plurality of different modes over a network,said transmission system comprising 
a first transceiver,connected to a first end of a subscriber loop,for selectively operating in one of said plurality of different modes,said first transceiver transmitting or receiving signals,at a first transmission rate,on a first channel,and transmitting or receiving signals,at a second transmission rate,on a second channel,in each of said plurality of different modes 
a second transceiver,connected to said first transceiver via said subscriber loop,for selectively operating in one of said plurality of different modes,said second transceiver transmitting or receiving said first channel signals at said first transmission rate on said first channel and transmitting or receiving said second channel signals at said second transmission rate on said second channel and 
a controller connected to said first transceiver for selectively changing said first and second transmission rates.
an transmission system for variably transmitting information data over a plurality of channels,comprising 
a first transceiver for transmitting or receiving signals at a first transmission rate on a first channel,and transmitting or receiving signals at a second transmission rate on a second channel 
a second transceiver for transmitting or receiving signals at said first transmission rate on said first channel and transmitting or receiving said second channel signals at said second transmission rate on said second channel and 
a subscriber loop for connecting said first and second transceivers together wherein 
each of said first and second transceivers includes a controller for selectively changing the transmission rates on said first and second channels.
id.at,ll,ll.emphasis added.
c.the accused covad dsl system 
covad provides its customers with both adsl and sdsl services.covad also uses dsl transceivers,called linecards,at both ends of the subscriber loop.in covad adsl linecard transceivers,the allocation of bandwidth between the upstream and downstream channels is fixed,with most of the frequency allocated to the downstream channel.because the bandwidth allocation is fixed,covad adsl linecard transceivers are incapable of shifting bandwidth between the upstream and downstream channels without removing and reprogramming the linecard transceivers.in covad sdsl linecard transceivers,the allocation of bandwidth to the single,sdsl channel is also fixed.covad sdsl linecard transceivers use echo cancellation techniques to allow communication within the single sdsl frequency range 
procedural background 
on january,covad filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement based on its proposed claim construction of three limitations contained in the patent.on february,prior to the close of discovery,the district court conducted a hearing in which the parties discussed the technology and claims of the patent.on february,the district court informed the parties that it would grant covad motion for summary judgment of noninfringement.on april,the district court issued its opinion and order explaining its claim constructions,and granting summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of covad.
the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement was based on the construction of three limitations contained in claims and the plurality of different modes limitation in claim and the transceiver limitation in claim the first and second channel limitation in both claims and the selectively changing the transmission rates limitation in both claims.patent,ll,ll.
the district court construed the first limitation to require the transceiver described in both claims and to be 
a transceiver that operates by dividing available bandwidth between two channels in at least two of the following ways,where the first channel is smaller than the second conventional adsl mode where the two channels are of roughly equal size mode and where the first channel is larger than the second reversible mode.
bell atlantic,at.the district court relied exclusively on the intrinsic evidence,including the claims,the written description,and the prosecution history,in arriving at its construction.it observed that,throughout the specification,the written description describes only these three possible modes.it concluded that it would not broaden claims and beyond their support in the specification,as the three modes discussed in the patent specification literally occupy the field of possibilities contemplated by the patent.id.at.
the district court also relied solely on the intrinsic evidence for its construction of the first and second channels limitation.based on a reading of the written description,the district court construed the first and second channels to mean an amount of bandwidth isolated for communications that may be either unidirectional or.id.at.finally,it construed the selectively changing limitation to mean that a change in transmission rates is chosen and occurs,although it need not occur during a communication session.id.at.based on these claim constructions,bell atlantic conceded that the accused covad systems do not literally infringe.moreover,the district court determined that covad sdsl transceivers do not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because they perform substantially different functions in a substantially different way to achieve substantially different results.id.at.the district court reasoned that covad single channel utilizes echo cancellation techniques to allow communications,which differs substantially from two separate unidirectional channels.id.at.
bell atlantic timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.standard of review 
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c newbanks cent.gulf lines,d.
the determination of infringement is a process.first,the court construes the claims to correctly determine the scope of the claims.second,it compares the properly construed claims to the accused device.cybor fas,en banc.claim construction is an issue of law that we review de novo.markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d cybor,at,at.

iii.discussion 
claim construction 
it is that,in interpreting an asserted claim,the court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record,the patent itself,including the claims,the specification and,if in evidence,the prosecution history such intrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.vitronics conceptronic.
we look first to the claim language itself to define the scope of the patented invention.id.as a starting point,we give claim terms their ordinary and accustomed meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art,avia group int l.accordingly,a technical term used in a patent is interpreted as having the meaning a person of ordinary skill in the field of the invention would understand it to mean.interactive gift express,compuserve,wl.july.
dictionaries and technical treatises,which are extrinsic evidence,hold a special place and may sometimes be considered along with the intrinsic evidence when determining the ordinary meaning of claim terms.vitronics,at,at.furthermore,we have previously cautioned against the use of dictionaries lest dictionary definitions be converted into technical terms of art having legal,not linguistic significance.multiform desiccants,medzam.
generally,there is a heavy presumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.johnson worldwide,zebco.this presumption is overcome where the patentee has chosen to be his own lexicographer,or where a claim term deprives the claim of clarity such that there is no means by which the scope of the claim may be ascertained from the language used.id.at,at.in the first situation,a patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary meaning.vitronics,at,at.therefore,the court must examine the intrinsic evidence to determine whether the patentees have given the term an unconventional meaning.hockerson,at,at.the specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication.vitronics,at,at.thus,the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually,it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.
we have previously held that,in redefining the meaning of particular claim terms away from the ordinary meaning,the intrinsic evidence must clearly set forth or clearly redefine a claim term so as to put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the patentee intended to so redefine the claim term.elekta instr.scientific int l,telecom samsung.we have also stated that the specification must exhibit an express intent to impart a novel meaning to claim terms.schering amgen,optical disc del mar avionics.however,a claim term may be clearly redefined without an explicit statement of redefinition.indeed,we have specifically held that the written description of the preferred embodiments can provide guidance as to the meaning of the claims,thereby dictating the manner in which the claims are to be construed,even if the guidance is not provided in explicit definitional format.scimed life,advanced cardiovascular.in other words,the specification may define claim terms by implication such that the meaning may be found in or ascertained by a reading of the patent documents.vitronics,at,at.
moreover,we must also examine the prosecution history to determine whether the patentee has relinquished a potential claim construction in an amendment to the claim or in an argument to overcome or distinguish a reference.southwall,cardinal ig,interactive gift.this history contains the complete record of all the proceedings before the patent and trademark office,including any express representations made by the applicant regarding the scope of the claims.vitronics,at,at.the prosecution history is considered to determine whether or not there were any express representations made in obtaining the patent regarding the scope and meaning of the claims.id.
finally,if the meaning of the claim limitation is apparent from the intrinsic evidence alone,it is improper to rely on extrinsic evidence other than that used to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the claim limitation.id.however,in the rare circumstance that the court is unable to determine the meaning of the asserted claims after assessing the intrinsic evidence,it may look to additional evidence that is extrinsic to the complete document record to help resolve any lack of clarity.id.at,at.this additional extrinsic evidence includes such evidence as expert testimony,articles,and inventor testimony.id.this extrinsic evidence may be used only to assist in the proper understanding of the disputed limitation it may not be used to vary,contradict,expand,or limit the claim language from how it is defined,even by implication,in the specification or file history.id.at,at.
the plurality of different modes and limitations 
bell atlantic challenges the district court claim construction of the plurality of different modes limitation in claim and the transceiver limitation in claim.based on the ordinary meaning of the word mode,bell atlantic argues that the phrase plurality of different modes simply requires multiple operational states providing different transmission services,as distinguished by their upstream and downstream transmission rates,whether the differences are achieved by altering bandwidth or by the other familiar methods of altering transmission rates.bell atlantic argues that the universe of modes contemplated by the patent is not limited to the three modes discussed by the district court conventional,and reversible.bell atlantic reasons that these three modes are simply three broad categories that may encompass other operational modes.specifically,bell atlantic contends that the rate of data transfer as opposed to the bandwidth within each of the three broad categories can be changed to create additional modes.
for example,bell atlantic posits that a service offering kbps kilobits per second in each direction is quite different from one offering mbps megabits per second.under the district court construction,both services would operate in the same mode because both services allocate the same amount of bandwidth to both the upstream and downstream directions.however,bell atlantic argues that the kbps service would operate in a different mode than the mbps service because the rate of data transmission varies between the two services.bell atlantic also suggests that a transmission system may be changed from a conventional adsl mode to a mode by increasing the coding to allow more bits per baud or by bit stuffing without altering the relative bandwidth distribution of the upstream and downstream channels.in short,bell atlantic argues that a plurality of different modes also encompasses different methods of altering the transmission rates within the three broad categories.
it may be true that the ordinary meaning of the word mode supports a broader meaning than the construction ascertained by the district court.however,we must look at the intrinsic evidence to determine whether the patentee has given the term an unconventional meaning.hockerson,at,at vitronics,at,at.we are mindful that the patentee may act as his own lexicographer by using the specification to define terms either expressly or by implication.vitronics,at,at.moreover,the ordinary meaning of the term mode is sufficiently broad and amorphous that the scope of the claim language can be reconciled only with recourse to the written description.comark communications,harris.
a.the patent specification 
at the outset,we note that the patent is entitled variable rate and variable mode transmission system.consistent with the title of the patent,the patentees,throughout the specification,use the terms rate and mode to refer to separate and distinct concepts.in the summary of the invention,the specification states that it is an object of the invention to operate in 
a plurality of different modes and at any one of a plurality of different bit rates still another object of the invention is to simply and easily vary the bit rates of the upstream and downstream channels,or the modes of the transceivers another object is to either automatically control bit rate or mode by the co or selectively control bit rate or mode by the subscriber.
patent,ll.emphasis added.later,the summary of the invention notes that the present invention has the advantages of conventional adsls,while allowing the data rate of the reverse control signaling channel to be controllably increased so as to have a higher rate transmission than adsl in a mode.id.at,ll.emphasis added.the specification continues 
this variable rate variable mode adsl service will accommodate access to a wide variety of information providers in addition to variable bit rates for the control channel,the invention enables at least two modes for the adsl transceivers,one providing communications and the other providing asymmetrical communications.
id.at,ll.emphasis added.thus,before we even reach the detailed description of the preferred embodiments,it is clear that the patent specification in the summary of the invention refers to the terms rate and mode as two separate and distinct concepts.the term rate describes the data rate within a given channel,while the term mode differentiates between asymmetrical and communications.
the written description of the preferred embodiments also guides our interpretation of the claim language,as claims must be read in light of the specification.scimed,at,at.we are mindful of the fact that limitations from the specification may not be read into the claims.comark,at,at.indeed,bell atlantic argues that by limiting the construction of the term mode to the three broad categories described in the specification,the district court improperly imported the limitations of one embodiment into the claim term.we disagree.
we recognize that there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification,and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification.comark,at,at.for example,relying on johnson worldwide,bell atlantic argues that it is impermissible to rely on the written description of a preferred embodiment to limit the claim language.in johnson worldwide,we held that the meaning of a claim term was not limited by its specific usage in the written description of a preferred embodiment.at,at.we reasoned that the v aried use of a disputed term in the written description demonstrates the breadth of the term rather than providing a limited definition.see also pitney bowes,holding that the written description of the preferred embodiments can set forth more than one definition of a claim term.
however,bell atlantic reading of johnson worldwide and characterization of the role of the written description is too narrow.we held in scimed,at,at,that the written description can provide guidance as to the meaning of the claims,thereby dictating the manner in which the claims are to be construed,even if the guidance is not provided in explicit definitional format.id.emphasis added.thus,when a patentee uses a claim term throughout the entire patent specification,in a manner consistent with only a single meaning,he has defined that term by implication.vitronics,at,at see also hockerson,at,at.
in this case,in addition to the summary of the invention,the detailed description of the preferred embodiments continues to use the terms mode and rate to refer to two separate and distinct concepts.the specification notes that the arrows used in figure seven illustrate the reversible mode feature of the system and no fixed data rate is given due to the capability of the system to transmit at any one of a number of different transmission rates.patent,ll.emphasis added.this passage uses the term rate to refer to the speed of data transmission,and uses the term mode to refer to the reversible mode feature.when describing the microprocessor that controls the transceivers,the specification states that the variable transmission rates are controlled by a first program and the mode of the transceiver is controlled by a second program.patent,ll.emphasis added.thus,the mode and rate of the transceiver are controlled by separate programs.
further,the specification states that the system operates in one of three selectable modes.patent,ll.emphasis added.the specification describes the modes 
the first mode is conventional adsl,which is appropriate for applications in which a subscriber wishes to view video data using the fixed rate interface or download a large amount of information in a predetermined downstream direction utilizing the ethernet interface.
the second mode is a transmission mode which improves upon conventional adsl by increasing the transmission rate of the upstream channel while decreasing the transmission rate of the downstream channel.this mode is preferable for certain interactive applications such as video games and distance learning,in which a kbps or kbps upstream channel is insufficient for the flow of data in the upstream direction.an example of the channelization in the mode in which the downstream and upstream channels are roughly equivalent is illustrated in by channels,and.
the third mode is a reversible mode in which the asymmetrical transmission of data and other information is carried out in the same manner as conventional adsl shown in,but the direction of flow is selectively reversed so that the upstream direction becomes the downstream direction and vice versa.this mode is especially useful for applications in which there are,exchanges of large amounts of information in both directions.
patent,ll.emphasis added.
these passages refer to figure of the patent,which illustrates the described distribution of channel bandwidth.channel is the downstream channel,while channel is the upstream channel 
although these passages offer the clearest description of the meaning of the term mode in the specification,the remainder of the written description also refers to the terms mode and rate as separate and distinct concepts 
the structure of the chips does not need to be changed to vary the mode of the transceiver or the transmission rates the enables the rate or mode of the to be selected in any one of a number of ways a menu may query for the desired mode data rate the changes in mode and rate for the channel can be accomplished by the interface once the mode and rate has been set the thus effectively functions as a variable rate variable mode modem.
another passage refers to an asymmetrical mode.patent,ll.emphasis added.other passages discuss the reversible adsl mode.patent,ll.still others explain how the system may change from mode to adsl mode.patent,ll.
in short,there is no question that the patent specification uses the terms mode and rate to refer to two different and distinct concepts.the rate of data flow is characterized as the transmission rate within a given channel.the mode is characterized by whether the relative bandwidth between the upstream and downstream channels is symmetrical or asymmetrical.moreover,because the two terms are used separately and distinctly,different modes can not be created by varying the data rate within one of the three broad categories.in other words,although a service offering kbps in each direction is quite different from one offering mbps,nevertheless,the two services do not constitute different modes.thus,given the single meaning of the term mode contemplated by the patent specification,there are only three possible permutations by which the relative bandwidth may be characterized where the first channel is smaller than the second conventional mode where the two channels are of roughly equal size mode and where the first channel is larger than the second reversible mode.
we acknowledge that it is generally impermissible to limit claim terms by a preferred embodiment or inferences drawn from the description of a preferred embodiment.johnson worldwide,at,at.however,that is not the case here.we note that t he usage preferred does not of itself broaden the claims beyond their support in the specification.wang labs,america online.moreover,unlike johnson worldwide,this case does not involve the v aried use of a disputed term.id.at,at.instead,the patentees defined the term mode by implication,through the term consistent use throughout the patent specification.vitronics,at,at.given this definition,the three modes described in the detailed description of the preferred embodiments describe the three possible modes of the invention,and the claims are not entitled to any broader scope.wang,at,at.
prosecution history 
the prosecution history also supports limiting the transceiver to the three possible modes.during the prosecution of the patent,the examiner rejected the relevant claims as obvious over patent arnon.arnon describes an adsl transmission system and transceiver that combines adsl data with television signals,and transmits the data at varying frequencies over coaxial cable wires.arnon,ll.arnon describes a system that combines the adsl data signals with the cable television signal at adsl terminal units within a residential building.arnon,ll.the examiner initially rejected the relevant claims of the patent because 
arnon did not expressly detail that the controller selected the mode of operation for the transceivers.arnon however taught that the receivers and transmitters could be automatically retuned to a different frequency when a terminal unit was faulty therefore,it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the data processing art at the time of the claimed invention that the arnon system comprised control means which retuned the receivers and transmitters when a terminal unit was faulty so that it could communicate via another terminal unit.also clearly it would have been obvious that this operation would have comprised selecting the new mode of operation for transmission of data.further since the arnon system operated on different channels at different rates it would have been obvious to a routineer that even in normal operation the arnon system would have used a control means to change modes of transfer and speeds of transfer.
emphasis added.although the statements of an examiner will not necessarily limit a claim,we observe that the examiner understood that the mode of transfer was a separate and distinct concept than the speed of transfer.
moreover,in an attempt to distinguish his invention from arnon,the patentees responded with various statements.importantly,the patentee argued 
in the present invention,the transmission bandwidth of channels,and are controlled for various modes using a in the unit.
emphasis added.it is clear from this statement that the mode of the present invention varies solely by changing the amount of bandwidth allocated between the upstream and downstream channels.in subsequent statements,the patentees described the exemplary embodiment that operates in one of three modes conventional,and reversible.the patentees observed that the invention allows one to perform various functions in the optimum mode and at the optimum transmission rate for that function.emphasis added.the patentees further distinguished arnon because 
t he adsl unit of arnon subscriber loops appear to be conventional adsl unit having a bandwidth distribution of the type illustrated in applicants arnon adsl terminal comprises transmitters and receivers for communicating data and control signals via the coaxial cable between the adsl units and the subscriber,in each case modulated at a frequency which is not used for television signals.this is completely different from the present invention in which the adsl terminal selectively changes the bandwidth for both control and data channels in the subscriber loop.
emphasis in original.bell atlantic now contends that this statement merely distinguishes the fact that arnon terminal units operated within a residential unit,while the transceivers described by the patent operate outside the building,or in the subscriber loop.it is true that the emphasized language supports this distinction.however,the statement also states that,the present invention selectively changes the bandwidth.thus,not only did the patentees distinguish that the invention operated in the subscriber loop,but they also emphasized that a conventional bandwidth distribution is completely different from the invention system of selectively chang ing the bandwidth.
that the transceivers must operate in one of the three described modes is further supported by the language of dependent claims through 
the transmission system of claim,wherein said plurality of different modes includes a conventional adsl mode and a mode.
the transmission system of claim,wherein said plurality of different modes includes a conventional adsl mode and a reversible mode.
the transmission system of claim,wherein said plurality of different modes includes a mode and a reversible mode.
the transmission system of claim,wherein said plurality of different modes includes a conventional adsl mode,a mode,and a reversible mode.
patent,to.these four dependent claims contemplate the only four possible permutations of a plurality of different modes.it is true that limitations stated in dependent claims are normally not to be read into the independent claim from which they depend.karlin,surgical dynamics.however,our acknowledgement of dependent claims simply further demonstrates that the patent defined the term mode by implication to mean the relative allocation of bandwidth between the first and second channel.such a meaning leaves only three possible modes conventional,and reversible.
bell atlantic observes that independent claim does not contain the plurality of different modes language contained in claim.nevertheless,the district court held that the transceiver described in claim must also operate by dividing available bandwidth between the two channels in conventional,and reversible modes.we agree with the district court.the second sentence of the patent abstract refers to adsl transceivers operating at variable rates and in variable modes.emphasis added.in the summary of the invention,the patent specification defines the invention as an adsl having adjustable variable rate functionality.patent.the patent uses the terms transceiver,and transceiver interchangeably throughout the written description and the prosecution history.therefore,one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the transceiver described in claim is the same transceiver described in claim.thus,at the same time the patentees defined the term mode by implication,they also defined the transceivers as those that operate in conventional,and reversible modes by allocating bandwidth between the first and second channels.for these reasons,the transceivers described in claims and are construed synonymously with the definition of mode set forth above.
the first and second channel limitation 
bell atlantic also challenges the district court claim construction of the term channel as used in claims and.the district court determined that the first and second channels are an amount of bandwidth isolated for communications that may be either unidirectional or.bell atlantic argued that channel means a path between communicating entities.thus,we must determine whether the patent specification requires the first and second channels to be an amount of bandwidth separated in frequency,support both unidirectional and communications.
unidirectional channels 
the district court determined that the first and second channels described in claims and may support either unidirectional or communications.the district court noted that various phrases in the specification described channels,and reasoned that the inventors clearly intended channel to encompass both and segments of bandwidth.however,bell atlantic contends that the first and second channels are instead one way path s.we agree with bell atlantic on this aspect of the interpretation of the channel limitation.
first,the language of the claims supports bell atlantic contention that the first and second channels are intended to encompass only communication.claims and both describe a first transceiver transmitting or receiving signals,at a first transmission rate,on a first channel,and transmitting or receiving signals,at a second transmission rate,on a second channel.patent,ll.emphasis added.the use of the word or demonstrates that each transceiver either transmits or receives on a single channel,but not both simultaneously.thus,the language of the claims themselves supports a construction of the first and second channels that excludes or communications.
second,the written description defines the first and second channels as those that support communication.throughout the written description,the specification discusses the data channels as either upstream or downstream channels.patent,ll.indeed,the written description notes that in conventional adsl systems,channels and are unidirectional.patent,emphasis added.other passages refer to the unidirectional nature of the downstream or upstream channels.patent.thus,it is clear that the specification defines by implication the first and second channels as supporting only unidirectional communication.
covad nevertheless contends that the specification and prosecution history also use the term channel to refer to communications.therefore,covad reasons that the term as used in claims and must be construed to encompass both unidirectional and communications.it is true that the specification refers to a or channel in numerous instances.patent,ll,ll,ll.it is also true that during prosecution history,the patentees stated that channel provides connectivity for conventional telephone services.however,in each of these instances,it is evident that the statements regarding the channels refer to only the prior art control channel,the signaling channel,or the pots channel.conversely,wherever the specification discusses the first and second upstream and downstream data channels referenced in the claims at issue,it is clear that the communication is unidirectional.
in circumstances such as this,where the language of the written description is sufficient to put a reader on notice of the different uses of a term,and where those uses are further apparent from documents referenced in the patent files,it is appropriate to depart from the normal rule of construing seemingly identical terms in the same manner.this entirely accords with the public notice function of claims.pitney bowes,at,at.thus,although the term channel may encompass both unidirectional and communications,it is clear that the first and second data channel limitations in claims and support only unidirectional communications.
frequency separated channels 
the district court also held that the first and second channels are an amount of bandwidth or bands of frequencies or frequency channels.in other words,the district court determined that the channels must be separated by frequency.bell atlantic contends that the ordinary meaning of the term channel is not limited to communication paths separated by frequency.indeed,as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art,the ordinary meaning of the term channel is quite broad.within the realm of dsl technology,technical treatises refer to channels separated by frequency frequency division multiplexing,channels subdivided by time time division multiplexing,channels separated by echo cancellation techniques,and channels subdivided by various modulation techniques.see,bryan carne,telecommunications primer prentice hall ed michael busby,demystifying,wordware.
however,the patent specification defines the first and second channels,by implication,as amounts of bandwidth,and thus,communication paths separated by frequency.the summary of the invention references the upstream and downstr
