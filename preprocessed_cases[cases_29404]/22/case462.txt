the plaintiffs in these cases appeal the district court dismissal with prejudice of their claims for violations of the wiretap act and the stored communications act,two chapters within the electronic communications privacy act of ecpa.the plaintiffs allege that facebook,a social networking company,and zynga game network,a social gaming company,disclosed confidential user information to third parties.we have consolidated these cases for this opinion and conclude that the plaintiffs in both cases have failed to state a claim because they did not allege that either facebook or zynga disclosed the contents of a communication,a necessary element of their ecpa claims.we therefore affirm the district court 
facebook operates,a social networking website.zynga is an independent online game company that designs,develops,and provides social gaming applications that are accessible to users of facebook.to understand the claims at issue,some background on facebook and internet communication is necessary.
social networking and gaming websites provide an internet forum where users can interact with each other and share information.anyone may register to use facebook social networking site,but registrants must provide their real names,email addresses,gender,and birth dates.facebook does not charge any fees to sign up for its social networking service.upon registration,facebook assigns each user a unique facebook user id.the user id is a string of numbers,but a user can modify the id to be the user actual name or invented screen name.facebook considers the ids to be personally identifiable information.
facebook users upload information to the site to share with others.users frequently share a wide range of personal information,including their birth date,relationship status,place of residence,religion,and interests,as well as pictures,videos,and news articles.facebook arranges this information into a profile page for each user.users can make their profiles available to the public generally,or limit access to specified categories of family,friends,and acquaintances.
to generate revenue,facebook sells advertising to third parties who want to market their products to facebook users.facebook helps advertisers target their advertising to a specific demographic group by providing them with users demographic information.for example,a purveyor of spring training baseball memorabilia can choose to display its ads to males between the ages of and who like baseball and live in phoenix,arizona,on the theory that the members of that particular demographic group will be more likely to click on the ad and view the offer.nevertheless,facebook privacy policy states that it will not reveal a user specific identity and that only anonymous information is provided to advertisers.
in addition to its social networking and advertising services,facebook offers a platform service that allows developers to design applications that run on the facebook webpage.zynga is one such developer.it offers free social gaming applications through facebook platform that are used by millions of facebook users.until november,zynga privacy policy stated that it did not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party.
a brief review of how computers communicate on the internet is helpful to understand what happens when a facebook user clicks on a link or icon.the hypertext transfer protocol,or http,is the language of data transfer on the internet and facilitates the exchange of information between computers.fielding,et,hypertext transfer protocol,http the protocol governs how communications occur between clients and servers.a client is often a software application,such as a web browser,that sends requests to connect with a server.a server responds to the requests by,for instance,providing a resource,which is the requested information or content.id.uniform resource locators,or urls,both identify a resource and describe its location or address.id.and so when users enter url addresses into their web browser using the http web address format,or click on hyperlinks,they are actually telling their web browsers the client which resources to request and where to find them.id.
the basic unit of http communication is the message,which can be either a request from a client to a server or a response from a server to a client.id.a request message has several components,including a request line,the resource identified by the request,and request header fields.id.the request line specifies the action to be performed on the identified resource.id.often,the request line includes get,which means retrieve whatever information is identified by the indicated resource,or post,which requests that the server accept a body of information enclosed in the request,such as an email message.id.for example,if a web user clicked a link on the ninth circuit website to access recently published opinions url,the client request line would state get opinions,which is the resource,followed by host,a location header that specifies the website that hosts the resource.id.
other request headers follow the request line and allow the client to pass additional information about the request,and about the client itself,to the server.id.a request header known as the referer provides the address of the webpage from which the request was sent.id.for example,if a web user accessed the ninth circuit website from the northern district of california webpage,the get request would include the following header referer a client can be programmed to avoid sending a referer header.id.
during the period at issue in this case,when a user clicked on an ad or icon that appeared on a facebook webpage,the web browser sent an http request to access the resource identified by the link.the http request included a referer header that provided both the user facebook id and the address of the facebook webpage the user was viewing when the user clicked the link.accordingly,if the facebook user clicked on an ad,the web browser would send the referer header information to the third party advertiser.
to play a zynga game through facebook,a registered facebook user would log into the user facebook account and then click on the zynga game icon within the facebook interface.for example,if a user wanted to access zynga popular farmville game,the user would click the farmville icon,and the user web browser would send an http request to retrieve the resource located at.like the http request to view an ad on facebook,the http request to launch a zynga game contained a referer header that displayed the user facebook id and the address of the facebook webpage the user was viewing before clicking on the game icon.in response to the user http request,the zynga server would load the game in an inline on the facebook website.the inline frame allows a user to view one webpage embedded within another consequently,a user who is playing a zynga game is viewing both the facebook page from which the user launched the game and,within that page,the zynga game.
according to the relevant complaint,zynga programmed its gaming applications to collect the information contained in the referer header,and then transmit this information to advertisers and other third parties.as a result,both facebook and zynga allegedly disclosed the information provided in the referer headers,the user facebook ids and the address of the facebook webpage the user was viewing when the user clicked the link to third parties.
in the separate proceedings before us here,the plaintiffs filed consolidated class action complaints against facebook and zynga,alleging violations of ecpa based on facebook and zynga disclosure of the information contained in referer headers to third parties.in robertson facebook,the plaintiffs alleged that facebook violated the stored communications act,a.in graf zynga,the plaintiffs alleged violations of both the stored communications act and the wiretap act,a.in both cases,the district court determined that the plaintiffs had standing because they alleged a violation of their statutory rights,but nevertheless granted facebook and zynga motions to dismiss the plaintiffs claims under both the wiretap act and the stored communications act for failure to state a claim.the district court read the complaints as alleging that the plaintiffs intended for facebook,zygna,or the third parties to receive the communications.because both the wiretap act and the stored communications act allow disclosures to intended recipients,a,b,the district court concluded that the complaints did not state a claim for violation of the wiretap act or stored communications act.these appeals followed.
we review de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim and we must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.arakaki lingle,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.we may affirm the district court judgment on any ground supported by the record.classic media,mewborn,cir.
before ecpa,the chief statutory protection for communications was the wiretap act,enacted in,which regulated only the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication.in,congress enacted ecpa to update statutory privacy protections that had failed to keep pace with the technological developments in the years since the wiretap act was enacted,at,reprinted in,see generally orin kerr,the next generation communications privacy act.
ecpa focused on two types of computer services that were prominent in the late electronic communications services,the transfer of electronic messages,such as email,between computer users and remote computing services,the provision of offsite computer storage or processing of data and files.see generally quon arch wireless operating,cir,rev in nonrelevant part sub nom.city of ontario quon,office of tech.assessment,federal government information technology electronic surveillance and civil liberties.title i of ecpa amended the existing wiretap act.as relevant here,the amended wiretap act provides that with certain exceptions,a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public shall not intentionally divulge the contents of any communication other than one to such person or entity,or an agent thereof while in transmission on that service to any person or entity other than an addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient.a.the contents of a communication are defined as any information concerning the substance,purport,or meaning of that communication.id.even if a disclosure is otherwise prohibited by a,an electronic communications service provider can reveal the contents of communications transmitted on its service with the lawful consent of the originator or any addressee or intended recipient of such communication.id.b ii.
title ii of ecpa,termed the stored communications act,covers access to electronic information stored in third party computers.id.the relevant provision here imposes requirements on providers of remote computing services that are similar to the requirements of the wiretap act discussed above.under the stored communications act,a person or entity providing remote computing service to the public shall not knowingly divulge to any person or entity the contents of any communication which is carried or maintained on that service on behalf of,and received by means of electronic transmission from or created by means of computer processing of communications received by means of electronic transmission from,a subscriber or customer of such service solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer processing services to such subscriber or customer,unless the provider is authorized to access the contents of any such communications to provide other services.id.a.also,like the wiretap act,the stored communications act allows a provider of covered services to divulge the contents of a communication to an addressee or intended recipient of such communication,or with the lawful consent of the originator or an addressee or intended recipient of such communication,or the subscriber in the case of remote computing service.id.b.
the stored communications act incorporates the wiretap act definition of contents.see id.it also differentiates between contents and record information.section c permits an electronic communications service or remote computing service to divulge a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service not including the contents of communications covered by a or a to any person other than a governmental entity.although there is no specific statutory definition for record,the stored communications act provides examples of record information in a different provision that governs the government power to require a provider of electronic communications service or remote computing service to disclose such information.id.c.according to c,record information includes,among other things,the name,address,and subscriber number or identity of a subscriber to or customer of such service,but not the contents of communications.id.c a,b,e.in other words,the stored communications act generally precludes a covered entity from disclosing the contents of a communication,but permits disclosure of record information like the name,address,or client id number of the entity customers in certain circumstances.
ecpa provides a cause of action to third parties for violations of the wiretap act and the stored communications act.under the wiretap act,any person whose wire,oral,or electronic communication is disclosed may in a civil action recover from the person or entity such relief as may be appropriate,including damages and attorney fees,id.a,and under the stored communications act,any person aggrieved by any violation of this chapter in which the conduct constituting the violation is engaged in with a knowing or intentional state of mind may,in a civil action,recover from the person or entity which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate,id.a.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that facebook,zynga,and the third parties were the intended recipients of the referer headers containing the user facebook ids and the urls.according to the plaintiffs,because their complaints allege that facebook and zynga had privacy policies which precluded them from providing personally identifiable information to third parties,the exceptions in and b for intended recipients are inapplicable.facebook and zynga,in turn,raise a number of arguments as to why we should affirm the district court.because the plaintiffs complaints suffer from a common defect they fail to allege that either facebook or zynga divulged the contents of a communication to a third party we focus our analysis on this single ground in doing so,we express no opinion on the other elements of an ecpa claim.
because the plaintiffs alleged that facebook and zynga violated ecpa by disclosing the http referer information to third parties,we must determine whether such information is the contents of a communication for purposes of a and a.
to answer this question,we first must determine congress intended meaning of the word contents.in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier.we start with the plain language of the statutes.see gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay.for purposes of a and a,the word contents is defined as any information concerning the substance,purport,or meaning of a communication,a.because the words substance,purport,or meaning are not further defined,we consider the ordinary meaning of these terms,including their dictionary definition.see wilderness soc y fish wildlife,cir en banc,amended by cir en banc.a dictionary in wide circulation during the relevant time frame provides the fol
