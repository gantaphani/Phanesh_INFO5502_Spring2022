background 
lge is the owner of patents relating to personal computers,including patents disclosing systems and methods that increase the bandwidth efficiency of a computer system bus claiming,in relevant part,a method that controls the access of a device to a bus shared by multiple devices claiming,in relevant part,a system for ensuring that outdated data is not retrieved from memory claiming a system and method for ensuring that outdated data is not retrieved from memory and claiming networked computers capable of sharing certain video images.lge sued defendants alleging infringement of these patents.
defendants purchase microprocessors and chipsets from intel or its authorized distributors and install them in computers.intel is authorized to sell these products to defendants under an agreement with lge.however,pursuant to this agreement,intel notified defendants that,although it was licensed to sell the products to them,they were not authorized under that agreement to combine the products with products.lge brought suit against defendants,asserting that the combination of microprocessors or chipsets with other computer components infringes lge patents covering those combinations.lge did not assert patent rights in the microprocessors or chipsets themselves.
after construing the patent claims,the trial court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of each patent.it determined that there was no implied license to any defendant,but that,with the exception of the patent,lge rights in any system claims were exhausted.the court also found that lge was contractually barred from asserting infringement of the patent against defendants.it found the,and patents not infringed after applying its claim construction to the accused methods and devices.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we review the trial court grant of summary judgment without deference,reapplying the same standard as the trial court.lacavera dudas,citing star fruits united states.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we review claim construction de novo.cybor fas,en banc.
implied license 
in a suit for patent infringement,the burden of proving the establishment of an implied license falls upon the defendant.bandag,al bolser tire stores,citing bassick adams grease gun,cir.to prevail,defendants were required to establish that the products have no noninfringing uses and that the circumstances of the sale plainly indicate that the grant of a license should be inferred.korners unlimited,quoting bandag,at.the trial court found,and we agree,that intel sales of its licensed products to defendants do not warrant the inference of a license with respect to the asserted patents.regardless of any noninfringing uses,intel expressly informed them that intel license agreement with lge did not extend to any of defendants products made by combining an intel product with products.in light of this express disclaimer,no license can be implied.
ii.patent exhaustion 
the patents asserted by lge do not cover the products licensed to or sold by intel they cover those products when combined with additional components.the trial court,nevertheless,found that the system claims in all patents except the patent were exhausted,but that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply to the method claims.we reverse the trial court holding with respect to the system claims and affirm with respect to the method claims.
it is axiomatic that the patent exhaustion doctrine,commonly referred to as the first sale doctrine,is triggered by an unconditional sale.see mitchell hawley,wall.a n unconditional sale of a patented device exhausts the patentee right to control the purchaser use of the device thereafter.the theory behind this rule is that in such a transaction,the patentee has bargained for,and received,an amount equal to the full value of the goods.this exhaustion doctrine,however,does not apply to an expressly conditional sale or license.in such a transaction,it is more reasonable to infer that the parties negotiated a price that reflects only the value of the use rights conferred by the patentee.braun med.abbott,discussing mallinckrodt,medipart,emphasis added and citations omitted.
there are two sales at issue here.first,prior to this litigation,lge granted intel a license covering its entire portfolio of patents on computer systems and components.this transaction constitutes a sale for exhaustion purposes.see united states masonite.second,with lge authorization,intel sold its microprocessors and chipsets to each defendant.notably,this sale involved a component of the asserted patented invention,not the entire patented system.
the trial court issued two orders on patent exhaustion.the first is unclear about which sale the court relied upon in holding lge system patent rights exhausted with respect to defendants,but we understand it to be lge license to intel.intel i at.however,the second order,which reaffirmed the first,clearly relied on intel sale of its microprocessors and chipsets to defendants as the exhausting sale.lg,d at.in finding the unconditional sale requirement satisfied,the court concluded that although lge is entitled to impose conditions on the sale of the essential components of its patented products does not mean that it actually did so here.to the contrary,defendants purchase of the microprocessors and chipsets from intel was unconditional,in that defendants purchase of the microprocessors and chipsets from intel was in no way conditioned on their agreement not to combine the intel microprocessors and chipsets with other parts and then sell the resultant products.id.at.we disagree.
the license expressly disclaims granting a license allowing computer system manufacturers to combine intel licensed parts with other components.moreover,this conditional agreement required intel to notify its customers of the limited scope of the license,which it did.although intel was free to sell its microprocessors and chipsets,those sales were conditional,and intel customers were expressly prohibited from infringing lge combination patents.law allowing contracts to be supplemented by consistent additional terms unless the writing is intended to be complete and exclusive.the exhaustion doctrine does not apply to an expressly conditional sale or license,braun med,at,so lge rights in asserting infringement of its system claims were not exhausted.
conversely,the trial court declined to find lge asserted method claims exhausted.several defendants contest this ruling on,and we reject their challenge.based on the above reasoning,even if the exhaustion doctrine were applicable to method claims,it would not apply here because there was no unconditional sale.however,the sale of a device does not exhaust a patentee rights in its method claims.glass equip,besten,citing bandag,al bolser tire stores.the court was correct.
iii.patent 
the patent discloses a system of networked computers capable of sharing video images.the trial court exhaustion ruling did not extend to the patent instead it granted summary judgment of noninfringement on the ground that lge was contractually barred from asserting infringement of the patent claims against defendants.this conclusion was based on a provision in a contract between lge and microsoft,which barred lge from suing microsoft,its suppliers,their subsidiaries,or their licensees.the court concluded that defendants were included within this class of parties.because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether defendants fall within the protection of this contract provision,we reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement.
in determining whether lge is barred under the agreement from suing defendants for infringement,the dispositive issue is whether each defendant is a microsoft licensee.defendants are installers tpis that assemble computers for original equipment manufacturers oems.the oems have licenses with microsoft,and it is undisputed that defendants were authorized to install microsoft products on the systems they manufacture.it is unclear,however,whether defendants authorization was under have made rights of the oems agreements with microsoft,whereby the oem would be authorized to use a third party for completing work on its behalf,or whether such authorization was as a sublicensee.if the work was authorized solely by an oem have made rights,and if that oem were not authorized to grant sublicenses under its agreement with microsoft,then defendants may not be licensees protected by the provision.cyrix intel,distinguishing have made rights from sublicenses.a genuine issue of material fact exists as to each defendant status.
on remand,defendants must establish that lge is contractually barred from pursuing infringement claims against them.see mccoy mitsuboshi cutlery.although the parties have relied on the agreement in arguing whether or not defendants are microsoft licensees,that agreement is not the proper focus.it is the agreements between each oem and each defendant,and those between microsoft and the oem hiring each defendant that matter.
the record indicates that fic was both a tpi and an oem.as an oem,it had a license from microsoft,and therefore falls squarely within the scope of protected parties under the provision.however,the contract provision only bars suit against microsoft licensees for infringement on account of the manufacture,use,sale,or distribution of microsoft products.lge does not dispute that there is no infringement absent the microsoft software in the accused devices,since the software satisfies some,but not all,limitations of the patent claims.however,lge argues that any infringement was not on account of the use of microsoft products.the trial court rejected this argument,essentially reading the on account of language as a but for requirement.
the on account of language,however,is not susceptible of only one interpretation.according to the supreme court in construing this phrase in an unrelated statute,the phrase on account of does not unambiguously define itself.united states,d construing b.here,too,the degree of causation required by this contract term is unclear.because proper construction requires factual considerations,we reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment.scott galvanizing,nw.enviroservices,see also bnc mortgage,tax pros,if the contract written words have two or more reasonable meanings,are ambiguous when read in context,a court may not grant summary judgment or direct a verdict instead,it must put the case to a trier of fact.citations omitted.
the parties also dispute the trial court construction of several claim terms in the patent.claim,from which asserted claims and depend,contains the limitation of a control unit for controlling the communication unit,wherein the control unit comprises a central processing unit cpu and a partitioned memory system.lge contends that the trial court erroneously construed the term control unit as a limitation.
a claim term that does not use means will trigger the rebuttable presumption that does not apply.lighting world,birchwood lighting,quoting ccs fitness,brunswick.this presumption can be rebutted by showing that the claim element recite s a function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function.watts xl,citing rodime plc seagate.however,the presumption is a strong one that is not readily overcome.lighting world,at.
here,the claim limitation at issue does not use the term means,and the presumption against treatment is not overcome.the claim itself provides sufficient structure,namely a cpu and a partitioned memory system,for performing the stated function,controlling the communication unit.see id.at.thus,the proper construction of control unit is a combination comprising a cpu and a partitioned memory system capable of controlling the communication unit.
defendants contend on cross appeal that the trial court also misconstrued claim by not requiring multiple displays.in particular,they contend that the preamble term image processing system requires multiple displays in light of the prosecution history.however,the claim language does not include this limitation,and the trial court properly refused to read it into the claim.moreover,the body of the claim provides for a display.kcj kinetic concepts,this court has repeatedly emphasized that an indefinite article a or an in patent parlance carries the meaning of one or more in claims containing the transitional phrase comprising.citations omitted.claim differentiation also supports the trial court construction because dependent claim adds the limitation of the image processing system further compris ing at least first and second displays coupled to the cpu of the image processing system.see phillips awh,differences among claims can also be a useful guide in understanding the meaning of particular claim terms.citing laitram rexnord.
the prosecution history relied upon by defendants does not compel a different construction.the patentee made arguments during prosecution to distinguish claims in the parent application to the patent,which expressly required multiple displays,over the prior art.these arguments,however,do not compel reading a multiple display limitation into the patent,which does not expressly require multiple displays.see elkay ebco,when multiple patents derive from the same initial application,the prosecution history regarding a claim limitation in any patent that has issued applies with equal force to subsequently issued patents that contain the same claim limitation.emphasis added.
the patent discloses a digital computer system that has devices called agents that are interconnected by a system bus.the claimed system and corresponding method require one agent,the requesting agent,to request access to a memory stored on another agent,called the replying agent.the requested data is organized as a matrix of memory cells,having column and row coordinates.the memory controller of the replying agent processes the request from the requesting agent by asserting a plurality of memory address control signals,including at least one row address strobe ras signal and one column address strobe cas signal.this page mode memory access operates by the assertion of an entire row of data followed by the assertion and deassertion of multiple column addresses.by the ras signal accessing an entire row followed by the assertion and deassertion of particular column addresses,this page mode memory access differs from the conventional memory access,which separately accessed each memory cell by asserting its individual row address and column address.in the claimed invention,after the data is accessed,it is then transferred to the requesting agent over the system bus.
lge alleged infringement of system claims and and method claims and.the trial court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of all asserted claims,concluding that the signals in defendants devices did not travel over the system bus.however,the patent claims do not contain a limitation requiring that the strobe signals travel over the system bus.moreover,the specification does not suggest that the strobe signals must travel over the system bus.to the contrary,figure shows an embodiment of the invention in which the strobe signals travel only internally within the replying agent,not across the system bus.
in an attempt to impose this limitation on the claims,defendants rely on the prosecution history.while the prosecution history is relevant to claim construction,it often lacks the clarity of the specification and thus is less useful for claim construction purposes.phillips,at citations omitted.here,defendants point to statements in the prosecution history that the prior art does not teach a page mode type of access over a system bus from a requesting agent to a replying agent.while we agree that this and other statements in the prosecution history lack ideal clarity,we do not find that they rise to the level of disclaiming or limiting the scope of the express claim language.therefore,the trial court erred in construing the claims to require the ras and cas signals to travel over the system bus.in addition,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accused devices and methods utilize strobe signals.lge expert submitted an affidavit that the accused devices employ strobe signals,which precludes summary judgment.
in the alternative,defendants contend that lge failed to present evidence of an end of access signal.this signal,which is required by the claims,is generated by the requesting agent and received by a detecting means coupled to the memory address control signal asserting means.when the detection means receives this end of access signal,the operation is halted.defendants contend that lge failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accused devices contain this limitation.however,the trial court did not consider this argument,and we will not address this factual issue in the first instance.
lge also argues that the trial court construction of the requesting agent claim limitation was in error.the court construed this term as a device coupled to the system bus that requests access to a memory located on a replying agent.claim construction order at.lge contends that an industry standard,which was incorporated into the specification by reference,provides the proper claim construction of this term.patent ll.the incorporated standard explicitly defines the term requesting agent as an agent that has entered into the arbitration function for bus access.defendants contend,however,that the patentee did not act as its own lexicographer by incorporating this industry standard by reference.the trial court did not accept lge proposed construction,concluding that it was a preferred embodiment and did not limit the claimed invention.the difference in the two constructions is temporal lge proposed construction defines an agent as a requesting agent only when it is engaged in arbitration for bus access,whereas the trial court construction defines a requesting agent regardless of whether it is actively engaged in arbitration.
we have recognized that the i nterpretation of descriptive statements in a patent written description is a difficult task,as an inherent tension exists as to whether a statement is a clear lexicographic definition or a description of a preferred embodiment.thus in determining whether a statement by a patentee was intended to be lexicographic,it is important to determine whether the statement was designed to define the claim term or to describe a preferred embodiment.id.we agree with the trial court and defendants that the patentee did not act as its own lexicographer here.instead,the industry standard was incorporated as a preferred embodiment.the specification makes this clear by explaining that a lthough the method and apparatus of the invention will be described herein in the context of a multibus ii environment,it should be appreciated that the invention may be practiced in many digital computer systems having a bus for transferring data between at least two agents interconnected upon the bus.patent ll.
chimie ppg industries,does not compel a different result.in chimie,we were confronted with the claim terms and.after concluding that these terms were relative and could only be understood by comparison with the prior art,we concluded that only one standard was disclosed in the specification for making such a comparison.we limited these claim terms to the disclosed standard.here,however,there is no relative term that can not be understood without reference to an industry standard.
but,this does not end our inquiry.the proper claim construction is the ordinary and customary meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention,as of the effective filing date of the patent application.phillips,at citations omitted.when prior art that sheds light on the meaning of a term is cited by the patentee,it can have particular value as a guide to the proper construction of the term,because it may indicate not only the meaning of the term to persons skilled in the art,but also that the patentee intended to adopt that meaning.arthur collins,telecom.although we have concluded that the patentee did not expressly adopt the definition of requesting agent in the incorporated industry standard,that standard remains relevant in determining the meaning of the claim term to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the patent application was filed,and it is treated as intrinsic evidence for claim construction purposes,see,benetton group spa,this court has established that prior art cited in a patent or cited in the prosecution history of the patent constitutes intrinsic evidence.citations omitted.
here,the trial court erred by failing to give proper weight to the incorporated industry standard it failed to consider the standard as intrinsic evidence of the meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art as of the filing date.after considering the standard,in addition to the patent claims and specification,we conclude that lge proffered definition based on the standard is correct.thus,we construe requesting agent as an agent that has entered into the arbitration function for bus access.this construction is entirely consistent with the specification,which provides that at one time in the operation of the system the requesting agent may be a replying agent,and that the replying agent may at that time be a requesting agent.patent ll.this language makes clear that the classification of an agent depends upon the function the agent is performing at any given time,whether it is engaged in arbitration at a given moment.
the patent discloses a rotating priority system that provides multiple computer devices alternating access to a system bus,which is the pathway over which the various components of a computer system transmit data.this system addresses the problem of hogging,in which one component of a computer system monopolizes access to the system bus.the asserted claims of the patent,method claims establish a rotating priority system that limits each device access to the bus.in particular,claim sets forth two steps of the method as counting a number of accesses by the device to the bus and then in response to a predetermined number of accesses to the bus,giving another device the highest priority.the trial court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent,holding that the claim limitation of counting a number of accesses by the device to the bus was not practiced in the accused method.
the court construed the claim limitation counting a number of accesses as counting the number of times a device gains use of the bus.claim construction order at.the parties do not directly challenge this construction,but lge argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the accused method performed this step.lge argues that the master latency timer mlt in defendants accused devices performs this step.mlts count clock signals when an anchor node has possession of the bus.defendants contend that although an mlt limits the time duration of bus access by a device,it does not count the number of accesses by the device.defendants also contend that,in some instances,the mlts continue counting when clock signals pass even if no access to the bus is taking place,such as during wait periods when no data is being placed on the bus.
lge responds that the bus is accessed even during wait periods,regardless of whether any data is placed on the bus,because the device has access to the bus.lge points out that the purpose of the invention is to eliminate hogging the bus,and that the bus is being hogged even during wait periods.further,lge argues that,under the trial court construction,a device still has use of the bus during a wait period.lge points to the discussion in the patent relating to figure.patent.in this preferred embodiment,the description includes a programmable node grant counter ngcnt.the description explains that when certain conditions are met,an enable count input is asserted and during a bus access cycle a transition of a clock signal causes ngcnt to increment by one count.therefore,when certain criteria are met,a clock signal can create an access count.
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the accused devices count the number of accesses.see ranbaxy,apotex,infringement,both literal and under the doctrine of equivalents,is a question of fact.citing insituform,cat contracting.the central issue is whether the bus is accessed on each clock signal so that the clock signals,in effect,count the number of accesses to the bus.the trial court agreed that lge argument is consistent with its claim construction,but found that it failed to present evidence supporting its position.to the contrary lge presented sufficient expert testimony on this issue to avoid summary judgment.lge expert testified that some type of signal is asserted with each clock signal,and,if proven,this would in effect make the mlts count accesses.the summary judgment is vacated.
the patent discloses a system for ensuring that the most current data is retrieved from the main memory.because individual devices can update data in their own local cache memory without immediately writing the new data back to the main memory,data in the main memory can be stale.therefore,the system claimed in the patent monitors the data being transferred over the bus,and if data stored in the cache matches the address of the data being transferred,a hold signal is asserted.then,the data being transferred is compared with the data on the cache.if there is a difference,the data stored on the cache,which is the most recent data,is also transferred.
the trial court concluded the patent claims asserted were not infringed based on its patent exhaustion holding,which we reverse above.however,lge contends that the trial court also improperly construed claims,and.in particular,lge disputes the trial court construction of cache memory means in claims and and cache memory in claim,which were construed as one of at least two high speed memories located close to the cpu of a computer to give the cpu faster access to blocks of data than could be taken directly from the larger,slower main memory and never using bits.claim construction order at.lge contends that the trial court improperly read claims and as requiring at least two caches.it also contends that the trial court improperly read in the limitation that neither cache uses bits.
we agree with lge that the trial court erred in reading the limitation of at least two high speed memories into claims and.unlike claim,which expressly requires at least two cache memory means,claims and have no such express limitation.phillips,at differences among claims can also be a useful guide in understanding the meaning of particular claim terms.citing laitram rexnord.to the contrary,claims and only require one or more cpus and a cache memory coupled between the cpu and the bus.because the claims expressly cover one central processing unit,they logically also cover systems with only one cache coupled between that single central processing unit and the bus.defendants rely on the fact that the written description describes a system with multiple caches.however,as we explain in more detail below,the patent application initially described two inventions,and these statements relate to the other invention that is not claimed in the patent.
we also agree with lge that the trial court improperly read the limitation of never using bits into the claims.the patent background section suggests that bits were used to manage data in systems with more than one cache.in particular,it explains that the purpose of the invalid bit is to redirect a processor attempting to access an address in its cache to another cache with a more updated memory associated with that address.patent ll.the claims at issue do not themselves expressly include or exclude the use of bits.defendants,however,contend that the trial court construction is supported by the specification and prosecution history.the specification states that a further object of this invention is to provide a cache memory system wherein the use of data indicators are avoided.patent ll.it further states that i t should be kept in mind during the following description,that the invention maintains data integrity by assuring that cache data is always the most in the system.thus,there never is a valid or invalid indication with respect to any cache data as it is always assured that if data is provided by a cache,that it invariably is valid most.id.ll.
defendants are correct that reviewing the specification in construing claims is appropriate,phillips,at,but such review need not be done in the abstract.here,as noted above,the original patent application disclosed two inventions.as the examiner observed,one invention was drawn to a cache system for updating each copy of the data stored in a plurality of caches when the data is modified,and the other was drawn to a cache system for sending the most current data to a requestor by monitoring the address of a data on a data bus for detecting whether the data is stored and modified in the cache.the patent examiner concluded that these two inventions were distinct and required the applicant to elect one invention.the applicant ultimately limited the original application to the latter group of claims,which issued as the patent,and the other claim group was separated into a different application,which ultimately issued as patent.
here,the discussion of bits in the specification was relevant to systems,because the patent background provides that s o long as a write back cache is utilized with only one processor,data management is straight forward.however,when more than one central processor uses the same main memory,data management problems multiply.patent ll.the patent explains that the data management problems in multiple cpu systems are a result,at least in part,of their containing more than one cache memory.managing data in multiple cache systems was the subject of the invention not elected during prosecution and,therefore,the statements in the specification referring to bits are not relevant to the invention ultimately claimed in the patent.pitney bowes,observing that a written description describing multiple inventions may not be relevant in toto to each of those inventions.indeed,the unelected claims expressly contained the limitation that the cache memory means hav e no provisions for indicating the invalidity of said data units,whereas the elected claims contained no such limitation.
for the same reasons,we do not find that the patentee disavowed the use of bits under the doctrine of specification disclaimer.t he specification may reveal an intentional disclaimer,or disavowal,of claim scope by an inventor.in that instance,the inventor has dictated the correct claim scope,and the inventor intention,as expressed in the specification,is regarded as dispositive.phillips,at see also scimed life advanced cardiovascular.however,because the statements relied upon by defendants relate to the invention not elected during prosecution,there is no clear disavowal with respect to the invention actually claimed in the patent.
vii.patent 
like the patent,the patent claims a system and method for ensuring that the most current data,as opposed to stale data,is retrieved from memory.the
