before us are stemming from a well known incident the theft from tjx computers of customer credit and debit card information and the subsequent fraudulent use of the information.see generally in re tjx.retail sec.breach,d mcmorris tjx,d.law suits ensued,this banks injured in the them.
in january,tjx companies,tjx,headquartered in massachusetts and a major operator of discount stores,revealed that its computer systems had been hacked.credit or debit card data for millions of its customers had been stolen.harm resulted not only to customers but,it appears,also to banks that had issued the cards issuing banks,which were forced to reimburse customers for fraudulent use of the cards and incurred other expenses.
in may,amerifirst bank,based in alabama,filed suit in the federal district court in massachusetts against tjx and,in addition,against an ohio bank and its third bank and fifth third bancorp collectively fifth third fifth third served as processing bank for tjx transactions,receiving the data from the customer initial charge for a purchase and,after verification from the issuing bank,authorizing the charge.visa and mastercard each had a network and regime for such purposes.
amerifirst complaint,seeking class action status for issuing banks,charged that both tjx and fifth third were variously at fault that tjx and fifth third failed to follow security protocols prescribed by visa and mastercard to safeguard personal and financial information that the breaches occurred from july onward but were discovered and disclosed only later and that the issuing banks suffered losses from reimbursing customers for fraud losses,monitoring customers accounts,and cancelling and reissuing cards.
the complaint charged negligence,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and unfair or deceptive practices under chapter.laws ch.the defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.b.on october,the district court dismissed the negligence and breach of contract claims but refused to dismiss claims based on negligent misrepresentation and chapter.a fifth claim,for negligence per se,was dismissed and is not at issue.in re tjx.retail sec.breach,d.
plaintiffs then moved to amend their complaint,seeking to add a claim for conversion and also new facts to the chapter claim.on november,the district court provisionally denied class status if made final,this denial would in turn defeat subject matter jurisdiction based on the minimal diversity provisions of the class action fairness act.the court invited briefing as to whether,if class action status were ultimately denied,it should transfer the case to state court.in re tjx.retail sec.breach.
on december,the court denied the motion to amend the complaint,it made the denial of class status final,and it ordered the transfer of the case to the massachusetts superior court.although all but two of the claims had been dismissed,the district court designated its rulings as without prejudice to reconsideration by the state court.at defendants request,this court stayed the transfer pending review on appeal.
tjx and fifth third now appeal to this court,urging principally that all claims against them should have been dismissed with prejudice and that in any event transfer to the state court was precluded by governing precedent.amerifirst and selco raise standing and finality objections to defendants appeal and ask for affirmance of the transfer order but by cross appeal,they say that dismissal of their other claims was error and that both class action status and the motion to amend should have been allowed.
jurisdiction,standing and finality.although no party has questioned it,we are compelled to consider first an oddity that might seem to imperil subject matter jurisdiction.jurisdiction in the district court rested on the minimum diversity provision available only for class actions,and ultimately the district court ruled that class certification was improper.so one might ask how do the parties now get to litigate on the merits whether specific counts did or did not state claims 
the answer is the district judge had provisional jurisdiction to decide those merits whether class action status was sustainable depended in part on what claims were on the table.in such cases it is both proper and necessary for the trial court first to resolve the merits of the claim to the extent necessary to allow the court to properly determine its own jurisdiction.augustine united states,cir.see generally bell hood.
in the end,after disposing of standing and finality objections,our analysis of the those sustained and those us to agree for the most part with the able district judge analysis although not with the transfer order but to disagree in one respect that reopens the class action issue.we therefore end by remanding for further proceedings as explained below.
the standing and finality objections are directed to bar defendants argument that two remaining counts of the misrepresentation and chapter have been dismissed.plaintiffs say that because the district court dismissed other counts and thereafter transferred the case,the merits rulings against the defendants on the remaining counts caused no harm to them,beyond speculative collateral estoppel effects that might flow from the rulings in future litigation.
because the district court ruled that the two counts stated viable claims,the defendants were plainly and concretely disadvantaged instead of an end to the liability claims,they now face further litigation of these claims indeed,in this very case,because the transfer turns out to be invalid and the claims may still end up going forward in the district court.they are thus entitled to appeal from the adverse that the ruling is embodied in a final judgment.
ordinarily a defendant may not appeal from a denial of a rule b motion because the litigation in the trial court will not have concluded.but here the district court brought the case before it to an end by the class action ruling and purported transfer.appeals from transfers between federal courts are sometimes immediately appealable and sometimes not but where the transfer court lacks power to transfer,an order purporting to do so can hardly defeat review of an otherwise final judgment.
plaintiffs also argue that the defendants appeal is barred because the district court said that its merits rulings were without prejudice to reconsideration by the state courts.dismissals without prejudice are sometimes deemed to prevent an immediate appeal where they represent an invitation to a plaintiff to cure some technical deficiency by in the same court,umbenhauer woog,cir.in this case,no such invitation was extended by the district court.
finally plaintiffs invoke balcom lynn ladder scaffolding,cir,which refused to allow a defendant,vindicated by a jury,to appeal from a judgment in its favor.this defendant wanted to challenge jury findings,fearing that they would prejudice it in future litigation.this court said that the findings were not essential to the judgment and thus would have no collateral estoppel effect.id.at.balcom is clearly not on point.
negligent misrepresentation.we therefore turn to the merits of defendants appeal,starting with the negligent misrepresentation claim which the district court found adequately alleged for purposes of rule b.review of rule b rulings is de novo.first medical health plan,cir.at the outset,one has to understand the nature of the claim as stated in the complaint and as thereafter clarified by the plaintiffs in resisting the motion to dismiss.
the complaint alleged that fifth third has contracts with mastercard and visa that require compliance with operating regulations adopted by each credit card organization and that tjx and fifth third similarly have a contract that requires tjx to comply with such regulations.it further alleged that tjx and fifth third ignored security measures required by the operating examples,that signatories deploy a firewall configuration,protect stored data,encrypt transmission of cardholder data,and track access to cardholder data and network resources.
but although tjx and fifth third are charged in the complaint with misrepresentations,the plaintiffs elaborated in their district court filings and brief on to rest with one doubtful exception as to fifth third on a flimsier foundation than actual misrepresentation.rather,plaintiffs argue that by accepting credit cards and processing payment authorizations,defendants impliedly represented that they would comply with mastercard and visa regulations and this was the negligent misrepresentation.
massachusetts law defines negligent misrepresentation using the restatement second of torts,which in section requires the following elements 
one who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
nycal kpmg peat marwick llp,quoting the restatement.
it would almost surely stretch massachusetts law too far to say that merely doing credit card transactions with issuing banks,whether directly fifth third or indirectly tjx,is a representation implied by conduct to third parties that the defendants were complying with detailed security specifications of visa and mastercard.the implication is implausible and converts the cause of action into liability for the limitations otherwise applicable to negligence claims.
conduct can be part of a representation,but the link between the conduct and the implication is typically tight.thus,in danca taunton sav.bank,the court upheld an implied representation claim where plaintiffs,in applying for a mortgage,were told by the bank that it needed to assure compliance with a zoning requirement later by a combination of words and action,the bank led the plaintiffs to believe that the bank had found compliance.more recently the sjc said of danca 
we emphasized the importance to our decision of the defendant conduct and words and response to the plaintiffs inquiry,holding it sufficient that the representation was reasonably understood as a statement that the bank employees had looked at the plan and found no problems.
page frazier,quoting danca,at.
yet we stop short of holding that the district court had to dismiss the misrepresentation claim in this case on the face of a complaint that explicitly alleged misrepresentation.recently the massachusetts trial court refused to dismiss virtually the same claim brought by credit unions against fifth third and another defendant for credit card losses resulting from a security breach.cumis ins,bj wholesale club,wl.plaintiffs naturally rely on this decision,as did the district court.
then,on summary judgment in cumis,it became crystal clear that the charge of misrepresentation rested simply on the doing of credit card same implication from conduct argument that plaintiffs offer in this case.the cumis court then granted summary judgment for defendants because inter alia such conduct was not a misrepresentation under massachusetts law.cumis ins,bj wholesale club.the ultimate disposition is therefore far more helpful to defendants.
ordinarily a district court does not have to look behind the complaint and grant a motion to dismiss because later statements by the plaintiff offer a narrower picture of what plaintiff expects to prove at trial.had the second cumis decision been available,the district court might well have granted the motion,but summary judgment is the more common method of disposing of claims that are facially valid but prove usually after discovery to be unsupported by evidence.the present claim thus survives,but on life support.
chapter.the provisions of chapter invoked by plaintiffs,ch,pertinently provide for a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices as between unfairness label in these provisions being a to more specific standards borrowed from an appropriate source of law.ciardi roche.plaintiffs offered three different theories invoking specific standards 
negligent misrepresentation already alleged as a separate tort under massachusetts law,
violation of section of the federal trade commission act,a,which chapter and 
violation of a federal statute that protects information that customers confide to financial institutions,act.
the district court sustained only the first of these theories and it rejected the other two.
the negligent misrepresentation claim is likely to have no future in this case for reasons just explained and,if it falls,so too does its use under chapter.townsends,beaupre.further,the district court we below uphold its the negligent misrepresentation claim,whether standing alone or under chapter,is not certifiable under the class action rubric.this brings us to the second theory plaintiffs have abandoned the third.
plaintiffs contend that their second defendants lack of security measures was unfair under the federal trade commission an alternative basis for its chapter claim.the district court disagreed,saying that the unfairness characterization rested on consent decrees of the federal trade commission and the court said a consent decree is not under massachusetts law an authoritative determination for purposes of chapter.whitinsville plaza,kotseas.plaintiffs read the case more narrowly.
to bring conduct within the unfairness rubric of chapter does not require that it have been specifically condemned by the ftc which has itself identified general factors to consider in identifying unfairness.the sjc has held that 
relying on ftc interpretations the following are considerations to be used in determining whether a practice is to be deemed unfair whether the practice is within at least the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness is immoral,unethical,oppressive,or unscrupulous causes substantial injury to competitors or other businessmen.
datacomm is itself an example of this approach.see also chapter rights remedies margot botsford,mcle ed.
if the charges in the complaint are true and obviously the details matter,a court using these general ftc criteria might well find in the present case inexcusable and protracted reckless conduct,aggravated by failure to give prompt notice when lapses were discovered internally,and causing very widespread and serious harm to other companies and to innumberable consumers.and such conduct,a court might conclude,is conduct unfair,oppressive and highly so in violation of chapter under the ftc interpretation.
further,we do not think irrelevant the host of ftc complaints and consent decrees condemning as unfair conduct specific behavior similar to that charged by plaintiffs.whitinsville broad language occurred where the court itself concluded on the merits that the conduct in legal challenge in reasonably justified and the decision may mean no more than that a consent decree does not establish a per se violation.whitinsville,mass at.further,whitinsville is not the sjc only or latest word on the subject.
on the contrary,prior to whitinsville the sjc had expressly relied on an ftc consent decree in one case,schubach household finance,and ftc advisory opinions in another,pmp,supra,at and,quite recently,the sjc invoked a consent decree secured by the federal deposit insurance corporation as providing relevant standards under chapter although not to establish liability since consent decrees do not usually determine facts 
the fact that the fdic ordered fremont to cease and desist from the use of almost precisely the loan features that are included in the judge list of presumptively unfair characteristics indicates that the fdic considered that under established mortgage lending standards,the marketing of loans with these features constituted unsafe and unsound banking practice with clearly harmful consequences for borrowers.such unsafe and unsound conduct on the part of a lender,insofar as it leads directly to injury for consumers,qualifies as unfair under.

where,as here,a substantial body of ftc complaints and consent decrees focus on a class of conduct,it is hard to se
