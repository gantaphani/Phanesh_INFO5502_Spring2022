in its isp remand order,the federal communications commission fcc adopted four interim,intercarrier compensation rules to govern telecommunications traffic bound for internet service providers.core communications,a competitive local exchange carrier,filed a petition asking the fcc to forbear from applying those rules pursuant to a.the fcc denied core petition with respect to two of the rules and granted it with respect to the other two.core then filed a petition for review in this court,seeking reversal of the fcc partial denial of its petition for forbearance.we consolidated core petition for review with its mirror image a petition for review filed by bellsouth corporation,an incumbent local exchange carrier,seeking reversal of the fcc partial grant of core petition for forbearance.for the reasons discussed below,we now deny both petitions.
before broadband connections such as cable modem and digital subscriber line dsl service became widely available,consumers generally gained access to the internet through connections provided by local telephone companies.under the method,a consumer uses a line provided by a local exchange carrier lec usually an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec to dial the local telephone number of an internet service provider isp,which then connects the call to the internet.typically,the isp does not subscribe to the ilec,but instead subscribes to another competitive local exchange carrier clec that interconnects with the incumbent.accordingly,a consumer who to the internet usually obligates an originating ilec to transfer the call to a clec,which then delivers the call to the isp.
although this relay is imperceptible to the caller,how the call is paid for matters a great deal to the participating telecommunications carriers.section b of the communications act of,as amended by the telecommunications act of the act,requires lecs to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b.under a reciprocal compensation arrangement,w hen a customer of carrier a makes a local call to a customer of carrier b,and carrier b uses its facilities to connect,or terminate,that call to its own customer,the originating carrier a is ordinarily required to compensate the terminating carrier b for the use of carrier b facilities.sbc fcc,cir citing global naps,fcc.
if traffic were governed by b,then reciprocal compensation arrangements would be required for the described above,and ilecs would be required to compensate clecs for completing their customers calls to isps.whether traffic is so governed is a question that has been the subject of two prior fcc orders and two prior decisions of this court.we briefly recount that history and then describe core subsequent petition for forbearance.
in,the fcc construed the reciprocal compensation arrangements provision of b to apply only to traffic that originates and terminates within a local area.implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,fcc rcd,wl.although that initial pronouncement did not address whether calls to an isp for connection to the internet are local or,the commission concluded in its declaratory ruling that such calls are,and thus that b is inapplicable.see implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,compensation for traffic,fcc rcd,wl declaratory ruling.instead,the fcc concluded that calls constitute interstate traffic,subject to fcc jurisdiction under of the act see id.at,implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecommunications act of,intercarrier compensation for traffic,fcc rcd,wl isp remand order construing the declaratory ruling.in bell atlantic telephone fcc,however,this court found that the commission had inadequately explained its conclusion that traffic is,and therefore vacated and remanded the declaratory ruling.see.
in,the fcc responded to our decision in bell atlantic with the isp remand order.once again,the commission concluded that calls delivered to isps are not subject to the mandatory reciprocal compensation obligations of b.see isp remand order,fcc rcd at.rather than basing its conclusion on a determination that calls are and hence not subject to b,this time the commission relied on a different statutory section,g see id.at.according to the fcc,g was intended to exclude the kinds of traffic enumerated in that subsection,specifically exchange access,information access,and exchange services for such access,from the reciprocal compensation requirements of subsection b.id.at,quoting g.and it found that calls made to isps located within the caller local calling area fall within those enumerated,that they involve information access.id.at,see bell atlantic,at.those calls,the fcc concluded,are thus not subject to b,but are instead subject to the fcc regulatory authority under.see id.at,id.at,id.at,see also supra note quoting.
having concluded that intercarrier compensation for traffic is within the jurisdiction of th e commission under section of the act,the fcc sought to establish an appropriate cost recovery mechanism for delivery of this traffic.id.at.in considering the possible alternatives,the fcc noted that the existing intercarrier compensation mechanism,in which the originating carrier pays the carrier that serves the isp,has created opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and distorted the economic incentives related to competitive entry into the local exchange and exchange access markets.id.at.the fcc explained the different considerations attendant to traditional telephone service and internet in this way 
traditionally,telephone carriers would interconnect with each other to deliver calls to each other customers.it was generally assumed that traffic back and forth on these interconnected networks would be relatively balanced.consequently,to compensate interconnecting carriers,mechanisms like reciprocal compensation were employed,whereby the carrier whose customer initiated the call would pay the other carrier the costs of using its network.
internet usage has distorted the traditional assumptions because traffic to an isp flows exclusively in one direction,creating an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage and leading to uneconomical results.because traffic to isps flows one way,so does money in a reciprocal compensation regime.it was not long before some lecs saw the opportunity to sign up isps as customers and collect,rather than pay,compensation because isp modems do not generally call anyone in the exchange.
id.at.the commission described the market distortions that result from applying a reciprocal compensation regime to such a large volume of traffic that is virtually all is,delivered to the isp,id.at,as follows 
because intercarrier compensation rates do not reflect the degree to which the carrier can recover costs from its,payments from other carriers may enable a carrier to offer service to its customers at rates that bear little relationship to its actual costs carriers thus have the incentive to seek out customers,including but not limited to isps,with high volumes of incoming traffic that will generate high reciprocal compensation payments.to the extent that carriers offer these customers below cost retail rates subsidized by intercarrier compensation,these customers do not receive accurate price signals.moreover,because the originating lec typically charges its customers averaged rates,the originating receives inaccurate price signals as the costs associated with the intercarrier payments are recovered through rates averaged across all of the originating carriers end users.
id.at,internal citations omitted.for these reasons,the commission concluded,we believe that the application of reciprocal compensation to traffic undermines the operation of competitive markets.id.at.
after concluding that a reciprocal compensation mechanism results in market distortions,the fcc announced that it was tandem with its isp remand notice of proposed rulemaking to consider whether the commission should replace existing intercarrier compensation schemes with a regime.id.at,see notice of proposed rulemaking,in the matter of developing a unified intercarrier compensation regime,fcc rcd,wl nprm.under such a regime,neither of two interconnecting networks charges the other for terminating traffic that originates on the other network.instead,each network recovers its costs from its own.id.at.thus,in the typical scenario discussed above,the originating ilec would recover its costs from its customer who initiated the call,while the clec would recover its costs from its isp customer to which it delivered the call.the commission concluded that a bill and keep regime for traffic may eliminate the incentives and concomitant opportunity for regulatory arbitrage by forcing carriers to look only to their isp customers,rather than to other carriers,for cost recovery.as a result,the rates paid by isps and,consequently,their customers should better reflect the costs of services to which they subscribe.id.at.
although the fcc issued the nprm looking toward a regime,the commission nonetheless deemed it prudent to avoid a flash cut to a new compensation regime that would upset the legitimate business expectations of carriers and their customers.id.at.it therefore adopted an interim intercarrier compensation regime for traffic that serves to limit,if not end,the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage,while avoiding a flash cut to a pure bill and keep regime.id.at.the interim regime,the fcc said,will govern intercarrier compensation for traffic until we have resolved the issues raised in the intercarrier compensation nprm.id.at.four provisions of the interim regime are relevant to the instant matter 
rate caps.the commission adopted rate caps,which established a gradually declining maximum rate that a carrier typically,a clec could charge another carrier typically,an ilec for delivering a call to an isp.see id.at.although the rate caps limited how much carriers could recover from other carriers,the carriers remained free to recover a ny additional costs from,that is,from their own customers.id.at,see id.at,see also petition of core communications,for forbearance under c from application of the isp remand order,fcc rcd,wl forbearance order.
mirroring rule.as an adjunct to the rate caps,the commission established a mirroring rule,which provided that the rate caps on traffic would apply only if the ilec also offered to charge the clec the same capped rate to terminate local traffic that originated on the clec network.see isp remand order,fcc rcd at,see also forbearance order,fcc rcd at.
growth caps.in addition to the rate caps,the commission adopted growth caps,which imposed a limit on the total number of minutes for which a carrier could receive intercarrier compensation.see isp remand order,fcc rcd at.the caps were equal to the total minutes for which the lec was previously entitled to compensation,plus a percent annual growth factor for each of the first two years under the interim regime.beyond the caps,traffic had to be exchanged on a basis.see id.at,id.at,see also forbearance order,fcc rcd at,id.at.
new markets rule.finally,the commission adopted a new markets rule,which denied intercarrier compensation for traffic in markets where the carrier was not exchanging traffic pursuant to an interconnection agreement prior to adoption of the order.isp remand order,fcc rcd at.in such a case,carriers shall exchange traffic on a basis during th e interim period.see forbearance order,fcc rcd at.
as the fcc explained,these four interim provisions were intended to eliminate arbitrage opportunities presented by the existing recovery mechanism for traffic by lowering payments and capping growth.isp remand order,fcc rcd at.the goal of the interim provisions was decreased reliance by carriers upon payments and an increased reliance upon recovery of costs from,consistent with the tentative conclusion in the nprm that bill and keep is the appropriate intercarrier compensation mechanism for traffic.id.at.
we reviewed the isp remand order in worldcom,fcc.there,we rejected the fcc conclusion that g authorized the commission to carve out calls from the requirements of b.see id.at.because that section is worded simply as a transitional device,we held,the fcc can not rely on g to exclude calls from the scope of b.id.nonetheless,in light of the possibility that there were other legal bases for adopting the rules chosen by the commission,we neither vacate d the order nor address ed petitioners attacks on various interim provisions devised by the commission.id.instead,we merely remanded the matter to the commission for further proceedings,which left the interim rules in effect pending those proceedings.see id.at see also forbearance order,fcc rcd at.
the telecommunications act of requires the fcc to forbear from applying any regulation or any provision of the act if it makes three determinations that we discuss in detail in part below.a.the act authorizes any telecommunications carrier to submit a petition to the fcc requesting such forbearance.see id.c.the commission must act upon the petition within one year,subject to its right to extend that deadline by an additional days.see id.
on july,petitioner core a petition asking the fcc to forbear from applying the four interim provisions of the isp remand order discussed above.after receiving the petition,the commission exercised its authority to extend the deadline by days.that extension moved the deadline to october.on october,the commission voted to adopt an order granting in part and denying in part core petition.in a press release issued on the day of the vote,the fcc announced the outcome of its decision and stated that a n order detailing the fcc analysis will be forthcoming.joint appendix on october,ten days after the vote and seven days after the statutory deadline,the commission released the text of its forbearance order addressing core forbearance petition.see fcc rcd,wl.the forbearance order stated that it shall be effective as of the october,adoption date.id.at,capitalization altered.
as the press release indicated it would,the fcc granted in part and denied in part core forbearance petition.the commission denied core petition with respect to the rate caps and mirroring rule,concluding that those provisions remained necessary to avoid regulatory arbitrage and market distortions.id.at.however,the fcc granted the request to forbear from enforcing the growth caps and new markets rule,concluding that they were no longer needed because m arket developments since have eased the concerns about growth of isp traffic that had prompted their adoption.id.at.
we now have before us two petitions for review of the fcc forbearance order.core contends that the fcc should not only have granted forbearance regarding the growth caps and new markets rule,but should also have granted forbearance regarding the rate caps and mirroring rule.a group of ilecs led by bellsouth takes the opposite position.it contends that the fcc should not have granted forbearance from enforcement of any of the provisions,and hence challenges the fcc decision to forbear from enforcing the growth caps and new markets rule.we consider core arguments in part ii and bellsouth arguments in part iii.
core raises two principal challenges to the fcc denial of its request to forbear from enforcing the rate caps and mirroring rule.first,core argues that the fcc issued its denial belatedly,and that under the statute the fcc tardiness must be regarded as granting the forbearance petition in its entirety.second,in the event that its first argument fails,core challenges the denial of forbearance with respect to the rate caps and mirroring rule as arbitrary and capricious 
the second sentence of c declares that a petition for forbearance shall be deemed granted if the commission does not deny the petition within one year of receiving it.c.the third sentence permits the commission to extend the period by an additional days.id.and the fourth sentence states that the commission may grant or deny a petition in whole or in part and shall explain its decision in writing.id.core asserts that the fcc missed the c deadline by not issuing a written order denying its petition until october,seven days after the extended statutory deadline of october.as a consequence,core insists,its petition for forbearance must be deemed granted in full.
the commission counters that the announcement of its october,vote satisfied the requirement that it deny the petition by the statutory deadline,and that therefore the petition may not be deemed granted.the deadline,the commission insists,applies only to the denial and not to the separate requirement of a written explanation the two sentences in section c impose separate and independent obligations on the commission.fcc br.in any event,the commission continues,an fcc regulation permits the commission to designate,as it did here,an effective date that is earlier in time than the date upon which an order is released.id.quoting a.
under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,this court would ordinarily accord deference to the commission interpretation of a statutory provision like c.core contends that no such deference is due here.this contention is based,in part,on the fact that the fcc interpretation of c is contained only in the litigation briefs of fcc counsel,and not in a commission order.see generally united states mead,d.
but there is good reason why the fcc did not address the meaning of the statute in an order core never raised the issue before the commission.that fact does not merely create a problem regarding the extent of deference we owe the fcc statutory interpretation it creates a problem regarding our authority to review the issue at all.under a,the filing of a petition for reconsideration is a condition precedent to judicial review of any fcc order where the party seeking such review relies on questions of fact or law upon which the commission has been afforded no opportunity to pass.a.this circuit has strictly construed that section,holding that we generally lack jurisdiction to review arguments that have not first been presented to the commission.bdpcs,fcc,see,american family ass n,fcc,new england pub.commc ns council,fcc,sioux valley rural television,fcc.
time warner entertainment fcc,cited by core,is not to the contrary.that case held that,where the formulation of the issue presented to us was not precisely as presented to the commission,we will nonetheless review it if a reasonable commission necessarily would have seen the question raised before us as part of the case presented to it.at emphasis in original see at t fcc.core problem,however,is not that it failed to present the issue to us precisely as it presented the issue to the commission.the problem is that it failed to present the issue to the commission in any form whatsoever.
of course,core,too,had good reason not to address,in its forbearance petition,whether a timely denial of that petition would require a written decision or only the announcement of the commission vote core could not have known,when it filed the petition,that the fcc would wait to issue its written denial until after the october deadline had passed.adhering to the language of a,however,we have held that,even when a petitioner has no reason to raise an argument until the fcc issues an order that makes the issue relevant,the petitioner must file a petition for reconsideration with the commission before it may seek judicial review.a see at t fcc.core did not file such a petition in this case.
none of the foregoing should be understood to place this court imprimatur on the fcc actions.waiting until the eleventh hour to vote on a forbearance petition,and then waiting until the thirteenth hour to issue the explanatory order,is hardly an ideal procedure for notifying a party of the disposition of a petition.and relying on an informal press release and a regulation to satisfy a statutory deadline could unnecessarily place commission policies at risk of judicial invalidation.nonetheless,because core did not give the commission an opportunity to address the question,we can not be the first authority to construe the meaning of c.
we review the commission order denying in part core petition for forbearance under the familiar arbitrary and capricious standard.see a cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc,at t fcc.under that standard,our scope of review is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.cellular,at.the agency must,however,examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.
section a requires the fcc to forbear from applying any regulation or provision of the act to a telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service if it determines that 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary to ensure that the charges,practices,classifications,or regulations by,for,or in connection with that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory 
enforcement of such regulation or provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers and 
forbearance from applying such provision or regulation is consistent with the public interest.
a emphasis added.these three prongs of the forbearance test are conjunctive,meaning that t he commission could properly deny a petition for forbearance if it finds that any one of the three prongs is unsatisfied.cellular,at.in this case,the commission found that none of the three prongs is satisfied with respect to the rate caps and mirroring rule.forbearance order,fcc rcd at.we now proceed to examine the reasonableness of the fcc determination.
core does not contend that there has been any change in circumstances since the isp remand order rendering enforcement of the rate caps no longer necessary to ensure that the charges and practices of clecs serving isps are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.a.instead,core challenges the isp remand order itself,contending that its imposition of rate caps on traffic was unreasonably discriminatory.it argues that,while the cost of terminating traffic is the same as any other type of traffic,the fcc has permitted substantially higher termination rates for other types of traffic,notably long distance traffic.core br.this means,core explains,that certain carriers earn more revenue for terminating certain types of traffic while other carriers earn less,even though all traffic cost s the same.id.
in rejecting this argument,the fcc reasonably concluded that the potential for discrimination against clecs is limited because,as a consequence of the mirroring rule,the caps apply to traffic only if an incumbent lec offers to exchange all section b traffic at the same rate.forbearance order,fcc rcd at.that is,the mirroring rule prevent s disparate treatment of the two types of traffic.id.moreover,the different characteristics of the two kinds of the fact that traffic to isps flows one way,as does money in a reciprocal compensation regime,isp remand order at,describing any residual difference in treatment as unreasonably discriminatory.and the fcc further explained that the rate caps are necessary to prevent discrimination between internet access customers and basic telephone service customers.the rate caps,the fcc stated,were implemented to prevent the subsidization of internet access customers at the expense of consumers of basic telephone service.id.at.
core makes largely the same argument with respect to the second prong of a.enforcement of the rate caps is not necessary for the protection of consumers,a,core argues,because the cost of terminating internet traffic and voice traffic is the same.thus,it contends,the only way to treat consumers on a nondiscriminatory basis is by enabling all carriers to recover the same termination costs with the same termination rate,such that no consumer has to bear a disproportionate share of network costs.core br.
but this argument does not render unreasonable the fcc view that the rate caps are necessary to prevent the subsidization of internet access consumers by consumers of basic telephone service.see forbearance order,fcc rcd at.the fcc does not contend that subsidization arises because the costs of and voice traffic are different,but rather because the large flows of cash in a reciprocal compensation regime ma k e it possible for lecs serving isps to afford to pay the isps to use their services,potentially driving isp rates to consumers to uneconomical levels.isp remand order,fcc rcd at,see id.at.moreover,because the originating lec typically charges its customers averaged rates,the costs associated with the intercarrier payments are recovered through rates averaged across all of the originating carrier,including particularly consumers of regular voice telephone service.id.at.the fcc concluded that t here is no public policy rationale to support a subsidy running from all users of basic telephone service to those end users who employ internet access,id.at,and that the caps were thus necessary to protect consumers of basic telephone service,see forbearance order,fcc rcd at.core argument does not undercut the reasonableness of this conclusion.
with minor differences,core reprises the same argument with respect to the third prong of a,the requirement that forbearance from applying the rate caps must be consistent with the public interest.a.the caps are inconsistent with that interest,core insists,because they unreasonably discriminat e against isps,and because they deter investment in competitive networks by capping the ability of clecs to recover costs at a level materially below the ilecs rate for providing the same termination function.core br.core derides the fcc determination that the caps are necessary to prevent regulatory arbitrage and distorted economic incentives as nothing more than imprecise,fcc.id.at.
with respect to core contention that the rate caps deter investment in competitive telecommunications networks,the fcc found that core provide d no evidence to support the claim.forbearance order,fcc rcd at.indeed,examination of core petition for forbearance reveals that the fcc is correct core offered no evidence on that issue nor on its broader contention that the isp remand order has forced clecs from the market.core petition for forbearance.core,moreover,cites no such evidence on this appeal.
the derision that core levels at the fcc terminology is similarly unwarranted.the fcc economic analysis is neither imprecise nor undefined.we have quoted it at length in part to make that clear.in a nutshell,the fcc determined in the isp remand order that,because traffic flows overwhelmingly in one direction,a reciprocal compensation regime creates an opportunity for clecs to sign up isps as customers and collect compensation from,rather than pay compensation to,other carriers.isp remand order,fcc rcd at.in the fcc view,this led to classic regulatory arbitrage that had two negative effects it created incentives for inefficient entry of lecs intent on serving isps exclusively and not offering viable local telephone competition,as congress had intended to facilitate with the act the large flows of cash made it possible for lecs serving isps to afford to pay their own customers to use their services,potentially driving isp rates to consumers to uneconomical levels.id.at.
the question before us is not whether the fcc economic conclusions are correct or are the ones that we would reach on our own,but only whether they are reasonable.see teledesic llc fcc.as we have previously stated,we will not an agency economic analysis,but will uphold regulations based on such an analysis if the agency has established in the record a reasonable basis for its decision.national wildlife fed epa,internal quotation marks omitted.core offers no ground for concluding that the fcc analysis is unreasonable.
although core petition for review challenged the fcc denial of forbearance as to both the rate caps and the mirroring rule,core clarified at oral argument that,if it lost its challenge to the former,it would withdraw its challenge to the latter.see oral arg.tr.at.that is a logical strategy,since the mirroring rule does no harm to core and may do it some good if the rate caps remain in place,the mirroring rule imposes equivalent caps on the rates that an ilec may charge core.having ruled against core challenge to the rate caps,we therefore do not address its challenge to the mirroring rule.
taking the opposite tack from core,the ilecs contend that the fcc acted impermissibly in granting core forbearance petition regarding the growth caps and new markets rule.the fcc found that all three prongs of the forbearance standard were met with respect to those provisions.forbearance order,fcc rcd at.once again,we review the fcc decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard.see cellular,at.
as discussed in part,the growth caps placed a limit on the total minutes for which a clec could receive intercarrier compensation,equal to the total traffic for which the clec was previously entitled to compensation,plus a growth factor for each of the first two years of the transition.in the isp remand order,the fcc explained that it adopted the measure to ensure that growth in internet access did not undermine fcc efforts to limit intercarrier compensation for this traffic and to begin,subject to the conclusion of the nprm proceedings,a smooth transition toward a bill and keep regime.isp remand order,fcc rcd at.a ten percent growth cap,for the first two years,the fcc stated,seem ed reasonable in light of clec projections that the growth of internet minutes will fall in the range of seven to ten percent per year.id.
the fcc new markets rule precluded intercarrier compensation for traffic where the carrier was not exchanging traffic pursuant to an interconnection agreement prior to adoption of the isp remand order.id.at.it applied,for example,when a new carrier enter ed a market or an existing carrier expand ed into a market it previously had not served.forbearance order,fcc rcd at.and its purpose,similar to that of the growth caps,was to prevent expansion of the old compensation regime during the transitional period.isp remand order,fcc rcd at.
the basis for the fcc decision to grant forbearance from application of the growth caps and new markets rule was the commission determination that m arket developments since have eased the concerns about growth of isp traffic that led the commission to adopt these rules.forbearance order,fcc rcd at,see id.at.recent industry statistics indicate declining usage of isp services,the commission noted.id.at.in particular,the fcc cited an industry report indicating that the number of end users using conventional to connect to isps is declining as the number of end users using broadband services to access isps grows.id.the report showed a decline in the number of subscribers and forecasted a decline in the percentage of subscribers using from in to in.see bernstein research call,dsl economics i at.the commission also cited fcc records showing a increase in access lines between and.see fcc releases data on services for internet access at tbl.june.with reduced concerns regarding continued expansion of the arbitrage opportunity presented by traffic,forbearance order,fcc rcd at,the commission concluded that these concerns are now outweighed by the public interest in creating a uniform compensation regime,id.at,and that the public interest prong of a was therefore satisfied,see id.at.
the same considerations led the commission to conclude that the growth caps and new markets rule are no longer necessary to ensure that charges and practices are just and reasonable,and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.id.at,citing a.as the fcc explained,b oth the growth caps and new markets rule require carriers to exchange traffic on a basis where the provisions apply,while exchanging traffic under the reciprocal compensation regime subject to the rate caps where they do not.id.at.since the record failed to demonstrate different costs in delivering traffic that would justify disparate treatment,similar rates should apply to both local voice traffic and traffic,absent compelling policy reasons to the contrary.id.at.and because the fcc found that the policy ratio
