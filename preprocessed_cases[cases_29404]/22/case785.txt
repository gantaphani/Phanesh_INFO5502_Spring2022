panduit corporation panduit appeals from a final order dismissing its claims with prejudice after the district court granted hellermanntyton corporation hellermanntyton motion for summary judgment that hellermanntyton did not breach provisions of the settlement agreement that ended a prior infringement suit involving patent the patent.see panduit hellermanntyton,c,final order panduit hellermanntyton,c,wl,summary judgment.because no genuine issue of material fact exists and hellermanntyton is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,we affirm.
background 
the patent involves a modular offset power box and communication extension for a power and communication wiring and raceway system.wiring raceway systems are commonly used when installing power and communications conductors within the same duct running throughout the walls of an office building.raceway systems help provide work spaces with power outlets and phone lines to run equipment like computers,fax machines,phones,and printers.the present invention facilitates adjustment within the raceway system to add or remove outlets or wiring at a given work space as desired.in prior art raceway systems,adjustments to accommodate changes in business needs or technology were difficult and time consuming.
one advantage of the raceway system disclosed in the patent is to allow power conductors disposed in the raceway to be quickly and easily routed into a power box while keeping the power conductors isolated from the communication channel.this system of routing avoids interference and helps speed installation.a view of this system is shown in figure of the patent,reproduced below.
the system is recited in claim,which is representative of the claims on appeal.at issue are the structural limitations of the offset power box,which are highlighted below.
a modular raceway outlet station for use with a trunking duct which has a divider wall and a top access opening comprising 
an offset power box having,
a projection extending laterally from a top wall of the offset power box having a top portion and an abutment portion depending from a furthest extent of the top portion adapted to be disposed substantially aligned with an adjacent edge of the top access opening and 
an opening formed in the abutment portion of the projection is in communication with an aperture formed in a side wall of the offset power box adjacent the duct and 
a communication extension adapted to be disposed over the duct top access opening having,
an abutment surface depending from a top surface of the extension adapted to be disposed flush against the abutment portion of the projection 
a routing notch formed in the abutment surface and 
a guide wall depending from the extension interiorly adjacent the routing notch,adapted to be substantially vertically aligned with a divider wall,
wherein power conductors may be routed out of and over the duct,through the routing notch,and opening,and into the offset power box before installation of the extension,such that the power conductors are isolated from communication conductors when the extension is installed.
patent,ll.emphasis added.
the preferred embodiment depicts the offset power box with a top wall,a pair of sidewalls,a pair of end walls,a pair of interior end walls,an interior sidewall opposite the duct and a bottom wall.the interior of the box accommodates the installation of a power outlet.projection laterally extends from the box toward the trunking duct.the abutment portion vertically depends from the furthest lateral extent of the top portion such that it is substantially vertically aligned with the adjacent edge of the duct top access opening.the opening in the side wall,or aperture as the claim recites,abuts the trunking duct when the box is in place and,along with the opening in the abutment portion,allows the electrical wires to pass out of the box and into the duct,as seen in figure of the patent,reproduced below.
in,panduit filed suit against hellermanntyton alleging infringement of the patent in view of a power box that hellermanntyton was then selling labeled part no,depicted in the drawing figure below and referred to as the previous design.shortly thereafter,the parties entered into a settlement agreement agreement to end the litigation,whereby hellermanntyton agreed not to make or sell subject products.the agreement defined subject products in b i as the hellermanntyton raceway side electric box hellermanntyton part no.and in b ii as all products,existing now or in the future,covered by any claim of the panduit patent.in exchange,panduit waived its claims against hellermanntyton for infringement of the patent prior to the date of the agreement.
in,panduit filed suit against hellermanntyton for breach of b i and b ii of the agreement and for infringement of the patent based on hellermanntyton sale of the product depicted in the drawing below and designated as the revised design.the only difference between the previous design and the revised design is that the wall abutting the trunking duct in the revised design is solid with no cutaway.
in february,the district court stayed litigation of the infringement claim pending the outcome of a reexamination proceeding at the united states patent and trademark office.however,the district court allowed the breach of contract claim to proceed.on august,the district court construed several limitations of claim,including the phrases a projection extending laterally from a top wall of the offset power box the projection limitation a projection having an abutment portion depending from a furthest extent of the top portion adapted to be disposed substantially aligned with an adjacent edge of the top access opening the abutment portion limitation an opening formed in the abutment portion of the projection the opening limitation and an aperture formed in a side wall of the offset power box the aperture formed in a side wall limitation.
on february,the district court issued an order granting hellermanntyton motion for summary judgment on the contract claim.first,the district court ruled as a matter of law that the accused device was not the same as the previous design and thus was not covered by b i of the agreement,dismissing panduit argument that the accused device was the same in all material respects as the device.second,the district court ruled as a matter of law that the accused device did not infringe the patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents and thus did not breach b ii of the agreement.the district court found that the accused device was missing the projection,abutment portion,and opening limitations.although briefed to the district court by both parties,the court did not address the issue of whether the aperture formed in a side wall limitation read on the accused device.the district court then entered a final order disposing of all remaining claims.panduit timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under a.
on appeal,panduit challenges the district court grant of summary judgment that hellermanntyton did not breach either b i or b ii of the agreement.
