mkc owns the and patents.the patent,entitled ergonomic keyboard input device,claims an ergonomic keyboard designed to accommodate the architecture of the human hand.according to the invention,the keyboard requires only slight finger gestures to actuate the keys.patent abstract.the patent,entitled ergonomic keyboard for device,issued as a of the patent.this patent claims a device that frees the thumb to actuate the keys in multiple and differentiated ways.patent abstract.
thomas gambaro is the sole inventor of both the and the patents.gambaro invented the novel ergonomic keyboard technology on a basis while also working in other jobs such as graphic artist and dishwasher.in fact,gambaro developed some of the ergonomic keyboard technology while he lived in a friend attic.as an independent inventor,gambaro developed his technology advances without the benefit of a laboratory and then traversed the patent system on a limited budget.

the district court determination of no infringement of the patent rested on claim construction.claim of the patent is the only independent claim and all the asserted claims contain the limitations of claim.claim of the patent shows the pertinent limitation in the context of the entire claim 
a device for entering information into an electronic system via a keyboard,the device comprising 
a housing having a grippable portion which permits the device to be held in one hand with the thumb free to move at least temporarily to a predetermined position while the device is held,
a concavity in said housing at said position,and 
a cluster of keys forming a keyboard within said concavity,each of the plurality of keys in said cluster being selectively actuable via mixed lateral and slight endo,translation of a thumb within said concavity,whereby information is entered into an electronic system.
patent emphases added.the district court construed a concavity in said housing at said position,and a cluster of keys forming a keyboard within said concavity to mean that the concavity must be formed by a depression in the housing of the device,and that all keys comprising the keyboard must be contained entirely within the concave area and sunk below the surface of the housing,so that the thumb movement occurs within the concave area.motionless keyboard,wl,at.
on appeal,mkc argues that a concavity in said housing at said position,and a cluster of keys forming a keyboard within said concavity means that the tops of the keys themselves can form the concavity.thus,under mkc proposed construction of the claims,the keys or portions thereof themselves can form a concavity within the housing.mkc wants a broad construction of the concavity.appellees,to the contrary,agree with the district court narrower construction.
the claim language a concavity in said housing at said position,and a cluster of keys forming a keyboard within said concavity defines well the limitation.patent emphases added.by using the terms concavity in said housing and keyboard within said concavity,the patentee defined a depression within the housing of the device and set the keyboard entirely within that depression.the district court correctly grasped and conveyed this meaning.
the specification underscores the correctness of the trial court construction a keyboard is positioned in a concavity or depression in the housing.patent emphasis added.to confirm this reading,all keyboard renderings in figures,and in the patent show a concavity in the housing of the device with the keyboard totally within the concavity.patent,and.figure,for instance,shows the concavity 
patent.thus,this court agrees with the district court claim construction of this limitation.
with respect to the infringement analysis,the accused microsoft sidewinder joysticks,the saitek joysticks,and the nokia cellular phones do not literally infringe the patent because the joysticks and cellular phones lack a concavity in the housing and a keyboard within
