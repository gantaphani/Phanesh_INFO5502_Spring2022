ronald ellyson was convicted of possessing child pornography in violation of a b,b west.ellyson argues that law enforcement officers obtained the illicit pornographic material at issue through a constitutionally defective search of his residence.ellyson also contends that the district court jury instructions failed to comply with ashcroft free speech coalition,d,thereby permitting the jury to convict him on unconstitutional grounds.because the court instructions were erroneous under free speech coalition,we must set aside the verdict and remand the matter for further proceedings.
on september,officers from the boiling springs lake police department in north carolina received information that two larceny suspects were guests at a trailer owned by ellyson.officers knocked and then entered the trailer in hopes of arresting nathan rudolphsky,one of the suspects.according to chief white,he asked ellyson if the police could search the trailer for rudolphsky and ellyson agreed.police found rudolphsky asleep in a back bedroom with angela burr,a woman who was living in ellyson trailer at the time.
during the time that officers were in the trailer,they observed a marijuana bong in plain view in the living room.when asked if the trailer contained any drugs or more drug paraphernalia,ellyson responded that it did not.according to the officers,ellyson did not object to a search of the trailer for additional illegal drugs or items associated with such drugs.during a search of ellyson bedroom,officers located a binder notebook containing images of children engaged in sexual activity.ellyson was arrested for possessing child pornography.at the request of police,ellyson then directed officers to a closet where he kept a second notebook containing similar images.officers also seized ellyson computer,as well as various videotapes,magazines,photographs,letters,and newspaper clippings belonging to ellyson.
after ellyson arrest,angela burr continued to live in the trailer.for nearly two weeks after the september search,burr remained in contact with officers from the boiling springs lake police department.burr testified that various officers told her that if law enforcement officers searched the trailer again and there was anything illegal found in the house she would possibly be charged with aiding and ab etting,and if she came across anything illegal that it would be in her best interest to turn it in or else she could be liable for it.
on september,burr visited ellyson in jail.according to burr,the purpose for her visit was to ask permission to continue living in the trailer while ellyson was incarcerated.during their conversation,ellyson inquired whether police officers had returned to conduct another search.when burr responded that they had not done so,ellyson told her that he had some computer diskettes that he wanted burr to dispose of as soon as she returned to the trailer.burr testified that she visited ellyson of her own accord and that she was never asked to meet ellyson or elicit any information from him on behalf of the police.the following day,burr located a box containing several diskettes,letters,and more photographs she also found a few computer diskettes in a night stand.on september,in light of what she had been told about any such material remaining in the trailer,burr contacted police and turned over the materials.
ellyson successfully moved to suppress the items obtained by police in their initial search on september.after an extensive evidentiary hearing,the district court granted ellyson motion as to the evidence obtained during the initial search.the court concluded that the officers opening of the door of ellyson trailer constituted a warrantless,nonconsensual entry into the residence in violation of ellyson fourth amendment rights that e xigent circumstances did not justify the illegal entry into the home and that ellyson consent to search subsequent to the illegal entry did not purge the taint of the original illegality.
ellyson also moved to suppress the evidence that burr subsequently located and then turned over to authorities on september.there was evidence in the record before the district court that cast doubt on whether burr was acting independently when she learned of and recovered the evidence that she eventually gave to police officers and that ultimately led to ellyson conviction.the district court,however,rejected ellyson argument that burr was acting as an agent of the government and thus conducted an impermissible search when she located the computer disks and other items that she relinquished to the police.the court made a factual finding that the police did not participate directly in obtaining the september evidence,and that burr decision to turn over the items she found was motivated primarily by her desire to protect herself.thus,the court concluded that ellyson failed to carry his burden of showing that burr was acting as an agent of the government.
the case went to trial based on the evidence burr gave police on september.this evidence included multiple images of an actual,identifiable minor engaged in explicit sexual conduct however,there were many other images introduced for which there was no testimony that the minors depicted were actual children.the district court instructed the jury that the government was required to prove that ellyson knowingly possessed at least one visual depiction of an image he knew to be child pornography.in accordance with the child pornography prevention act of cppa,see west,the district court instructed the jury that child pornography was defined as any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or image of sexually explicit conduct,where the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct or such visual depiction is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.emphasis added.the court further instructed the jury that the government was required to prove that the images possessed by ellyson either had been mailed or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including computer.the jury returned a guilty verdict.at sentencing,the district court imposed a term of imprisonment,departing upward on the basis that ellyson criminal history category did not adequately reflect the likelihood that ellyson would continue to commit crimes involving sexually deviant conduct with minors.
ellyson filed this appeal,arguing that the district court erroneously concluded that law enforcement agents were not acting through burr to conduct a search for additional evidence of child pornography and that the items turned over to police on september should have been suppressed.initially,ellyson contended that the government failed to establish an interstate commerce nexus to his possession of the images involving actual minors.ellyson claimed that his possession of the remaining images,which did not definitively involve the use of actual children,could not be constitutionally prohibited.although ellyson acknowledged that his argument was contrary to circuit precedent at the time he filed his appeal,see united states mento,cir,vacated,d,he urged us to follow the view of the ninth circuit in free speech coalition reno,cir,which the supreme court affirmed,that the definition of child pornography under b was unconstitutional to the extent that it proscribed possession of an image that appears to be of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.b.because the supreme court had already granted certiorari to address this issue,we held this appeal in abeyance pending the court decision in ashcroft free speech coalition,d.
first,we consider ellyson argument that the district court was in error when it concluded that no agency relationship existed between burr and the government for fourth amendment purposes and denied his motion to suppress the evidence given to police by burr.we review the factual findings underlying the district court denial of a pretrial motion to suppress for clear error,and the court legal determinations de novo.see ornelas united states,d united states seidman,cir.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see seidman,at.
because the protection afforded by the fourth amendment is aimed exclusively at state action evidence secured by private searches,even if illegal,need not be excluded from a criminal trial.united states kinney,cir.the fourth amendment applies to a search conducted by a private citizen only if that individual is acting as an agent of the government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official.united states jacobsen,d internal quotation marks omitted see coolidge new hampshire,d explaining that a private search may be converted into state action only if the private actor is regarded as having acted as an instrument or agent of the state.the burden of proving that a private party acted as an agent or instrument of the government is on the defendant.see united states shahid,cir.whether an agency relationship exists is a inquiry that is guided by common law agency principles.see united states koenig,cir.one highly pertinent consideration is whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct and whether the private party purpose for conducting the search was to assist law enforcement efforts or to further her own ends.united states feffer,cir see kinney,at affirming the district court conclusion that no agency relationship existed where the private individual acted on her own initiative,without suggestion from the police officers.
the district court made several critical factual findings on this issue.the court found that burr visited ellyson in jail on september because she wanted to discuss with ellyson whether she could continue to reside in his trailer,that ellyson requested burr to locate and dispose of some computer disks that remained in the trailer,and that burr made no effort to look for evidence in the trailer until after her meeting with ellyson.the district court further found that burr actions were not motivated by a desire to aid the police in building their case but by a desire to preclude law enforcement from holding her responsible for any items subsequently discovered in the trailer.thus,the district court found that burr had a legitimate independent motivation for performing the search.the court also found,based on the testimony of burr and various officers,that the police never asked burr to visit ellyson in jail,that they were not aware that ellyson had requested burr to dispose of the disks,and that they did not prompt burr to search further after she had turned over the evidence on september.based on these findings of burr had a legitimate independent motivation for performing the search and the police had not participated or acquiesced in the district court concluded that burr had not been acting as an agent or instrument of the state.
ellyson concedes that the district court findings of fact are not clearly erroneous,and,having reviewed the record,we perceive no clear error in any event.ellyson argues simply that the district court drew the wrong legal conclusion from its findings.ellyson suggests that the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that burr was an instrument of the police,and he points out that the district court even acknowledged that the record contained several pieces of evidence supporting his agency theory.however,once it has been established that the court did not clearly err in its findings that the police neither directed nor acquiesced in burr activities,our inquiry is at an end even though the evidence might have allowed a different conclusion.see feffer,at agency relationship turns on the government knowledge and the private actor motivation.for ellyson to argue that the record contains substantial conflicting evidence that would have supported the finding that burr was not acting independently is simply another way of suggesting the district court reached the wrong factual conclusion.as ellyson himself observed,the district court acknowledged that there was conflicting evidence but simply decided to credit the testimony of burr and the police officers on this issue.accordingly,we reject this argument and affirm the denial of ellyson motion to suppress this evidence.
next,ellyson contends that,in light of free speech coalition,the district court jury instructions permitted the jury to convict him on constitutionally infirm grounds,requiring the verdict to be set aside.ellyson was convicted of knowingly possessing computer disks that contained image s of child pornography.a b.before congress passed the cppa,the definition of child pornography applied to visual depictions of actual minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.a see free speech coalition.at.the cppa expanded the definition of child pornography to include a visual depiction that is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,b,or a visual depiction that is advertised,promoted,presented,described,or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,d.accordingly,the expanded definition of child pornography encompassed images that did not involve actual minors in the production,including virtual child pornography images that were completely.free speech coalition.at 
in concluding that the cppa prohibition against the possession of virtual child pornography was overly broad under the first amendment,the court focused on two decisions.in miller california,d,the court instructed that the first amendment prohibits government regulation of sexually oriented material unless it is obscene,which the court defined as material that,taken as a whole,appeal s to the prurient interest in sex,portray s sexual conduct in a patently offensive way,and do es not have serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value.the cppa ban on virtual child pornography,however,extends to images that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity without regard to the miller requirements.free speech coalition.at.although new york ferber,d,allows the prohibition of child pornography that is not necessarily obscene under miller,the court explained that ferber holding was based on the production of the work,not its content.free speech coalition.at.ferber permits a state to ban the sale or distribution of child pornography that is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in that such material is a permanent record of a child abuse,and the continued circulation itself would harm the child.id.the court in free speech coalition concluded that i n contrast to the speech in ferber,speech that itself is the record of sexual abuse,the cppa ban of material that appears to be child pornography prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production.id.at.because b covers materials beyond the categories recognized in ferber and miller,the court held that the provision is overbroad under the first amendment.id.at 
the district court in this case instructed the jury that it could find ellyson guilty of violating if it concluded that he had possessed material containing a visual depiction that appears to be of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.the instruction simply tracked the language of b and therefore amounted to an erroneous instruction to the extent that it permitted the guilty verdict to rest on the unconstitutional appears to be language in the statute.see united states richardson,cir finding jury instructions plainly erroneous because the district court included appears to be language in the definition of child pornography so that the government did not have to prove that the images were of actual children,as opposed to virtual children,cert.denied,d.of course,the district court did not have the benefit of free speech coalition at the time it issued its instructions to the jury.indeed,at the time of trial,the court instructions were consistent with circuit precedent rejecting a constitutional challenge to the appears to be language of the cppa.see mento,at.
we next consider the appropriate standard of review.we conclude our review is for harmless error.despite mento,it appears that defense counsel had the prescience to preserve an objection to a guilty verdict based on a visual depiction that did not make use of an actual child.during the charge conference,defense counsel asked the court to remove language that included the phrase appeared to be because the government was required to prove that ellyson was required to know that they are minors.although this particular objection may have been inexact,we think it sufficiently reflects the legal theory underlying ellyson earlier rule motion for acquittal.in arguing for a judgment of acquittal,ellyson contended that the prosecution did not prove by any credible evidence that there were victims under the age of.when the government responded that it was only required to prove the images involved someone who looks like a minor,ellyson clarified that he was not talking about age but actual people.ellyson contended that,according to the government own witnesses,images can be entirely generated without the use of individuals in any way,shape or form,and that there is no evidence that a large number of the images are not entirely made up and do not fall within the statute,because it has to be an actual minor.in view of the record as a whole,we conclude that ellyson attorney preserved the record on this issue.accordingly,our review is for harmless error rather than plain error.see.a.
under yates united states,d,a verdict must be set aside in cases where it is legally supportable on one ground,but not on another,and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.see griffin united states,d.r eversal is required when a case is submitted to a jury on two or more alternate theories,one of which is legally as opposed to factually inadequate,the jury returns a general verdict,and it is impossible to discern the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict.united states hastings,cir.the district court instructions permitted the jury to convict ellyson on essentially alternate ellyson possessed images involving the use of an actual minor engaged in explicit sexual conduct or that ellyson possessed images involving what appears to be a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.therefore,the jury was presented with one alternative that was constitutionally viable and one that was not.because the jury rendered a general guilty verdict that did not specify the basis for the conviction,the question becomes whether it is possible for us to determine such basis.
it is undisputed that several of the images involved the use of an actual,identifiable minor named mike from the raleigh,north carolina area.the jury conviction of ellyson for his possession of these particular images would not offend the first amendment under free speech coalition.there are other images contained on ellyson diskettes,however,with respect to which the government failed,at least on the record before us,to establish the use of an actual child victim.agent michael darnell,who had experience in the investigation of cases involving internet child pornography and was specially trained to extract such images from a defendant computer,testified that it is possible to completely construct an image of a young boy not having utilized a young boy in the construction of that image.agent darnell indicated that diskette number,for example,contained images of child pornography,but that he did not know whether these particular images involved the use of actual children or whether the images were virtual creations.had the jury found ellyson guilty based on these images because they appeared to be a depiction of child pornography,the verdict could not stand under free speech coalition.in sum,the evidence in the record,coupled with the court instructions,permitted the jury to convict ellyson on both a constitutional and unconstitutional basis.because there is no way for us to determine the jury basis for its verdict,we must set the verdict aside.richardson,at finding jury instructions plainly erroneous but concluding that the error did not affect the fairness,integrity of public reputation of the judicial process where the evidence clearly established that the children depicted in the images or pictures were actual children.
this conclusion does not end the matter because we must determine whether the government may retry ellison or whether he is entitled to an outright reversal and judgment of acquittal.ellyson contends that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because only images involving the use of an actual child are sufficient to support a conviction,and that the government failed to introduce evidence establishing an interstate nexus with those relatively few images introduced that depicted an actual child.ellyson concedes that the images of mike approximately of images of an actual child however,he contends that the government failed to meet its burden of establishing that the images of mike were mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or that was produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer.a b.
when an appellate court vacates a conviction based on an error in the trial proceedings,the government is generally free to retry the defendant.see lockhart nelson,d.supreme court jurisprudence on this subject teaches that the double jeopardy clause general prohibition against successive prosecutions does not prevent the government from retrying a defendant who succeeds in getting his first conviction set aside because of some error in the proceedings leading to conviction.id.at.however,there is an exception to this rule when a defendant conviction is reversed by an appellate court on the sole ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury verdict.id.at.see burks united states,d.a reversal based on the legal insufficiency of evidence is,in effect,a determination that the government case was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal rather than submitting the case to the jury.united states akpi,cir.the double jeopardy clause does not permit the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.burks,at.see gilliam foster,cir en banc niemeyer,dissenting the court has stated that the protection against affording the prosecution a second opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to present initially falls within the heart of double jeopardy protection.by contrast,a conviction set aside based on trial error does not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case and it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.burks,at.
although ellyson claim focuses on what he believes is insufficient evidence of an interstate nexus to the images of mike,the basis for setting aside ellyson conviction is not an insufficiency of evidence rather,we must set aside the verdict because of the erroneous jury instruction.under circuit law at the time of trial,the government presented more than sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict against ellyson.prior to free speech coalition,the government could satisfy its burden by showing that ellyson child pornography appear ed to be of a minor under b,and it was unnecessary for the government to offer evidence that a minor depicted in a given image was an actual child and not a image.see mento,at.
the record contains substantial evidence that the images possessed by ellyson apart from the ones involving mike,at the very least,appeared to be of minors involved in sexually explicit conduct,see b,and that such images had moved in interstate commerce,see a b.as established through the testimony of several witnesses,ellyson diskettes contained numerous images depicting minor boys,teenage and younger,engaged in sexual activity.these images were originally stored on the diskettes by james manchester,an inmate ellyson befriended while ellyson was serving time for violating the terms of his supervised release imposed in connection with a
