we realize that the demands made on busy trial judges approach,if they do not already exceed,the unrealistic.this is particularly true in counties such as orange county where all civil cases are immediately assigned to direct calendar courts.judges with heavy case loads are expected to preside over trials,hear law and motion,rule on ex parte applications,conduct settlement and status conferences,and perform additional administrative duties.all this under the requirements of the trial court delay reduction act,et and the standards of judicial administration cal.stds.jud,which include a directive that percent of all civil cases be disposed of within months after filing cal.stds.jud,b.
it is thus no surprise that,in their need for efficiency,trial judges have adopted procedures to streamline litigation.most of these procedures have beneficial effects,causing disputes to be resolved more quickly and more efficiently without sacrificing the ultimate goal of the judicial process the delivery of just results.but,in adopting these new,efficient procedures,judges must remember another,equally important goal preserving a process that not only is just,but also appears to be just.in spite of the need for efficiency,courts should not lose sight of the need that parties be given their day in court.
the concept of parties being given their day in court has real as well as symbolic meanings.it is much preferred that parties,or more likely their lawyers,be given an opportunity to address the court in person so as to assure themselves that the facts and ideas sought to be communicated have,in fact,been communicated.in this case the parties were not given such an assurance the ruling on their demurrer was delivered to them very cryptically on the internet the day before they expected to appear in court.the internet is a useful tool and serves many purposes but it is no substitute for judge and lawyer being able to interact in person.
medix ambulance service medix,michael dimas,joanna dimas,and eric saline filed their petition for writ of mandate after the superior court overruled their demurrer to the complaint filed by loretta collado without hearing oral argument.we issued an order to show cause,invited further briefing,and heard oral argument.we now grant the petition because the trial court erred in overruling the demurrer.we publish our opinion primarily in an attempt to delineate circumstances which require the court to hear oral argument.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff complaint includes four causes of action,all related to charges of sexual harassment at her place of employment sexual harassment in violation of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et sexual harassment in violation of public policy unlawful retaliation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
all four causes of action name medix,plaintiff employer,as well as the dimases and saline.plaintiff alleges that saline and the dimases were her supervisors.she also asserts that the dimases are shareholders of medix which,she alleges,is their alter ego.the complaint alleges plaintiff filed administrative charges under feha against medix and other defendants,but fails to allege plaintiff filed such charges against the dimases.petitioners demurred,raising a number of issues.we limit our review to the contention plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
in support of their demurrer,petitioners asked the court to take judicial notice of the complaint plaintiff filed with the department of fair employment and housing the department and attached a copy of the document.the administrative complaint named medix ambulance service as the party alleged to have harassed plaintiff.plaintiff identified petitioner saline in the body of the complaint as one of the persons whom plaintiff alleges engaged in the harassment.plaintiff neither named the dimases in the part of the complaint form asking for the identity of the employer,person,who discriminated against me,nor did she mention them in the body of the complaint form.
in opposition to the demurrer,plaintiff gave short shrift to her failure to file an administrative claim against the dimases.without citing relevant authority,she argued that the complaint alter ego allegations cured the defect and,citing rojo kliger cal d,of which more anon,argued that she was entitled to assert nonstatutory claims without having to first file a feha claim.
petitioners noticed the demurrer to be heard on april.on april,the court posted a notice on the internet.under the heading law and motion rulings and tentative rulings,judge michael brenner,appeared the entry to the extent relevant here demurrer overruled plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the alter ego allegations against defendants dimas.later that day,when petitioners lawyer telephoned judge brenner courtroom clerk inquiring about oral argument,the clerk told her there would be no hearing,the ruling was final.
discussion 
the court erred in refusing to hear oral argument 
where a statute provides for a hearing,it does not necessarily demand the parties be given an opportunity to orally argue the case.as our supreme court recently noted,the terms hear and hearing when used in a legal sense do not necessarily encompass oral presentations.lewis superior court cal th,d.a statute referring to a hearing does not require an opportunity for an oral presentation,unless the context or other language indicates a contrary intent.id.at,d.in gwartz superior court th,d and in mediterranean construction state farm fire casualty th,d,this court concluded that the context of the statute governing summary judgment motions required an oral hearing.parties are also entitled to oral argument in critical pretrial matters where there is a real and genuine dispute.titmas superior court th,d whether the privilege applied see also tjx companies,superior court th,d whether suit should proceed as a class action.we analyze the procedures employed here under those criteria.
first the statutory context.we found six statutes bearing on the meaning of hearings in connection with demurrers.code of civil procedure section provides that the hearing on motions or demurrers shall be postponed where a party or attorney is a member of the legislature.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure,unless otherwise indicated.section requires the court to postpone the hearing on a demurrer if all attorneys of record stipulate to such a continuance.section,subdivision a requires the judicial council to adopt a standard of judicial administration governing the appearance of counsel by telephone at any hearing of a demurrer,an order to show cause,or a motion all of these references contemplate the physical presence of the lawyers in the courtroom unless arrangements have been made for telephonic appearances.
section provides that a ny pleading may be amended once before the trial of the issue of law thereon.italics added.the use of the word trial would seem to involve something more than a message on the internet.section,subdivision a provides that uncontested demurrers may be decided in chambers.the implication is that contested demurrers are to be decided in open court.furthermore,section,subdivision c provides that the court may grant leave to amend when sustaining a demurrer.from a practical standpoint,counsel generally would only make a request for such leave after the court sustains the demurrer.parties opposing a demurrer would rarely weaken their opposition by demonstrating how the pleading may be amended.it has been our experience that such a request is normally made at a hearing in open court and after the court indicates it will sustain the demurrer.
when we apply the next criterion,critical pretrial matters involving a real and genuine dispute,the balance clearly favors a hearing in open court.we doubt we have to persuade either the court or the litigants herein of the critical nature of the demurrer stage of the proceeding.if,as we will conclude in our discussion below,the demurrer should have been sustained,its being overruled results in defendants having to engage and participate
