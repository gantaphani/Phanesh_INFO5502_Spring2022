background 
seized computer in texas 
in,law enforcement officials from the police department in corpus christi,texas seized a computer from a resident of corpus christi suspected of distributing child pornography over the internet.the suspected individual had an account with america online,hereinafter aol and had the following electronic mail address or screen name.a computer forensic specialist,employed by the police department,extracted child pornographic images from the hard drive of that individual computer.
some of the child pornographic images extracted from the seized exhibits through been exchanged between and another aol user,with the screen name hello im beth.these images depict an adult male vaginally penetrating a young girl minors performing oral sex on adult males a minor masturbating an adult male a minor lewdly and lasciviously exposing her genitalia and minors engaged in sexual activities with adult males.
seized computer in florida 
further investigation revealed that the screen name hello im beth was registered to phyllis hotaling,an aol customer residing in brandon,florida.the police department in corpus christi contacted detective phillipe dubord of the sheriff office in hillsborough county,florida and informed him that an individual in brandon was involved in trading child pornography.dubord ascertained that the defendant hall,hotaling son,resided with his mother in brandon.dubord also learned that hotaling account contained other screen names,including the screen name,which the government later used at trial to link hall to the child pornographic images.the sheriff office then obtained a warrant to search hotaling home.
on february,detective dubord and other law enforcement officials executed the search warrant at hotaling residence in brandon,florida.they removed some diskettes and two computers,including one located in hall bedroom.they also interviewed the occupants of hotaling home and ascertained that hall was the person likely responsible for trading child pornography.
detective dubord and another law enforcement official informed hall of his miranda rights,which hall waived after signing an fbi form advising him of his rights.they interviewed hall in his bedroom,and he admitted that he had been using aol for approximately a year.hall also acknowledged that he used aol screen names hello im beth and,among other screen names.
during the interview,detective dubord showed hall child pornographic images and asked hall if he had seen them before.hall admitted that he had sent or received some of the child pornographic images.hall initialed the ones that he recalled having sent or received.these images,with hall initials on them,were later marked as government exhibits through and introduced into evidence during hall trial.
indictment 
on may,a grand jury indicted hall for violating a as follows distribution and receipt of child pornography through interstate commerce by a computer on january,count one receipt of child pornography through interstate commerce by a computer on january,count two and distribution of child pornography through interstate commerce by a computer on january,count three.the indictment also contained a forfeiture count,which charged that hall shall forfeit his interest in,inter alia,his computer for his engagement in the violations alleged in counts one through three.
prior to trial,the government provided written notice of its intent to introduce a videotaped interview pursuant to rules b and of the federal rules of evidence.the interview was of a old girl who was the victim in a pending state of florida case against hall for lewd and lascivious molestation and sexual battery on a victim less than years of age.according to the district court,the girl states in the videotape that hall licked her and demonstrates physically how she touched hall.
hall moved to exclude this evidence from use during his trial.hall argued that the evidence would only inflame,confuse,and mislead the jury and maintained that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudice.in response,the government argued that the evidence was probative of hall interest in children and,consequently,probative of his intent in receiving and distributing child pornography.the government also maintained that it should be permitted to introduce the evidence in its because hall had pled not guilty and placed his intent directly at issue.the government contended that any undue prejudice could be dispelled by a limiting instruction to the jury.
after conducting a hearing and viewing the videotape,the district court entered a order determining that the evidence was relevant and admissible,under rules b and,to prove hall intent,knowledge,and lack of mistake or accident in the event that hall asserts lack of intent as a defense.in such a situation,the district court concluded that the probative value of the videotape exceeds its prejudicial effect and does not violate.the district court also provided hall an opportunity to the child before trial.
on the day of trial and before the jury was impaneled,the parties informed the district court that they had come to an understanding concerning the admission of the videotaped interview of the child.they advised the court that the government would not seek to introduce the evidence in its but that it would do so in its rebuttal case if hall raised a defense such as intent or mistake.hall informed the court that he intended to rest following the government and to hold the government to its burden of proof.
trial commenced on august,and lasted for a.events at trial proceeded as the parties had discussed.after the government presented its,hall rested without presenting a defense.the videotaped interview of the child never was introduced into evidence.on august,the jury found hall guilty on all three counts.
on november,the district court sentenced hall to months imprisonment on each count,such terms to run concurrently,and three years supervised release.the district court compiled hall criminal history score,which placed him in category iii,and calculated hall total offense level as.hall base offense level was for his convictions under a.see.the district court increased hall base offense level of to an adjusted offense level of,by adding a two levels under b because the trafficked material specifically,government exhibits and involved a minor under the age of b five levels under b b because hall offenses involved distribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value and c two levels under b because hall used a computer to transmit the material.
the government also requested that the district court increase hall offense level by four levels,under b,for trafficking in materials that portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.the district court denied this request 
before the jury verdict,hall stipulated to the forfeiture of his computer in the event that the jury returned a guilty verdict.however,the district court did not include the forfeiture in its initial written sentence,dated november.on december,the district court amended that sentence and entered a preliminary order of forfeiture regarding hall computer.the district court entered a final order of forfeiture on april.both parties timely appealed.
ii.rule b evidence 
on appeal,hall argues that the district court decision about the government rule b evidence was erroneous and forced him to surrender several constitutional rights the government responds that hall is not entitled to relief because the rule b videotaped interview of the was introduced during the jury trial.because the evidence never was introduced,the government submits that the district court,in denying hall motion to exclude the videotape,rendered an unreviewable advisory ruling.the government argues that if hall believed the district court ruling was in error,he should have asserted lack of intent as a defense at trial,objected to the resulting admission of the videotape,and then challenged its admission based on a complete record.
for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court decision about the videotape evidence under rule b is not reviewable in this appeal.
luce united states 
we begin our analysis of this issue with luce united states,d,because it involved a similar situation.in luce,the supreme court concluded that a district court in limine evidentiary ruling,permitting prior conviction evidence under rule a of the federal rules of evidence,was not reviewable because the defendant never testified and thus the government prior conviction evidence never was introduced at trial luce,at.
in luce,the district court entered an in limine ruling during trial that a prior conviction of the defendant could be used to impeach him if the defendant testified at trial.id.at.as a result,the defendant chose not to testify at trial.id.at.the supreme court in luce expressly considered whether a defendant may obtain appellate review of a district court in limine evidentiary ruling concerning the admissibility of the defendant prior conviction when the defendant chose not to testify as a result of the district court ruling.id.at.the supreme court recognized that a reviewing court is handicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context.id.at.it further observed that a ny possible harm flowing from a district court in limine ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative,and recognized that a trial court ruling is subject to change when the case unfolds,particularly if the actual testimony differs from what was contained in the defendant proffer.id.the supreme court also noted that even if nothing unexpected happens at trial,the district judge is free,in the exercise of sound judicial discretion,to alter a previous in limine ruling.id.at.
in luce,the supreme court further recognized that the defendant failure to testify created difficulties for the reviewing court because of the question of harmless error.id.at.the supreme court reasoned that w ere in limine rulings under rule a reviewable on appeal,almost any error would result in the windfall of automatic reversal the appellate court could not logically term harmless an error that presumptively kept the defendant from testifying.id.in view of these reasons,the supreme court held that to raise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction,a defendant must testify.id.at.
subsequently,courts have not limited luce to only evidentiary rulings under rule a.for instance,this court in united states dimatteo,cir,extended luce to apply to in limine rulings under rule b of the federal rules of evidence adopting the supreme court rationale in luce,we held that a defendant decision not to present a witness,whose credibility would have formed the basis of an evidentiary objection under rule b,forecloses our ability to review the claim that the district court might have erroneously allowed extrinsic evidence to impeach that witness in violation of rule b.id.at see also united states studnicka,cir holding that defendant tactical decision not to take the stand precludes defendant from challenging on appeal the trial court ruling that allowed the prosecutor to question defendant about certain matters.
b.other circuits 
in addition,while this court heretofore specifically has not addressed luce in a rule b context,other circuits have held that luce applies to in limine evidentiary decisions under rule b.see united states ortiz,cir the proper method to preserve a claim of error regarding rule b motions is to take the position that leads to the admission of the adverse evidence,in order to bring a fully developed record to the reviewing court.united states johnson,cir although luce was decided under.a,its logic applies with equal force to motions under rule.
for example,in ortiz,the defendant was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute,and the government sought to introduce into evidence the defendant prior conviction as a prior similar act probative of intent under rule b.at.because defense counsel represented to the district court that the defense was based on mistaken identity,and not lack of intent to distribute,the court ruled in limine that the conviction would not be admitted into evidence.id.however,the district court cautioned defense counsel that it would alter its ruling if counsel placed intent in issue by arguing that the defendant possession of heroin was consistent with personal use.id.at.prior to closing argument,defense counsel indicated to the district court that he would be making a personal use argument to the jury but ultimately elected not to because of the district court continued admonition that it would allow the prior conviction into evidence under rule b if counsel chose to make the personal use argument.id.at.on appeal,the defendant sought reversal of his conviction on the ground that the district court in limine ruling under rule b was improper and forced him to abandon the personal use theory.id.at.
the second circuit in ortiz rejected the defendant argument and determined that luce rationale was applicable equally in the context of in limine rulings under rule b.id.at.the second circuit reasoned that a lthough the district court ruled that it would admit ortiz prior conviction if defense counsel insisted on arguing personal use,the effect of the court decision remained inchoate,its consequences unknowable because defense counsel did not insist on making his personal use argument.id.at.the second circuit continued that s uch insistence would have led to full development of an adequate record for purposes of appellate review.defense counsel contrary choice deprives us of such a record.id.the second circuit also determined that because the defendant failed to insist on making a personal use argument,harmless error analysis was meaningless because holding that defendant claim was preserved would result in the windfall of automatic reversal on the basis of the district court in limine ruling.id.at quoting luce,at.thus,the second circuit concluded that the defendant failure to challenge the district court adverse disposition of the in limine rule b motion by insisting on the right to make the full personal use argument constitutes a waiver of any claim of error in that decision.ortiz,at.
luce applies to rule b 
we agree with ortiz reasoning and conclude that luce applies equally to in limine rulings about rule b evidence.because hall did not take the position that leads to the admission of the adverse evidence,ortiz,at,the record is too minimally developed to support any meaningful review of the district court decision about rule b evidence.consequently,any possible harm flowing from the district court the admission of the videotaped interview of the child in the event that hall raised a lack of intent wholly speculative.luce,at.in sum,we conclude that the district court rule b ruling is not reviewable because the videotape evidence never was admitted into evidence.in fact,hall tactical decision not to testify actually obtained the trial advantage of limiting the government evidence on the intent issue and thereby prevented the government from admitting the videotaped interview in its.this tactical decision,however,not only caused an inadequate record for review but also,in effect,constituted a waiver of any claim of error in that b ruling 
iii.appears to be 
we now turn to hall claim that the district court jury instructions were erroneous in light of ashcroft free speech coalition,d.all three counts of the indictment alleged that hall violated a,which makes it a felony for any person knowingly to receive or distribute child pornography in interstate commerce by any means,including by computer.at the time of hall indictment and trial,the definition of child pornography included both images made using actual minors,a,as well as virtual child pornography,as added by the child pornography prevention act of.
thus,in charging the jury,the district court defined child pornography using the words of the statute 
c hild pornography means any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture,whether made or produced by electronic,mechanical,or other means,of sexually explicit conduct,where 
a the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct 
b such visual depiction is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct 
c such visual depiction has been created,adapted,or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct or 
d such visual depiction is advertised,promoted,presented,described,or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct 
emphasis added.subsequent to hall trial,the supreme court in free speech coalition struck down as unconstitutional the words or appears to be from the definition of child pornography contained in b and the entire definition of child pornography in d.at.free speech coalition left intact the ban on actual child pornography in the remainder of.id.at.
on appeal,hall challenges his conviction in light of the supreme court decision in free speech coalition.hall argues that the district court erred in its jury charge,rendering it impossible to determine from the record whether the jury relied on the unconstitutional definitions of child pornography in convicting him 
because hall did not object to this jury instruction defining child pornography,we review this issue for plain error.see united states sanchez,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.thus,hall must show that there is error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.sanchez,at quoting olano,at.other internal quotation marks and citation omitted.w here the first two prongs of the plain error rule established by olano are satisfied,the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the plain error affec ted substantial rights.united states mitchell,cir quoting olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in most cases,this means that the error must have been prejudicial it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.mitchell,at quoting olano,at.
the government properly concedes that this jury instruction was erroneous because it included the words or appears to be,and that the error was plain.it submits,however,that the error did not affect hall substantial rights and,alternatively,that affirming hall convictions would not seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.we agree that hall has not carried his burden as to either the third or fourth prong of plain error review.
we reach this conclusion because the evidence established that the children depicted in the pictures introduced at trial were actual children and no one ever claimed,or even hinted,that the images were of virtual children.for example,detective dubord works with the innocent images task force,a federal task force investigating child exploitation on the internet.dubord testified that based on his training and experience,the images depicted minors.in addition,the pictures sent out to the jury are in the record before this court and they show actual children.in fact,there was no evidence at trial of any kind indicating or inferring that the pictures contained images of virtual children as opposed to actual children.
in a recent speech coalition case,united states richardson,cir,this court concluded that a jury instruction including appears to be was plain error but affirmed the defendant conviction under the same statute because the children in the images were actual children.id.at.in richardson,this court stated that it had examined the images shown in the actual pictures sent out to the jury and t he children depicted in those images were real.of that we have no doubt whatsoever.id.internal citation omitted.thus,we concluded that a reasonable jury could not have found that the images in issue there were of virtual children created by computer imaging technology as opposed to actual children id.at.likewise,after examining the pictures sent out to the jury during hall trial,we conclude that the evidence showed that the children depicted in those images were real and that no reasonable jury could have found that the images were virtual children created by computer technology as opposed to actual children.
iv.sentencing 
sentencing hearing 
in its,the government contends that the district court erred in failing to apply a sentence enhancement under b at hall sentencing hearing,the government requested a increase under b for the trafficking of materials involving the sexual exploitation of a minor where the materials portray sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.id.the government sought this enhancement based on government exhibit,which hall sent to on january.government exhibit portrays an adult male vaginally penetrating a very young girl,well under the age of twelve.the government argued that the vaginal penetration of such a young child by an adult male would necessarily cause pain,and thus this image portrayed sadistic conduct.
the district court declined to apply the sadistic conduct enhancement in b,for two reasons.first,the district court stated that the activity depicted is what he been charged and convicted with in the first place.it what makes it pornographic.the district court also noted that it had already applied a increase under b for the trafficking of materials involving the sexual exploitation of a minor where the material involves a minor under the age of twelve years second,the district court declined to find that the image in exhibit depicted sadism because the young child expression in that picture did not indicate sufficiently that she actually was experiencing pain.
prior precedent 
the sentencing guidelines do not specify what constitutes materials that portray sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence prescribed in b.however,several recent decisions in our circuit have construed the meaning of this language in b,specifically the term sadistic,and determined what is required for this particular enhancement to apply.in united states garrett,cir,this court concluded that an image that displays the subjection of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be painful is sadistic within the meaning of b.garrett,at.thus,we affirmed in garrett the district court finding,based on the medical expert testimony,that the act of adult men vaginal and anal penetration of children between eight and eleven years of age would be considered sadistic.united states caro,cir discussing garrett,at.
this court revisited the meaning of this same language in b in united states bender,cir,cert.denied,d.in bender,in affirming the district court application of an enhancement under b,we clarified our ruling in garrett regarding what constitutes a sadistic image.caro,at see bender,at.we stated that a photograph is sadistic within the meaning of section b when it depicts the subjection of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be painful.bender,at quoting garrett,at.we then determined that photographs of very young children being vaginally and anally penetrated by adult males are sadistic images warranting a b enhancement.bender,at caro,at.
finally,in caro,this court explained what is required to show that application of an enhancement under b is appropriate.in car
