thomas and janice reedy appeal their convictions of,and sentences for,transporting visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,in violation of,and transporting child pornography,in violation of.websites specializing in child pornography paid the reedys a portion of their profits to establish a,screening,and age verification system for subscribers.
the government agrees that the district court imposed multiplicitous sentences by counting each image posted as a violation of two statutes that criminalize the same conduct.accordingly,the court should resentence using for the substantive counts of transporting visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit activity.
the parties disagree,however,as to what unit of prosecution should apply for a violation of.because the statute does not speak to the question,the rule of lenity requires resentencing based on the number of websites rather than the number of individual images.we vacate and remand for resentencing only and reject the reedys other arguments.
in april,united states postal inspector adams contacted detective steve nelson of the fbi crimes against children task force assigned to the dallas police department child exploitation unit.adams requested nelson aid in investigating an internet website named,which linked to another website named lolita world.nelson agreed to access the website as part of an undercover investigation.
to gain access to all the information on the website,a prospective subscriber was prompted to go to a page hosted by keyz.the subscriber then had to provide his or her name,address,and a credit card number to which to charge a fee of for thirty days access.nelson purchased access and found pornography on lolita world that involved children ranging from infants to teenagers.further investigation uncovered that landslide,landslide,provided a computerized credit card verification service used by various webmasters whose websites contained adult and child pornography.landslide offered access under the adult verification system avs and the keyz system.
avs subscribers paid,which provided six months access to all the websites under the avs umbrella.the websites accessed through avs offered adult pornography only.
keyz subscribers purchased access to specific sites at per month.landslide retained a portion of the money collected,and the webmasters received the rest.under the keyz system,nelson found websites depicting child pornography.these websites included lolita little kids,blackcat lolita,children of god,children forced to porn,just grow up,child rape,children playground,innocent lolita,fantastic site,and special site.
nelson captured information from some of the websites by using an internet card that permitted him to record the information onto a video cassette recorder.he also used a software package called web buddy to capture the information from the websites and copy it onto the hard drive of his computer so he could view it offline.he determined the locations of the websites from which the child pornography originated by using a software package called visualroute.the location of each image of child pornography alleged in the indictment was traced to an internet service provider outside texas.
the landslide and avs homepages displayed banners,or online advertisements with hyperlinks,alerting potential subscribers to the availability of child pornography on various websites.in addition,landslide offered a free adult classified advertisements section on the website that showed banners advertising child pornography.on reviewing the ads,nelson found postings by persons wanting to trade child pornography,to have sexual contact with children,and to trade keyz passwords.
the reedys were the owners and operators of landslide,and thomas reedy was its founder.janice reedy held various positions with the company beginning in january,including handling its financial transactions.during an interview with law enforcement agents,thomas reedy admitted that he and his wife knew some of the websites contained child pornography and that child pornography represented thirty to forty percent of his business.the reedys had authored and received emails indicating that they were aware that some of the websites on the keyz system offered child pornography and that the reedys knew the transmission of child pornography was illegal.
during a search of the reedys residence in september,law enforcement agents seized a desktop computer and a notebook computer.the basis of count was child pornography images from the desktop computer.the police found three images of child pornography on the notebook computer.
landslide gross sales from september through august were was returned to dissatisfied customers.landside incurred costs of.based on this information,the auditor determined that landslide had made a profit of and that of the proceeds came from the eleven websites named in the indictment.
the superseding indictment charged the reedys with various offenses arising from their participation in the transmission of child pornography over the internet.count charged conspiracy to transport any visual depiction produced through the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,in violation of a and b.counts through charged the substantive offenses of transporting and aiding and abetting the transport of visual depictions produced through the use of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,in violation of and.count charged conspiracy to commit activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography in violation of a and b.counts through charged committing activities relating to material constituting or containing child pornography and aiding and abetting in violation of and.count alleged possession of a computer disk and computer material containing approximately fifty images of child pornography produced by means of a computer using material shipped and transported in interstate commerce,in violation of,which is part of the child pornography prevention act of,et.
the jury found thomas reedy guilty on counts through and janice reedy guilty on counts through.the court sentenced thomas reedy to months consecutive imprisonment on each count,plus three years supervised release on each count,to run concurrently,and a special assessment of.his prison term would have equaled years,so the court ordered that he serve a life sentence.
janice reedy received months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently,plus three years supervised release and a special assessment of.her prison term totals fourteen years.
the reedys allege that their indictment was multiplicitous for three reasons the indictment twice charges the same conduct as the transportation of materials that sexually exploit minors in violation of and the transportation of child pornography in violation of.the indictment alleged duplicative conspiracies to violate each of the two statutes.the indictment and the district court incorrectly viewed the number of pictures,rather than the number of websites,as the relevant unit of analysis under.
we review issues of multiplicity de novo.united states dupre,cir.multiplicity is the charging of a single offense in several counts.charles wright,federal practice and procedure,at west ed.the chief danger raised by a multiplicitous indictment is the possibility that the defendant will receive more than one sentence for a single offense.united states swaim,cir.
where overlapping statutory provisions create a risk of multiplicity,t he test for determining whether the same act or transaction constitutes two offenses or only one is whether conviction under each statutory provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.united states nguyen,cir citing united states free,cir.where a multipart transaction raises the prospect of multiplicity under a single statute,the question becomes whether separate and distinct prohibited acts,made punishable by law,have been committed.united states shaid,cir quoting bins united states,cir.
we first consider whether the government properly charged two counts for each image by charging separate violations of and.the government acknowledges that it could not properly charge a violation of both statutes for each image but argues that thomas reedy waived this argument in the district court.a defendant must challenge the multiplicity of an indictment before trial or forfeit the issue.united states soape,cir.he may,however,raise claims about the multiplicity of sentences for the first time on appeal thomas reedy appellate brief repeatedly characterizes his challenge as one to the multiplicitous sentences,which eliminates any possibility of waiver 
thomas reedy so phrased his challenge in the district court as well.the government concedes that janice reedy raised these objections at trial.she objected pursuant to the previously filed motion to dismiss the indictment,and that motion alleged that the indictment itself is multiplicitious.she stated that the government responded to the challenge to the indictment by stating that it would elect among the charges later,and she sought to remind the court of that at sentencing.
thomas reedy attorney joined in the argument by referencing the district court scheduling order,which permitted to join in one another objections and motions.because thomas reedy consistently ratified janice reedy challenges based on the multiplicity of the sentence,and he has presented them on appeal,he has preserved the argument for our review.
on remand,the district court should resentence for each violation of and not.section a criminalizes the transport of visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.section a criminalizes the transportation or distribution of child pornography.section b d defines child pornography broadly to include a visual depiction that appears to be a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,a depiction created,adapted,or modified to so appear,or one advertised as a visual depiction of a minor engaged in such conduct.b d.in ashcroft free speech coalition,d,the court struck down this definition of child pornography as overbroad.
accordingly,the court should resentence the reedys without including the substantive violations of the court should not consider counts to,which are duplicative of the counts,nor should it consider count,which alleges a duplicative conspiracy to violate.
in determining the sentence the district court used the total number of images appearing on all the websites as the relevant unit of prosecution for determining the number of counts for violating.the reedys contend that the court should have used only the number of websites the government responds that the reedys should,theoretically,bear liability for each download of each picture from each website on the keyz network 
to determine whether the reedys conduct gives rise to multiple convictions or punishments,we must,therefore,determine the allowable unit of prosecution.united states universal credit.united states prestenbach,cir.we begin with the language of to determine whether it precisely delineates the criminal act.united states dixon,cir,petition for cert.filed.
section a makes it a crime knowingly to ship or transport in interstate commerce any visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.we have explained the problem posed by the use of the word any,and our method for resolving it 
since any can mean one or some,courts have determined the unit of prosecution by reference to the conduct alleged.courts apply the following rule whether a transaction results in the commission of one or more offenses is determined by whether separate and distinct acts made punishable by law have been committed.the principle underlying this rule is that the unit of prosecution for a crime is the actus reus,the physical conduct of the defendant.
prestenbach,at 
the word transport is fairly straightforward but closely examining the meaning of visual depiction only complicates matters.we start by considering whether a visual depiction is neatly confined to an individual image or encompasses a broader set of items,such as books,magazines,movies,or other collections.
section defines a visual depiction as including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture,whether made or produced by electronic,mechanical,or other means.this list includes both items that may be classified as a single shot of a single scene,such as a still photograph,and series of shots of several scenes or ongoing action,such as a film or video.the statute contemplates visual depictions as constituting both single images and more than one image.
other portions of demonstrate that congress recognized that a visual depiction might include one or several images.section a b forbids the possession of books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction sent through interstate commerce and c creates an affirmative defense for persons possessing less than three matters containing any visual depiction.these references tell us that a matter is larger and inclusive of a visual depiction,but they do not explain the size or inclusiveness of a visual depiction.standing alone,the text of fails to resolve the question,so we turn to our one precedent interpreting related issues under that section 
in united states gallardo,cir,the defendant mailed four envelopes addressed to four persons in various locations,and argued that because he mailed three envelopes at the same time,the court should consider them as a single count.in a passage on which both sides focus here,we held that the three envelopes should count as three,and only three,counts 
e ach separate use of the mail to transport or ship child pornography should constitute a separate crime because it is the act of either transporting or shipping that is the central focus of this statute.gallardo mailed four separate envelopes containing child pornography,thus committing four separate acts of transporting or shipping.the number of photographs in each envelope is irrelevant.in contrast,a defendant arrested with one binder containing numerous photographs has committed only one act of transportation.similarly,a single transportation of two women is but one violation of the mann act.
id.at citation omitted.
the government emphasizes that we parsed the placing of the three envelopes into the mail.the reedys highlight that we permitted only one count for each envelope and labeled improper an attempt to charge the defendants for each picture contained in the envelope.gallardo is not especially similar to the instant case,so we take from it only a single proposition where a defendant has a single envelope or book or magazine containing many images of minors engaging in sexual activity,the government often should charge only a single count.
consider the reedys actions they established a security screening device that aided and abetted the website operators who purveyed child pornography.the reedys chose to bundle their service by website they charged for subscriptions to individual websites under the keyz plan.as the defendant in gallardo chose to collect several pictures in an envelope,or the publisher of a magazine of child pornography chooses to collect several images in a periodical,the reedys chose to bundle in this manner.gallardo cuts slightly in favor of the reedys interpretation.
we are faced,then,with what to do where,as here,a criminal statute fails to provide an answer to a question the supreme court provided the answer almost fifty years ago when faced with this interpretive dilemma.in bell united states,the court considered whether the mann act prohibition against knowingly transporting any woman or girl in interstate commerce for an immoral purpose supported two counts for transporting two women at the same time in the same vehicle.the court reached the same impasse that we have reached today.because argumentative skill could persuasively and not unreasonably reach either interpretation,the court ruled that the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity,and the government could charge only one count.id.at.we reach the same conclusion here and decide that the district court erred by permitting the prosecution to group the counts by individual image rather than website 
the reedys raise two challenges to the jury instructions the instructions reflected the multiplicitous counts and biased the jury by making the defendants appear twice as guilty.thomas reedy argues that the court erroneously instructed the jury that it only need find he possessed one visual depiction under count.we review each in turn.
we review challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion.united states young,cir.a conviction will be reversed only if the charge as a whole leaves us with substantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.bender brumley,cir citation and internal quotation omitted.even if the instructions are erroneous,we will not reverse if we determine,based upon the entire record,that the challenged instruction could not have affected the outcome of the case.johnson sawyer,cir.
the reedys argue that including instructions on multiplicitous counts allowed the jury to find them guilty on counts deemed unconstitutional under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.the reedys reason that these instructions prejudiced the jury on all counts included in the indictment by making the reedys appear two times guiltier,with twice the opportunity for the jury to find guilt.
the government argues that dismissing the multiplicitous counts would render any jury error harmless,because the court expressly instructed the jury to consider guilt on each count separately.the relevant jury instructions provided 
a separate crime is charged in each count of the indictment.each count and the evidence pertaining to that count should be considered separately and individually.the fact that you may find the defendant under consideration guilty or not guilty as to one or more counts should not control your verdict as to any other count.
juries are presumed to follow instructions.see,richardson marsh,d collecting cases.the above instruction should have prevented the multiplicative indictment from influencing the verdict on the valid counts.see also dixon united states kimbrough,cir.a remand for resentencing will cure all error.
thomas reedy argues that the jury instruction on count permitted the jury to convict on findings shy of what a b requires the instruction on count stated that the jury had to find that the defendant under consideration knowingly possessed at least one visual depiction containing an image or images of child pornography.thomas reedy argues that d,which creates an affirmative defense to a charge of violating a,requires finding that he possessed at least three images of child pornography.according to thomas reedy,he possessed only one computer disc drive.
section d expressly states,however,that it is an affirmative defense.see united states henriques,cir stating that d gives the defendant an affirmative defense upon a showing that the defendant possessed fewer than three images.reedy bore the burden of raising and pleading the affirmative defense,united states elorduy,cir,but failed to raise the defense or object to the instruction the court did not have an obligation to instruct on a of the crime or on an affirmative defense never presented.
the reedys raise three objections to the sentence the relevant conduct calculations erroneously included revenue from both child pornography and legal adult pornography.thomas reedy did not play a leadership role in the offense.the court failed to resolve all the sentencing objections.
we review the application of sentencing guidelines de novo but findings of fact for clear error.united states taylor,cir.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.united states myers,cir.we review the application of.c de novo.united states medina,cir.
the reedys contend that the auditor incorrectly established their pecuniary gain as,because this figure includes money generated from legal pornographic websites.the reedys argue that only,which was earned from the websites contained in the indictment,should be considered for establishing the sentencing enhancement under b o.the government responds the district court did not include revenues from the adult pornography websites in its calculation but merely considered revenues from other child pornography sites.
relevant conduct for which a defendant was not charged or convicted may be considered in determining the guideline range.see united states taplette,cir.according to a,relevant conduct may be based on all acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as to the offense of conviction.
the represented the total amount of pecuniary gain from all the child pornography websites for which landslide operated its credit card verification system.the auditor testified that his analysis of landslide financial records showed as the total proceeds from the websites named in the indictment.during the sentencing process,however,a second government auditor conducted an audit of keyz financial records and determined that landslide had earned from all the websites containing child pornography for which it provided a credit card verification system.the court properly considered those sums when establishing the enhancement.
thomas reedy argues that the district court wrongfully found him to be a of criminal activity,resulting in a enhancement under a.reedy contends that he was only a middleman,so his total offense level under b should be decreased by one offense level.the government answers that reedy qualified because his criminal enterprise involved more than five participants.
under a,the offense level may be increased by four if the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.according to application note,the sentencing court should consider 
the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of the participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control and authority exercise over others.
reedy quotes assistant united states attorney terri moore opening statement to the jury that subscribers or users needed a middleman,that where appellants come in.they are a middleman.marshall also testified that on the internet,there a large group of customers,there a large group of child pornography sites,and in the middle is.com basically being the gatekeeper between those two components.
the government notes that under a,a defendant should receive a enhancement if he was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.the presentence report psr sets forth the following in support of the recommendation that thomas reedy be considered a 
t his case involved a sophisticated,international child pornography scheme which earned in excess of.the superseding indictment in this case identified five participants in the conspiracy,including thomas reedy,janice reedy,kusuma,boris greenberg,and hanny ingganata thomas reedy held the position of president within his company and directed the employees identified in paragraph.he also developed and implemented the services used to the child pornography.for these reasons,the level enhancement for being an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive is warranted in this case.
no one challenges the following facts the criminal activity involved at least five knowing participants.the crime involved the transportation,for remuneration,of child pornography all over the world via the internet.thomas reedy ran the operation he developed and implemented the keyz service for the purpose of mass marketing child pornography to interested subscribers he actively recruited webmasters to utilize keyz by promising increased profits by tracking subscribers interested in child pornography if a webmaster failed to fo
