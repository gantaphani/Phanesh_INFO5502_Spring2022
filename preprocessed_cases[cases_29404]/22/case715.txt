the united states district court for the central district of california entered summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of google,google and against vederi,llc vederi on october.because the district court erred in its claim construction,this court vacates the judgment of and remands for further proceedings.
vederi sued google for patent infringement on october,alleging that google street view infringed various claims of four related patents patent patent and collectively the asserted patents.the asserted patents share a common and claim priority to a common provisional patent application.
generally speaking,the asserted patents relate to methods for creating synthesized images of a geographic area through which a user may then visually navigate via a computer.patent abst.in acquiring the images,a recording device is mounted on top of a car that is driven throughout the geographic area.id.at ll.in one embodiment,a single camera points generally horizontally and perpendicularly to the axis of the street to capture front views of the objects lining the streets and sometimes side views of buildings,stores,homes,and other objects.id.at ll.the asserted patents disclose that multiple cameras may also be used to capture views in different directions.id.at ll.
the camera captures and records images as it passes by objects e,stores,buildings,cars.id.at ll.by combining these images of the geographic area,the asserted patents disclose generating a composite image that provides a field of view that is wider than that provided by any single image.id.at ll.figure illustrates certain aspects of the invention of the asserted patents.
id.at.as shown in figure,the camera captures views as the vehicle moves along axis x.id.at ll.nonetheless a composite image gives a viewer the perspective of viewing the passing objects from the vantage point of a fictitious camera.id.figure depicts an exemplary graphical user interface that also illustrates a composite image as indicated by the box surrounding image area.id.at.ll.
id.at emphasis added.the asserted patents note that the cameras may use lenses,id.at ll,and provide views of the objects,id.at ll.
the asserted patents incorporate by reference,and claim priority to,provisional application,which was filed on october.that provisional patent application discloses,in relevant part 
future embodiments of the invention could present data in different formats.for example,rather than using a camera facing directly to the street side,a slightly forward or backward looking camera could be used to provide a panoramic look up or down the street.also,if sufficient cameras to cover all viewing directions are used so as to provide degrees of view images and synthetic panoramas where the direction of view is can be provided.
claim of the patent is representative of the asserted claims.it recites 
in a system including an image source and a user terminal having a screen and an input device,a method for enabling visual navigation of a geographic area from the user terminal,the method comprising 
receiving a first user input specifying a first location in the geographic area 
retrieving from the image source a first image associated with the first location,the image source providing a plurality of images depicting views of objects in the geographic area,the views being substantially elevations of the objects in the geographic area,wherein the images are associated with image frames acquired by an image recording device moving along a trajectory 
receiving a second user input specifying a navigation direction relative to the first location in the geographic area 
determining a second location based on the user specified navigation direction and 
retrieving from the image source a second image associated with the second location.
patent emphasis added.the dispute on appeal concerns the substantially elevations limitation,which appears in all of the asserted claims.the district court concluded that google did not infringe any asserted claims after construing the term images depicting views of objects in a geographic area,the views being substantially elevations of the objects in the geographic area as vertical flat as opposed to curved or spherical depictions of front or side views.thus,under the trial court reading of the claims,spherical or curved images fell outside the scope of vederi patent claims.
the accused product google street view provides context for the parties disagreement.according to google,street view combines images of a wide range of views recorded by multiple cameras having lenses mounted on a moving vehicle.those photographs are overlapping pictures taken from a single location at approximately the same time.id.
these images are stitched together into a virtual spherical composite image.id.at.the resulting image is a representation of a spherical shape.id.
the spherical projections are then cut into square tiles to reduce bandwidth when a user is viewing only a portion of the spherical image.id.at.as shown in the figure below,the spherical panorama gives the user the option to scroll around and view objects as if the user were standing in the center of the sphere.id.at.
id.at.according to google,it does not infringe the asserted patents because its product produces images and views that are curved or spherical,and never flat.id.at.
the district court conducted a markman hearing on november.the parties agreed that the substantially elevations limitation referred to front and side views of objects.however,the parties disagreed as to the meaning of the limitation,depicting views of objects the views being substantially elevations of the objects in the geographic area.vederi stated that the limitation depicting views of objects the views being substantially elevations of objects means front or side views of objects.google contended that the limitation means vertical flat as opposed to curved or spherical depictions of front or side views.the district court adopted google construction because it concluded that the asserted patents did not disclose anything about spherical views.id.at.
google and vederi filed competing motions for summary judgment on the issue of infringement.in its opinion on summary judgment,the district court stated that it adopted google construction of substantially elevations because vederi method of taking,processing,and displaying images creates only vertical flat views,not spherical ones.id.at.the district court elaborated by noting that the photographs are captured by cameras moving along a horizontal plane the result is one long,flat composite picture of a street nothing about that method or result suggests that the patents cover curved or spherical images.id.at.
the district court further observed that the reference to degree panning in the provisional patent application refers to the creation of a degree panorama,akin to panning degrees along a horizontal plane,not within a sphere.id.at.the district court noted that it would be similar to taking pictures with a camera as it spun around on a lazy susan.id.according to the district court,it would not be possible to pan up and down as in street view.id.
based on its claim construction,the district court entered summary judgment of in favor of google.the district court noted that t he court construction of the substantially elevations limitation means that if street view presents only images,it does infringe vederi patents because all of vederi patents contain the substantially elevations limitations.id.at.after considering the parties competing arguments,the court explained that street view images may appear to be flat to the naked eye,but they are actually curved because of google methods for capturing,processing,and displaying them.id.at.the district court concluded,b ecause street view displays only curved views,it does contain the substantially elevations limitation,and so does literally infringe vederi patents.id.it also found no infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.id.at.
vederi appeals.this court has jurisdiction under a.
claim construction is an issue of law reviewed de novo.cybor fas.in construing claims,this court rel
