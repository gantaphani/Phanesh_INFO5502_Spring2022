in california the accrual of causes of action growing out of the publication of defamatory or other tortious statements is governed by the rule.under the rule,one cause of action will arise,and the statute of limitations will commence running,upon the first general publication or broadcast of a tortious statement,notwithstanding how many copies of the publication are distributed or how many people hear or see the broadcast.any subsequent republication or rebroadcast gives rise to a new single cause of action.
we find the rule applies to statements published on internet web sites.because the statements which give rise to plaintiffs cause of action for defamation were posted on a web site maintained by one of the defendants more than a year before plaintiffs complaint was filed,plaintiffs defamation cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations,code of civil procedure section.
accordingly,the trial court should have granted defendants motion to strike the defamation cause of action.
plaintiff and respondent diana fineran and defendants and appellants laura gilbreath,lee zimmerman,randi briggs and john herold are all very interested in cat breeding.the record discloses fineran was the president and the individual defendants were all officers and directors of defendant and appellant traditional cat association tca.in a dispute developed between fineran and the individual defendants with respect to criticism of fineran leadership of tca.as the result of the dispute,fineran established another organization,plaintiff and respondent the traditional cat association,a washington corporation ttca.ttca then commenced a series of lawsuits against tca and the individual defendants,alleging that they had misappropriated tca funds and were guilty of conversion,copyright infringement,unfair competition,trademark and trade secret infringement 
in response to the litigation,in defendant john herold created a web site on the internet which he named the diana fineran response website.the web site purported to report on the status of the litigation initiated by fineran.the descriptions of the litigation on the web site were highly critical of fineran and ttca and very favorable to tca,herold and the other defendants.
on may,fineran and ttca filed the instant action against herold,tca and the other defendants.fineran and ttca alleged that the statements on the web site gave rise to a cause of action for defamation.she also alleged unfair competition and conversion causes of action.
herold and the other defendants challenged the complaint by way of a motion to strike and a demurrer.the motion to strike was directed primarily at the defamation cause of action.the demurrer challenged all three causes of action.in support of the motion to strike,herold submitted a declaration in which he stated that he had not altered the web site after may.
in ruling on the motion to strike,the trial court found the statements on the web site were made in furtherance of the defendants petition and free speech rights within the meaning of section,subdivision b.however,the court denied the motion to strike because it found,among other matters,the statute of limitations defenses asserted by the defendants,even if conclusive,will not support relief under the statute.
the court sustained the defendants demurrer but gave ttca and fineran leave to amend.
herold and the other defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying their motion to strike.see,subd.j.
discussion 
idefamationa.statute of limitations defenses support relief 
in considering plaintiffs defamation cause of action,the first issue we must consider is the trial court determination that statute of limitations defenses,even if meritorious,will not support a motion to strike under the statute.
a motion to strike under section,subdivision b,requires a trial court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold prima facie showing that the defendant acts,of which the plaintiff complains,were ones taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.kashian harriman th,d.as we have noted,the trial court found that the statements which appeared on the web site and which give rise to fineran and ttca defamation cause of action were made in furtherance of the defendants free speech and petition rights.this aspect of the trial court ruling was plainly correct.given the controversy surrounding the parties dispute and its evident notoriety in the cat breeding community,the web site statements concerned matters of public interest in the cat breeding community,subd.e see tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d damon ocean hills journalism club th,d.we also note our courts have repeatedly held that reports of judicial proceedings,such as appeared on the web site,are an exercise of free speech within the meaning of section.see sipple foundation for nat.progress th,d braun chronicle publishing th,d lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d.
when a court finds that a defendant was furthering free speech or petitioning rights,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim by making a prima facie showing of facts that would,if proved,support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.citation.kashian harriman,supra,th at,d.this standard is similar to the standard used in determining motions for nonsuit,directed verdict,or summary judgment,in that the court can not weigh the evidence.citations.however,the plaintiff can not simply rely on the allegations in the complaint citation,but must provide the court with sufficient evidence to permit the court to determine whether there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.citation.computerxpress,jackson th,d.importantly,the court can also consider a defendant opposing evidence to determine whether it defeats a plaintiff case as a matter of law.kashian harriman,supra,th at,d lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing,supra,th at,d.
contrary to the express terms of the statute,the trial court ruled a statute of limitations defense is not a proper issue for determination in a motion to strike under code of civil procedure.the only defense at issue in motion is the constitutional defenses involving the right to petition and free speech.the limitation imposed by the trial court on motions appears nowhere on the face of the statute or in its rationale.
in determining whether a plaintiff has demonstrated the requisite probability of prevailing,section,subdivision b,requires that the court consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.italics added.thus on its face the statute contemplates consideration of the substantive merits of the plaintiff complaint,as well as all available defenses to it,including,but not limited to constitutional defenses.this broad approach is required not only by the language of the statute,but by the policy reasons which gave rise to our statute.as the court in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,stated intimidation will naturally exist anytime a community member is sued by an organization for millions of dollars even if it is probable that the suit will be dismissed.citation.considering the purpose of the provision,expressly stated,the nature or form of the action is not what is critical but rather that it is against a person who has exercised certain rights.citation.the legislature recognized that all kinds of claims could achieve the objective of a slapp interfere with and burden the defendant exercise of his or her rights.similarly,a claim which is meritless because it is barred by the statute of limitations will cause just as much intimidation as a claim which is barred because of a constitutional defense.both forms of meritless lawsuits are the subject of section.
in sum then,the statements on the web site were an exercise of free speech which shifted to plaintiffs the burden of establishing the merits of their defamation cause of action,including its timeliness.as we explain more fully below,plaintiffs defamation cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.
given the unique and dynamic character of the internet,plaintiffs argue that their defamation cause of action arose continuously while the web site was operating.hence they contend that because herold conceded that the web site was operating at the time the motion to strike was made,the statute of limitations for defamation had not expired at the time they filed their complaint.as we indicated at the outset,we do not accept this analysis.plaintiffs defamation claim is governed by the rule.
california adoption of the rule 
in shively bozanich cal th,d,the court recently set forth the history and rationale of the rule.under the common law as it existed in the century and early part of the century,the principle that each communication of a defamatory remark to a new audience constitutes a separate publication,giving rise to a separate cause of action,led to the conclusion that each sale or delivery of a copy of a newspaper or book containing a defamation also constitutes a separate publication of the defamation to a new audience,giving rise to a separate cause of action for defamation.see harper et,law of torts,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.this conclusion had the potential to subject the publishers of books and newspapers to lawsuits stating hundreds,thousands,or even millions of causes of action for a single issue of a periodical or edition of a book.this conclusion also had the potential to disturb the repose that the statute of limitations ordinarily would afford,because a new publication of the defamation could occur if a copy of the newspaper or book were preserved for many years and then came into the hands of a new reader who had not discovered it previously.the statute of limitations could be tolled indefinitely,perhaps forever,under this approach.
the difficulties created by the early common law rule are illustrated in a english case that concluded a plaintiff could bring an action seeking redress for libel against a publisher based upon an allegedly defamatory remark contained in a newspaper issued years prior to the plaintiff discovery of the defamation,on the theory that the sale to the plaintiff of the copy of the newspaper constituted a new publication,starting anew the running of the period of limitations.the duke of brunswick harmer eng.despite the burdens created by the staleness and potential volume of the claims thus permitted,many american courts,and the reporters of the first restatement of torts,nonetheless adhered to the rule applied by the english court in the duke of brunswick case.rest d,torts,com.b,smolla,law of defamation ed.
ultimately,many american courts began to reconsider the common law rule exemplified in the duke of brunswick case.these courts recognized that the advent of books and newspapers that were circulated among a mass readership threatened unending and potentially ruinous liability as well as overwhelming and endless litigation,as long as courts adhered to the rule that each sale of a copy of a newspaper or a book,regardless how long after original publication,constituted a new and separate publication.the early common law rule threatened a volume of litigation and a potential for indefinite tolling of the period of limitations that,these courts realized,would challenge the ability and willingness of publishers to report freely on the news and on matters of public interest.see gregoire putnam sons,collecting cases see also hartmann time.cir,observing that the century rule posed a threat to freedom of the press applewhite memphis state university,noting that the rule posed threats of harassment,multiple recovery,and injury to the administration of justice winrod time.
seeking to avoid both the multiplicity and the staleness of claims permitted by the rule applied in the duke of brunswick case,courts fashioned what became known as the rule,holding that,for any single edition of a newspaper or book,there was but a single potential action for a defamatory statement contained in the newspaper or book,no matter how many copies of the newspaper or the book were distributed.see,gregoire putnam sons,supra,see also bradford american media operations,rinaldi viking penguin,winrod time,supra,at rest d torts,subd.harper et,law of torts,supra.of course,because each person who takes a responsible part in a publication of defamatory matter may be held liable for the publication see dunn hearst cal,osmond ewap,d,multiple causes of action,even under the rule,could be brought in one proceeding against several defendants for a single defamatory statement.wathan equitable life assur.soc,dubinsky united airlines master executive council d.west laws ann.single publ.act,comrs.note.
under the rule,with respect to the statute of limitations,publication generally is said to occur on the first general distribution of the publication to the public.belli roberts furs d.see also bradford american media operations,supra.at collecting cases.accrual at that point is believed to provide adequate protection to potential plaintiffs,especially in view of the qualification that repetition of the defamatory statement in a new edition of a book or newspaper constitutes a new publication of the defamation that may give rise to a new cause of action,with a new accrual date.see rinaldi viking penguin,supra,at.under this rule,the cause of action accrues and the period of limitations commences,regardless of when the plaintiff secured a copy or became aware of the publication.see strick superior court d.mcguiness motor trend magazine d.belli roberts brothers furs,supra,d at.see also morgan hustler magazine,flynn associated press.
the rule largely has been codified in the uniform single publication act,which has been adopted in many states,including california,added by stats,mcguiness motor trend magazine,supra,d at.belli roberts brothers furs,supra,d at.see also smolla,law of defamation,supra,harper et,law of torts,supra,fn.the uniform single publication act was intended to reflect the common law rule.wathan equitable life assur,supra.at dubinsky united airlines master executive council,supra,at west laws,supra,single publ.act,comrs.note.shively bozanich,supra,cal th at,d.
in shively the plaintiff argued that notwithstanding the rule and its premises,the statute of limitations on her claim should have been tolled until she discovered the publication.in rejecting this argument,the court in shively stated as is evident,application of the discovery rule to statements contained in books and newspapers would undermine the rule and reinstate the indefinite tolling of the statute of limitations intended to be cured by the adoption of the rule.if we were to recognize delayed accrual of a cause of action based upon the allegedly defamatory statement contained in the book,a problem of evidence,on the basis that plaintiff did not happen to come across the statement until some time after the book was first generally distributed to the public,we would be adopting a rule subjecting publishers and authors to potential liability during the entire period in which a single copy of the book or newspaper might exist and fall into the hands of the subject of a defamatory remark.inquiry into whether delay in discovering the publication was reasonable has not been permitted for publications governed by the rule.nor is adoption of the rule proposed by plaintiff appropriate simply because the originator of a privately communicated defamatory statement may,together with the author and the publisher of a book,be liable for the defamation contained in the book.under the rationale for the rule,the originator,who is jointly responsible along with the author and the publisher,should not be liable for millions of causes of action for a single edition of the book.similarly,consistent with that rationale,the originator,like the author or the publisher,should not be subject to suit many years after the edition is published.shively bozanich,supra,cal th at,d.
