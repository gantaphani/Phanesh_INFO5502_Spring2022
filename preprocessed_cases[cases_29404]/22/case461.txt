barnes noble,barnes noble appeals the district court denial of its motion to compel arbitration against kevin khoa nguyen nguyen pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained in its website terms of use.in order to resolve the issue of arbitrability,we must address whether nguyen,by merely using barnes noble website,agreed to be bound by the terms of use,even though nguyen was never prompted to assent to the terms of use and never in fact read them.we agree with the district court that barnes noble did not provide reasonable notice of its terms of use,and that nguyen therefore did not unambiguously manifest assent to the arbitration provision contained therein.
we also agree with the district court that nguyen is not equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration because he relied on the terms of use choice of law provision.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of barnes noble motion to compel arbitration and to stay court proceedings.
background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute.barnes noble is a national bookseller that owns and operates hundreds of bookstores as well as the website.in august,barnes noble,along with other retailers across the country,liquidated its inventory of discontinued hewlett packard touchpads touchpads,an unsuccessful competitor to apple ipad,by advertising a fire sale of touchpads at a heavily discounted price.acting quickly on the nationwide liquidation of touchpads,nguyen purchased two units on barnes noble website on august,and received an email confirming the transaction.the following day,nguyen received another email informing him that his order had been cancelled due to unexpectedly high demand.nguyen alleges that,as a result of barnes noble representations,as well as the delay in informing him it would not honor the sale,he was unable to obtain an hp tablet during the liquidation period for the discounted price,and was forced to rely on substitute tablet technology,which he subsequently purchased at considerable expense.
in april,nguyen filed this lawsuit in california superior court on behalf of himself and a putative class of consumers whose touchpad orders had been cancelled,alleging that barnes noble had engaged in deceptive business practices and false advertising in violation of both california and new york law.barnes noble removed the action to federal court and moved to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa,arguing that nguyen was bound by the arbitration agreement in the website terms of use.
the website terms of use are available via a terms of use hyperlink located in the bottom corner of every page on the barnes noble website,which appears alongside other hyperlinks labeled nook store terms,copyright,and privacy policy.these hyperlinks also appear underlined and set in green typeface in the lower lefthand corner of every page in the online checkout process.
nguyen neither clicked on the terms of use hyperlink nor actually read the terms of use.had he clicked on the hyperlink,he would have been taken to a page containing the full text of barnes noble terms of use,which state,in relevant part by visiting any area in the barnes site,creating an account,or making a purchase via the barnes site a user is deemed to have accepted the terms of use.nguyen also would have come across an arbitration provision,which states

nguyen contends that he can not be bound to the arbitration provision because he neither had notice of nor assented to the website terms of use.barnes noble,for its part,asserts that the placement of the terms of use hyperlink on its website put nguyen on constructive notice of the arbitration agreement.barnes noble contends that this notice,combined with nguyen subsequent use of the website,was enough to bind him to the terms of use.the district court disagreed,and barnes noble now appeals.

iii.discussion 
the faa,et,requires federal district courts to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration of claims covered by a written and enforceable arbitration agreement.id.the faa limits the district court role to determining whether a valid arbitration agreement exists,and whether the agreement encompasses the disputes at issue.see chiron ortho diagnostic,cir.the parties do not quarrel that barnes noble arbitration agreement,should it be found enforceable,encompasses nguyen claims.the only issue is whether a valid arbitration agreement exists.
in determining whether a valid arbitration agreement exists,federal courts apply ordinary state law principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan.federal courts sitting in diversity look to the law of the forum state here,california when making choice of law determinations.hoffman citibank,n,cir per curiam.under california law,the parties choice of law will govern unless section of the restatement second of conflict of laws dictates a different result.id.
here,the parties agree that the validity of the arbitration agreement is governed by new york law,as specified by the terms of use choice of law provision.but whether the choice of law provision applies depends on whether the parties agreed to be bound by barnes noble terms of use in the first place.as the district court acknowledged in its order,we need not engage in this circular inquiry because both california and new york law dictate the same outcome.thus,in evaluating the validity of barnes noble arbitration agreement,we apply new york law,to the extent possible.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that nguyen did not enter into barnes noble agreement to arbitrate.
