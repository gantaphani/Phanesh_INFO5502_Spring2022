gary grief,an official of the texas lottery commission the commission,appeals the district court denial of his summary judgment motion to dismiss him,on grounds of qualified immunity,as a defendant in the employment retaliation suit filed by shelton charles whom grief fired from his job as a systems analyst with the commission.concluding that the district court correctly determined that,if charles could prove that grief fired him for his speech,charles has alleged an objectively unreasonable violation of his first amendment rights because the speech for which he was putatively fired was entitled to constitutional protection,we affirm in part.but further concluding that we lack jurisdiction to assess whether grief actions were objectively reasonable because the district court determined that there is a genuine fact question as to the real reason for charles termination,his speech or his insubordination,we dismiss in part grief interlocutory appeal of the denial of qualified immunity.
facts proceedings 
charles is an who,in october,sent an to commission officials,including grief,raising concerns about racial discrimination and retaliation against him and other minority employees of the commission.in november,after failing to receive a response,charles that,this time directing it to members of the texas legislature with oversight authority over the commission.additionally,charles sent a new to these same members of the legislature alleging,inter alia,violations of the texas open records act,misuse of state funds,and other misconduct by commission management.two days later,grief directed charles to meet with his immediate supervisor and a human resources manager to answer questions regarding the.when those two began to question charles about the,he requested that the commission questions be put in writing so that he could respond in writing.according to allegations by charles,one of the representatives of the commission agreed to do so but later that same day,grief appeared unannounced in charles office and fired him on the spot.grief handed charles a written statement to the effect that he was being fired for insubordination,specifically for his refusal to respond to the direct requests from his immediate supervisor.
after charles sued grief and the commission for employment retaliation in violation of charles constitutional right of free speech,grief sought dismissal as a defendant on grounds of qualified immunity,which the district court denied,largely on the basis of a magistrate judge report and recommendation.like the magistrate judge,the district court concluded that charles had introduced summary judgment evidence that,when viewed in the light most favorable to him as the nonmovant,was sufficient to establish that charles acts were protected by clearly established first amendment law and grief acts were objectively unreasonable.
grief timely filed a notice of appeal,challenging the district court order that denied him qualified immunity,specifically the court conclusion that charles had alleged a violation of a constitutional right.in his appeal from the denial of qualified immunity,grief insists that his firing of charles was objectively reasonable because he was responding to reports of charles insubordination,not to his speech.alternatively,grief advances that charles speech is not protected because his are too vague,conclusory,and to involve matters of public concern,and his speech was made in the context of his employment as a commission employee,and therefore,pursuant to garcetti ceballos,is not protected 
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
although a denial of a defendant motion for summary judgment is ordinarily not immediately appealable,the supreme court has held that the denial of a motion for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review.our jurisdiction is significantly limited,however,for it extends to such appeals only to the extent that the denial of summary judgment turns on an issue of law.
o fficials enjoy qualified immunity to the extent that their conduct is objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.whenever the district court denies an official motion for summary judgment predicated upon qualified immunity,the district court can be thought of as making two distinct determinations,even if only implicitly.first,the district court decides that a certain course of conduct would,as a matter of law,be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.second,the court decides that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendant s did,in fact,engage in such conduct.according to the supreme court,as well as our own precedents,we lack jurisdiction to review conclusions of the second type on interlocutory appeal.stated differently,in an interlocutory appeal we can not challenge the district court assessments regarding the sufficiency of the is,the question whether there is enough evidence in the record for a jury to conclude that certain facts are true.we do,however,have jurisdiction to review the first type of determination,the purely legal question whether a given course of conduct would be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.
qualified immunity 
to determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity,the court asks whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right,and whether the defendant conduct was objectively reasonable in light of the clearly established law at the time of the incident.
terminating an employee for engaging in protected speech,of which charles accuses grief,is an objectively unreasonable violation of such an employee first amendment rights.grief,though,insists that charles did not engage in protected speech,but even if he did,grief actions were objectively reasonable because he fired charles,not for his speech,but for his insubordination when he refused to respond to the commission questions unless they were put in writing.
whether charles engaged in protected speech is a purely legal question over which we have appellate jurisdiction we do not,however,have jurisdiction to review grief contention that his actions in firing charles were objectively reasonable.whether grief actions were reasonable depends on his real reason for firing charles and the district court determined that charles had introduced sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to causation,whether he was fired for being insubordinate as grief maintains,or his speech as charles insists to the extent that grief attacks the district court determination of the genuineness,rather than the materiality,of any dispute concerning charles factual assertions,the appellate court may not consider his argument at this juncture.
protected speech 
public employees do not surrender all their free speech rights by reason of their employment.rather,the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen on matters of public concern.a public employee speech is protected by the first amendment when the interests of the worker as a citizen commenting upon matters of public concern outweigh the interests of the state as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the services it performs through its employees.
garcetti ceballos 
before proceeding to examine the substance of charles speech,we must first focus on his role when he uttered it.emphasizing the distinction between a speaker acting in her role as citizen and her role as employee,garcetti held that the first amendment does not protect expressions made pursuant to the employee official duties.even if the speech is of great social importance,it is not protected by the first amendment so long as it was made pursuant to the worker official duties.stated differently,when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.
