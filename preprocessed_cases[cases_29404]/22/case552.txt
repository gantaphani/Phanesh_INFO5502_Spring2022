giberson appeals from the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence of child pornography found on his personal computer,which led to his conviction for receipt of child pornography in violation of a and possession of child pornography in violation of a b.he also appeals from his sentence,arguing the district court erred in sentencing him for both possession and receipt of child pornography.we have jurisdiction under and a.we affirm his conviction,vacate his sentence,and remand.
on february,a north las vegas police department officer stopped giberson because his license plates had expired.during the stop,the officer discovered that giberson had a false nevada identification card in the name of charles walsh,iii.after learning that giberson had three outstanding arrest warrants for traffic violations and no valid driver license,the officer arrested giberson.a search incident to the arrest revealed a play cash card from a casino in walsh name.giberson told the officer that he used the fake for work and to avoid paying his child support obligation.
united states health and human services hhs agent david kiesow began an investigation into giberson child support obligations and discovered that,in,a minnesota state court had ordered giberson to make monthly payments to his for the support of their two children.ironically,giberson,who at one point had served as deputy commissioner of the minnesota department of human services and had supervised the child support enforcement division,failed to make the required payments and,as of july,was behind.law enforcement efforts to collect giberson child support arrearage had been unsuccessful.
as a result of this investigation,agent kiesow obtained a warrant to search giberson residence in nevada.the search warrant authorized hhs agents to search for records or documents that appear to show ownership of assets or property records or documents from financial institutions in giberson name or the names of any known or unknown aliases records and correspondence relating to identification cards records,documents or correspondence related to the use or attempted use of other individual identities correspondence,records and documents relating to giberson or his aliases earnings and employment tax records documents or records showing receipt of income or expenditure of funds and records referring to giberson employer.prior to executing the warrant,agent kiesow had no evidence that giberson owned a computer or used a computer in the commission of his suspected crimes.
on september,the day after they obtained the warrant,hhs agents searched giberson home.in one of the bedrooms,they discovered a personal computer.the computer was on a desk and was connected to a printer that was on an adjacent dresser.next to the printer,on the dresser,the agents found a sheet of what appeared to be fake nevada cards.the agents observed that the cards were not high quality and looked like they could have been printed from the adjacent printer.on the desk with the computer,agents found transparencies depicting the nevada state seal.in the drawers of the computer desk,on the desk,and on the dresser next to the desk,they found a number of other documents evidencing the production of false,including fake social security cards and state of new york birth certificates in the name of charles walsh iii,one of giberson known aliases,and in other names.
believing that many of the materials had been printed off of giberson computer,agent kiesow contacted an assistant attorney,who advised him to secure the computer until the agents could obtain a search warrant for it.kiesow then sent the computer to a forensics laboratory in chicago.there,hhs forensic computer specialist david rehms made a mirror image of the computer hard drive before shipping the computer back to giberson wife in nevada.
on september,kiesow obtained a second search warrant.the second warrant authorized a search of the mirror image of giberson hard drive for records relating to cards or the creation of cards,including driver licenses,state seals,and pictures of individuals that might be placed on cards,as well as records related to giberson assets,property,employment,and income.
the next day,computer specialist rehms began his search of the mirror image using a law enforcement utility software package called ilook.ilook pulls computer files based on file type,and dumps all similar file types into separate folders.for example,ilook retrieves all graphics or images files and puts them into one folder.an analyst can then open that folder and view multiple thumbnails versions of the images on the computer screen at one time without opening individual files.in this case,after sorting the computer files with ilook,rehms used another software package to view the files because it enabled him to view more thumbnails of graphic images on the screen at a time,making his search more efficient.
while rehms was scanning the thumbnail images for images and photographs related to the production of fake,he discovered images he believed to be child pornography.rehms immediately stopped his search and telephoned agent kiesow,who directed rehms to stop his search while kiesow determined the proper course of action.either later that day or the next day,kiesow telephoned rehms and told him to continue searching for the items in the search warrant,but that,if rehms came across more child pornography,he was to print it out.however,rehms did not specifically search for child pornography.he continued his search for items related to fake,and as he came across images of child pornography,he printed out a sampling.rehms also found images related to the production of fake and seals for the state of nevada.
following rehms discovery,kiesow contacted fbi special agent andrew gruninger,who obtained a search warrant to search the mirror image of giberson hard drive.a subsequent forensic search of the hard drive pursuant to the third warrant revealed more than images of child pornography.
giberson was indicted on july,and charged with receiving child pornography in violation of a and possessing child pornography in violation of a b.in november,giberson filed a motion to suppress evidence,arguing that law enforcement officers exceeded the scope of the first search warrant when they seized his computer,and that they exceeded the scope of the second search warrant when they searched for child pornography on the computer.after an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied.the district court,after receiving objections to the magistrate judge recommendation and hearing oral argument,accepted the recommendation and denied giberson motion to suppress.
later,giberson entered conditional guilty pleas to both counts in the indictment.the district court sentenced giberson to concurrent terms of sixty months on each of the two counts,to be followed by three years of supervised release on count one,concurrent with a life term of supervision on count two.giberson appealed,arguing the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress and in failing to merge the counts of conviction at sentencing.
giberson challenges the seizure of his computer pursuant to the first search warrant and the search of the mirror image of his hard drive pursuant to the second search warrant,arguing the evidence of child pornography obtained from the seizure and subsequent search should have been suppressed.we review the district court denial of his motion to suppress de novo and the district court underlying factual findings for clear error.united states summers,cir.
the fourth amendment provides that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.generally,in a search made pursuant to a warrant,only specifically enumerated items may be seized.see united states tamura,cir.
one issue we can put to the side.giberson brief twice states that t he warrant was not specific enough.his argument,however,seems limited to the claim that the warrant did not specify the computer and the computer was therefore unlawfully seized he does not suggest that the warrant itself failed to specifically describe items to be seized and was therefore facially invalid.in any event,the warrant was based on probable cause and clearly limited the types of documents and records that were seizable,objectively describ ing the items to be searched and seized with adequate specificity and sufficiently restrict ing the discretion of agents executing the search.see united states adjani,cir.the warrant also described the items to be searched and seized as particularly as could be reasonably expected given the nature of the crime and the evidence the government then possessed.see id.at.thus,the warrant was not a general warrant and was not facially invalid under united states spilotro,cir.
giberson does argue that,because the first search warrant did not specify that the officers could search or seize a computer,the seizure of his computer exceeded the scope of the warrant.the question,then,is whether a warrant that describes particular documents authorizes the seizure of a computer where,as here,the searching agents reasonably believed that documents specified in the warrant would be found stored in the computer.
we have long held that a search warrant authorizing the seizure of materials also authorizes the search of objects that could contain those materials.in united states,officers were conducting a search pursuant to a warrant authorizing the seizure of b ooks,papers,records,receipts,documents,notations,diaries,journals or ledgers related to the defendant unlawful business dealings,fn.cir.during the search,officers found a locked briefcase and a microcassette tape.id.after the defendant refused to open the briefcase,the officers cut it open and seized its contents,which included cocaine.id.the microcassette tape contained incriminating statements about the defendant.id.
the defendant challenged the search,arguing that the search and seizure of the briefcase,the microcassette,and their contents were not permitted because they were not particularly described in the warrant.id.at.we rejected that argument,reasoning 
the search and seizure of both the microcassette and the briefcase were proper.it is axiomatic that if a warrant sufficiently describes the premises to be searched,this will justify a search of the personal effects therein belonging to the person occupying the premises if those effects might contain the items described in the warrant.
id.because the briefcase would be a logical container for many of the items described in the warrant,and the microcassette tape is by its very nature a device for recording information which come s clearly within the specific authority of the warrant,we held that the failure of the warrant to anticipate the precise container in which the material sought might be found was not fatal.id.at.
later,in united states reyes,we reaffirmed this principle,holding that a search warrant authorizing the seizure of drug trafficking records,ledgers,or writings related to drug trafficking also permitted agents to seize a cassette tape,cir.we recognized that,in the age of modern technology and commercial availability of various forms of items,the warrant could not be expected to describe with exactitude the precise form the records would take,and that,the seizure of a specific item characteristic of a generic class of items items that record information defined in the warrant did not constitute an impermissible general search.id.
computers,like briefcases and cassette tapes,can be repositories for documents and records.we have not yet had occasion to determine,in an opinion,whether computers are an exception to the general principle that a warrant authorizing the seizure of particular documents also authorizes the search of a container likely to contain those documents.we hold that,in this case,where there was ample evidence that the documents authorized in the warrant could be found on giberson computer,the officers did not exceed the scope of the warrant when they seized the computer.
giberson does not deny that it was reasonable in this case for the agents to believe that the documents specified in the warrant might be found on his computer.rather,he argues that the analogy between a computer and other containers is not appropriate because computers are somehow entitled to heightened protection,and are searchable only when specified in the warrant.we observe at the outset that fourth amendment exceptions and distinctions based solely on a type of technology are unwise and inconsistent with the fourth amendment.see kyllo united states,d stevens,dissenting.technology changes.to be acceptable,giberson argument must be based on a principle that is not.though giberson offers several rationales for treating computers differently from storage mediums such as filing cabinets and briefcases,none is persuasive.
giberson principal argument is that computers are able to store massive quantities of intangible,digitally stored information,distinguishing them from ordinary storage containers.but neither the quantity of information,nor the form in which it is stored,is legally relevant in the fourth amendment context.while it is true that computers can store a large amount of material,there is no reason why officers should be permitted to search a room full of filing cabinets or even a person library for documents listed in a warrant but should not be able to search a computer.giberson purported exception would also create problems in analyzing devices with similar storage capacities.if we permit cassette tapes to be searched,then do we permit cds,even though they hold more information if we do not permit computers to be searched,what about a usb flash drive or other external storage device giberson purported exception provides no answers to these questions.
similarly,attempting to limit fourth amendment searches based on the format of stored information would be arbitrary.we have already held that microcassettes,which store data differently from traditional paper,are seizable in a search for records.see,at.there is no reason why material stored digitally on a computer should not also be searchable.once again,giberson purported exception generates more questions than answers if we permit a person to be searched,what about one blackberry the format of a record or document should not be dispositive to a fourth amendment inquiry.
giberson purported rule creates a brightline exception to the fourth amendment that provides no principles by which to evaluate whether a search is reasonable.the supreme court has consistently eschewed such brightline rules.see ohio robinette,d.here,the only principle upon which we can anchor this analysis is the one already articulated by this court that to search a container,it must be reasonable to expect that the items enumerated in the search warrant could be found therein.if it is reasonable to believe that a computer contains items enumerated in the warrant,officers may search it.here,numerous documents related to the production of fake were found in and around giberson computer and were arguably created on and printed from it.it was therefore reasonable for officers to believe that the items they were authorized to seize would be found in the computer,and they acted within the scope of the warrant when they secured the computer.
giberson offers two other bases upon which to distinguish computers from other objects in the fourth amendment context.first,he argues that computers have a great potential for the intermingling of relevant and irrelevant and personal and private material.indeed,a court has recognized that b ecause computers can hold so much information touching on many different areas of a person life,there is a greater potential for the intermingling of documents and a consequent invasion of privacy when police execute a search for evidence on a computer.united states walser,cir.however,we have already rejected this reasoning in adjani,when we pointed out that t he fear that agents searching a computer may come across personal information can not alone serve as the
