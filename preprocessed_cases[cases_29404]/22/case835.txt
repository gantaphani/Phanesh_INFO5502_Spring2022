here,we hold that when a city employee uses a personal account to communicate about the conduct of public business,the writings may be subject to disclosure under the california public records act cpra or act we overturn the contrary judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
in june,petitioner ted smith requested disclosure of categories of public records from the city of san jose,its redevelopment agency and the agency executive director,along with certain other elected officials and their staffs the targeted documents concerned redevelopment efforts in downtown san jose and included emails and text messages sent or received on private electronic devices used by the mayor,two city council members,and their staffs.the city disclosed communications made using city telephone numbers and email accounts but did not disclose communications made using the individuals personal accounts.
smith sued for declaratory relief,arguing cpra definition of public records encompasses all communications about official business,regardless of how they are created,communicated,or stored.the city responded that messages communicated through personal accounts are not public records because they are not within the public entity custody or control.the trial court granted summary judgment for smith and ordered disclosure,but the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate.at present,no documents from employees personal accounts have been collected or disclosed.
ii.discussion 
this case concerns how laws,originally designed to cover paper documents,apply to evolving methods of electronic communication.it requires recognition that,in today environment,not all activity occurs during a conventional workday,or in an workplace.
enacted in,cpra declares that access to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.in,voters made this principle part of our constitution.a provision added by proposition states the people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people business,and,therefore,the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.cal,art.i,subd.b.public access laws serve a crucial function.openness in government is essential to the functioning of a democracy.implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be accountable for its actions.in order to verify accountability,individuals must have access to government files.such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.international federation of professional and technical engineers,local,superior court cal th,international federation.
however,public access to information must sometimes yield to personal privacy interests.when enacting cpra,the legislature was mindful of the right to privacy,and set out multiple exemptions designed to protect that right.commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,commission on peace officer standards see.similarly,while the constitution provides for public access,it does not supersede or modify existing privacy rights.cal,art.i,subd.b.
cpra and the constitution strike a careful balance between public access and personal privacy.this case concerns how that balance is served when documents concerning official business are created or stored outside the workplace.the issue is a narrow one are writings concerning the conduct of public business beyond cpra reach merely because they were sent or received using a nongovernmental account considering the statute language and the important policy interests it serves,the answer is no.employees communications about official agency business may be subject to cpra regardless of the type of account used in their preparation or transmission.
statutory language,broadly construed,supports public access 
cpra establishes a basic rule requiring disclosure of public records upon request.in general,it creates a presumptive right of access to any record created or maintained by a public agency that relates in any way to the business of the public agency.sander state bar of california cal th,italics added.every such record must be disclosed unless a statutory exception is shown.ibid.section sets out a variety of exemptions,many of which are designed to protect individual privacy.international federation,supra,cal th at.the act also includes a catchall provision exempting disclosure if the public interest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure,subd.a.
when we interpret a statute,o ur fundamental task is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we first examine the statutory language,giving it a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not examine that language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.if the language is clear,courts must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.citation.furthermore,we consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.sierra club superior court cal th.
in cpra cases,this standard approach to statutory interpretation is augmented by a constitutional imperative.see sierra club superior court,supra,cal th at.proposition amended the constitution to provide a statute,court rule,or other authority,including those in effect on the effective date of this subdivision,shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people right of access,and narrowly construed if it limits the right of access.cal,art.i,subd.b,italics added.given the strong public policy of the people right to information concerning the people business code,and the constitutional mandate to construe statutes limiting the right of access narrowly cal,art.i,subd.b,all public records are subject to disclosure unless the legislature has expressly provided to the contrary.sierra club,at.
we begin with the term public record,which cpra defines to include any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics,subd.e hereafter public records definition.under this definition,a public record has four aspects.it is a writing,with content relating to the conduct of the public business,which is prepared by,or owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency.
cpra defines a writing as any handwriting,typewriting,printing,photostating,photographing,photocopying,transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile,and every other means of recording upon any tangible thing any form of communication or representation,including letters,words,pictures,sounds,or symbols,or combinations thereof,and any record thereby created,regardless of the manner in which the record has been stored,subd.g.it is undisputed that the items at issue here constitute writings.
in,creating a writing could be a fairly involved process.typically,a person would use an implement to type,or record words longhand,or would dictate to someone else who would write or type a document.writings were generally made on paper or some other tangible medium.these writings were physically identifiable and could be retrieved by examining the physical repositories where they were stored.writings exchanged with people outside the agency were generally sent,on paper,through the mail or by courier.in part because of the time required for their preparation,such writings were fairly formal and focused on the business at hand.
today,these tangible,if laborious,writing methods have been enhanced by electronic communication.email,text messaging,and other electronic platforms,permit writings to be prepared,exchanged,and stored more quickly and easily.however,the ease and immediacy of electronic communication has encouraged a commonplace tendency to share fleeting thoughts and random bits of information,with varying degrees of import,often to broad audiences.as a result,the line between an official communication and an electronic aside is now sometimes blurred.the second aspect of cpra public records definition establishes a framework to distinguish between and purely private communications.
relating to the conduct of the public business 
the overall structure of cpra,with its many exemptions,makes clear that not everything written by a public employee is subject to review and disclosure.to qualify as a public record,a writing must contain information relating to the conduct of the public business,subd.e.generally,any record kept by an officer because it is necessary or convenient to the discharge of his official duty is a public record.braun city of taft d,see people purcell d.
whether a writing is sufficiently related to public business will not always be clear.for example,depending on the context,an email to a spouse complaining my coworker is an idiot would likely not be a public record.conversely,an email to a superior reporting the coworker mismanagement of an agency project might well be.resolution of the question,particularly when writings are kept in personal accounts,will often involve an examination of several factors,including the content itself the context in,or purpose for which,it was written the audience to whom it was directed and whether the writing was prepared by an employee acting or purporting to act within the scope of his or her employment.here,the city claimed all communications in personal accounts are beyond the reach of cpra.as a result,the content of specific records is not before us.any disputes over this aspect of the public records definition await resolution in future proceedings.
we clarify,however,that to qualify as a public record under cpra,at a minimum,a writing must relate in some substantive way to the conduct of the public business.this standard,though broad,is not so elastic as to include every piece of information the public may find interesting.communications that are primarily personal,containing no more than incidental mentions of agency business,generally will not constitute public records.for example,the public might be titillated to learn that not all agency workers enjoy the company of their colleagues,or hold them in high regard.however,an employee electronic musings about a colleague personal shortcomings will often fall far short of being a writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business,subd.e.
coronado police officers carroll th demonstrates the intricacy of determining whether a writing is related to public business.there,police officers sought access to a database of impeachment material compiled by public defenders.the attorneys contributed to the database and used its contents in their work.id.at.however,their representation of individual clients,though paid for by a public entity,was considered under case law to be essentially a private function.id.at see polk county dodson.accordingly,the coronado court concluded the database did not relate to public business and thus was not a public record.id.at.the court was careful to note that not all documents related to the database were private,however.documents reflecting policy decisions about whether and how to maintain the database might well relate to public business,rather than the representation of individual clients.id.at.content of that kind would constitute public records.ibid.
prepared by any state or local agency 
the city focuses its challenge on the final portion of the public records definition,which requires that writings be prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency,section e.the city argues this language does not encompass communications agency employees make through their personal accounts.however,the broad construction mandated by the constitution supports disclosure.
a writing is commonly understood to have been prepared by the person who wrote it.if an agency employee prepares a writing that substantively relates to the conduct of public business,that writing would appear to satisfy the act definition of a public record.the city urges a contrary conclusion when the writing is transmitted through a personal account.in focusing its attention on the owned,used,or retained by aspect of the public records definition,however,it ignores the prepared by aspect,subd.e.this approach fails to give significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of the act.sierra club superior court,supra,cal th at.
the city draws its conclusion by comparing the act definitions of local and state agency.under cpra,local agency includes a county city,whether general law or chartered city and county school district municipal corporation district political subdivision or any board,commission or agency thereof other local public agency or entities that are legislative bodies of a local agency pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section,subd.a,italics added.the city points out that this definition does not specifically include individual government officials or staff members,whereas individuals are specifically mentioned in cpra definition of state agency.according to that definition,state agency means every state office,officer,department,division,bureau,board,and commission or other state body or agency,except those agencies provided for in article iv except section thereof or article vi of the california constitution,subd.f,italics added.the city contends this difference shows the legislature intended to exclude individuals from the local agency definition.if a local agency does not encompass individual officers and employees,it argues,only writings accessible to the agency as a whole are public records.this interpretation is flawed for a number of reasons.
the city narrow reading of cpra local agency definition is inconsistent with the constitutional directive of broad interpretation.cal,art.i,subd.b see sierra club superior court,supra,cal th at.broadly construed,the term local agency logically includes not just the discrete governmental entities listed in section,subdivision a but also the individual officials and staff members who conduct the agencies affairs.it is well established that a governmental entity,like a corporation,can act only through its individual officers and employees.suezaki superior court cal d,alvarez felker d,see united states dotterweich,reno baird cal th.a disembodied governmental agency can not prepare,own,use,or retain any record.only the human beings who serve in agencies can do these things.when employees are conducting agency business,they are working for the agency and on its behalf.see,cal.of health facilities of health services cal th,competitive enterprise institute office of science technology policy cir,reaching the same conclusion for federal foia requests.we presume the legislature was aware of these settled principles.see people superior court zamudio cal th.a writing prepared by a public employee conducting agency business has been prepared by the agency within the meaning of section,subdivision e,even if the writing is prepared using the employee personal account.
the city also fails to explain how its proposed requirement that a public record be accessible to the agency as a whole could be practically interpreted.even when documents were stored in filing cabinets or ledgers,many writings would not have been considered accessible to all agency employees,regardless of their level of responsibility or involvement in a particular project.
moreover,although employees are not specifically mentioned in the local agency definition,nothing in the statutory language indicates the legislature meant to exclude these individuals from cpra obligations.the city argues the omission of the word officer from the local agency definition reflects a legislative intent that cpra apply to individuals who work in state agencies but not employees in local government.the city offers no reason why the legislature would draw such an arbitrary distinction.if it intended to impose different disclosure obligations on state and local agencies,one would expect to find this difference highlighted throughout the statutory scheme,particularly when the obligations relate to a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.yet there is no mention of such an intent anywhere in the act.indeed,under the city logic,cpra obligations would potentially extend only to state officers,not necessarily state employees.the distinction between tenured public officers and those who hold public employment has long been recognized.see in re cal th.considering cpra goal of promoting public access,it would have been odd for the legislature to establish different rules for different levels of state employment.contrary to the city view,it seems more plausible that the reference to every state officer in the state agency definition,subd.f was meant to extend cpra obligations to elected state officers,such as the governor,treasurer,or secretary of state,who are not part of a collective governmental body nor generally considered employees of a state agency 
the city position is further undermined by another cpra provision,which indicates that public records can be held by individual officials and need not belong to an agency as a whole.when it is alleged that public records have been improperly withheld,section,subdivision a directs that the court shall order the officer or person charged with withholding the records to disclose the records or show cause why they should not be produced.if the court concludes the public official decision to refuse disclosure is not justified,it can order the public official to make the record public,subd.b.if the court finds that the public official was justified in refusing disclosure,it must return the item to the public official without disclosing its content.ibid.the legislature repeated use of the singular word official in section indicates an awareness that an individual may possess materials that qualify as public records.moreover,the broad term public official encompasses officials in state and local agencies,signifying that cpra disclosure obligations apply to individuals working in both levels of government.
owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency 
cpra encompasses writings prepared by an agency but also writings it owns,uses,or retains,regardless of authorship.obviously,an agency engaged in the conduct of public business will use and retain a variety of writings related to that business,including those prepared by people outside the agency.these final two factors of the public records definition,use and retention,thus reflect the variety of ways an agency can possess writings used to conduct public business.
as to retention,the city argues public records include only materials in an agency possession or directly accessible to the agency.citing statutory arguments and cases limiting the duty to obtain and disclose documents possessed by others,the city contends writings held in an employee personal account are beyond an agency reach and fall outside cpra.the argument fails.
appellate courts have generally concluded records related to public business are subject to disclosure if they are in an agency actual or constructive possession.see,board of pilot comrs.for the bays of san francisco,san pablo and suisun superior court th,consolidated irrigation dist.superior court th,consolidated irrigation.a n agency has constructive possession of records if it has the right to control the records,either directly or through another person.consolidated irrigation,at.for example,in consolidated irrigation,a city did not have constructive possession of documents in files maintained by subconsultants who prepared portions of an environmental impact report because the city had no contractual right to control the subconsultants or their files.id.at.by contrast,a city had a cpra duty to disclose a consultant field survey records because the city had a contractual ownership interest and right to possess this material.see community youth athletic center city of national city th,community youth.
an agency actual or constructive possession of records is relevant in determining whether it has an obligation to search for,collect,and disclose the material requested.see,subd.c.it is a separate and more fundamental question whether a document located outside an agency walls,or servers,is sufficiently owned,used,or retained by the agency so as to constitute a public record.see,subd.e.in construing foia,federal courts have remarked that an agency public records do not lose their agency character just because the official who possesses them takes them out the door.competitive enterprise institute office of science and technology policy,supra,at.we likewise hold that documents otherwise meeting cpra definition of public records do not lose this status because they are located in an employee personal account.a writing retained by a public employee conducting agency business has been retained by the agency within the meaning of section,subdivision e,even if the writing is retained in the employee personal account.
the city argues various cpra provisions run counter to this conclusion.first,the city cites section,which provides that a state or local agency may not transfer a public record to a private entity in a manner that prevents the agency from providing the record directly pursuant to this chapter.italics added.taking the italicized language out of context,the city argues that public records are only those an agency is able to access directly.but this strained interpretation sets legislative intent on its head.the statute clear purpose is to prevent an agency from evading its disclosure duty by transferring custody of a record to a private holder and then arguing the record falls outside cpra because it is no longer in the agency possession.furthermore,section does not purport to excuse agencies from obtaining public records in the possession of their own employees.it simply prohibits agencies from attempting to evade cpra by transferring public records to an intermediary not bound by the act disclosure requirements.
next,the city relies on section,subdivision a,which states that an agency must make a public record available in any electronic format in which it holds the information italics added,and on section,subdivision a,which requires that public records be available for inspection during office hours.these provisions do not assist the city.they merely address the mechanics of how public records must be disclosed.they do not purport to define or limit what constitutes a public record in the first place.moreover,to say that only public records in the possession of the agency,subd.c must be disclosed begs the question of whether the term agency includes individual officers and employees.we have concluded it does.
under the city interpretation of cpra,a document concerning official business is only a public record if it is located on a government agency computer servers or in its offices.indirect access,through the agency employees,is not sufficient in the city view.however,we have previously stressed that a document status as public or confidential does not turn on the arbitrary circumstance of where the document is located.
in commission on peace officer standards,supra,cal th at pages to,a state agency argued certain employment information was exempt from disclosure under cpra because it had been placed in confidential personnel files.in considering a penal code provision that deems peace officer personnel records confidential,we rejected an interpretation that made confidentiality turn on the type of file in which records are located,finding it unlikely the legislature intended to render documents confidential based on their location,rather than their content.commission,at.although we made this observation in analyzing the scope of a cpra exemption,the same logic applies to the act definition of what constitutes a public record in t
