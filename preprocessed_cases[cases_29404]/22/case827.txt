use of social media,in its myriad of forms,has become ubiquitous in our society.petitioners facebook,facebook,instagram,llc instagram,and twitter,twitter each provide digital platforms on which users may post communications,commentary,photographs,video clips,or other items the user may wish to share within a social network.evidence gathered from social media is becoming equally ubiquitous in our courtrooms.real parties in interest derrick hunter and lee sullivan defendants were indicted,and await trial,on murder,weapons,and charges stemming from a shooting.each of the defendants served a subpoena duces tecum on one or more of the petitioners seeking both public and private content from user accounts of the murder victim and a witness.
petitioners moved to quash the subpoenas,objecting under the federal stored communications act sca or act et to the compelled disclosure of the content of their users electronic communications.section a provides that electronic communication services shall not knowingly divulge the contents of a user communication to anyone,with limited exceptions b.defendants responded that the requested information is necessary to properly defend against the pending charges,and that any statutory privacy protections afforded a social media user must yield to a criminal defendant constitutional rights to due process,presentation of a complete defense,and effective assistance of counsel 
the trial court denied petitioners motions to quash and ordered petitioners to produce responsive material for in camera review.petitioners filed the instant petition for writ of mandate prohibition in this court.we issued an order staying the production order and requested opposition.after consideration of defendants answer,and petitioners reply thereto,we denied defendants request to dissolve the temporary stay and issued an order requiring the respondent superior court to show cause why the relief requested by petitioners should not be granted.we now grant the petition and direct the trial court to issue an order quashing the subpoenas.
f actual context and procedural history 
on june,jaquan rice,was killed and,a minor,was seriously injured in a shooting in the bayview district of san francisco.the vehicle used in the shooting was identified by surveillance video.while of poor quality,the video depicts one individual shooting a handgun from the rear passenger window on the driver side.a second individual is seen exiting the rear door and shooting from behind the rear of the vehicle with a handgun with a large attached magazine.the driver of the vehicle was not visible,but witnesses indicated that a woman was driving.within minutes of the shooting,prosecution witness renesha lee was stopped driving the vehicle.she was the sole occupant.
hunter year old brother was identified by several eyewitness as one of the shooters,and he confessed to the shooting when questioned by police hunter brother told police that he shot rice because rice had repeatedly threatened him in person and in social media postings on facebook and instagram.rice also had tagged the boy in a video clip posted on instagram that depicted guns.
lee is sullivan former girlfriend.lee gave varying accounts of the events of june,but ultimately told police that defendants and hunter brother borrowed her car and took her home prior to the shooting.
in presenting the case to the grand jury,the prosecution contended that defendants and hunter brother were members of big block,a criminal street gang,and that rice was killed because he was a member of west mob,a rival gang,and because rice had publicly threatened hunter brother.in testimony before the grand jury,inspector leonard broberg,a gang expert from the san francisco police department gang task force,opined that the murder and attempted murder were committed for the benefit of big block.broberg testified that gangsters are now in the century and they have taken on a new aspect of being gangbangers,and they do something called cyber banging.they will actually be gangsters on the internet.they will issue challenges will show signs of disrespect,whether it via images or whether it via the written word facebook,instagram,socialcam,vine.they will disrespect each other in cyberspace.broberg described for the grand jury a video posted by rice on facebook in which he rapped while giving a tour of his gang neighborhood and pointed out areas where he could be found if rival gang members wanted to find him,including the location where rice was shot.in a subsequent declaration,broberg averred that he rel ies heavily on records from social media providers such as facebook,instagram,and twitter to investigate and prosecute alleged gang members for gang crime.broberg said that he regularly relied on social media records in forming an opinion whether a particular crime is gang related.broberg also said he relied,in part,on social media records as evidence that rice and the defendants were members of rival gangs and that the shooting was gang related.
defendants were indicted and stand charged with,inter alia,the murder of rice and the attempted murder of.gang and firearm enhancements are alleged as to both defendants in the indictment,subd.b,subd.a,subds.d e.
sullivan counsel served subpoenas duces tecum,subd.b on facebook,instagram,and twitter,seeking records from the social media accounts of rice and lee.as to facebook,the subpoena seeks a ny and all public and private content,including,but not limited to user information,associated email addresses,photographs,videos,private messages,activity logs,posts,status updates,location data,and comments including information deleted by the account holder for accounts belonging to rice and to lee.as to instagram,the subpoena seeks a ny and all public and private content,including,but not limited to user information,associated email addresses,photographs,videos,private messages,activity logs,posts,location data,and comments,as well as data deleted by the account holder associated with accounts belonging to rice and lee.sullivan subpoena to twitter seeks similar information as to lee only.hunter subpoena to twitter seeks a subset of that information for all accounts registered to lee.sullivan subpoenas also seek the identity of the custodian of records for petitioners who could authenticate the requested records.
petitioners moved to quash the subpoenas,arguing that disclosure of the information sought was barred by the sca.defendants opposed,contending that their constitutional rights to present a complete defense,witnesses,and a fair trial prevailed over the privacy rights of account holders under the sca.in an offer of proof as to lee social media records,sullivan alleged that lee was the only witness who implicated him in the shootings,that the records would demonstrate lee was motivated by jealous rage over sullivan involvement with other women,and that lee had repeatedly threatened others with violence.sullivan cited examples of postings on what he said was lee twitter account that included a photograph of lee holding a gun and making specific threats.in his offer of proof as to rice social media records,sullivan said review of the records was required to locate exculpatory evidence and to confront and broberg.sullivan cited broberg grand jury testimony and attached examples to his opposition of what he alleged were screen shots of violent video postings by rice,asserting that the subpoenaed records would show that rice was a violent criminal who routinely posted rap videos and other posts threatening hunter brother and other individuals.
hearings on the motions to quash were held on january and.the trial court denied petitioners motions to quash,and ordered petitioners to produce responsive material for an in camera review by february petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court contending that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion to quash,and seeking a stay of the order to produce the requested materials.on february,we stayed the production order pending consideration of the petition and requested opposition.sullivan submitted an answer,in which hunter joined.on march,we issued an order to show cause to the respondent superior court why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted,and we declined defendants request to dissolve the stay.sullivan filed a return to the order to show cause,in which hunter joined,and to which petitioners filed a reply

in the criminal context,the sca provides for disclosure of the content of an electronic communication to a governmental agency,without notice to the subscriber or customer,only pursuant to a warrant issued using the procedures described in the federal rules of criminal procedure or,in the case of a state court,issued using state warrant procedures by a court of competent jurisdiction.a,b a.disclosure of the communication content may also be compelled by a governmental entity,with notice to the subscriber by administrative subpoena authorized by a federal or state statute or a federal or state grand jury or trial subpoena b b i or a court order for disclosure only if the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication,or the records or other information sought,are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation d,b b ii.several courts have recognized that users have a fourth amendment reasonable expectation of privacy in electronic communications that are stored with,or sent or received through,a commercial internet service provider and that a warrant,based on probable cause,may be required to obtain communication content.warshak cir,holding the sca unconstitutional to the extent that it would permit the government to obtain the content of the defendant without a warrant see hanna cir,fn.lucas cir.as some forms of communication begin to diminish,the fourth amendment must recognize and protect nascent ones that arise.warshak,at.

defendants insist that,notwithstanding constraints of the sca,the subpoenaed materials are necessary to ensure their right to present a complete defense to the charges against them,and that their fifth amendment guarantee of due process and sixth amendment right to compulsory process are implicated.see holmes south carolina,federal constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.moreover,they argue that their sixth amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel and confrontation of the witnesses against them require that they be given the opportunity to conduct reasonable pretrial investigation of the prosecution case.defendants,and amici curiae,assert that the sca is unconstitutional to the extent that it precludes access by a criminal defendant to information potentially material to his or her defense.we think that defendants overstate the extent of constitutional support for their claims.

sixth amendment 
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution protects both the right of confrontation and the right of compulsory process in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.both clauses are binding on the states under the fourteenth amendment.pointer texas,confrontation clause washington texas,compulsory process clause.
examination 
the confrontation clause provides two types of protections for a criminal defendant the right physically to face those who testify against him,and the right to conduct.pennsylvania ritchie,ritchie,citing delaware fensterer.
in davis alaska,davis,the supreme court found a violation of the confrontation clause in a trial court refusal to allow the defendant to impeach at trial the credibility of a key prosecution witness with the witness probationary status resulting from a juvenile delinquency adjudication.the trial court granted a prosecution protective order,precluding concerning the witness juvenile record,on the basis that the records were confidential under alaska law.id.at fns.noting that the primary interest secured by the right of confrontation is the right of id.at,the supreme court found that the state policy interest in protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile offender record can not require yielding of so vital a constitutional right as the effective for bias of an adverse witness.id.at.
subsequently,in ritchie,the supreme court considered the application of davis to pretrial discovery.while no majority consensus emerged concerning the proper application of the confrontation clause to the pretrial discovery issue presented,four justices expressed the view that the right to confrontation is a trial right ritchie,supra,at plur.opn.of powell,people hammon cal th,hammon.the defendant,ritchie,was convicted of various sexual offenses with his minor daughter.prior to trial,ritchie attempted to subpoena confidential records from a state protective services agency which had investigated the abuse allegations.the agency refused to comply with the subpoena,claiming that the records were privileged under pennsylvania law.ritchie argued that he was entitled to information in the agency file because it might contain the names of favorable witnesses,as well as other,unspecified exculpatory evidence.the trial judge declined to order production.ritchie,at pp.the high court of pennsylvania concluded that ritchie,through his lawyer,was entitled to review the entire file to search for any useful evidence.id.at,fn.omitted.applying a due process analysis,the supreme court majority rejected the idea that a defendant right to discover exculpatory evidence would include unsupervised authority to search through the agency files.ritchie,supra,at see id.at pp.concluding in camera review of agency file sufficient to protect ritchie interests.
a plurality of the supreme court also rejected the view that the trial court interfered with ritchie confrontation clause right of by denying him pretrial access to information he contended was necessary to prepare his defense.id.at.the opinions of this court show that the right to confrontation is a trial right,designed to prevent improper restrictions on the types of questions that defense counsel may ask during and n othing in the case law supports the view that the confrontation clause creates a constitutionally compelled rule of pretrial discovery.id.at.the plurality found that ritchie due process rights were sufficiently protected by in camera review at trial of the confidential files to determine if they contained information material to his defense id.at pp.see weatherford bursey,supra,at,no due process violation in prosecution pretrial failure to reveal identity of undercover informant whose trial testimony was unfavorable to the defendant.
our own supreme court has repeatedly declined to recognize a sixth amendment right to defense pretrial discovery of otherwise privileged or confidential information.in people webb cal th,the defense subpoenaed psychiatric records of a witness in a capital murder case,arguing entitlement to any information in the records affecting the competence or credibility of the witness in order to fairly her.id.at.the trial court conducted in camera review of the records and provided limited disclosure.the defendant,citing ritchie,contended that limited pretrial disclosure of the psychiatric records prejudicially undermined his right to the witness effectively at trial.webb,at.the court refused to read ritchie as broadly as defendant urged,and questioned whether the defendant had any constitutional right to examine the records at all,even if material,in light of the strong policy protecting a patient treatment history.simply stated,it is not clear whether or to what extent the confrontation or compulsory process clauses of the sixth amendment grant pretrial discovery rights to the accused.webb,at pp.
our high court again considered the extent of pretrial defense discovery of otherwise privileged information in hammon,supra,cal th.in that case,the defense served subpoenas duces tecum on psychotherapists who had treated the complaining witness in a sexual molestation case,claiming the records would be necessary to challenge the witness credibility.the trial court granted the people motion to quash the subpoenas.id.at pp.noting the lack of a majority consensus in ritchie on the proper application of the confrontation clause,the hammon court observed that it is not at all clear whether or to what extent the confrontation or compulsory process clauses of the sixth amendment grant pretrial discovery rights to the accused.hammon,at.
in declining to extend a defendant sixth amendment rights of confrontation and to authorize pretrial disclosure of privileged information,our supreme court expressly overruled a series of intermediate appellate cases interpreting davis,supra,to require pretrial disclosure of privileged information when a defendant need for the information outweighed the confidentiality interest.hammon,supra,cal th at.the hammon court found that people reber d permitting pretrial discovery of a complaining witness psychotherapy records and cases following that decision were not correct.hammon,at.in authorizing disclosure before trial reber went farther than davis required,with insufficient justification.hammon,at.we do not see an adequate justification for taking such a long step in a direction the united states supreme court has not gone.id.at.the high court recognized that at trial,a trial court might be called upon to balance a defendant need for and the policies supporting a statutory or constitutional privilege,but also noted that entertaining such requests pretrial when the trial court would not typically have sufficient information to conduct the inquiry presented a serious risk of unnecessary invasion of statutory privilege.ibid.
in alvarado superior court cal th,the trial court issued protective orders in a jail homicide case,permitting the prosecution to withhold the names of witnesses,both pretrial and during testimony at trial.id.at pp.the supreme court found the order valid to the extent it permitted pretrial nondisclosure of the witnesses identities,rejecting the argument that nondisclosure violated the defendants constitutional rights to due process of law and to confront the witnesses against them id.at,see weatherford bursey,supra,at pp.no constitutional violation where prosecution surprised the defendant at trial by calling to the stand a previously undisclosed witness.in people valdez cal th,our high court again approved a trial court order,issued pursuant to penal code section delaying and limiting disclosure of the identities of prosecution witnesses to protect the safety of those witnesses.valdez,at pp.the court again found no authority for any contention that section,insofar as it authorizes the denial of pretrial disclosure based on concerns for witness safety,is unconstitutional under either the confrontation or the due process clause.valdez,at see people maciel cal th,rejecting similar claims by a different defendant regarding the same protective orders.
in sum,there is little,if any,support for defendants claim that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment mandates disclosure of otherwise privileged information for purposes of a defendant pretrial investigation of the prosecution case.
compulsory process 
we find even less support for defendants contention that the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment separately authorizes the trial court order here.the supreme court has had little occasion to discuss the contours of the compulsory process clause.ritchie,supra,at.the cases provide that at a minimum criminal defendants have the right to the government assistance in compelling the attendance of favorable witnesses at trial and the right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.id.at,italics added,citing chambers mississippi,cool united states,and washington texas,supra.the ritchie majority concluded that compulsory process provides no greater protections in this area than those afforded by due process,and that claims such as this are better evaluated under the broader protections of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment addressing the fundamental fairness of trials.ritchie,at.
our own supreme court has rejected a claim that a defendant was denied his sixth amendment right to effective counsel when he was denied access to an fbi database for use in of a prosecution expert,allegedly thereby compromising his right to present a meaningful defense,a fair opportunity to be heard,and the constitutional right to reliable factfinding.people prince cal th.similar to defendants contentions here,prince argued that lack of access to the database depriv ed him of evidence clearly bearing on the credibility of key prosecution witnesses.id.at.finding it unnecessary to address the claim on evidence in the record,the court nevertheless noted that t o the extent defendant claim concerns pretrial discovery and is based upon the confrontation or compulsory process clauses of the sixth amendment,it is on a weak footing.as we have previously observed,in light of the divided views of the justices of the supreme court it is not at all clear whether or to what extent the confrontation or compulsory process clauses of the sixth amendment grant pretrial discovery rights to the accused.prince,at fn.see people clark cal th,rejecting a claim that failure to disclose witness misdemeanor conviction prior to guilt phase of capital trial deprived defendant of compulsory process and confrontation rights,and declining to recognize a sixth amendment violation when a defendant is denied discovery that results in a significant impairment of his ability to investigate and a witness.
fifth amendment and due process 
defendants and amici curiae argue that failure to provide pretrial discovery would deny defendants their due process rights to meaningfully prepare and present a defense to the charges against them.they more broadly assert that the sca is unconstitutional to the extent that it denies them access to information available to the prosecution through search warrant,subpoena,or court order.
to prevail on a claim that a statute violates due process,a defendant must carry a heavy burden.the courts will presume a statute is constitutional unless its unconstitutionality clearly,positively,and unmistakably appears all presumptions and intendments favor its validity.citations.in the due process context,defendant must show that the statute offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.people falsetta cal th,see patterson new york.fundamental principles of justice are those which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions citation and which define the community sense of fair play and decency.falsetta,at,quoting dowling united states.
the observation of the united states supreme court that t he due process clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded wardius oregon,supra,at weatherford bursey,supra,at has been repeated often by our own high court.people williams cal th,people maciel,supra,cal th at people valdez,supra,cal th at pp.in city of los angeles superior court cal th,our supreme court rejected a due process challenge to evidence code section,subdivision b,limiting defense discovery of complaints of police officer misconduct to a five year window.the defendant argued that enforcement of the limitation would unduly infringe his right to a fair trial,and that information older than five years old might qualify as evidence favorable to the accused that is material to guilt or punishment under brady maryland brady.city of los angeles,at.the court found no due process fundamental principle of justice implicated.id.at.the court has separately observed that brady merely serves to restrict the prosecution ability to suppress evidence rather than to provide the accused a right to criminal discovery.people morrison cal th,italics added.
d.other access to information and reciprocity 
as petitioners correctly note,defendants are not wholly precluded from access to much of the information that they now seek by subpoena.the prosecution has obtained at least some of rice facebook and instagram communications pursuant to search warrant,as authorized by the sca defendants do not suggest why they would not be entitled to receive copies of those communications,either as general criminal discovery required under penal code section or as potentially exculpatory brady material.see pierce cir,declining to address constitutional challenge to the sca for failure to provide reciprocal discovery rights where defendant otherwise obtained material from witness facebook account,and dismissing as speculative the suggestion that additional relevant exculpatory material might have been in the account.the due process clause of the federal constitution requires the prosecution to disclose to the defense evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and material to the issues of guilt or punishment.people jenkins,supra,cal th at.
defendants respond that access only to records that tend to support the prosecution theory of the case does not provide them with the complete materials necessary to present a full defense.they argue the sca establishes a,arbitrary,and unconstitutional preference that the government,but not the defense,is entitled to access to relevant electronic evidence.they assert that such a disparity in treatment is prohibited by wardius oregon,supra.in wardius,the unites states supreme court struck down a state statute that required the defendant to disclose the names of his alibi witnesses,but did not require the prosecution
