background 
wells fargo recruited and hired twymon,an,in july as the director of organizational performance reporting measurement in west des moines,iowa.twymon duties at wells fargo included responsibility for the performance management system,employee development consulting,statistical measures,and all activities related to organizational performance and organizational change.twymon was initially supervised by laura gillund,senior vice president of human resources,whose office was in minneapolis,minnesota.janel cerwick,a human resources professional based in west des moines,later assumed supervisory responsibilities over twymon.on november,wells fargo fired twymon,citing violation of wells fargo electronic communication use system policy computer policy as the reason for termination.twymon alleges racial animus and retaliation were the real reasons for her termination.
twymon alleged violation of wells fargo computer policy came to the attention of cerwick in november.an employee informed cerwick that twymon was using her work computer to assist a with his master thesis and complained,generally,about twymon excessive personal computer and internet use.wells fargo computer policy states that a ll company electronic communication systems equipment are the company property and are to be used to facilitate the business of the company.the policy prohibits e xcessive or inappropriate personal use of the company electronic communication systems equipment and warns violations of the policy may subject an employee to corrective action,which may include termination of employment.the policy also prohibits viewing,storing,downloading,or forwarding pornographic images or other perceived obscene,racist,or harassing materials and sending electronic mail that is obscene,racist,harassing,violent,or otherwise offensive.
on november,as a result of the employee complaint,cerwick requested an audit of twymon computer hard drive and began investigating her internet and usage.on november,cerwick received the initial results of the audit,which showed that twymon had visited hundreds of internet sites.some time later the record is unclear as to when,twymon computer hard drive was found to contain images of nude and partially nude males,as well as views of male genitalia.in addition,twymon was found to have received an inappropriate image via her work and to have forwarded the to her personal account.wells fargo deemed twymon alleged actions to be in gross violation of the computer policy and terminated twymon employment on november.
twymon denies she violated the wells fargo computer policy and alleges that her dismissal was,instead,motivated by racial animus and in retaliation for complaints she made about racial discrimination.as for her alleged violation of the computer policy,twymon admits to some personal use of the internet,but denies accessing the vast majority of hundreds of sites she reportedly visited.as a rationale as to why the audit,which documented web traffic from the unique ip address registered to twymon computer,revealed such usage,twymon claims that any employee with a swipe card could have accessed her computer.wells fargo contests this claim,noting the wells fargo computer system requires each employee to log on using a unique user name,confidential password,and assigned ip address,a procedure twymon acknowledges.
although she denies much of the personal internet use attributed to her,twymon claims she had permission from gillund to use her work computer for personal use as twymon personal computer was damaged during her relocation to the des moines area.gillund acknowledges giving twymon permission for limited personal use of her work computer as a temporary accommodation after her difficult move,but states that after issues related to twymon move were resolved,twymon did not ask for permission for continued personal use.gillund asserts twymon received notice regarding the computer policy at least twice during her time with wells fargo and signed an acknowledgment indicating she read and understood the policy.twymon also complains that white employees used their work computers for personal reasons during work hours without any consequences.there is no evidence in the record about the computer habits of other employees,and wells fargo states it consistently administers corrective action for violations of the computer policy.
twymon does not deny her computer hard drive contained photographs of naked men and other inappropriate material,but she denies responsibility for the images.she claims she received two inappropriate from another wells fargo employee and complained to phil hall,director of employee relations and an,about the communications and images.
twymon alleges her experience at wells fargo prior to her alleged misuse of the computer system demonstrates she was subject to racial discrimination and retaliation and not actually terminated for computer policy violations 
twymon was recruited for the wells fargo position by an independent executive recruiter.twymon recruiting process included a series of interviews,one directly with gillund.although twymon acknowledges that gillund was cordial and professional during her recruitment,twymon perceived gillund as unsupportive,disinterested,distant,and cold from the beginning of her employment.twymon believed gillund had not wanted her hired.twymon claims gillund did not provide twymon with the mentorship or guidance that gillund provided to her white subordinates.twymon does not provide any specific examples of white employees receiving mentoring from gillund,but states that barb rodriguez,a white employee who worked in minneapolis,received more attention from gillund,and twymon notes she perceived a marked difference between how rodriguez work and her own were facilitated by gillund.
as twymon employment continued she felt that gillund favored her white employees.she alleges a double standard existed for white and employees.for example,twymon alleges that gillund allowed caucasian employees,including rodriguez,to work flexible hours.in contrast,twymon states she was generally denied the opportunity for a flexible schedule,although she was permitted to telecommute for a week when her mother was ill.gillund denies rodriquez worked flexible hours.nothing in the record reflects the work hours of other employees.
twymon recalls other incidents she claims demonstrate gillund favoritism towards white employees.for example,twymon alleges gillund made disparaging remarks about an employee of polynesian descent.twymon also recounts an incident where a human resources manager of unknown race allegedly yelled at her.twymon states she responded by telling the manager she did not wish to be treated in that manner,and gillund reprimanded twymon for her response.gillund allegedly told twymon,you do know your place.in contrast,twymon alleges that a white employee yelled and spoke disrespectfully to gillund in a meeting and received no reprimand.
twymon also complains generally of rude,condescending,and unpleasant treatment by her,but does not cite any specific examples.she notes that she reported the boorish behavior to gillund,who twymon claims responded by instructing her to learn how to deal with temperamental people.twymon alleges that she was consistently directed to be accommodating and nice,while,in contrast,her white colleagues were consistently allowed to behave badly.
twymon alleges that some of her did not approve of her dating white men and so they embarked upon a campaign to find her a.twymon claims she informed gillund of these efforts,but that gillund stated she did see any problem.twymon also alleges that gillund reprimanded her for being rude when twymon corrected a white pronunciation of her name,but that when a white corrected twymon when twymon mispronounced a name,no such reproach was given.
twymon also claims that hall and cerwick made discriminatory statements to her.twymon alleges that,at some exact date is explained to her that intelligence and outspokenness in black employees is not welcomed and that qualities that would make a caucasian a golden child,being aggressive and intelligent and outspoken and a,would do exactly the reverse to a person of color.twymon alleges that hall advised her to develop a deferential persona,as a good black that would be accepted by the caucasians at wells fargo,in addition to the person who she really was an intelligent,outspoken,professional black female.twymon alleges she responded by asking if she should act like an uncle tom and states that hall replied in the affirmative.twymon claims she reported this incident,either to people inside or outside of wells fargo,but she does not state when or to whom such a report was made.
twymon alleges cerwick said she was not midwest nice,a phrase she also attributes to gillund.twymon further alleges that cerwick treated her differently than white employees.twymon recounts an instance where she was reprimanded for making a decision contrary to the views of her caucasian.
during her tenure at wells fargo,twymon was subject to performance evaluations.in february,twymon received her first performance appraisal.overall,twymon was positively rated,but the appraisal noted areas in which twymon fell short.gillund commented on twymon errors on a recent project,her need to improve her ability to define process timeliness,and her need to improve on following projects through to completion.twymon alleges that an earlier version of the appraisal included inappropriate references to her values and her personal behavior and that gillund admitted she did not include such comments on white employees evaluations.gillund denies this accusation the record does not include this alleged draft of the review.gillund contends she continued to express concerns about twymon work throughout the year.
in september,twymon participated in a conference call that included brad blackwell,vice president of pacific markets in california.during the conference call,blackwell discussed recruiting more minority home mortgage consultants in california.during this discussion,blackwell admittedly made a statement to the effect,we ca send white guys into east to sell mortgages to these people.you got to send one of their own kind.twymon viewed these comments as disparaging towards blacks and hispanics.twymon states she responded by informing blackwell she was a member of the group he was discussing and that she was offended.twymon felt blackwell then reacted in a defensive and angry manner,so she left the conference call and returned with hall,who she hoped would mediate the conflict.after the conference call,hall investigated the incident.he determined that blackwell did not behave inappropriately,while twymon behavior was inappropriate.
twymon also complained to gillund about the conference call.twymon alleges that gillund reprimanded her for her behavior on the blackwell conference call and demanded twymon apologize.twymon further asserts that gillund stated that part of twymon job included assisting white wells fargo employees in understanding black people.
twymon performance review commenced in october.gillund noted positive aspects of twymon performance in the review,but listed facets that needed improvement and characterized twymon as below expectations in some areas.in particular,gillund recounted that various human resources personnel had provided disconcerting feedback regarding twymon behavior,including her behavior during the blackwell conference call.gillund noted twymon should work on defining deadlines and following through on projects.twymon was specifically asked to ensure attendance and timeliness at meetings.and,the report instructed twymon not to take work issues or discussions personally.
on november,twymon,gillund,and cerwick met to discuss twymon performance.gillund allegedly expressed continuing concerns about twymon performance.wells fargo provided twymon with the option of continuing her employment with a performance improvement plan or separating from wells fargo under terms provided in a departure agreement.twymon alleges that she asked gillund if she was attempting to get rid of twymon,and gillund responded in the affirmative.
twymon declined to resign and sign the departure agreement and instead entered into a performance improvement plan.the performance improvement plan was revised a number of times.twymon alleges the revisions were made to make it more difficult for her to meet requirements gillund and cerwick claim the changes were made at twymon request to clarify the document.the performance improvement plan did not change twymon job responsibilities or reduce her compensation.the plan made it clear that twymon could be terminated if she failed to make satisfactory progress on the goals outlined in the performance improvement plan.
cerwick was informed of twymon alleged computer abuse while twymon was working under the performance improvement plan.twymon was terminated for violating the computer policy on november.following twymon termination,a white male was hired to perform some of her duties,while the remainder of her job responsibilities were distributed to existing wells fargo employees.
some months after her termination,twymon contacted hall and asked him to review her termination.twymon told hall she believed she was wrongfully terminated because she complained about racist behavior at wells fargo.hall forwarded twymon request to george innus,a member of wells fargo employee relations group.innus investigated twymon termination and concluded that twymon was not terminated on the basis of her race.he sent twymon a letter reiterating that her termination was based upon her excessive and inappropriate use of the internet and,as explained to her at the time of her termination.
twymon filed charges of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission and the iowa civil rights commission.both agencies notified twymon of her right to sue,and twymon filed suit alleging that her termination was a result of racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of federal and state law.
the district court granted wells fargo motion for summary judgment.the district court reasoned that twymon failed to establish either direct evidence of race discrimination or a prima facie case of racial discrimination,and,even if she had provided evidence supporting an inference of discrimination,wells fargo produced a legitimate,reason for her termination that twymon did not demonstrate to be pretextual.likewise,the district court held that twymon failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,and,even if she had,twymon failed to show that wells fargo proffered legitimate,grounds for her termination were,in fact,a pretext.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.canady stores,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
racial discrimination 
title vii of the civil rights act of title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.the iowa civil rights act of likewise prohibits employment discrimination.iowa code ch.a plaintiff may establish a violation of title vii prohibition against termination through either direct or indirect evidence.see price waterhouse hopkins,d,concurring.twymon asserts she presented sufficient evidence of both kinds to avoid summary judgment.we disagree.
direct evidence 
twymon first contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her employment discrimination claim primarily because statements made by gillund and hall constitute direct evidence of unlawful racial discrimination.we disagree.direct evidence is evidence that establishes a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the c
