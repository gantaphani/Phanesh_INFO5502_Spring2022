this appeal requires us to decide,for the first time,what requirements must be satisfied for a person on supervised release to waive his right to counsel in a revocation proceeding under federal rule of criminal procedure b.following the first and seventh circuits,we hold that,although the waiver need not meet the formal requirements required by the sixth amendment,the waiver must be knowing and voluntary as demonstrated either through a colloquy with the district court,or by the totality of the circumstances,or both.we hold that the totality of the circumstances,including the colloquy with the court,indicates that hodges waiver of his right to counsel and his decision to proceed pro se were knowing and voluntary.thus we affirm the judgment of the district court revoking his supervised release.
tony lewis hodges was convicted under a of making false statements to a federal officer regarding an incendiary device he placed in the work place of a former girlfriend.on february,hodges was sentenced to imprisonment for sixty months,and three years of supervised release.hodges completed his term of imprisonment,and began his supervised release on march.
during his release,hodges dated a young woman for approximately five months.shortly after she terminated the relationship in october,hodges began harassing the young woman by sending partially nude photographs of her over the internet,calling her on the telephone times in just over a month,coming onto her property and peering in her windows,and approaching her at work.as a result,the government sought to revoke hodges supervised release,charging him with felony cyber stalking in violation of ann.four misdemeanor complaints,including two counts of stalking,telephone harassment,and disturbance of a business and failing to obey the instructions of his probation officer to refrain from contacting the victim and witness in the charged offenses.
the district court appointed the federal public defender as counsel for hodges,and scheduled a revocation hearing.on february,just before the hearing began,hodges appointed counsel,jupiter,of the federal public defender office,informed the court that hodges wished to proceed pro se.after a brief bench conference the following discussion occurred 
the court hodges,a petition has been filed by the probation officer charging you with violations of the terms of supervised release.have you received a copy of that petition and gone over it 
hodges i read it.i have gotten a personal copy for myself,but i read it.
the court you have a right to have the evidence against you disclosed you have a right to counsel in this case,that is a lawyer.jupiter has been appointed to represent you and has prepared for this hearing.a moment ago he advised that there was some question about that.do you want him to represent you in the case 
hodges i expressed to him a minute ago that i would rather go pro se.
the court all right.i confident that jupiter with his law degree and experience as a lawyer is better able to represent you than you are to represent yourself,but you have a right to represent yourself if you want to do that.are you telling me that you do not want jupiter to represent you 
hodges yes,sir.
the court and you going to do it yourself 
hodges yes,sir.
the court alright,i going to relieve jupiter of representing you.
jupiter your honor,would the court want me as standby counsel 
the court since you are here and prepared,then you may remain at counsel table to answer any questions that he might have,if he has any questions.hodges,you,as i said a moment ago,have the right to have the evidence disclosed against you.you can the witnesses that are brought to testify in the case.you can present testimony in your own defense,including your own,if you wish to do so.and i have told you you have the right to counsel,but you have advised me that you do not wish to have a lawyer represent you in the case,and i accepting that and agreeing or allowing you to represent yourself.
hodges it not a decision i making or anything against jupiter.it just something i thought of myself,basically i given an opportunity to just try to ask for something that you know,that pressing on my life that,you know,i would rather just take it to my own hands and have the blame for myself.
the court all right,sir.
the hearing proceeded with hodges representing himself.at the close of the evidence hodges again affirmed his desires to represent himself,explaining,today i wanted to be my own attorney for the simple fact that i feel like i do have a whole lot of chances left in order to prove myself,in order to defend myself,in order to stand up for myself 
at the close of the evidence the district court found that hodges had committed each of the charged offenses and sentenced hodges to months of imprisonment followed by months of supervised release.hodges now appeals the revocation on the sole basis that the waiver of his right to counsel was invalid due to the failure of the district court to warn him of the pitfalls of and the benefits of counsel.
hodges raises only one claim that the court failed properly to inform him of the dangers of proceeding without counsel and thus his waiver of counsel was unknowing and involuntary.our circuit has had many opportunities to discuss and develop the standard for waiver of a right to counsel in criminal prosecutions,including trial and sentencing.see,united states jones,cir waiver at trial united states joseph,cir waiver at trial united states davis,cir waiver during trial mcqueen blackburn,cir waiver during trial.however,our cases have not addressed the issue in the context of a revocation proceeding today,our resolution of hodges appeal presents two parts first,an analysis of the proper standard for waiver of the right to counsel in the revocation setting and second,an evaluation of hodges waiver in the light of that standard.
in the context of a criminal prosecution a defendant who waives his right to counsel in favor of should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of,so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with his eyes open.joseph,at.thus,some sort of colloquy with the district court is required to warn the defendant against the perils and disadvantages of,to assure that the waiver is knowing and voluntary.davis,at.this requirement is designed to ensure that the waiver is not the result of coercion or mistreatment,making it clear on the record that the accused understands the nature of the charges,the consequences of the proceedings,and the practicality of waiving the right to counsel.joseph,at.
although warnings by the district court are important,these same cases make clear that w e require no sacrosanct litany for warning defendants against waiving the right to counsel.depending on the circumstances of the individual case,the district court must exercise its discretion in determining the precise nature of the warning.id.at see also jones,at we do not suggest that a district court must follow a script.to be sure,however,in determining the appropriate warning against,the district court must consider various factors,including defendant age,education,background,experience,and conduct.joseph,at internal citations omitted.these considerations in warning a defendant against have been applied in the sixth amendment context in which a defendant faces the initial criminal prosecution,usually before a jury.
there is,however,a difference between criminal prosecutions,and revocation hearings,such as the one before us today.the sixth amendment provides a defendant a constitutional right to represent himself at trial,see faretta california,d.this right to,however,does not extend to hearings to revoke parole,united states,cir citing scarpelli,d and loud estelle,cir,or supervised release,united states moore,cir.instead,in the revocation context is a matter of discretion vested in the district court.the right to represent himself asserted by hodges arises not under the sixth amendment,but under rule b we have not addressed the adequacy of a waiver in the rule b context.consequently,the question presented in this case is
