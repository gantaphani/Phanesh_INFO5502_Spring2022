we are called upon to determine the public right to access orders issued under d and related documents at the jury phase of an ongoing criminal investigation.because we find that there is no first amendment right to access such documents,and the common law right to access such documents is presently outweighed by countervailing interests,we deny the request for relief.
title ii of the electronic communications privacy act of,commonly known as the stored communications act sca,was enacted to protect the privacy of users of electronic communications by criminalizing the unauthorized access of the contents and transactional records of stored wire and electronic communications,while providing an avenue for law enforcement entities to compel a provider of electronic communication services to disclose the contents and records of electronic communications,stat,codified at.as one senator remarked,the sca was designed to protect legitimate law enforcement needs while minimizing intrusions on the privacy of system users as well as the business needs of electronic communications system providers.cong.rec.statement of leahy.
to obtain records of stored electronic communications,such as a subscriber name,address,length of subscription,and other like data,the government must secure either a warrant pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,or a court order under.d.c.orders issued under d may be granted if the government offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication,or the records or other information sought,are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.d.this is essentially a reasonable suspicion standard.
in seeking access to records,the government need not give prior notice to the subscriber or customer.c.the sca also provides for gag orders,which direct the recipient of a d order to refrain from disclosing the existence of the order or investigation.see b.
this case involves the d orders pertaining to the government request for records of electronic communications relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.the underlying facts of the investigation,which are not presently before us,relate to the unauthorized release of classified documents to,and the alleged involvement of bradley manning,a army private first class.
as part of its investigation,the government petitioned the district court for the eastern district of virginia and obtained an order pursuant to d,from a magistrate judge twitter order,directing twitter,twitter to disclose records of electronic communications pertaining to appellants jacob appelbaum,rop gonggrijp,and birgitta jonsdottir subscribers specifically,the order directed twitter to provide subscribers names,usernames,personal contact information,account information,connection records,financial data length of service,direct messages to and from email addresses and internet protocol addresses for all communications between november,and december.
the issuing magistrate judge determined that prior notice to any person of the twitter order,the government application for the twitter order twitter application,and the ongoing criminal investigation,would seriously jeopardize the investigation.consequently,the magistrate judge sealed the twitter order and application,and directed twitter not to disclose their existence,or the investigation to any person unless and until otherwise ordered by the court.on january,upon the government motion,the magistrate judge unsealed the twitter order and authorized twitter to disclose the order to subscribers.
on january,subscribers moved the court to vacate the twitter order,unseal all documents relating to the twitter order,and unseal and publicly docket any other d orders on the subject of the investigation pertaining to subscribers that were issued to companies other than twitter other d orders.
following a hearing on the motions,the magistrate judge issued a memorandum opinion and an order denying the motion to vacate,and partially granting the motion to unseal as follows it granted the motion to unseal pleadings filed during the litigation over the twitter order denied the motion to unseal the twitter application denied the motion to unseal the other d orders and took under advisement the issue of public docketing of the other d orders and related motions.in ruling on the motion to unseal,the magistrate judge determined that there was no first amendment right to access the twitter application,and the other d orders and their applications.the magistrate judge also determined that the common law presumption of access to judicial records was overcome because the sealed documents contained sensitive nonpublic facts,including the identity of targets and witnesses in an ongoing criminal investigation.
while subscribers request for public docketing was pending,the eastern district reviewed and changed the docketing procedures of its clerk office.specifically,the eastern district instituted new procedures by creating an ec docket for recording cases pertaining to requests for pen registers and d orders.the ec docket is a running list that is publicly available from the district court clerk office.it indicates all assigned case numbers,the date of assignment,the presiding judge,and whether the case is sealed.however,it lacks individual docket entries for all types of documents filed in each case and the dates of such entries.
following the creation of the ec docket,the magistrate judge denied subscribers public docketing request,reasoning that there exists no right to public notice of all the types of documents filed in a sealed case.subscribers then filed objections to the magistrate judge sealing and docketing decisions with the district court.
in reviewing the magistrate judge decisions,the district court applied a clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard of review and overruled subscribers objections.the district court stated that it also conducted a de novo review and f ound that the magistrate judge findings and orders survive a more demanding scrutiny.in re appl.of the for an order pursuant to u.d,d.the district court then affirmed the magistrate judge sealing and docketing decisions.
subscribers appealed.
we first address the basis for our jurisdiction over this matter.we have stated m andamus,not appeal,is the preferred method of review for orders restricting access to criminal proceedings.balt.sun goetz,cir quoting.post soussoudis,cir.as mandamus is the preferred method for reviewing courts orders restricting access to criminal proceedings,we treat subscribers appeal as a petition for mandamus,and we have jurisdiction under the all writs act.see.post,at 
w rits of mandamus are to be issued only in extraordinary circumstances.id.at citing platt.mining,d.to successfully obtain mandamus relief,a petitioner must show that he has a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought,and there are no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires.in re braxton,cir citations omitted.for the reasons that follow,subscribers fail to establish they have a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought and therefore,we deny the petition for mandamus.
subscribers raise two substantive issues on appeal whether the district court erred in refusing to unseal the other d orders and derivative motions and orders concerning such orders and the sufficiency of the docketing system employed by district courts in the eastern district of virginia overlaying these two issues is whether the district court applied the proper standard of review to the magistrate judge decisions.we first address the procedural issue,and then address the substantive issues in turn.
subscribers contend that in reviewing the magistrate judge decisions,the district court erred by applying a clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard,as opposed to a de novo standard of review.we have held that a magistrate judge power to control access to judicial documents or docket sheets derives from the district court inherent power to control access.see.post hughes,cir a magistrate power to seal or unseal documents derives from the district court power to take such actions see also aclu holder,cir whether to seal a docket sheet is within the district court inherent power.
a magistrate judge power to control access falls under the additional duties prong of the federal magistrates act,b,and decisions under this prong are accorded de novo review by the district court.hughes,at citing matthews weber,d.consequently,in this proceeding,both the magistrate judge sealing and docketing decisions fall within the additional duties provision of b,and are reviewable de novo.upon a careful examination of the district court rulings,we hold that the district court applied the appropriate standard of review to the magistrate judge decisions 
subscribers next contend that the district court erred in permitting the other d orders and related documents to remain sealed because these documents are subject to the right of access.the right of public access derives from two independent sources the first amendment and the common law.dep t of state police.post,cir.the distinction between the rights of access afforded by the common law and the first amendment is significant,because the common law does not afford as much substantive protection to the interests of the press and the public as does the first amendment.id.quoting goetz,at rushford new yorker magazine,cir.specifically,the common law presumes a right to access all judicial records and documents,but this presumption can be rebutted if the public right of access is outweighed by competing interests.in re knight publ g,cir see united states moussaoui,app x,cir unpublished.on the other hand,the first amendment provides a right of access only to particular judicial records and documents,and this right yields only in the existence of a compelling governmental interest that is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.dep t of state police,at.
for a right of access to a document to exist under either the first amendment or the common law,the document must be a judicial record.goetz,at.whether a certain document is a judicial record is a question of law,and we determine it de novo.see lugosch pyramid of onondaga,cir.
although we have never explicitly defined judicial records,it is commonsensical that judicially authored or created documents are judicial records.thus,we have no difficulty holding that the actual d orders and subsequent orders issued by the court are judicial records 
with respect to whether the derivative d motions are judicial records,our prior cases guide this inquiry.in rushford,we held that discovery documents filed in connection with a dispositive motion,such as a motion for summary judgment,were subject to the right of access because summary judgment adjudicates substantive rights.at.in in re policy management systems,we refrained from ascribing the first amendment right of access to documents not considered by the court but filed with a motion to dismiss,reasoning that they do not play any role in the adjudicative process.cir unpublished table decision.taken together,rushford and in re policy management systems hold that documents filed with the court are judicial records if they play a role in the adjudicative process,or adjudicate substantive rights.we adopt that definition.in doing so,we are in harmony with the decisions of several of our sister circuits.see,in re providence journal,cir examining the common law presumption of access coextensively with the definition of judicial records,and holding that the presumption attaches to those materials which properly come before the court in the course of an adjudicatory proceeding and which are relevant to that adjudication.citation omitted united states el sayegh,w hat makes a document a judicial record and subjects it to the common law right of access is the role it plays in the adjudicatory process.amodeo,at t he item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.applying this definition,the derivative d motions are judicial records because they were filed with the objective of obtaining judicial action or relief pertaining to d orders.see also goetz,at holding search warrant affidavits are judicial records because they are considered by a judicial officer in determining whether to issue a warrant,and are available in a subsequent proceeding if sufficiency is challenged.
because we conclude that d are judicial records,the common law presumption of access attaches to these documents.however,we next examine whether,in addition to the common law presumption,a first amendment right of access to these documents also exists.
to determine whether the first amendment provides a right to access d orders and proceedings,we employ the experience and logic test,asking whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public,and whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.goetz,at quoting press enterprise superior court,d.here,neither prong is satisfied.
subscribers concede that there is no long tradition of access specifically for d orders,given that the sca was enacted in however,they argue that under press enterprise,where a relatively new process is at issue,courts focus on the logic prong.our enterprise precedent makes clear that both the experience and logic prongs are required.see goetz,at stating a conjunctive test see also united states gonzales,cir citing goetz for the proposition that some courts adopt the approach that press enterprise requires satisfaction of both prongs.
even assuming only the logic prong is required,this prong is not met the logic prong asks whether public access plays a significant role in the process in question.the d process is investigative,and openness of the orders does not play a significant role in the functioning of investigations.section d proceedings consist of the issuance of and compliance with d orders are ex parte in nature,and occur at the investigative,jury,phase of what may or may not mature into an indictment.investigative processes where privacy and secrecy are the norm are not amenable to the practices and procedures employed in connection with other judicial proceedings.see in re sealed case.
subscribers contend that transparency of d orders and motions,which are the very foundation of our judicial system,would ensure fairness,decrease bias,improve public perception of the justice system,and enhance the chances that the orders are and not overbroad.we are not persuaded by this argument because in press enterprise,the supreme court noted 
although many governmental processes best operate under public scrutiny,it takes little imagination to recognize that there are some kinds of government operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly.a classic example is that the proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.
at quoting douglas oil petrol stops,d.section d proceedings can be likened to grand jury proceedings.in fact,they are a step removed from grand jury proceedings,and are perhaps even more sacrosanct.proceedings for the issuance of d orders are also like proceedings for the issuance of search warrants,which we have noted are not open.see goetz,at observing that the supreme court has twice recognized that proceedings for the issuance of search warrants are not open.because secrecy is necessary for the proper functioning of the criminal investigations at this d phase,openness will frustrate the government operations because d orders and proceedings fail the logic prong,we hold that there is no first amendment right to access them.
we next consider whether the common law presumption of access to d orders requires access.this presumption is not insurmountable,and access may be denied if certain substantive and procedural preconditions are satisfied.see goetz,at t he press and the public have a common law qualified right of access to judicial records.emphasis added.in undertaking this inquiry,we note that the common law right of access to judi
