background 
the facts of this case are set forth in detail in american booksellers foundation for free expression dean,d,familiarity with which is presumed.we summarize the relevant facts below.
plaintiff sexual health network,shn is a delaware corporation whose principal place of business is in connecticut.shn purpose is to provide access to information,especially for persons with disabilities,illnesses,and changes in their lifestyle.shn website is the primary vehicle by which shn provides such information.the shn website contains information on a range of topics including sexual addiction,advice for making safe sex practices more erotic,guidelines on the safe practice of bondage sadomasochistic activities,and information on how those with disabilities can experience sexual pleasure.approximately different viewers visit the shn website each month.shn website also coordinates interactive question and answer forums.
the american civil liberties union of vermont is an affiliate of the national aclu.maintains a website that links to the website of the national aclu.although does not include materials on its own website,the national aclu includes materials on topics such as birth control,safe sex practices,gay and lesbian rights,abortion,and sex education.
in,vermont governor howard dean signed into law act,an act relating to internet crimes,which extended to internet communications prohibition against distributing to minors sexually explicit materials that are harmful to minors.acts resolves.on february,plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from enforcement of the amended statute on the basis that it violated the first amendment and the dormant commerce clause.in response,the vermont general assembly passed act,which limited to dissemination of indecent material to a minor in the presence of a minor and created a new provision,which prohibited dissemination to minors of indecent material that is harmful to minors when the dissemination occurs outside the presence of the minor but the disseminator has actual knowledge that the recipient is a minor.acts resolves.plaintiffs amended their complaint to allege first amendment and dormant commerce clause violations with the enactment of amended and the new.
the district court found that the technology of the internet has not changed substantially since the supreme court decision in reno american civil liberties union,d.in particular,it remains difficult for publishers who post information on the internet to limit website access to adult viewers or to viewers from certain states.although technology exists that allows publishers to restrict website access by requiring credit card verification or registration with a commercial service,a significant number of adult are unwilling or unable to use such verification systems.such systems are not only an additional hassle,they also require that website visitors forgo the anonymity otherwise available on the internet.additionally,adults who do not have a credit card are unable to access those sites that require credit card verification.neither shn nor screen viewers through either a credit card system or an screening service.according to shn,such systems would significantly decrease the number and frequency of visitors to its website.
the district court held that shn and had standing to bring suit against section because they faced a sufficiently credible fear of prosecution but lacked standing to challenge section section violates the first amendment because it burdens adult speech and is not narrowly tailored and section violates the dormant commerce clause because it projects vermont regulation onto the rest of the nation and because the local benefits do not outweigh the burden on interstate commerce.am.booksellers,d at.finally,the district court found that the statute could not be severed and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing it.
discussion 
the state defendants challenge the district court determination that plaintiffs have standing and that the statute violates the first amendment and dormant commerce clause.defendants also challenge the scope of the injunction.appellants argument with respect to the first three points rests on a narrow construction of section.we therefore turn first to the proper construction of section.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.see zervos verizon new york,cir.
scope of section 
the core prohibition of section reads in pertinent part as follows 
no person may,with knowledge of its character and content,and with actual knowledge that the recipient is a minor,sell,lend,distribute or give away pornographic material which is harmful to minors 
the district court interpreted the provision to apply to material posted on websites and to internet or email discussion groups.the state defendants argue that this interpretation is incorrect and that section only applies to communication because it is only in these circumstances that the sender will have actual knowledge that the recipient is a minor.we disagree.
the terms of section can be easily read to apply to material placed on a website or shared with an email or internet discussion group.when people post information onto a website available to the public,they distribute or give away the information.actual knowledge that a recipient is a minor is possible not only in cases of email correspondence but also when the disseminator of the material knows that there will be minors among the many people who visit the website or participate in the discussion group.moreover,as the supreme court pointed out in reno,a heckler might provide knowledge by announcing that a minor would be looking at the website or participating in the discussion group.at.appellants point to no decisions of the vermont supreme court that suggest to us that that court would construe the statute differently.
ii.standing 
appellants argue that plaintiffs lack standing because the statute does not reach material posted on plaintiffs websites.as we have discussed,we reject this narrow reading of the statute.because there are no feasible means of preventing minors from accessing their websites or internet discussion groups without also significantly limiting communication to adults,see reno,at,section presents plaintiffs with the choice of risking prosecution or censoring the content of their sites.plaintiffs have therefore met the threshold for establishing standing for a first amendment claim by demonstrating an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against them.right to life comm.sorrell,cir quoting virginia am.booksellers ass n,d.the district court did not address whether plaintiffs also have standing to bring their commerce clause claims.the standard for amendment claims is slightly higher a plaintiff must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement.babbitt united farm workers union,d.in this case,the choice that the statute presents to their communications or risk presents a realistic danger of direct injury.
iii.first amendment right to free expression 
the constitution permits a state to impose restrictions on a minor access to material considered harmful to minors even if the material is not obscene with respect to adults,see ginsberg new york,d but such restrictions aim
