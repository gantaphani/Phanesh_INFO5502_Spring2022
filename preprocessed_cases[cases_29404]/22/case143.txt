opinion of the court 
appellant donald miller was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment and a lifetime term of supervised release following his conviction for possession of child pornography and possession of marijuana.the district court imposed eight special conditions of supervised release,including a restriction on internet access,mandatory computer monitoring,and a limitation on association with minors.on appeal,miller challenges the duration of his term of supervised release and four of the eight special conditions.we agree with miller that the lifetime limitation on internet use is a greater restraint of liberty than is reasonably necessary and that the restriction on his association with minors is overbroad.accordingly,we will vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in january,the federal bureau of investigation fbi searched miller house after discovering that his computer had been identified based on its ip address as the source of images of child pornography that were uploaded onto an internet server in utah.the fbi agents seized miller computer and computer zip disks.one of the disks contained more than pornographic images.approximately eleven of the images depicted child pornography.the adult pornography apparently included five images that could arguably be characterized as sadomasochistic.united states miller,cir miller i.the same search uncovered a small amount of marijuana in his house.
at his trial,miller argued that he had not downloaded the child pornography images.he testified that he had never seen the images,did not knowingly copy them to the zip disk,and looked only at legal adult pornography,characterizing his collection as p rimarily playboy centerfolds.id.at.he suggested that the images might have been downloaded by a computer hacker,noting that around the time that they were downloaded,he had been the victim of a billing fraud for a pornography website.a defense expert offered testimony that the images were among several hundred copied onto the zip disk in periodic intervals over a period,indicating that they might have been copied automatically,perhaps by a computer virus.the expert also explained that a user might inadvertently download multiple image files when he believes he is downloading only one.this testimony was countered by a government agent,who noted that the images on the zip disk had been extracted and thus were not the type of embedded files described by the defense.id.at.the agent also expressed doubt that anyone would hack into another person internet connection to transmit data that would be attributed to that person ip address,or that any virus existed that would download child pornography onto a person computer,id.at n.
despite miller defense,the jury convicted him on three counts of the indictment knowingly receiving child pornography,in violation of a knowingly possessing child pornography,in violation of a b and possession of marijuana,in violation of a.miller was acquitted on two counts,transporting and shipping child pornography by computer and receiving and distributing child pornography by computer.the district court calculated miller total offense level as,including a enhancement for obstruction of justice based on his purported perjury in denying at trial that his pornography collection included any sadomasochistic images with a criminal history category of i,the advisory guidelines range was to months imprisonment.the district court sentenced miller to months imprisonment on the first two counts and months imprisonment on the marijuana count,to be served concurrently,and imposed a life term of supervised release for the possession of child pornography offense.at the time of the sentencing,miller was sixty years old he is now years old.
in his first appeal,miller challenged his conviction on the first two counts on several grounds,including his contention that separate convictions for receiving and possessing the same images of child pornography violated the double jeopardy clause.this court ruled in miller favor on the double jeopardy issue and his challenge to the obstruction of justice enhancement and remanded to the district court to vacate one of the two child pornography convictions and resentence miller without the obstruction of justice enhancement.miller i,at.miller did not challenge the duration or conditions of his term of supervised release in his first appeal.
on remand,the district court vacated the conviction for knowing receipt of child pornography and resentenced miller solely on the knowing possession of child pornography and marijuana counts.without the enhancement for obstruction of justice,miller total offense level was,resulting in an advisory guidelines range of to months,with a mandatory supervised release term of five years to life pursuant to k.at an october,sentencing proceeding,the district court sentenced miller to months imprisonment to be followed by a life term of supervised release.the court also imposed eight special conditions of supervised release,including four that are at issue in this appeal miller was required to participate in a sex offender treatment program at his own expense special condition he was barred from associat ing with children under the age of,except in the presence of an adult who has been approved by the probation officer special condition he was prohibited from using a computer with internet access without the prior written approval of the p robation o fficer special condition and he was required to submit to random inspections of his computer and permit the installation of software to monitor his computer use special condition.app.at the conclusion of the proceeding,miller objected to these supervised release conditions,arguing that they were not reasonably related to the offense conduct in this case.id.at.on october,the district court filed an order formalizing the oral rulings made at the sentencing proceeding,including the vacation of the receipt of child pornography count and the entry of conviction on the possession count october order.this order did not mention the term of supervised release.the district court filed a judgment setting forth the full sentence on october.on the same day,the district court signed a statement of reasons explaining the sentence,which is dated october.
on october,miller filed a motion to correct his sentence under federal rule of criminal procedure a,challenging both the supervised release term and the special conditions.on october,miller timely appealed his sentence to this court.in a november,order the november order,the district court granted the rule a motion in part.while acknowledging miller appeal,the court stated that it still had jurisdiction to address the rule a motion because the government had not challenged its jurisdiction.in addition,the district court relied on federal rule of appellate procedure b,which states that the filing of a notice of appeal does not divest a district court of jurisdiction to correct a sentence under federal rule of criminal procedure a.
in substance,the november order largely affirmed the supervised release term and the conditions imposed in the october sentencing,but it contained a much more thorough explanation of the court reasoning.the district court justified the lifetime term based on the high rate of recidivism among sex offenders and a sentencing guidelines policy statement recommending the imposition of the statutory maximum supervised release term on convicted sex offenders,including child pornography offenders.the district court also relied on miller mis characterization of the nature of his pornography collection as playboy centerfold images,despite his possession of five images allegedly depicting sadomasochism,and his continuing denial of any involvement in the possession of child pornography.lastly,the district court explained that the lifetime term was not greater than reasonably necessary as it could be terminated if,in the future,there was no need to continue miller supervision.as to the special conditions,the district court indicated that the factors supporting the lifetime term also provided a basis for each of the four restrictions at issue.
the november order altered miller sentence in two respects.first,the district court agreed that special condition bar on miller association with overly broad based on a decision of this court rejecting similar language.see united states smyth,app x,cir.therefore,the court modified the condition to include exceptions for brief,unanticipated,and incidental contacts with minors and for contacts with miller own family members or children.app.
second,although disagreeing with miller characterization of special conditions and as imposing a complete ban on his ability to access the internet,the district court sought to minimize confusion by moving the text of special condition to the end of special condition so that both conditions are read together.id.at.this new,combined special condition reads as follows 
the defendant shall not use a computer with access to any computer service without the prior written approval of the p robation o fficer.this includes any i nternet service provider,bulletin board system,or any other public or private computer network.the defendant shall submit to an initial inspection by the probation office and to any examinations during supervision of the defendant computer and any devices,programs,or applications.the defendant shall allow the installation of any hardware or software systems which monitor or filter computer use.the defendant shall abide by the standard conditions of computer monitoring and filtering that will be approved by this court.the defendant is to pay the cost of the computer monitoring,not to exceed the monthly contractual rate,in accordance with the probation officer direction.
id.at.in all other respects,the district court denied miller rule a motion.on appeal,miller challenges the sentence imposed by the district court,arguing that the lifetime duration of his term of supervised release and special conditions,and subject him to a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary 
we first address the government argument that miller has waived any right to challenge his sentence.according to the government,miller waived the arguments that he now advances by failing to raise them during his first appeal to this court therefore,the district court judgment must be affirmed in all respects.miller disagrees,arguing that because his second sentencing was de novo,the arguments were not waived and we are therefore free to review his challenge to the length of his term and the special conditions of his supervised release.should we agree with miller,we must also determine whether our review is limited to the district court october order,which offers limited reasoning for the court sentencing decision,or if we can consider the district court november order ruling on miller motion under federal rule of criminal procedure a,which contains a more detailed statement of reasons but was issued beyond the period required by rule a.
although the district court imposed the same lifetime term and special conditions in the original sentencing in this case,miller did not challenge the supervised release aspect of his sentence in his first appeal.consequently,the government,invoking the authority of united states pultrone,cir,contends that miller waived his arguments regarding his term of supervised release 
pultrone had been convicted of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to months imprisonment.pultrone filed an appeal,and the government on the ground that the district court had failed to apply a mandatory statutory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment.pultrone voluntarily withdrew his appeal we remanded for application of the statutory minimum.pultrone was accordingly sentenced to months imprisonment,a sentence he appealed.assessing whether we had jurisdiction over the second appeal,we held that pultrone had waived all of the arguments contained therein because e ach of these allegations of error could and should have been raised in that first direct appeal because pultrone voluntarily withdrew the appeal,he failed to preserve these issues.id.at accord united states quintieri,cir holding that the law of the case doctrine forecloses the appellate court from reconsidering issues decided by a previous appellate panel or previously waived by the defendant united states marmolejo,cir holding that the defendant had waived his argument regarding the obstruction of justice enhancement as he did not raise it on appeal from his original sentencing united states walterman,cir same united states whren,same.accordingly,we dismissed pultrone second appeal for lack of jurisdiction.pultrone,at.
pultrone and the other court of appeals cases we cite recognize an exception to the waiver doctrine.w hen a case is remanded for de novo resentencing,the defendant may raise in the district court and,if properly preserved there,on appeal to the court of appeals,issues that he or she had previously waived by failing to raise them.quintieri,at.in contrast,in pultrone,we were addressing a limited resentencing rather than a de novo proceeding.at.in that posture,we noted that as the proceeding on remand reflected only our direction that the statutory minimum sentence be imposed and because pultrone abandoned his appeal,no other aspect of his conviction or sentence was at issue.in this circumstance,t he grant of remand on appeal does not reopen the order appealed from id.quoting united states mendes,cir accord whren,at instructing that upon a resentencing occasioned by a remand,unless the court of appeals expressly directs otherwise,the district court may consider only such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals decision marm olejo,at same walterman,at same.as stated in quintieri,however,when the resentencing is de novo rather than limited,issues concerning the first sentence that were previously waived may be raised in the first instance if warranted by the second sentence.miller argues that this exception applies because his second sentencing was essentially de novo.
our sister circuits are divided over whether a district court absent specific direction should generally treat a vacation and remand of a sentence as a de novo resentencing or as a limited proceeding in which the sentencing court revisits only the particular issues identified as grounds for remand.see quintieri,at collecting cases on both sides of the circuit split.in those circuits that have adopted a de novo sentencing default rule,resentencing is de novo absent explicit direction otherwise from the remanding appellate court.see,united states jennings,cir creating a default rule of de novo resentencing,amended by cir united states cornelius,cir same united states ponce,cir same united states stinson,cir same.
other circuits follow a default rule of limited resentencing,in which resentencing is not considered to be de novo unless expressly designated as such.in these circuits,upon a resentencing occasioned by a remand,unless the court of appeals expressly directs otherwise,the district court may consider only such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals by the reasoning or by the result.whren,at accord united states wallace,cir united states lee,cir united states husband,cir.the second circuit splits the difference,holding as follows 
w hen a sentencing results from a vacatur of a conviction,we in effect adhere to the de novo default rule but when a resentencing is necessitated by one or more specific sentencing errors,unless correction of those errors would undo the sentencing calculation as a whole,we in effect adhere to the default rule of limited resentencing.
quintieri,at internal citations omitted.
we do not need to determine which default rule is appropriate here because it is well established that when the remand includes instructions to vacate at least one interdependent count of conviction,a de novo sentencing is appropriate.see united states davis,cir.in davis,we endorsed the sentencing package doctrine,which instructs as follows 
w hen a defendant is found guilty on a multicount indictment,there is a strong likelihood that the district court will craft a disposition in which the sentences on the various counts form part of an overall plan.when a conviction on one or more of the component counts is vacated,common sense dictates that the judge should be free to review the efficacy of what remains in light of the original plan,and to reconstruct the sentencing architecture upon remand if that appears necessary in order to ensure that the punishment still fits both crime and criminal.
id.citation internal quotation marks omitted accord quintieri,at r esentencing usually should be de novo when a court of appeals reverses one or more convictions and remands for resentencing emphasis omitted united states goggins,cir i f convictions on some counts of a indictment are vacated the court may resentence the defendant to enhanced sentences on the remaining counts.
in cases subsequent to davis,we stressed that the sentencing package doctrine should be confined to cases in which the sentences on the underlying counts were interdependent.mckeever warden,cir united states murray,cir.interdependent offenses result in an aggregate sentence,not sentences which may be treated discretely.murray,at.applying this test,we conclude that the sentences on miller two child pornography counts were interdependent,such that the sentencing package doctrine applied,and miller second sentencing was de novo.accordingly,the term and conditions of supervised release were squarely at issue during the second sentencing,and miller did not waive his current challenges by failing to raise them in his first appeal.
when computing miller total offense level at the original sentencing,the district court grouped the two child pornography counts pursuant to d,which provides that a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule w hen the offense level is determined largely on the basis of some measure of aggregate harm the introductory commentary to part explains the policy underlying the grouping of interrelated counts 
some offenses that may be charged in indictments are so closely intertwined with other offenses that conviction for them ordinarily would not warrant increasing the guideline range.for example,embezzling money from a bank and falsifying the related records,although legally distinct offenses,represent essentially the same type of wrongful conduct with the same ultimate harm,so that it would be more appropriate to treat them as a single offense for purposes of sentencing 
in order to limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct,this part provides rules for grouping offenses together.convictions on multiple counts do not result in a sentence enhancement unless they represent additional conduct that is not otherwise accounted for by the guidelines.in essence,counts that are grouped together are treated as constituting a single offense for purposes of the guidelines.
section specifically provides that offenses covered by the guideline provisions applicable to miller child pornography and to be grouped.when offenses are grouped pursuant to d,the offense level applicable to that group is the guideline that produces the highest offense level.id.b.the child pornography counts and the possession of marijuana count involved unrelated acts and were not so grouped.for miller grouped offenses,the receipt of child pornography count produced the highest offense this was used as the base offense level.see id.ultimately,the district court sentenced miller to months imprisonment on the grouped child pornography counts.this constituted an aggregate sentence that was based upon the interdependence of the child pornography counts.davis,at.as the offenses were grouped,they result ed in an aggregate sentence,not sentences which may be treated discretely.murray,at.
in miller first appeal,we remanded the case to the district court to correct the erroneous entry of separate convictions on the two duplicative child pornography counts in violation of the double jeopardy clause.united states miller,cir.the district court left the possession count in place and vacated the receipt count.in recalculating miller offense level for the possession count,the district court could not rely on a discrete sentence previously imposed for that offense.instead,the district court had to ungroup the two offenses and determine the base offense level applicable to the receipt count.see.such resentencing on one of two interrelated and grouped counts is the type of de novo proceeding contemplated in davis and murray rather than the limited resentencing considered in pultrone.as such,the supervised release term was equally at issue in the second sentencing.while the district court happened to impose an identical term of supervised release at the first and second sentencings,the term was imposed anew at the second sentencing,when the district court had the freedom to craft an appropriate term and both parties had the opportunity to make arguments and raise objections.thus,the duration and special conditions of miller term of supervised release were squarely presented at the second de novo sentencing,and miller did not waive these issues by failing to challenge his term of supervised release in his first appeal.see quintieri,at.
in sum,we reaffirm the sentencing package doctrine endorsed in davis.when a conviction on one or more interdependent counts is vacated on appeal,the resentencing proceeding conducted on remand is de novo unless we specifically limit the district court authority.moreover,counts that were grouped pursuant to the sentencing guidelines at the original sentencing are interdependent,such that the vacation of one of the grouped counts requires a de novo sentencing on remand unless we direct otherwise.we conclude therefore that miller second sentencing proceeding was de novo and that he did not waive his current challenge to the term and conditions of his supervised release by failing to raise it during his first appeal.
b.the november order 
before reaching the merits of miller appeal,we must determine whether we should confine our review to the district court october judgment and statement of reasons october judgment or whether we may also consider the district court november order responding to miller motion for correction of his sentence pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a rule a motion.rule a authorizes a district court to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error at any point within seven days after sentencing.while miller filed his rule a motion on october,within seven days of the october,sentencing proceeding,the district court ruling on the motion was outside of the window.in its november order,the district court granted miller motion in part,modifying special conditions,and relating to contact with minors,internet access,and random computer inspections.the district court also provided a much more thorough explanation of the reasons underlying its sentencing decisions.
rule a limitation is jurisdictional,such that a district court lacks authority to act under the rule outside this period.united states washington,cir united states higgs,cir.moreover,the limit in the rule does not apply to counsel motion.it is expressly in terms of the district court action.higgs,at.this was a deliberate decision by the advisory committee,which noted that the stringent time requirement of seven days was shorter than the time for appealing the sentence so that if the court did in fact correct the sentence within the seven days,the defendant could still timely appeal the sentence if so desired.id.at quoting.advisory committee note.
given that both miller and the government acknowledged the jurisdictional bar and conceded at oral argument that we should confine our review to the october judgment,we will not consider the november order as part of the record on appeal 
having concluded that miller arguments were not waived,we turn to the merits of his appeal.miller sole challenge is that the district court supervised release term and conditions in the october judgment are outside of the bounds of d and thus an abuse of discretion.section authorizes a sentencing court to impose a condition of supervised release to the extent that such condition is reasonably related to the factors set forth in a and involves no greater deprivation than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section a d.the relevant factors,as delineated in a,are as follows 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant 
the need for the sentence imposed 
b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct 
c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and 
d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,medical care,or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner 
miller contends that the length of his supervised release term was longer than reasonably necessary and that special conditions,and,described supra,were not reasonably related to the purposes articulated in the pertinent a factors 
a sentencing judge is given wide discretion in imposing a term of supervised release.nevertheless,that discretion is not unbounded as i t must be exercised within the parameters of.united states voelker,cir citing united states crandon,cir.under d,a court may impose a special condition of supervised release only after considering whether it is reasonably related to certain factors set forth in a the nature of a defendant offense and the defendant history and characteristics the need for adequate deterrence the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and the need to provide the defendant with correctional treatment including vocational training or medical care.i t is not necessary for all of the factors identified in a to be present before a special condition of supervised release may be imposed.united states sicher,cir.yet,c ourts generally can not impose a one with a clearly rehabilitative evidence that the condition imposed is reasonably related,that is,related in a tangible way to the crime or to something in the defendant history.united states pruden,cir quoting united states evans,cir.under this standard,a condition with no basis in the record,or with only the most tenuous basis,will inevitably violate d command that such conditions involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary.pruden,at.
we have consistently required that district courts explain and justify conditions of supervised release.see voelker,at united states warren,cir.a district court must state the reasons in open court for imposing a particular special condition so that the appellate court is not left to speculate about the reasons.united states.loy,cir citations omitted.where the court does not make clear why it imposed a given condition,we can not properly review a defendant abuse of discretion claim challenging the condition and may therefore remand to the district court for further explanation.id.alternatively,we may affirm the condition if we can ascertain any viable basis for the restriction in the record before the district court voelker,at quoting warren,at 
miller challenges both the lifetime term and the four special conditions set forth above.in voelker,faced with similar arguments,we concluded that we did not need to separately address voelker challenge to the term of his supervised release.our discussion of the propriety of the conditions imposed on that term applies to duration of the term with equal force.id.we can not truly assess the propriety of the length of the term of supervised release without considering the restrictiveness of the conditions imposed.we will adopt this approach in the instant case and focus on the propriety of the conditions of the supervised release.id.
special conditions and ban and computer monitoring 
as previously stated,special condition prohibits miller from us ing a computer with access to any computer service without the prior written approval of the p robation o fficer.app.this includes any computer with access to the internet.special condition requires miller to submit to monitoring of his computer and allow the installation of any hardware or software systems which monitor or filter computer use at his expense.id.miller objects to these special conditions as not reasonably related to the circumstances of the offense or his history and as so overbroad as to involve a much greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary.miller br.to assess the merits of miller challenge,an analysis of our prior cases is instructive.
a series of four cases lays out our approach to supervised release conditions restricting computer and internet usage for child pornography offenders.in general,our precedent recognizes that such restrictions,as they bear on tools that are essential in modern life for legitimate purposes of communication,commerce,and,must be narrowly tailored according to the context of the particular offense.
in voelker,at,the defendant was convicted of receipt of child pornography and sentenced to months imprisonment followed by a life term of supervised release.voelker had also exposed the buttocks of his daughter to another adult male over a webcam while chatting with him online,although he was not charged based on this conduct.id.at.on appeal,voelker challenged the length and conditions of his term of supervised release.id.at.the condition prohibited voelker from accessing any computer equipment or any computer service at any location,including employment or education.this includes,but is not limited to,any internet service provider,bulletin board system,or any other public or private computer network id.at.
we vacated the conditions of supervised release,explaining that c onditions of supervised release must be supported by some evidence that the condition imposed is tangibly related to the circumstances of the offense,the history of the defendant,the need for general deterrence,or similar concerns set out in a.id.at.applying this test,we held that the outright lifetime ban on accessing computers or the internet was the antithesis of a narrowly tailored sanction,a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary,and not reasonably related to the factors set forth in.id.at.we expressed two primary concerns with the computer condition.first,we emphasized the extraordinary breadth of the restriction,which we described as lifetime cybernetic banishment.id.at.we further noted that we have never approved such an,severe,and permanent restriction id.at.focusing on t he ubiquitous presence of the internet and the nature of the information it contains and the extent to which computers have become part of daily life and commerce,we found it hard to imagine how voelker could function in modern society given this lifetime ban on all forms of computer access and use.id.at.second,we stressed that while voelker conduct was reprehensible,he did not use his computer equipment to seek out minors nor did he attempt to set up any meetings with minors over the internet id.at.
the voelker court specifically distinguished united states crandon,cir,in which we approved a supervised release term with a special condition barring the defendant from accessing the internet except as specifically approved by his probation officer.crandon was distinguishable,the voelker court held,on the basis of the duration of the supervised release term the existence of exceptions to the prohibition and the crandon defendant use of the internet to meet and develop a relationship with a girl,which culminated in sexual relations with her.at.as crandon used the i nternet as a means to develop an illegal sexual relationship with a young girl over a period of several months,we upheld the conditions of his supervised release as narrowly tailored and related to the dual aims of deterring him from recidivism and protecting the public.at.
while distinguishing crandon,the voelker court looked favorably on united states freeman,cir,as illustrat ing the kind of tailoring the court should have considered in crafting the computer restriction.at.in freeman,the defendant pled guilty to receipt and possession of child pornography after being caught copying computer files of child pornography images from an undercover police officer posing as a collector of child pornography.freeman,at.freemen subsequently admitted to molesting young boys and pursuing babysitting jobs to have the opportunity to photograph boys in the nude.id.at.he also had two prior sexual misconduct convictions.id.the sentencing court imposed a sentence of seventy months imprisonment and five years of supervised release.id.at.during the term of supervised release,freeman was banned from having computer equipment in his residence and from possessing or using a computer with internet access without prior written approval of his probation officer.id.at.freeman was also subject to unannounced inspections of his residence and possessions during his supervised release term to monitor his compliance with the computer equipment ban.id.at.
on appeal,we made clear that t here is no need to cut off a child pornography offender access to email or benign internet usage when a more focused restriction,limited to pornography sites and images,can be enforced by unannounced inspections of material stored on the offender hard drive or removable disks.id.at.we specifically distinguished crandon on the ground that the offender in that case had used the internet to contact young children and solicit inappropriate sexual contact with them,a use of the internet that is harmful to the victims contacted and more difficult to trace than simply using the internet to view pornographic web sites.id.as a result,crandon and similar offenders merited a more severe restriction,and we took care to emphasize that w e are not in any way limiting our ability to restrict the use of computers when a defendant has a past history of using the internet to contact children.id.in freeman case,however,a total ban on internet access was not warranted.id.furthermore,we added that if freeman violated a more tailored limitation on his access to pornography websites and images,then the district court might impose a broader restriction on his internet access.id.
most recently,in united states thielemann,cir,we upheld a computer restriction as not disproportionate when viewed in the context of thielemann conduct.on his computer,thielemann possessed several hundred pornographic images of children.id.at.the computer also contained logs of online chats with phillips,an individual with whom thielemann had a sexual relationship.id.during one of these chats,thielemann encouraged phillips to have sexual contact with an girl.id.thielemann pled guilty to receipt of child pornography as part of his plea agreement,thielemann admitted to the following conduct 
h e engaged in chats with phillips,and during a chat,phillips had on his lap a minor,visible to the defendant,and at the defendant encouragement and inducement phillips did simulate masturbation of the minor,and did pose the minor in order to effect the lascivious exhibition of the minor pubic area.
id.at internal quotation marks citation omitted.thielemann was sentenced to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release.id.at.pursuant to one of the special conditions of supervised release,thielemann was prohibited from own ing or operat ing a personal computer with i nternet access in a home or at any other location,including employment,without prior written approval of the probation office id.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.he did not object to this special condition before the district court,subjecting it to plain error review on appeal.id.
comparing the case to voelker and crandon,we concluded that t he terms of thielemann supervised release are more analogous to those we upheld in crandon.id.at.as thielemann could use a personal computer as long as it was not connected to the internet and could seek permission from the probation office to use the internet during his restriction,t he parameters of the computer restriction are far less troubling than those in voelker.id.we further stressed that thielemann did more than simply trade child pornography he utilized internet communication technologies to facilitate,entice,and encourage the molestation of a child.id.as the restriction on computer and internet use share d a nexus to the goals of deterrence and protection of the public,we held that it did not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than wa s necessary and did not constitute plain error.id.
these cases make clear that we must consider two key factors in judging the reasonableness of special conditions and.first,we must examine the scope of the supervised release condition,including both its duration and its substantive,the degree to which access to computers and the internet is restricted.voelker indicates that we can not divorce the amount of time a special condition lasts from the question of whether that particular special condition is reasonably related to the considerations laid out in a.second,we must consider the severity of the defendant criminal conduct and the facts underlying the conviction,with a particular focus on whether the defendant used a computer or the internet to solicit or otherwise personally endanger children 
assessing these two factors,in comparison to the conditions imposed in our prior cases,the limitation in condition on miller access to the internet is overly restrictive while condition,providing for computer monitoring,is narrowly tailored and reasonable.with respect to the scope of condition,for the rest of his life,miller is confined to using a computer that does not have online access unless he receives approval from his probation officer to use the internet and other computer networks.the substantive scope of this special condition is nearly identical to the computer restriction upheld in thielemann.it is less restrictive than the conditions that we rejected in freeman and voelker.yet,while the substantive scope of miller condition may be less restrictive than the conditions that we previously struck down,it applies for the rest of his life.crandon,freeman,and thielemann involved,and terms,respectively.at at at.in voelker,however,the offender faced a lifetime term,and this duration was an important consideration in our conclusion that the condition lifetime cybernetic banishment was too restrictive.at.
with respect to the criminal conduct at issue,both freeman and voelker distinguished crandon on the ground that the defendant in that case had used the internet to actively contact a child and solicit sexual contact.in thielemann,the defendant similarly made use of the internet to facilitate,entice,and encourage the molestation of a child.at.crandon and thielemann received,respectively,and terms of supervised release.miller has not used the internet in these ways,and yet he still faces a lifetime term.while we do not intend to minimize the serious harm caused by possession of child pornography,miller use of the internet poses a danger that differs in both kind and degree from the conduct involved in crandon and thielemann.
in freeman,we suggested that,on remand,the district court should impose a more focused restriction,limited to pornography sites and images,which can be enforced by unannounced inspections at.special condition anticipates just this form of monitoring of or filtering of miller computer use.in light of this alternate,less restrictive possibility,the lifetime limitation on internet use imposed on miller is a greater restraint of liberty than is reasonably necessary.see d.accordingly,we will vacate special condition restricting miller internet access.we will also vacate special condition requiring computer monitoring as any new conditions of supervised release should integrate a more focused restriction on internet access with the requirement of computer monitoring into a comprehensive,reasonably tailored scheme.
on remand,the district court may impose a restriction on miller computer use and internet access and may require computer monitorin
