following a trial to the court,koch was convicted of one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a b.the district sentenced koch to months imprisonment and five years of supervised release.koch appeals,arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence,that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction,that the court erred in evidentiary rulings,and that his sentence is substantively unreasonable with unduly restrictive conditions of supervised release.we affirm.
in the fall of the iowa division of criminal investigations dci received information that koch,then an employee at riverside casino in riverside,iowa,was running illegal high stakes poker games at his residence.dci began an investigation of koch,led by agent mark weidman.during the investigation dci agents learned that koch was using computers to run his gambling operation.based on this information they obtained a search warrant for his residence in may.the warrant permitted the agents to search and seize computers and related equipment that could be used to record any data on the gambling operation.
during the search of koch home agents seized gambling equipment,records,and electronic equipment from koch basement,garage,two bedrooms,and a bathroom.among the many items seized were a compaq computer and an external storage device or flash drive,which were found in a bedroom koch appeared to be using as an office.the parties agree that the evidence taken into custody as a result of the may search was lawfully seized pursuant to a valid search warrant.
koch pled guilty to a state gambling offense in october and was sentenced in december with a deferred judgment and probation.in january agent weidman was about to transfer to the state fire marshal office and prepared to dispose of the evidence in dci custody from the search of koch home,including the compaq computer and flash drive.
because agent weidman had not previously been involved in the disposal of property,he contacted the county attorney office for advice on how to proceed before he examined any of the evidence.the county attorney office instructed weidman to obtain a disposal of property order from a state court judge.weidman followed the office advice and applied to a state court judge for such an order.with his application he provided the court a list of all the items in dci custody relating to koch case.the state court then issued an order providing that the evidence seized as part of koch case could be disposed of in any one of three ways it could be destroyed,returned to the owner upon proof of ownership,or retained by law enforcement for official use.the state court order thus left it to the agents to choose which option to use in disposing of the property.
only after the disposition of property order had been obtained did agent weidman and the three agents assisting him begin to review the evidence in dci custody.they decided to retain certain evidence for training purposes,to destroy some,and to return any personal items to koch provided that they did not contain any records or materials related to his illegal gambling operation.when the agents realized that the contents of the flash drive had never been opened or viewed,agent jeffrey miller opened the drive and clicked on one of its folders on his office computer to determine whether it contained any information on koch gambling operation.he saw some pictures of females.a few of the thumbnail images were expanded and miller saw they were pornographic in nature and contained images of young females.he immediately removed the flash drive from his computer and informed his colleagues about what he had seen.
agent miller testified at the evidentiary hearing on koch motion to suppress that he had the flash drive open for no more than two minutes and had examined only four photographs before closing it.he then reopened the drive to show the other agents the final image he had viewed which he believed to be child pornography.the flash drive was open for a total of up to five minutes and was then removed from the computer.agent weidman contacted the internet crimes against children icac division to report what they had seen.
an icac agent then obtained a new search warrant with specific authority to search the flash drive and the unexamined compaq computer.icac criminalist michael morris subsequently conducted a forensic examination of the equipment.morris discovered over separate images of child pornography on both devices.koch was later charged with one count of possession of child pornography in violation of a b.
prior to trial koch moved to suppress the results of the initial viewing of the flash drive as well as all the evidence uncovered with the benefit of the new search warrant.he argued that the original search warrant obtained as part of the gambling investigation was stale at the time the flash drive was opened and that the search had exceeded the scope of the original warrant.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied koch motion.it concluded that the probable cause underlying the original warrant had been preserved while the flash drive remained in police custody,making the warrant still effective for search of the equipment.alternatively,the court concluded that the dci agents had acted in good faith under united states leon.
agent morris testified at trial that he had uncovered separate images of child pornography during the forensic examination of the entire flash drive.the images had been initially saved on the flash drive in june and were located in a folder which had to have been manually created by a user of the drive.morris also testified that he uncovered illegal images on koch computer,several of which were duplicative of those found on the flash drive.the images on the computer were initially saved in december and were also located in a folder which had to have been manually created by a user of the computer.in addition,there was forensic evidence that some of the images on the computer had been moved and saved in different folders and that images had been manually deleted on the flash drive.
morris testified that the user names on both the flash drive and the computer were variants of koch first name.the flash drive user was identified as jonathon and the computer user as jo.both devices also contained numerous documents authored by koch for college courses and other subjects,as well as digital photographs of him.a number of these files were created within days of the dates the pornographic images had been saved,moved,or deleted on the respective devices.
following the bench trial,the district court found koch guilty of one count of possession of child pornography.the court sentenced him to months and five years of supervised release.the court applied three sentencing guideline enhancements two levels for possession of more than but less than images of child pornography,b a four levels for images representing sadistic or masochistic conduct,b and two levels for use of a computer,b.koch timely appealed his conviction and sentence.
koch argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the search of the flash drive and all computer related evidence.he asserts that the agents lacked probable cause and a valid warrant to search the drive.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.united states,cir.we will affirm the court order unless the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence,is based on an erroneous view of the applicable law,or in light of the entire record,we are left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made.united states,cir.
koch does not contest that the computer and flash drive were lawfully seized in may under a valid warrant.he argues,however,that the january search of the flash drive should be suppressed because the warrant obtained as part of the gambling investigation was no longer effective.he cites iowa code and sgro united states,both of which provide that a search warrant not executed within ten days of issuance is no longer valid.since the original search warrant in this case was executed the same day it was issued,the ten day rule in sgro and iowa code is not implicated 
koch also argues that the search of the flash drive exceeded the scope of the original warrant which authorized a search for evidence relating to a gambling operation.he relies on united states carey,cir.in carey,the court suppressed evidence of child pornography discovered during a computer search for evidence of drug dealing.id.at.observing that the police had spent several hours searching an entire hard drive for evidence of child pornography instead of drug evidence,the court concluded the search had exceeded the scope of the warrant.id.at.here,the agents were reviewing evidence pursuant to a judicial disposal order,checking to see if it contained gambling information,when they encountered child pornography.they only looked at it briefly before closing the flash drive.no more searching occurred until after a new warrant was obtained.koch has failed to show that his case is materially similar to carey or any of the others he cited which excluded evidence on the basis of a fourth amendment violation.
here,the basis for the district court decision not to suppress the challenged evidence was that the probable cause underlying the original search warrant was still effective at the time the agents viewed the flash drive and thus the warrant was not stale.we need not address that issue,however,because we conclude that the agents had an objective,good faith belief under united states leon that their search was legal.see united states proell,cir applicability of the exception to the exclusionary rule may be considered before assessing probable cause.
the supreme court recently reflected in herring united states,that in analyzing the applicability of the exclusionary rule,leon admonished that we must consider the actions of all the police officers involved.id.at.that is because the exclusionary rule is directed at police misconduct which is intended to be deterred by its application.leon,at.evidence should be suppressed only if it can be said that the law enforcement officer s had knowledge,or may be properly charged with knowledge,that the search was unconstitutional under the fourth amendment.illinois krull.we have defined the operative test as whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal.united states perry,cir.
since the application of the test is fact driven,we review the facts here.the flash drive and computer were originally seized in may under a valid search warrant.the equipment then remained in the custody of law enforcement until agent weidman was faced with disposing property in january.before reviewing any of the evidence weidman went to the county attorney office for instructions on the correct way to dispose of property.the county attorney office told him to apply to a state court judge for a disposal of property order.weidman went to the state court and provided it with a list of the property seized from koch home under the original warrant.a state court judge then issued an order for the disposal of property,leaving to agent discretion which means of disposal was appropriate for particular evidence.it was only after the order was obtained from the state court that agent weidman and those assisting him reviewed any of the evidence they were considering for disposal or for training use.when they came to the flash drive,they believed it was necessary to view its contents to make sure that it did not contain gambling information and could therefore be returned to koch 
we conclude that weidman and the other agents were acting in good faith when they opened the flash drive and unexpectedly discovered child pornography.before looking into any equipment they had not simply relied on the original warrant,but sought legal advice from the county attorney office which they then followed by applying for a court order.it was while they were in the process of following the court directions about disposal of the property seized under that warrant and checking for any gambling material on the flash drive that they came across the pornographic pictures involving young girls.they did not prolong the viewing but closed the drive within just a few minutes.
whether or not the state court should have done more in response to agent weidman request for a disposal order,instructed him to obtain a new warrant,or tailored the order more specifically is immaterial in terms of the exclusionary rule.that was illustrated in leon.there,a magistrate judge was found to have erred in finding probable cause for a warrant which police officers used to conduct a search.the supreme court concluded that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule should not be applied under those circumstances,for the rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.leon,at.since the officers had acted in good faith,the evidence should not have been suppressed.id.at.
koch case is very similar to leon because here the dci agents acted in good faith by seeking advice from the county attorney office and relying on a state court order before viewing any portion of the flash drive.when they unexpectedly discovered child pornography,they obtained a new search warrant.only then did they look at the computer and examine the bulk of the flash drive.the alleged fourth amendment violation here was not the result of police misconduct or the deliberate,reckless,or grossly negligent conduct which the exclusionary rule is intended to deter.herring.at.we conclude that the district court did not err by denying the motion to suppress.
koch also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction.we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,viewing evidence in the light most favorable to the government,resolving conflicts in the government favor,and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the verdict.united states scofield,cir.when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence following a court trial,we apply the same standard as when reviewing a jury verdict and will reverse only if no reasonable factfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gray,cir.in order to convict koch of possession of child pornography in violation of u.a b,the government was required to prove that koch knowingly possessed an item of child pornography which was transported or produced using materials transported in interstate commerce.
koch first contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly possessed child pornography.the government presented evidence at trial that well over separate images of child pornography were found on the computer and flash drive seized from a bedroom in the home he owned and occupied alone.the user names on both the computer and flash drive were variations on koch first name,and the pornographic images on each were located in folders which had to have been manually created by a user of the flash drive and the computer.in addition to the images of child pornography,the computer and flash drive also contained documents authored by koch and digital photographs of him created within days of when numerous images of child pornography were saved,moved,or deleted on both devices.
koch argues that while this evidence may show that he used both the computer and flash drive,it does not give rise to a reasonable inference that he knew the child pornography images existed.citing united states kain,cir and united states stulock,cir,he asserts that even proof of exclusive possession of a computer containing child pornography is not sufficient to prove he knowingly possessed the illegal images.koch reliance on kain and stulock is misplaced.the passages koch relies on in those cases refer to the presence of child pornography in internet browser cache files on a defendant computer,images which were automatically stored as a result of internet browsing.in contrast,the images here were found on koch computer and flash drive in files that a user had to create manually.there was also additional evidence that a nu
