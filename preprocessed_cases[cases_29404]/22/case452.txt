this appeal is the second trip to our court for a group of plaintiffs in their statutory and constitutional challenges to government surveillance programs.in the last appeal,we reversed the district court dismissal of all claims on standing grounds and remanded for further proceedings,including determination of whether the claims are foreclosed by the state secrets privilege.jewel sec.agency,cir.several years of further proceedings have yet to produce a final judgment.most recently,the district court dismissed a fourth amendment claim which was only one among several claims regarding internet surveillance,on the grounds that plaintiffs lacked standing and that their claim was barred by the state secrets privilege.jewel sec.agency,no,wl,at.the court then certified that single issue as final under federal rule of civil procedure b.
the government filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that certification was improper under rule b.we agree.our task is to address the juridical concerns surrounding the appeal of less than a complete judgment and to scrutinize the district court evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units.curtiss wright.because the fourth amendment question is intertwined with several other issues that remain pending in district court and because this interlocutory appeal would only prolong final resolution of the case,we conclude that the rule b certification was not warranted and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
this appeal arises out of ongoing litigation concerning internet and cell phone surveillance programs the government began in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on september,in,carolyn jewel,tash hepting,gregory hicks,erik knutzen,and joice walton filed a complaint on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated against the united states,the national security agency nsa,and a number of government officials in their personal and official capacities.the complaint included seventeen counts,raising both constitutional and statutory claims and seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages.in summary,the complaint alleges that government officials engaged in continuing warrantless surveillance within the united states that had begun under a secret presidential order.the terrorist surveillance program,some aspects of which were publicly acknowledged by the government in,involved collecting data on millions of internet and cell phone users.according to plaintiffs,the telecommunications company at t collaborated with the nsa to divert internet traffic into secure rooms at at t facilities in san francisco and to provide customer records to the government.through this collaboration,the government allegedly collected data on cellular telephone communications,text messages,email,and other forms of internet communication without a warrant.jewel,at.
in,the district court dismissed the action with prejudice,holding that plaintiffs lacked a sufficiently particularized injury and therefore lacked standing on all claims.jewel,wl,at.on appeal,we reversed and held that jewel claims are not abstract,generalized grievances and instead meet the constitutional standing requirement of concrete injury.nor do prudential considerations bar this action.jewel,at.the case was remanded to the district court with instructions to consider,among other claims and defenses,the government assertion that the state secrets privilege bars this litigation.id.at.
after remand,the district court addressed the interaction between the state secrets privilege and sovereign immunity as those issues pertain to the statutory claims under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa,the electronic communications privacy act stored communications act,the wiretap act,and the administrative procedure act.jewel sec.agency,d.the district court determined 
the government state secrets privilege does not compel complete dismissal of the action because sufficient information regarding the surveillance program had been made public such that the subject matter of the suit itself is not a state secret.id.at.
the fisa procedural mechanism prescribed under f preempts application of the state secrets privilege.id.at.title applies to claims under the stored communications act and the wiretap act,thus preempting the state secrets doctrine for those claims.id.at.
the damages claims under fisa are barred by sovereign immunity,but damages are not barred under the stored communications act or the wiretap act.id.at.
plaintiffs can not seek injunctive relief for their stored communications act and wiretap act claims because patriot act,amending a and a,impliedly limited authority to sue the united states for forms of relief other than damages.id.at.
the district court order disposed of eleven of the seventeen claims and explicitly declined to address any of the constitutional claims,which included first and fourth amendment challenges to internet and phone surveillance programs and an alleged violation of the separation of powers principle.id.at.nor did the court address the possible defenses,such as qualified immunity,that might be available to individual defendants.the district court requested further briefing on the scope of fisa preemption with regard to the constitutional claims,noting that plaintiffs had the burden to show standing to sue without risking impermissible damage to ongoing national security efforts.id.at.the court also requested briefing on the recent disclosure of the government continuing surveillance activities and the statement by the director of national intelligence that certain information should be declassified and immediately released to the public.id.at.
while the parties were in the process of briefing these questions,three of the five plaintiffs,jewel,knutzen,and walton collectively jewel or the jewel plaintiffs,moved for partial summary judgment on one aspect of their fourth amendment claim related specifically to internet interception because they thought the public record supported their claim.jewel specifically limited the scope of the motion to only one aspect of the fourth amendment claim a t this time.jewel alleges that the government is engaging in a dragnet internet interception program called upstream collection,and that this program is an element of the government collection of communications under fisa.under this program,the nsa designates persons located outside the united states who are reasonably believed to possess or receive,or are likely to communicate,foreign intelligence information.jewel,wl,at.once specific telephone numbers or email addresses associated with these individuals are identified,the nsa,assisted by the telecommunications providers,filters internet communications in an effort to remove all purely domestic communications in order to capture designated communications.id.at.the jewel plaintiffs contend that this program constitutes surveillance of private communications without a warrant or individualized suspicion,in violation of the fourth amendment.id.the government has acknowledged the existence of the upstream collection process,h owever,the technical details of the collections process remain classified.id.
in an order denying jewel motion for summary judgment and granting the government,the district court held that plaintiffs failed to establish a sufficient factual basis for standing to challenge the ongoing internet data collection program.although the court agreed that jewel could demonstrate concrete injury if the internet interception program operated in the way proffered,the evidence at summary judgment is insufficient to establish that the upstream collection process operates in the manner in which plaintiffs allege it does and that,based on classified materials relating to upstream collection,the plaintiffs version of the significant operational details of the upstream collection process is substantially inaccurate.id.at.the court further held that the fourth amendment claims must be dismissed because even if plaintiffs could establish sta
