background 
phillips entered the university of texas at austin ut in and was admitted to the department of computer sciences in.like all incoming ut students,phillips signed ut acceptable use computer policy,in which he agreed not to perform port scans using his university computer account nonetheless,only a few weeks after matriculating,phillips began using various programs designed to scan computer networks and steal encrypted data and passwords.he succeeded in infiltrating hundreds of computers,including machines belonging to other ut students,private businesses,government agencies,and the british armed services webserver.in a matter of months,phillips amassed a veritable informational goldmine by stealing and cataloguing a wide variety of personal and proprietary data,such as credit card numbers,bank account information,student financial aid statements,birth records,passwords,and social security numbers.
the scans,however,were soon discovered by ut information security office iso,which informed phillips on three separate occasions that his computer had been detected portscanning hundreds of thousands of external computers for vulnerabilities.despite several instructions to stop,phillips continued to scan and infiltrate computers within and without the ut system,daily adding to his database of stolen information.
at around the time iso issued its first warning in early,phillips designed a computer program expressly for the purpose of hacking into the ut system via a portal known as the txclass learning central a complete training resource for ut faculty and staff.txclass was a secure server operated by ut and used by faculty and staff as a resource for enrollment in professional education courses.authorized users gained access to their txclass accounts by typing their social security numbers in a field on the txclass website page.phillips exploited the vulnerability inherent in this protocol by transmitting a attack program which automatically transmitted to the website as many as six social security numbers per second,at least some of which would correspond to those of authorized txclass users.
initially,phillips selected ranges of social security numbers for individuals born in texas,but he refined the attack to include only numbers assigned to the ten most populous texas counties.when the program hit a valid social security number and obtained access to txclass,it automatically extracted personal information corresponding to that number from the txclass database and,in effect,provided phillips a back door into ut main server and unified database.over a period,phillips thus gained access to a mother lode of data about more than current and prospective students,donors,and alumni.
phillips actions hurt the ut computer system.the attack program proved so the usual monthly number of unique requests received by txclass from approximately to as many as it caused the ut computer system to crash several times in early.hundreds of ut web applications became temporarily inaccessible,including the university online library,payroll,accounting,admissions,and medical records.ut spent over to assess the damage and to notify victims that their personal information and social security numbers had been illicitly obtained.
after discovering the incursions,ut contacted the secret service,and the investigation led to phillips.phillips admitted that he designed the attack program to obtain data about individuals from the ut system,but he disavowed that he intended to use or sell the information.
phillips was indicted and convicted after a jury trial on one count of computer fraud pursuant to a a ii and b i,and one count of possession of an identification document containing stolen social security numbers pursuant to a.phillips timely filed a motion for judgment of acquittal challenging,unsuccessfully,the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the loss amount used to support the computer fraud conviction,and asserting,correctly,that his conviction under a violated the ex post facto clause he was sentenced to five years probation,five hundred hours of community service,and restitution of.phillips appealed.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
phillips asserts that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence that he intentionally access ed a protected computer without authorization under a a ii.
although phillips timely filed a motion for judgment of acquittal,see,the motion raised only the narrow issue whether the loss or damage caused by his online exploits exceeded.see a b i.both the government opposition memorandum and the district court ruling on the motion addressed this one issue.accordingly,w here,as here,a defendant asserts specific grounds for a specific element of a specific count for a rule motion,he waives all others for that specific count.united states herrera,cir en banc,cert.denied,d emphasis in original.we thus review his newly raised claim that there was insufficient evidence of the statutorily required mens rea under a a ii only for a manifest miscarriage of justice.united states green,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this exacting standard of review,a claim of evidentiary insufficiency will be rejected unless the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt or if the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.united states avants,cir.
phillips insufficiency argument takes two parts that the government failed to prove he gained access to the txclass website without authorization and he did so intentionally.
with regard to his authorization,the cfaa does not define the term,but it does clearly differentiate between unauthorized users and those who exceed authorized access.see e defining exceeding authorized access as access ing a computer with authorization and us ing such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter see also a,a,a.several subsections of the cfaa apply exclusively to users who lack access authorization altogether.see,a,a i,a ii,a iii.in conditioning the nature of the intrusion in part on the level of authorization a computer user possesses,congress distinguished between insiders,who are authorized to access a computer,and outside hackers who break into a computer.see,at see also,at,as reprinted in,at stating that a and a will be aimed at outsiders.
courts have therefore typically analyzed the scope of a user authorization to access a protected computer on the basis of the expected norms of intended use or the nature of the relationship established between the computer owner and the user.applying such an analysis,in united states morris,cir,a case involving an invasive procedure that prefigured modern portscanning,the second circuit held that transmission of an internet worm designed to demonstrate the inadequacies of current security measures on computer networks by exploiting security defects was sufficient to permit a jury to find unauthorized access within the meaning of a a.morris,at.the morris court determined that conduct,like password guessing or finding holes in programs,that uses computer systems not in any way related to their intended function amounts to obtaining unauthorized access.id.at see also creative computing llc,cir internet site administrator misappropriation of login names and passwords to obtain access to competitor website violated cfaa theofel,cir,cert.denied,d use of an authorized password by an outside hacker to gain access to a mail server fell within the paradigm of what congress sought to prohibit under the stored communications act ef cultural travel bv explorica,cir mentioning in dicta the district court observation of a default rule that conduct is unauthorized for purposes if it is not in line with reasonable expectations of the website owner and its users internal quotation marks omitted.
phillips attack program was not an intended use of the ut network within the understanding of any reasonable computer user and constitutes a method of obtaining unauthorized access to computerized data that he was not permitted to view or use.during,phillips admitted that txclass normal hourly hit volume did not exceed a few hundred requests,but that his attack created as many as.he also monitored the ut system during the multiple crashes his program caused,and backed up the numerical ranges of the social security numbers after the crashes so as not to omit any potential matches.phillips intentionally and meticulously executed both his intrusion into txclass and the extraction of a sizable quantity of confidential personal data.there was no lack of evidence to find him guilty of intentional unauthorized access.
phillips makes a subsidiary argument that because the txclass website was a public application,he,like any internet user,was a de facto authorized user.in essence,phillips contends that his theft of other people data from txclass merely exceeded the preexisting generic authorization that he maintained as a user of the world wide web,and he can not be considered an unauthorized user under a a ii.
this argument misconstrues the nature of obtaining access to an internet application and the cfaa use of the term authorization.while it is true that any internet user can insert the appropriate url into a web browser and thereby view the txclass administrative training system web page,a user can not gain access to the txclass application itself without a valid social security number password to which ut has affirmatively granted authorization neither phillips,nor members of the public,obtain such authorization from ut merely by viewing a page,or clicking a hypertext link.instead,courts have recognized that authorized access typically arises only out of a contractual or agency relationship while phillips was authorized to use his ut email account and engage in other activities defined by ut acceptable computer use policy,he was never authorized to access txclass.the method of access he used makes this fact even more plain.in short,the government produced sufficient evidence at trial to support phillips conviction under a a ii.
constructive amendment of the indictment 
for the first time on appeal,phillips alleges as error that the district court constructively amended his indictment in its jury instructions.the district court charged the jury based on the government proposed instruction and a modified version of the eleventh circuit criminal pattern jury instruction that adopts language from a a i and b i.subsection i punishes an individual who knowingly causes the transmission of a program to a protected computer.phillips was indicted,however,not for knowingly transmitting a program under a a i,but for intentionally accessing a protected computer under a a ii.as phillips did not object to the instruction at trial,we review this disparity between the indictment and jury charge for plain error.united states bieganowski,cir constructive amendment claims raised for the first time on appeal reviewed for plain error.
phillips asserts that the deviation between the terms of the charged offense and the language of the jury instruction was plain and adversely affected his substantial rights in two ways.first,the jury instruction impermissibly reduced the government burden of proof by not requiring the jury to find that he intentionally accessed txclass without authorization,but instead only that he transmitted a program without authorization.second,phillips claims that while a a ii requires the government to prove that he intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization,the instruction required the jury to find only that phillips knowingly caused the transmission of a program,not that he knowingly did so without authorization.put otherwise,phillips argues that since a a ii scienter element applies to both the phrase causes the transmission and without authorization,the district court erred in submitting an instruction in which the scienter element applied only to the act of transmitting a program.
constructive amendment of an indictment occurs when the trial court through its instructions and facts it permits in evidence,allows proof of an essential element of the crime on an alternative basis provided by the statute but not charged in the indictment.united states slovacek,cir,cert.denied,d citing stirone united states,d.in evaluating whether constructive amendment has occurred,we consider whether the jury instruction,taken as a whole,is a correct statement of the law and whether it clearly instructs jurors as to the principles of law applicable to the factual issues confronting them.united states guidry,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
with respect to phillips first argument,the district court instruction plainly modified an essential element of the charged offense by supporting the act of accessing a protected computer under subsection ii on the basis of transmitting a program under subsection i.see,united states reyes,cir jury instruction permitting conviction based on proof of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana constructively amended indictment that charged not conspiracy,but the substantive offense itself.this was a classic constructive amendment.why the government overlooked the inconsistency between the statutory provision cited in the indictment and the provision described in the jury charge is a mystery.
we nonetheless find no reversible plain error with respect to the discrepancy.phillips gained access to txclass by the act of transmitting the attack program.the factual predicates for phillips particular conviction under the jury charge and the transmitting a program and intentionally accessing a protected identical.there is no conceivable basis upon which the jury could have concluded that phillips transmitted the program and obtained information from ut database without having also accessed a protected computer.the instruction on this element of the charged offense,although incorrect,was immaterial.
phillips second argument is that the indictment charged him with intentionally access ing a protected computer without authorization,while the jury instruction only required that he knowingly transmitted the program.
we agree that the plain language of the statute,tracked in the indictment,indicates that the actus reus was the intentional unauthorized access of a protected computer.in fact,the amendment to a changed the scienter requirement from knowingly to intentionally because of congress concern that the knowingly standard might be inappropriate for cases involving computer technology.see,at,as reprinted in,morris,at 
the district court instructed the jury that to convict,it must find that phillips knowingly caused the transmission of a program and that he so acted without the authorization of appropriate persons or entities.this instruction,as phillips contends,does not fully convey that the jury must find that phillips intentionally acted without authorization.however,as discussed above in the context of his sufficiency claim,the evidence leaves no doubt that phillips knew he was unauthorized to transmit an invasive computer program designed to gain access to the txclass system and to steal thousands of social security numbers.it beggars belief that,having transmitted such a program,phillips did not intend to access a protected computer and that he access be unauthorized to the extent the jury instructions were wrong,the errors did not affect phillips substantial rights.see bieganowski,supra.
offense instruction 
phillips next contends that the district court improperly failed to instruct the jury on a offense under a a iii,which is a misdemeanor phillips counsel actually raised t
