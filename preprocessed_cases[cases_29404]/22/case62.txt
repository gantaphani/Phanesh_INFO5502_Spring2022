this appeal requires us to clarify the contours of the safe harbor provision of the digital millennium copyright act dmca that limits the liability of online service providers for copyright infringement that occurs by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider.c

background 
a.the dmca safe harbors 
the dmca was enacted in to implement the world intellectual property organization copyright treaty,universal city studios,corley,cir,and to update domestic copyright law for the digital age,see ellison robertson,cir.title ii of the dmca,separately titled the online copyright infringement liability limitation act ocilla,was designed to clarif y the liability faced by service providers who transmit potentially infringing material over their networks.at.but r ather than embarking upon a wholesale clarification of various copyright doctrines,congress elected to leave current law in its evolving state and,instead,to create a series of safe harbors for certain common activities of service providers.id.at.to that end,ocilla established a series of four safe harbors that allow qualifying service providers to limit their liability for claims of copyright infringement based on a transitory digital network communications,b system caching,c information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users,and d information location tools.a d.
to qualify for protection under any of the safe harbors,a party must meet a set of threshold criteria.first,the party must in fact be a service provider,defined,in pertinent part,as a provider of online services or network access,or the operator of facilities therefor.k b.a party that qualifies as a service provider must also satisfy certain conditions of eligibility,including the adoption and reasonable implementation of a repeat infringer policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider system or network.id.i a.in addition,a qualifying service provider must accommodate standard technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works.id.i b,i.
beyond the threshold criteria,a service provider must satisfy the requirements of a particular safe harbor.in this case,the safe harbor at issue is c,which covers infringement claims that arise by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider.id.c.the c safe harbor will apply only if the service provider 
a i does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing 
ii in the absence of such actual knowledge,is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent or 
iii upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness,acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material 
b does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity and 
c upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph,responds expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.
id.c a c.section c also sets forth a detailed notification scheme that requires service providers to designate an agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement,id.c,and specifies the components of a proper notification,commonly known as a takedown notice,to that agent,see id.c.thus,actual knowledge of infringing material,awareness of facts or circumstances that make infringing activity apparent,or receipt of a takedown notice will each trigger an obligation to expeditiously remove the infringing material.
with the statutory context in mind,we now turn to the facts of this case.
factual background 
youtube was founded in february by chad hurley hurley,steve chen chen,and jawed karim karim,three former employees of the internet company paypal.when youtube announced the official launch of the website in december,a press release described youtube as a consumer media company that allows people to watch,upload,and share personal video clips at.under the slogan broadcast yourself,youtube achieved rapid prominence and profitability,eclipsing competitors such as google video and yahoo video by wide margins.in november,google acquired youtube in a transaction valued at billion.by march,at the time of summary judgment briefing in this litigation,site traffic on youtube had soared to more than billion daily video views,with more than hours of new video uploaded to the site every minute.
the basic function of the youtube website permits users to upload and view video clips free of charge.before uploading a video to youtube,a user must register and create an account with the website.the registration process requires the user to accept youtube terms of use agreement,which provides,inter alia,that the user will not submit material that is copyrighted unless he is the owner of such rights or ha s permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant youtube all of the license rights granted herein.when the registration process is complete,the user can sign in to his account,select a video to upload from the user personal computer,mobile phone,or other device,and instruct the youtube system to upload the video by clicking on a virtual upload button.
uploading a video to the youtube website triggers a series of automated software functions.during the upload process,youtube makes one or more exact copies of the video in its original file format.youtube also makes one or more additional copies of the video in flash format a process known as transcoding.the transcoding process ensures that youtube videos are available for viewing by most users at their request.the youtube system allows users to gain access to video content by streaming the video to the user computer in response to a playback request.youtube uses a computer algorithm to identify clips that are related to a video the user watches and display links to the related clips.
procedural history 
plaintiff viacom,an american media conglomerate,and various viacom affiliates filed suit against youtube on march,alleging direct and secondary copyright based on the public performance,display,and reproduction of their audiovisual works on the youtube website.plaintiff premier league,an english soccer league,and plaintiff bourne filed a putative class action against youtube on may,alleging direct and secondary copyright infringement on behalf of all copyright owners whose material was copied,stored,displayed,or performed on youtube without authorization.specifically at issue were some video clips identified by viacom,as well as additional clips jointly,the identified by the putative class plaintiffs.
the plaintiffs in both actions principally demanded statutory damages pursuant to c or,in the alternative,actual damages plus the defendants profits from the alleged infringement,as well as declaratory and injunctive relief judge stanton,to whom the viacom action was assigned,accepted the premier league class action as related.at the close of discovery,the parties in both actions for partial summary judgment with respect to the applicability of the dmca safe harbor defense 
in the june opinion,the district court denied the plaintiffs motions and granted summary judgment to the defendants,finding that youtube qualified for dmca safe harbor protection with respect to all claims of direct and secondary copyright infringement.viacom int l,d at.the district court prefaced its analysis of the dmca safe harbor by holding that,based on the plaintiffs summary judgment submissions,a jury could find that the defendants not only were generally aware of,but welcomed,material being placed on their website.id.at.however,the district court also noted that the defendants had properly designated an agent pursuant to c,and when they received specific notice that a particular item infringed a copyright,they swiftly removed it.id.at.accordingly,the district court identified the crux of the inquiry with respect to youtube copyright liability as follows 
t he critical question is whether the statutory phrases actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing,and facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent in c a i and ii mean a general awareness that there are infringements here,claimed to be widespread and common,or rather mean actual or constructive knowledge of specific and identifiable infringements of individual items.
id.after quoting at length from the legislative history of the dmca,the district court held that the phrases actual knowledge that the material or an activity is infringing,and facts or circumstances indicating infringing activity,describe knowledge of specific and identifiable infringements of particular individual items.id.at.mere knowledge of the prevalence of such activity in general,the district court concluded,is not enough.id.
in a final section labeled other points,the district court rejected two additional claims.first,it rejected the plaintiffs argument that the replication,transmittal and display of youtube videos are functions that fall outside the protection c affords for infringement of copyright by reason of storage at the direction of the user.id.at.second,it rejected the plaintiffs argument that youtube was ineligible for safe harbor protection under the control provision,holding that the right and ability to control infringing activity under c b requires knowledge thereof,because the provider must know of the particular case before he can control it.id.at.
following the june opinion,final judgment in favor of youtube was entered on august.these appeals followed.
discussion 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the party.see,paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir.summary judgment is proper only when,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.doninger niehof,cir quoting.a.
actual and red flag knowledge c a 
the first and most important question on appeal is whether the dmca safe harbor at issue requires actual knowledge or aware ness of facts or circumstances indicating specific and identifiable infringements,viacom,d at.we consider first the scope of the statutory provision and then its application to the record in this case.
the specificity requirement 
as in all statutory construction cases,we begin with the language of the statute,barnhart sigmon coal,d.under c a,safe harbor protection is available only if the service provider 
i does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing 
ii in the absence of such actual knowledge,is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent or 
iii upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness,acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material 
c a.as previously noted,the district court held that the statutory phrases actual knowledge that the material is infringing and facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent refer to knowledge of specific and identifiable infringements.viacom,d at.for the reasons that follow,we substantially affirm that holding.
although the parties marshal a battery of other arguments on appeal,it is the text of the statute that compels our conclusion.in particular,we are persuaded that the basic operation of c requires knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity.under c a,knowledge or awareness alone does not disqualify the service provider rather,the provider that gains knowledge or awareness of infringing activity retains protection if it acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material.c a iii.thus,the nature of the removal obligation itself contemplates knowledge or awareness of specific infringing material,because expeditious removal is possible only if the service provider knows with particularity which items to remove.indeed,to require expeditious removal in the absence of specific knowledge or awareness would be to mandate an amorphous obligation to take commercially reasonable steps in response to a generalized awareness of infringement.viacom br.such a view can not be reconciled with the language of the statute,which requires expeditious action to remove or disable the material at issue.c a iii emphasis added.
on appeal,the plaintiffs dispute this conclusion by drawing our attention to c a ii,the red flag knowledge provision.see id.c a ii limiting liability where,in the absence of such actual knowledge,the service provider is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.in their view,the use of the phrase facts or circumstances demonstrates that congress did not intend to limit the red flag provision to a particular type of knowledge.the plaintiffs contend that requiring awareness of specific infringements in order to establish aware ness of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent,c a ii,renders the red flag provision superfluous,because that provision would be satisfied only when the actual knowledge provision is also satisfied.for that reason,the plaintiffs urge the court to hold that the red flag provision requires less specificity than the actual knowledge provision.pls.supp.br.
this argument misconstrues the relationship between actual knowledge and red flag knowledge.it is true that we are required to disfavor interpretations of statutes that render language superfluous.ex rel.blumenthal dep t of the interior,cir quoting.bank germain,d.but contrary to the plaintiffs assertions,construing c a to require actual knowledge or awareness of specific instances of infringement does not render the red flag provision superfluous.the phrase actual knowledge,which appears in c a i,is frequently used to denote subjective belief.see,united states quinones,cir t he belief held by the defendant need not be reasonable in order for it to defeat actual knowledge.by contrast,courts often invoke the language of facts or circumstances,which appears in c a ii,in discussing an objective reasonableness standard.see,maxwell city of new york,cir police officers application of force is excessive if it is objectively unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.internal quotation marks omitted.
the difference between actual and red flag knowledge is thus not between specific and generalized knowledge,but instead between a subjective and an objective standard.in other words,the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or subjectively knew of specific infringement,while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement objectively obvious to a reasonable person.the red flag provision,because it incorporates an objective standard,is not swallowed up by the actual knowledge provision under our construction of the c safe harbor.both provisions do independent work,and both apply only to specific instances of infringement.
the limited body of case law interpreting the knowledge provisions of the c safe harbor comports with our view of the specificity requirement.most recently,a panel of the ninth circuit addressed the scope of c in umg recordings,shelter capital partners llc,cir,a copyright infringement case against veoh networks,a service similar to youtube as in this case,various music publishers brought suit against the service provider,claiming direct and secondary copyright infringement based on the presence of unauthorized content on the website,and the website operator sought refuge in the c safe harbor.the court of appeals affirmed the district court determination on summary judgment that the website operator was entitled to safe harbor protection.with respect to the actual knowledge provision,the panel declined to adopt a broad conception of the knowledge requirement,id.at,holding instead that the safe harbor r equir es specific knowledge of particular infringing activity,id.at.the court of appeals reach ed the same conclusion with respect to the red flag provision,noting that w e do not place the burden of determining whether materials are actually illegal on a service provider.id.at alterations in original quoting perfect,ccbil llc,cir.although shelter capital contains the most explicit discussion of the c knowledge provisions,other cases are generally in accord.see,capitol records,llc,d,wl,at,undoubtedly,is aware that some level of infringement occurs.but,there is no genuine dispute that did not have specific red flag knowledge with respect to any particular link umg recordings,veoh networks,d,umg ii i f investigation of facts and circumstances is required to identify material as infringing,then those facts and circumstances are not red flags.while we decline to adopt the reasoning of those decisions in toto,we note that no court has embraced the contrary proposition urged by the plaintiffs that the red flag provision requires less specificity than the actual knowledge provision.
based on the text of c a,as well as the limited case law on point,we affirm the district court holding that actual knowledge or awareness of facts or circumstances that indicate specific and identifiable instances of infringement will disqualify a service provider from the safe harbor.
the grant of summary judgment 
the corollary question on appeal is whether,under the foregoing construction of c a,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to youtube on the record presented.for the reasons that follow,we hold that although the district court correctly interpreted c a,summary judgment for the defendants was premature.
specific knowledge or awareness 
the plaintiffs argue that,even under the district court construction of the safe harbor,the record raises material issues of fact regarding youtube actual knowledge or red flag awareness of specific instances of infringement.to that end,the plaintiffs draw our attention to various estimates regarding the percentage of infringing content on the youtube website.for example,viacom cites evidence that youtube employees conducted website surveys and estimated that of all youtube streams contained copyrighted material.the class plaintiffs similarly claim that credit suisse,acting as financial advisor to google,estimated that more than of youtube content was premium copyrighted content and that only of the premium content was authorized.these approximations suggest that the defendants were conscious that significant quantities of material on the youtube website were infringing.see viacom int l,d at a jury could find that the defendants not only were generally aware of,but welcomed,material being placed on their website.but such estimates are insufficient,standing alone,to create a triable issue of fact as to whether youtube actually knew,or was aware of facts or circumstances that would indicate,the existence of particular instances of infringement.
beyond the survey results,the plaintiffs rely upon internal youtube communications that do refer to particular clips or groups of clips.the class plaintiffs argue that youtube was aware of specific infringing material because,inter alia,youtube attempted to search for specific premier league videos on the site in order to gauge their value based on video usage.in particular,the class plaintiffs cite a february,from patrick walker,director of video partnerships for google and youtube,requesting that his colleagues calculate the number of daily searches for the terms soccer,football,and premier league in preparation for a bid on the global rights to premier league content.on another occasion,walker requested that any clearly infringing,official broadcast footage from a list of top premier league clubs including liverpool football club,chelsea football club,manchester united football club,and arsenal football club be taken down in advance of a meeting with the heads of several major sports teams and leagues.youtube ultimately decided not to make a bid for the premier league rights but the infringing content allegedly remained on the website.
the record in the viacom action includes additional examples.for instance,youtube founder jawed karim prepared a report in march which stated that,a s of today,episodes and clips of the following shows can still be found on youtube family guy,south park,mtv cribs,daily show,reno,and dave chapelle sic.karim further opined that,although youtube is not legally required to monitor content and complies with dmca takedown requests,we would benefit from preemptively removing content that is blatantly illegal and likely to attract criticism.he also noted that a more thorough analysis of the issue would be required.at least some of the tv shows to which karim referred are owned by viacom.a reasonable juror could conclude from the march report that karim knew of the presence of material on youtube,since he presumably located specific clips of the shows in question before he could announce that youtube hosted the content a s of today.a reasonable juror could also conclude that karim believed the clips he located to be infringing since he refers to them as blatantly illegal,and that youtube did not remove the content from the website until conducting a more thorough analysis,thus exposing the company to liability in the interim.
furthermore,in a july,exchange,youtube founder chad hurley sent an to his with the subject line budlight commercials,and stated,we need to reject these too.steve chen responded,can we please leave these in a bit longer another week or two ca hurt.karim also replied,indicating that he added back in all bud videos.similarly,in an august,exchange,hurley urged his colleagues to start being diligent about rejecting copyrighted inappropriate content,noting that there is a cnn clip of the shuttle clip on the site today,if the boys from turner would come to the site,they might be pissed again,chen resisted 
but we should just keep that stuff on the site.i really do see what will happen.what someone from cnn sees it he happens to be someone with power he happens to want to take it down right away.he gets in touch with cnn legal.weeks later,we get a cease desist letter.we take the video down.
and again,karim agreed,indicating that the cnn space shuttle clip,i like.we can remove it once we bigger and better known,but for now that clip is fine.
upon a review of the record,we are persuaded that the plaintiffs may have raised a material issue of fact regarding youtube knowledge or awareness of specific instances of infringement.the foregoing premier league request the identification and removal of clearly infringing,official broadcast footage.the march report indicates karim awareness of specific clips that he perceived to be blatantly illegal.similarly,the bud light and space shuttle refer to particular clips in the context of correspondence about whether to remove infringing material from the website.on these facts,a reasonable juror could conclude that youtube had actual knowledge of specific infringing activity,or was at least aware of facts or circumstances from which specific infringing activity was apparent.see c a i ii.accordingly,we hold that summary judgment to youtube on all,especially in the absence of any detailed examination of the extensive record on summary judgment,was premature 
we hasten to note,however,that although the foregoing were annexed as exhibits to the summary judgment papers,it is unclear whether the clips referenced therein are among the current.by definition,only the current are at issue in this litigation.accordingly,we vacate the order granting summary judgment and instruct the district court to determine on remand whether any specific infringements of which youtube had knowledge or awareness correspond to the in these actions.
ii.willful blindness 
the plaintiffs further argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants despite evidence that youtube was willfully blind to specific infringing activity.on this issue of first impression,we consider the application of the common law willful blindness doctrine in the dmca context.
the principle that willful blindness is tantamount to knowledge is hardly novel.tiffany nj ebay,cir collecting cases see in re aimster copyright,cir willful blindness is knowledge,in copyright law as it is in the law generally.a person is willfully blind or engages in conscious avoidance amounting to knowledge where the person was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.united states aina marshall,cir quoting united states rodriguez,cir global tech appliances,seb,d applying the willful blindness doctrine in a patent infringement case.writing in the trademark infringement context,we have held that a service provider is not permitted willful blindness.when it has reason to suspect that users of its service are infringing a protected mark,it may not shield itself from learning of the particular infringing transactions by looking the other way.tiffany,at.
the dmca does not mention willful blindness.as a general matter,we interpret a statute to abrogate a common law principle only if the statute speak s directly to the question addressed by the common law.matar dichter,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the relevant question,therefore,is whether the dmca speak s directly to the principle of willful blindness.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the dmca provision most relevant to the abrogation inquiry is m,which provides that safe harbor protection shall not be conditioned on a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity,except to the extent consistent with a standard technical measure complying with the provisions of subsection i.m.section m is explicit dmca safe harbor protection can not be conditioned on affirmative monitoring by a service provider.for that reason,m is incompatible with a broad common law duty to monitor or otherwise seek out infringing activity based on general awareness that infringement may be occurring.that fact does not,however,dispose of the abrogation inquiry as previously noted,willful blindness can not be defined as an affirmative duty to monitor.see aina marshall,at holding that a person is willfully blind where he was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.because the statute does not speak directly to the willful blindness doctrine,m limits but does not abrogate the doctrine.accordingly,we hold that the willful blindness doctrine may be applied,in appropriate circumstances,to demonstrate knowledge or awareness of specific instances of infringement under the dmca.
the district court cited m for the proposition that safe harbor protection does not require affirmative monitoring,viacom,d at,but did not expressly address the principle of willful blindness or its relationship to the dmca safe harbors.as a result,whether the defendants made a deliberate effort to avoid guilty knowledge,in re aimster,at,remains a fact question for the district court to consider in the first instance on remand 
control and benefit c b 
apart from the foregoing knowledge provisions,the c safe harbor provides that an eligible service provider must not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity.c b.the district court addressed this issue in a single paragraph,quoting from c b,the control and benefit provision,and concluding that t he right and ability to control the activity requires knowledge of it,which must be.viacom,d at.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the district court erred by importing a specific knowledge requirement into the control and benefit provision,and we therefore remand for further on the issue of control.
right and ability to control infringing activity 
on appeal,the parties advocate two competing constructions of the right and ability to control infringing activity.c b.because each is fatally flawed,we reject both proposed constructions in favor of a inquiry to be conducted in the first instance by the district court.
the first construction,pressed by the defendants,is the one adopted by the district court,which held that the provider must know of the particular case before he can control it.viacom,d at.the ninth circuit recently agreed,holding that until the service provider becomes aware of specific unauthorized material,it can not exercise its power or authority over the specific infringing item.in practical terms,it does not have the kind of ability to control infringing activity the statute contemplates.umg recordings,shelter capital partners llc,cir.the trouble with this construction is that importing a specific knowledge requirement into c b renders the control provision duplicative of c a.any service provider that has knowledge of infringing activity and thereby obtains financial benefit would already be excluded from the safe harbor under c a for having specific knowledge of infringing material and failing to effect expeditious removal.no additional service provider would be excluded by c b that was not already excluded by c a.because statutory interpretations that render language superfluous are disfavored,ex rel.blumenthal,at,we reject the district court interpretation of the control provision.
the second construction,urged by the plaintiffs,is that the control provision codifies the common law doctrine of vicarious copyright liability.the common law imposes liability for vicarious copyright infringement w hen the right and ability to supervise coalesce with an obvious and direct financial interest in the exploitation of copyrighted materials even in the absence of actual knowledge that the copyright mono poly is being impaired.shapiro,bernstein green,cir metro goldwyn mayer studios grokster,d.to support their codification argument,the plaintiffs rely on a house report relating to a preliminary version of the dmca the right and ability to control language codifies the second element of vicarious liability subparagraph b is intended to preserve existing case law that examines all relevant aspects of the relationship between the primary and secondary infringer.i,at.in response,youtube notes that the codification reference was omitted from the committee reports describing the final legislation,and that congress ultimately abandoned any attempt to embark upon a wholesale clarification of vicarious liability,electing instead to create a series of safe harbors for certain common activities of service providers,at.
happily,the future of digital copyright law does not turn on the confused legislative history of the control provision.the general rule with respect to common law codification is that when congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of those terms.neder united states,d ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted.under the common law vicarious liability standard,t he ability to block infringers access to a particular environment for any reason whatsoever is evidence of the right and ability to supervise.arista records llc,d,alteration in original quoting a m records,napster,cir.to adopt that principle in the dmca context,however,would render the statute internally inconsistent.section c actually presumes that service providers have the ability to block access to infringing material.id.at see shelter capital,at.indeed,a service provider who has knowledge or awareness of infringing material or who receives a takedown notice from a copyright holder is required to remove,or disable access to,the material in order to claim the benefit of the safe harbor.c a iii c.but in taking such action,the service provider would in the plaintiffs analysis be admitting the right and ability to control the infringing material.thus,the prerequisite to safe harbor protection under c a iii c would at the same time be a disqualifier under c b.
moreover,if congress had intended c b to be coextensive with vicarious liability,the statute could have accomplished that result in a more direct manner.shelter capital,at.
it is conceivable that congress intended that service providers which receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity would not,under any circumstances,be able to qualify for the subsection c safe harbor.but if that was indeed their intention,it would have been far simpler and much more straightforward to simply say as much.
id.alteration in original quoting ellison robertson,d,aff in part and rev in part on different grounds,cir.
in any event,the foregoing tension elsewhere described as a predicament and a is sufficient to establish that the control provision dictates a departure from the common law vicarious liability standard,neder,at.accordingly,we conclude that the right and ability to control infringing activity under c b requires something more than the ability to remove or block access to materials posted on a service provider website,llc,wl,at accord wolk kodak imaging network,d,wl,at,umg ii,d at io,veoh networks,d,corbis,d,overruled on other grounds by cosmetic ideas,cir.the remaining and more difficult question is how to define the something more that is required.
to date,only one court has found that a service provider had the right and ability to control infringing activity under c b in perfect,cybernet ventures,d,the court found control where the service provider instituted a monitoring program by which user websites received detailed instructions regard ing issues of layout,appearance,and content.id.at.the service provider also forbade certain types of content and refused access to users who failed to comply with its instructions.id.similarly,inducement of copyright infringement under metro goldwyn mayer studios grokster,d,which premises liability on purposeful,culpable expression and conduct,id.at,might also rise to the level of control under c b.both of these examples involve a service provider exerting substantial influence on the activities of users,without necessarily or even frequently acquiring knowledge of specific infringing activity.
in light of our holding that c b does not include a specific knowledge requirement,we think it prudent to remand to the district court to consider in the first instance whether the plaintiffs have adduced sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that youtube had the right and ability to control the infringing activity and received a financial benefit directly attributable to that activity.
by reason of storage c 
the c safe harbor is only available when the infringement occurs by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider.c.in this case,the district court held that youtube software functions fell within the safe harbor for infringements that occur by reason of user storage,noting that a contrary holding would confine the word storage too narrowly to meet the statute purpose.viacom,d at.for the reasons that follow,we affirm that holding with respect to three of the challenged software functions the conversion or transcoding of videos into a standard display format,the playback of videos on watch pages,and the related videos function.we remand for further with respect to a fourth software function,involving the syndication of videos uploaded to youtube.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the structure and language of ocilla indicate that service providers seeking safe harbor under c are not limited to merely storing material.io,d at.the structure of the statute distinguishes between conduit only functions under a and the functions addressed by c and the other subsections.see n subsections a,b,c,and d describe separate and distinct functions for purposes of applying this section.most notably,ocilla contains two definitions of service provider.k a b.the narrower definition,which applies only to service providers falling under a,is limited to entities that offer the transmission,routing or providing of connections for digital online communications,between or among points specified by a user,of material of the user choosing,without modification to the content of the material as sent or received.id.k a emphasis added.no such limitation appears in the broader definition,which applies to service providers including youtube falling under c.under the broader definition,the term service provider means a provider of online services or network access,or the operator of facilities therefor,and includes an entity described in subparagraph a.id.k b.in the absence of a parallel limitation on the ability of a service provider to modify material,we conclude that c is clearly meant to cover more than mere electronic storage lockers.umg recordings,veoh networks,d,umg i.
the relevant case law makes clear that the c safe harbor extends to software functions performed for the purpose of facilitating access to material.see shelter capital,at.two of the software functions challenged here transcoding and playback were expressly considered by our sister circuit in shelter capital,which held that liability arising from these functions occurred by reason of the storage at the direction of a user.c see shelter capital,at,see also umg i,d at io group,d at.transcoding involves m aking copies of a video in a different encoding scheme in order to render the video viewable over the internet to most users.supp.joint app x i.the playback process invol
