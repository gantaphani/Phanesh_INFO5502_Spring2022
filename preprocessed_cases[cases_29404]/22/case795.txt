the three claim,in relevant part,screen recognition and terminal that download a screen of information from a remote mainframe computer onto a local personal computer pc.mainframe computers permit multiple users to simultaneously access one central computer.before the widespread use of pcs,each user would connect to the mainframe using a dumb terminal.a dumb terminal typically included a monitor for displaying text and a keyboard for data entry.a dumb terminal,as its name implies,did not process or reformat the data received from the mainframe.rather,the dumb terminal simply displayed the information from the mainframe.symmetrically,the dumb terminal sent all data entry back to the mainframe for processing.because a dumb terminal monitor generally was a monochromatic green,the display was called a green screen.
gradually,pcs replaced dumb terminals.unlike a dumb terminal,a pc does not merely send and receive information.rather,a pc uses software to facilitate communication to and from the mainframe.with that software,a pc does not simply mimic a dumb terminal,but processes the information into a graphical user interface gui format,which is much more.although the gui format displays and receives information to and from the user,the pc still sends and receives information only in the manner understood by the mainframe,as if a dumb terminal were connected to the mainframe.in relevant part,the asserted patents specifically facilitate recognition of the information that the mainframe sends to the pc.
in a prior art technique of screen recognition,the mainframe would send a screen identification screen id,along with other information,to the local pc.once it received the screen id,the pc would display the information in a predetermined manner.if the screen id changed,the manner of display would also change.the patent describes three potential problems with this prior art technique.first,the mainframe must send a screen id so that the pc can properly display the information.if the pc does not download a screen id,the display routine does not know how the screen of information should be displayed.patent,ll.next,the application can not change without also changing the screen id.if fields within the screen of information have either been added or deleted,the pc will not display those additions or deletions.id.at.and finally,changes to the application at the mainframe are not dynamic.for example,i f the remote application at the host is changed,the display routine must be rewritten to i recognize new fields and ii not display fields which are no longer present.additionally,new programming at the host application may be required in order to provide a new screen id number.id.at,ll.
to avoid these problems,the patent relates to a display routine which is based upon an algorithm which recognizes the screen by the layout and fields therein,not based solely upon the particular screen id number.id.at,ll.the asserted of the patent,claim of the patent,and claim of the require an algorithm that recognizes the screen based on the information downloaded from the mainframe to the pc.
in construing these claims,the district court at the parties behest primarily focused on claim of the patent because that claim is the independent claim upon which claim depends and because the other two patents specifications refer to the patent.the patent is a of the patent.the patent,however,is not part of the patent family.although its construction focused on claim of the patent,the district court also addressed similar limitations present in the claims of the and patents.thus,the trial court construed claim of the patent 
a user terminal for connecting to a remote host comprising 
means for receiving information to be displayed as a first image on a screen 
means for processing said information to generate a screen identification id from said first image,said id being generated as a function of the number,location,and length of each field in said first image said id uniquely identifying said first image 
means for comparing said generated id to a list of stored ids,and for selecting display parameters associated with a stored id which matches said generated id and 
means for displaying said information on a user display as a second image having display parameters associated with said stored id,said second image being determined based upon the generated id.
the trial court also construed claim of the patent 
apparatus for implementing a computer terminal to be connected to a remote computer,said apparatus comprising 
means for identifying a particular user logged on to said remote computer through said computer terminal 
means for identifying,based upon a position,length and type of each of a plurality of fields,a particular screen to be displayed to said user and 
a plurality of special function keys,each key performing a specified function,the specified function performed by each key being determined by the particular user logged on and the particular screen identified to be displayed.
finally,the trial court construed claim of the patent 
the method of communicating between a host computer and a remote terminal over a data network comprising steps of 
establishing a first communication session between said terminal and a communications server via a first communications channel 
downloading,from said server to said terminal,communications software for communicating between said terminal and said host and a plurality of specific screen identifying information 
utilizing said communications software to implement a second communications session between said terminal and said host via a second communications channel independent of said server 
receiving a screen from said host to said terminal 
if said received screen matches one of the plurality of specific screen identifying information,displaying a customized gui screen and 
if said received screen does not match one of the plurality of specific screen identifying information,displaying a default gui screen.
the parties requested the district court to construe information,which appears in the and patents claims.this term does not appear in the patent claim.the district court first construed claim of the patent to refer to the entire layout of a green screen includ ing,for the purposes of generating a screen id,at least the number,length,and location of all fields of data on a screen.claim construction,slip op.at emphasis added.the district court also construed claim of the patent to refer to the type of every field of the green screen.id.emphasis added.finally,the district court construed claim of the patent congruently to claim of the patent,holding that all fields on the screen are utilized.id.at emphasis added.thus,the district court limited all three of the claims to systems and methods that use all fields or every field,and not merely some fields,to identify an incoming screen.this court has jurisdiction over resqnet appeal under a.
this court reviews claim construction decisions without deference.cybor fas,en banc.this court discerns the meaning of claim language according to its usage and context.a fundamental principle for discerning the usage of claim language is the ordinary and accustomed meaning of the words amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of invention.see rexnord laitram.indeed,normal rules of usage suggest a heavy presumption that claim terms carry their accustomed meaning in the relevant community at the relevant time.ccs fitness,brunswick,citing johnson worldwide,zebco.in ascertaining the accustomed usage of the relevant community at the relevant time,dictionaries and treatises may also assist the courts.digital,telegenix.of course,a patent applicant may overcome this presumption by clearly using a word in the specification,prosecution history,or both in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning.boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,citing teleflex,ficosa am.in other words,a patent applicant may consistently and clearly use a term in a manner either more or less expansive than its general usage in the relevant community,and thus expand or limit the scope of the term in the context of the patent claims.middleton.mining,explaining that in order to disavow claim scope,a patent applicant must clearly and unambiguously express surrender of subject matter during prosecution ballard med.prods.allegiance healthcare,noting that an applicant may disclaim claim scope during prosecution.thus,the specification may limit the scope of a claim if the patentee has disavowed or disclaimed the scope by using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction,representing a clear disavowal of claim scope.teleflex,at.similarly,analogous to the restrained use of the specification,the prosecution history may limit the scope of the claims if the alleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution are both clear and unmistakable.omega eng g,raytek.
claim of the patent 
claim of the patent contains limitations in format.ordinarily,a claim in that format covers only the corresponding structure disclosed in the written description,as well as that structure equivalents.see,budde.for claim of the patent,the function is processing said information to generate a screen identification id from said first image.patent,ll.the structure corresponding to that function is an algorithm which recognizes the screen layout and fields therein,not based solely upon the particular screen id.patent,ll.neither the function nor its supporting structure alone,however,helps this court resolve the claim construction issue.
the district court cogently identified the issue as whether the algorithm discussed in the specification evaluates attributes of all of the fields of an incoming screen of data or simply attributes of some of the fields in order to uniquely identify the incoming screen.claim construction,slip.op.at emphases added.in the phrase immediately following the functional language,the claim recites,said id being generated as a function of the number,location,and length of each field in said first image.patent,ll.emphasis added.this language shows that the claimed algorithm evaluates attributes of each and every field in the information to be displayed,the first image.see patent,ll.information to be displayed as a first image on a screen.accordingly,the language of claim of the patent requires the claimed algorithm to use all fields in the information from the mainframe.
the specification confirms the all fields requirement in the claim.in describing the determination of the screen id,the specification provides that the particular screen is identified by its layout,fields,as will be described in more detail later.patent,ll.following up on the promise of more detail,the specification sets forth only one embodiment of the algorithm 
the particular algorithm used to recognize the screen and generate the screen id may vary from system to system,but a particular such algorithm will now be described.the screen recognition algorithm is based on a combination of information available to the program from the display buffer sent by the remote computer,plus information entered by the user.from the display buffer,the program derives the following information 
a number of fields on the screen 
b type of each field 
c coordinates of the fields row,column 
d length of the field 
when a screen is received in the buffer,the above parameters are determined in order to generate a unique screen id.
patent,ll.with the words each field and fields,this passage suggests that characteristics of all,not just some,fields are inputs into the algorithm.nowhere does the specification suggest otherwise.
furthermore,the specification identifies three problems in the prior art,only two of which would be overcome if the claim were construed as utilizing less than all fields in the information sent by the mainframe.the potentially unsolved problem relates specifically to a change in the application without a concomitant change in the screen id.the patent explains 
another major problem with the above prior art arrangement is that if the application is changed,no display or a meaningless display may result.specifically,suppose that the application running on the remote host were changed so that several fields were removed other fields were added.suppose further that the screen i d,associated with the screen was not modified.
the display routine would simply recognize the screen id and attempt to display the screen of information in a manner prescribed for a screen with that particular id.however,the display routine will be looking for fields which are not present in buffer if these fields have been deleted,or alternatively,will not display fields which are contained within buffer if fields have been added at the remote application.other problems may arise if the location of fields on the screen being received from the remote host has changed.in any case,the user may see a screen with missing information,or with information which is irrelevant such as random characters which the display routine believes is meaningful information.
patent.the patent further explains accordingly,if the screen id number remains the same but the application is altered such that fields are added,removed,the screen will be recognized as a new screen since a different screen id will be generated and the changes in sic,to the field s will be nonetheless properly displayed.patent,ll.thus,if the application requires either greater or fewer fields,the display to the user may not reflect those changes 
construing the claim to solve all three problems in this case merely confirms the meaning of the claim language.therefore,this reasoning does not run afoul of the general rule that limitations should not be imported from the specification based solely on overcoming problems in the prior art.see,the court task is not to limit claim language to exclude particular devices because they do not serve a perceived purpose of the invention.resonate alteon websystems,the issue at this point may be stated thus when the written description sets out two different problems present in the prior art,is it necessary that the invention claimed,and thus each and every claim in the patent,address both problems we conclude that on the record in this case,the answer is no.honeywell victor of japan.that rule,of course,is a corollary of the broader principle against importing limitations from the specification into the claims.comark communications harris.to repeat,however,in this case,the specification,including those portions relating to extant problems in prior art,properly confirms the meaning of claim language.see also union oil of cal.atl.richfield,cert.denied,d confirming the claim interpretation by referring to the problem that the invention overcomes eastman kodak goodyear tire rubber,overruled in part on other grounds by cybor,at,the specification,of which the claims are part,teaches about the problems solved by the claimed invention,the way the claimed invention solves those problems,and the prior art that relates to the invention.these teachings provide valuable context for the meaning of the claim language.
the prosecution history further confirms the meaning of the claim language.see rexnord,at.the examiner rejected the original claims corresponding to the issued claims in view of united states patent to aihara et aihara.the patentee distinguished aihara because that reference would not resolve the problems identified in the specification.emphasizing the potentially unsolved problem described above,the patentee explained 
such problems include,for example,if the application screen is changed at the mainframe,but the screen id is not changed,then the personal computer will display meaningless and garbled charac
