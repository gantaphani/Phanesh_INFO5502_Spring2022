petitioner global naps,gnaps seeks review of a federal communications commission fcc ruling that gnaps tariff for traffic was facially invalid under fcc regulations.gnaps raises both procedural and substantive challenges to the fcc order.specifically,gnaps contends that the fcc violated its own rules and due process requirements in voiding the tariff,misconstrued the tariff terms,and improperly invalidated the tariff retroactively.we hold that the fcc did not deprive gnaps of due process,did not exceed its authority by invalidating the tariff,and reasonably declared gnaps tariff unlawful.therefore we uphold the fcc order and deny the petition for review.
background 
statutory regulatory.reciprocal compensation 
under section b of the telecommunications act of,local exchange carriers lecs are required to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications.b.this means that when a customer of carrier x calls a customer of carrier y who is within the same local calling area,carrier x pays carrier y for completing,or terminating,the call.the fcc interprets this requirement to apply only to local is,calls that originate and terminate within a local area.the reciprocal compensation requirement do es not apply to the transport or termination of interstate or intrastate interexchange traffic.in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecom.act of,wl subsequent history omitted.
under the act,carriers are expected to negotiate the rate and terms of reciprocal compensation.if the carriers are unable to reach agreement,they may submit the contested issues to arbitration by the relevant state public utility commission puc.e.once the puc approves an interconnection agreement,it is charged with interpreting and enforcing the agreement,but the puc determinations are subject to review in federal court for consistency with the act.see e.
in february,the fcc published an order holding that calls to internet service providers isps are not local on the theory that such traffic does not originate and terminate in the same local calling area,and is therefore not covered by the reciprocal compensation obligation.see in re implementation of the local competition provisions in the telecom.act of,compensation for traffic,wl reciprocal compensation ruling.while the call to the isp may be local,the fcc concluded that the terminating end of the call is actually the site reached by the internet connection.the fcc noted that there was no federal rule governing intercarrier compensation for traffic,but held that carriers would be bound to provide compensation as provided under their respective interconnection agreements as interpreted by state pucs.id.at.the fcc also initiated a rulemaking on an appropriate federal compensation mechanism.id.at.while this rulemaking was underway,the affected lecs petitioned this court for review of the fcc decision.we vacated and remanded the order for the commission failure to provide an adequate explanation as to why calls were not treated as local calls.see bell atlantic.fcc.
tariff requirements 
under section b of the telecommunications act,all interstate communications charges,practices,classifications,and regulations must be just and reasonable.b.carriers must publish rate tariffs before they go into effect.published tariffs must contain clear and explicit explanatory statements regarding the rates and regulations.a.tariffs may not make reference to any other tariff publication or to any other document or instrument.id.at a.tariffs filed by nondominant carriers,such as gnaps,take effect on only one day notice.such tariffs receive streamlined review and are presumed lawful by the commission.failure to comply with the relevant regulatory provisions may be grounds for rejection of the tariff.id.at b.
relevant facts 
gnaps is a competitive local exchange carrier clec in several states.gnaps and intervenor verizon,an lec formerly known as bell atlantic,have interconnection agreements in several states.in april,the two carriers entered into an interconnection agreement including a provision that r eciprocal compensation only applies to the transport and termination of local traffic defined as a call which is originated and terminated within a given local access and transport area or lata in massachusetts.the parties did not agree as to whether the agreement reciprocal compensation provisions covered traffic,but agreed to abide by the interpretation of the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte the massachusetts either the agreement or identical language in other agreements to which verizon was a party.
on october,dte ruled that verizon was required to pay reciprocal compensation for the delivery of internetbound traffic by mci worldcom.complaint of mci worldcom.at the time,dte directed verizon to pay reciprocal compensation to other lecs with which it had similar agreements within the state.shortly thereafter,however,the fcc published the reciprocal compensation ruling declaring that traffic is interstate,not local.dte responded on may,by vacating its october decision and declaring that verizon was not required to pay reciprocal compensation for traffic,but may be required to pay compensation under the interconnection agreement.complaint of mci worldcom.may.on february,after this court vacated the fcc order,dte reaffirmed its may ruling,but this ruling is the subject of ongoing litigation.complaint of mci worldcom.
on april,while the dte proceedings were underway and before the dte vacated its initial decision gnaps filed a tariff imposing an per minute charge on the delivery of all calls for which gnaps does not receive compensation under the terms of an interconnection agreement.the tariff further provided that a carrier f ailure to actually compensate gnaps for traffic as local traffic under the terms of an interconnection agreement shall constitute an election to compensate gnaps under the terms of this tariff.on may,gnaps billed verizon under this tariff over million for fifteen days of service.verizon refused to pay.
c.the fcc proceedings 
on july,verizon filed a complaint against gnaps tariff under section of the communications act.verizon alleged that the tariff was inconsistent with fcc rules insofar as the fcc exempted isps from access charges and provided for joint provision of access service to interexchange carriers,the tariff preempted state determination of compensation for interstate traffic,the tariff made verizon an involuntary gnaps customer,and the tariff imposed excessive rates.specifically,verizon alleged gnaps has no right to circumvent the negotiation and arbitration process that the dte and this commission have directed it to follow by unilaterally filing a federal tariff.after a status conference,the fcc directed briefing on ten issues concerning the legality of the tariff and the applicability of specific fcc rules,including why global naps filed a federal tariff and whether that was reasonable.in re bell.
on december,the fcc declared gnaps tariff unlawful under section b and void ab initio.in re bell,et global naps,memorandum opinion and order,wl order.the fcc found that the challenged tariff provisions violated the requirement of that tariffs be clear and explicit because those tariff provisions condition the imposition of charges on circumstances that were indeterminate when the tariff took effect and remain indeterminate today.id.additionally,the fcc found that the tariff impermissibly another this case the interconnection agreement between gnaps and violation of a.the commission noted that at the time the tariff was filed,the parties did not know whether gnaps would receive reciprocal compensation from verizon for traffic because the dte proceedings were still underway.
on january,gnaps petitioned for reconsideration of the fcc order.gnaps raised several arguments.first,gnaps argued that in basing its decision on grounds not raised by verizon or briefed by either party,the fcc denied gnaps its right to notice and due process and illegally relieved verizon of its burden of proof.gnaps further argued that the fc
