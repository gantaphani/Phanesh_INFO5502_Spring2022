defendant was convicted of violating penal code section,subdivision a which prohibits contacting a minor for the purpose of committing various crimes,including,as alleged here,sexual penetration with a person under the age of years,subd.h.the court ordered defendant placed on formal probation for five years subject to various conditions,including that defendant serve days in the orange county jail.
defendant interactions with the victim,whom we refer to as jane doe,were entirely over the internet,primarily through chat rooms.at the time he met jane doe,she was years old and he was years old,but he represented himself to be only two or three years older than her.the two developed a close relationship,and when jane doe was years old,they began having cybersex,which involved watching pornographic videos together,describing various sexual acts they would do to one another,and masturbating together.defendant was in california during these online interactions,and jane doe was in indiana.
defendant raises numerous contentions on appeal.he contends jane doe is not a minor because the age of consent in indiana is years old,and that,in any event,he could not have caused the sexual penetration from thousands of miles away.he also contends his conviction under section violates his constitutional rights to equal protection,privacy,and free speech,and that it violates the dormant commerce clause.
we affirm.defendant seduction of jane doe under false pretenses,together with his repeated suggestions that she masturbate,satisfied the statutory elements of intending to participate in causing sexual penetration.even if jane doe was an adult for purposes of applying indiana law,she was a minor for purposes of applying california law.and we reject the various constitutional challenges defendant raises to the validity of section and his conviction in particular.
jane doe met defendant in an internet chat room a few weeks before her birthday,shortly after starting high school.the school was a boarding school in indiana and she was horribly home sick.she had two solaces one was her participation in volleyball at school,the other was that she,in her words,met somebody that i felt i could really talk to and relate a little bit and they seemed to care,defendant identified himself as todd christopher elliott and claimed he was only two or three years older than her.he claimed to be living in huntington beach with an uncle.early in the relationship he sent photographs of a young man that he claimed were of him.in reality,his name is mark irving shapiro and he was approximately years old at the time.jane doe told defendant her real age.
initially,they would chat a few times per week,talking about all aspects of their life.he claimed to run track and expressed an interest in the wizard of oz.their conversations were not initially sexual.they would send each other little gifts in the mail,including,in one instance,him sending her flowers,and in another instance her sending him a drawing of him.they would send photos to one another and acknowledge each other birthday.the frequency of their chats increased over time to the point where,by the age of,they were chatting every day,on average three hours per day.at the age of,she felt she was in love with him.as she explained,i was convinced that i was in love with him and i really trusted him because he was somebody i could really talk to and before i never really had somebody i could talk to about anything or all my problems.by the time she was years old,the two were saying i love you to each other and using pet names.
when jane doe was years old,the relationship turned sexual.defendant began by encouraging her to talk about sexual things because,as she recounted his explanation,everybody needs somebody to talk to about those kind of things and it was to help me out.he began sending her links to pornographic videos.he tried to make it clear that the intention was not to be sexual but obviously it felt pretty sexual.he explained to her that it okay to masturbate and everybody should do that because it good for you.these sorts of conversations became commonplace,occurring several times per week.around this time he sent her a picture of a young man,who he claimed to be him,with his penis exposed.
these conversations evolved from him suggesting masturbation to the two of them describing various erotic scenarios involving sexual intercourse between the two of them.they both acknowledged masturbating while having these chats.he also began offering more detailed recommendations about how to achieve an orgasm,such as by penetrating herself with the handle of a hairbrush.he would make these sorts of recommendations frequently.this transition from simply recommending masturbation to discussing erotic scenarios and recommending penetration with a hair brush occurred within a few weeks.
by the time of july,jane doe relationship with family and friends had deteriorated as a result of her increasing obsession with her relationship with todd elliott.she was not spending much time with family and friends because they disapproved of the relationship,and defendant would get mad if she did not check in on a regular basis.she decided she would rather upset her friends and family than him.
around that time jane doe mother grew concerned.on a family vacation jane doe spent the entire time on a cell phone chatting with todd elliott.jane doe then sued her father to obtain information about her trust fund,and in general her mother noticed a radical change in jane doe personality.these occurrences prompted her mother and father to hire a private investigator to look into todd elliott background.the investigator installed onto jane doe computer a keystroke logger and a program to retrieve deleted files.
as a result of the investigation,they discovered todd elliot was in fact the defendant mark shapiro,an older man.they then hired a counselor for jane doe to discuss the findings.they also took her computer away.afterwards,defendant warned jane doe that her parents claims were all lies,and at some point her saying,days until you are,and you will be free to make your own decisions.two or three weeks later,defendant admitted the truth.
after learning the truth about defendant,jane doe,in her words,did go and talk to him like an idiot and i was actually fine with it.i talked to him because i had always assured him it did matter what age he was,that i loved him,and age did make a difference,she continued talking with him for a few months,until she was approximately years old.
in january a huntington beach police detective searched defendant house and found a computer containing files with images of a nude female bearing jane doe name.there was another file folder labeled todd with pictures in it.
prior to trial,defendant filed a nonstatutory motion to dismiss,raising many of the same arguments raised in this appeal,which the court denied.the prosecutor moved in limine to exclude any mention of the fact that the age of consent in indiana is years old,which the court granted.the court also excluded a jury instruction that would have informed the jury that the age of consent in indiana is years old.defendant timely appealed the judgment.
discussion 
legal principles 
section,subdivision a states,every person who contacts or communicates with a minor,or attempts to contact or communicate with a minor,who knows or reasonably should know that the person is a minor,with intent to commit an offense specified in section,or involving the minor shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for the term prescribed for an attempt to commit the intended offense.here,the target offense was section,subdivision h,which states,except as provided in section,any person who participates in an act of sexual penetration with another person who is under years of age shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or in a county jail for a period of not more than one year.sexual penetration,as used in the statute,means,the act of causing the penetration,however slight,of the genital or anal opening of any person or causing another person to so penetrate the defendant or another person genital or anal opening for the purpose of sexual arousal,gratification,or abuse by any foreign object,substance,instrument,or device,or by any unknown object,subd.k.a foreign object has been held to include one own finger.people keeney th.putting these legal principles together,the prosecution theory at trial was that defendant violated section,subdivision a,by communicating with jane doe with the intent to seduce her and convince her to masturbate.
defendant intended to participate in an act of sexual penetration 
defendant first contends he can not be found guilty of attempting to violate section,subdivision h,because he did not intend to participate in an act of sexual penetration.nor,he claims,did he intend to engage in the act of caus ing jane doe to penetrate herself,as that term is used in section,subdivision k.he argues,defendant was thousands of miles away.he could not possibly have caused the penetration the act of was entirely consensual.it was completely voluntary.jane doe was alone at the time and not subject to any coercion of any kind.she decided to do it and then did it.thus,jane doe caused the sexual penetration,not defendant.
defendant takes too narrow a view of the law.taken together,the statutes require the people to prove that defendant intended to participate in the act of causing the sexual penetration.they do not require that defendant intended to have physically caused the penetration.indeed,sexual penetration includes causing another person to accomplish the penetration,subd.k.thus it is clear that defendant need not accomplish the penetration personally.
the question is,what conduct short of physically causing the penetration constitutes participation in the act of causing the penetration defendant contends,the statute makes no provision for criminally punishing a person who merely invites or encourages another person to sexually penetrate himself or herself and this court should not read such a provision into the statute.
we need not decide whether mere encouragement to masturbate would satisfy section,subdivision h,because defendant conduct here was far more pervasive and,we conclude,did come within the scope of the statute.defendant ingratiated himself with jane doe by false pretenses,pretending to be a young man only a few years older than her.he seduced her and nurtured such a strong relationship that jane doe thought she was in love with this nonexistent person.defendant then used the influence of the trust he had engendered to inundate her with sexual content,such as repeated suggestions that she masturbate,explicit sexual communications,pornographic videos,and fictional short stories of extremely graphic,erotic encounters between the two.he moved quickly from simply encouraging her to masturbate,to engaging in cybersex for his own sexual gratification.he was not a teacher simply offering an opinion on the benefits of masturbation.his conduct satisfies the requirement of intending to participate in the act causing the sexual penetration.
defendant conviction did not violate the equal protection clause 
next,defendant contends his conviction violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution,and article,section of the california constitution.defendant explains his argument by way of two hypothetical examples.person a and person b are both located in california,and each communicates with a year old female in indiana.person a suggests to the female in indiana that she masturbate by.person b tells the female he will come to indiana and have sexual intercourse with her.u nquestionably person b has committed no crime.the reason person b has committed no crime is that section prohibits communications with minors for the purpose of participating in several target crimes,but section sex with a minor statutory rape is not listed among the target crimes.by contrast,person a can be prosecuted in california for a criminal offense under section,subdivision a,with section,subdivision h,as the target offense engaging in sexual intercourse is unquestionably more serious sexual conduct than encouraging another person to masturbate.therefore,it violates person a right to equal protection to convict him.and since defendant is in person a position,his conviction should be overturned.
while we commend defense counsel for his clever argument,as we will explain,it is not sound.
the concept of the equal protection of the laws compels recognition of the proposition that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.citation.the first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection clause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.citations.this initial inquiry is not whether persons are similarly situated for all purposes,but whether they are similarly situated for purposes of the law challenged.cooley superior court cal th.in people hofsheier cal th hofsheier,the court analyzed whether persons convicted of section,subdivision b oral copulation with a minor and section statutory rape were similarly situated and concluded they were the only difference between the two offenses is the nature of the sexual act.thus,persons convicted of oral copulation with minors and persons convicted of sexual intercourse with minors are sufficiently similar to merit application of some level of scrutiny to determine whether distinctions between the two groups justify the unequal treatment.hofsheier,at.similarly here,the individuals described in defendant hypothetical are sufficiently similarly situated to warrant scrutiny under the equal protection clause.
in resolving equal protection issues,the united states supreme court has used three levels of analysis.distinctions in statutes that involve suspect classifications or touch upon fundamental interests are subject to strict scrutiny,and can be sustained only if they are necessary to achieve a compelling state interest.classifications based on gender are subject to an intermediate level of review.but most legislation is tested only to determine if the challenged classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.hofscheier,supra,cal th at.classifying sex offenders according to the nature of their act does not involve suspect classifications,and thus the rational basis test applies.
is there any rational basis for criminalizing communications intent on sexual penetration but not communications intent on sexual intercourse we believe there is,based on the definition of sexual penetration.it includes both anal and vaginal penetration,and also penetration by any foreign object,substance,instrument,or device,or by any unknown object,subd.k.foreign objects may be of varying degrees of size,shape,or texture,and thus present potential dangers to a minor genitals or anal opening greater than simple consensual intercourse.thus the legislature could rationally conclude that vaginal or anal penetration with a foreign object is more harmful than intercourse between a or year old minor and an adult 
nor is there any constitutional violation as applied to this case.defendant framed his hypothetical in terms of a man who simply encouraged a year old to masturbate,but here defendant encouraged jane doe to penetrate herself with the handle of a hair brush,precisely the sort of foreign object a legislature could conclude is potentially more harmful than intercourse.accordingly,defendant conviction did not violate his right to equal protection under the law.
the legislative intent in passing section does not require reversal 
next defendant contends the conviction must be set aside because the legislative intent of voters in passing proposition the sexual predator punishment and control act jessica law,which included section,was to protect california minors,and only california minors.in support,defendant cites various ballot arguments and background materials that express a concern for protecting california children.
defendant argument is ultimately based on statutory inter
