plaintiffs,retired general charles chuck yeager and his foundation,appeal the district court order granting summary judgment to defendants ed and connie bowlin.yeager contends that the district court should not have struck his declaration,which contains comprehensive details he did not remember at his deposition.he also contends that,under california rule,the bowlins republished statements about him on their website and thereby restarted the statute of limitations when they modified unrelated information on their website.we reject both arguments and affirm the district court 
background 
yeager is a recognized figure in aviation history.the bowlins are retired commercial airline captains who became friends with yeager in the.the bowlins own aviation autographs,which sells memorabilia,including items related to or signed by yeager.
in,yeager brought eleven claims against the bowlins,including violations of the federal lanham act,california common law right to privacy and california statutory right to publicity,cal.at his deposition in this action,yeager did not recall answers to approximately two hundred questions,including questions on topics central to this action.approximately three months later,on the same day that he filed his opposition to the bowlins motion for summary judgment,yeager filed a declaration.the declaration contains many facts that yeager could not remember at his deposition,even when he was shown exhibits in an attempt to refresh his recollection.
the district court held that yeager declaration was a sham and,for summary judgment purposes,disregarded it where it contained facts that yeager could not remember at his deposition.the district court granted the bowlins motion for summary judgment on all claims.it held that yeager claims under california common law right to privacy and california statutory right to publicity,cal,were.
yeager timely appealed.
ii.standards of review 
questions of law decided on summary judgment are reviewed de novo.sullivan dollar tree stores,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
we,apparently,have not yet decided the standard which governs our review of a district court invocation of the sham affidavit rule.we have,however,implied that review is for abuse of discretion.see van asdale int l game,cir noting two important limitations on a district court discretion to invoke the sham affidavit rule.moreover,we review for abuse of discretion r ulings regarding evidence made in the context of summary judgment wong regents of the of,cir.we thus conclude that a district court decision whether to apply the sham affidavit rule should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.under that standard,we first determine de novo whether the trial court identified the correct legal rule to apply to the relief requested.united states hinkson,cir en banc.if it did we then determine whether the trial court application of the correct legal standard was illogical,implausible,or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.sham declaration 
yeager argues that his declaration can not be a sham because he did not declare facts which contradict facts he testified to at his deposition.we disagree.
the general rule in the ninth circuit is that a party can not create an issue of fact by an affidavit contradicting his prior deposition testimony.van asdale,at quoting kennedy allied mut.ins,cir.this sham affidavit rule prevents a party who has been examined at length on deposition from rais ing an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony,which would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact.kennedy,at internal quotation marks omitted see also van asdale,at stating that some form of the sham affidavit rule is necessary to maintain the principle that summary judgment is an integral part of the federal rules.but the sham affidavit rule should be applied with caution because it is in tension with the principle that the court is not to make credibility determinations when granting or denying summary judgment.id.quoting sch.dist.acands,cir,in order to trigger the sham affidavit rule,the district court must make a factual determination that the contradiction is a sham,and the inconsistency between a party deposition testimony and subsequent affidavit must be clear and unambiguous to justify striking the affidavit.id.at.
according to the district court,the deponent remember ed almost nothing about the events central to the case during his deposition,but suddenly recall ed those same events with perfect clarity in his declaration in opposition to summary judgment without any credible explanation as to how his recollection was refreshed.during his deposition,yeager responded that he did not recall answers to approximately different questions.for example,yeager stated that he did not recall significant or events in the recent past,such as testifying in court or his involvement in a plane crash.in his declaration,yeager provided no reason for his sudden ability to recall specific facts that he could not recall during his deposition other than stating that since his deposition he reviewed several documents that have refreshed his recollection about some things he did not recall.the district court found this explanation to be unbelievable given that yeager was shown over twenty exhibits during his deposition in an attempt to refresh his recollection.
several of our cases indicate that a district court may find a declaration to be a sham when it contains facts that the affiant previously testified he could not remember.in scamihorn general truck drivers,we implied this result in dicta when we noted that a declaration could be considered a sham if the declarant provides information which he had testified he could not recall,cir.we have also held that a witness can be punished for contempt of court when he refuses to give information which in the nature of things he should know.collins united states,cir.in collins,we quoted learned hand example that to evade contempt of court it could not be enough for a witness to say that he did not remember where he had slept the night before,if he was sane and sober id.quoting united states appel.the utility of the sham affidavit rule to maintain summary judgment as integral to the federal rules,van asdale,at,would be undermined if we were to hold that the rule did not apply in this case.
we caution that facts,or new facts,accompanied by a reasonable explanation,should not ordinarily lead to the striking of a declaration as a sham.see cleveland policy mgmt,stating the general rule that parties may explain or attempt to resolve contradictions with an explanation that is sufficiently reasonable.t he party is not precluded from elaborating upon,explaining or clarifying prior testimony elicited by opposing counsel on deposition and minor inconsistencies that result from an honest discrepancy,a mistake,or newly discovered evidence afford no basis for excluding an opposition affidavit.van asdale,at quoting messick horizon,cir.this is not a case in which a deponent memory could credibly have been refreshed by subsequent events,including discussions with others or his review of documents,record,or papers.
in this case,the district court found that the disparity between the affidavit and deposition is so extreme that the court must regard the differences between the two as contradictions.this finding was not clearly erroneous.the district court could reasonably conclude that no juror would believe yeager weak explanation for his sudden ability to remember the answers to important questions about the critical issues of his lawsuit.it is implausible that yeager could refresh his recollection so thoroughly by reviewing several documents in light of the extreme number of questions to which yeager answered he could not recall during his deposition and the numb
