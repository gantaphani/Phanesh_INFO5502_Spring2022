this case presents the question of whether the first amendment prevents massachusetts law enforcement officials from interfering with an individual internet posting of an audio and video recording of an arrest and warrantless search of a private residence,when the individual who posted the recording had reason to know at the time she accepted the recording that it was illegally recorded.the appellant state police officers challenge the district court grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining them from taking any action that interferes with appellee mary jean posting of the recording on a website.we find this case materially indistinguishable from the supreme court decision in bartnicki vopper,d,and thus conclude that jean has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of her claim that the first amendment protects the posting of a recording under such circumstances.consequently,we uphold the preliminary injunction.
factual background 
the facts are largely undisputed where disputes exist,they do not affect the outcome of this appeal.
jean,a local political activist in worcester,massachusetts,maintained a website displaying articles and other information critical of former worcester county district attorney john conte in october,paul pechonis contacted jean through her website.they had never met previously.pechonis explained that,on september,eight armed state police troopers arrested him in his home on a misdemeanor charge.he met the officers at the front door and allowed them to handcuff him.the officers then conducted a warrantless search of his entire house.the arrest was both audiotaped and videotaped by a,a camera used by parents to monitor children activities within the home.the parties contest whether the recording was accidental this fact is immaterial to the outcome of the case.
pechonis provided jean a copy of the recording.we assume,for purposes of this appeal,that when jean accepted the tape she had reason to know that it had been illegally recorded.on january,jean posted the recording on her website accompanied by an editorial comment critical of conte performance in office.
by letter dated february,the state police advised jean that her actions violated.laws ch,section,and were subject to prosecution as a felony the letter stated that,if jean did not cease and desist,within hours of receipt of this letter,from posting this unlawful tape on the internet or any other publicly accessible site,the police would refer this matter to the district attorney office for further investigation and possible prosecution.the police sent a second letter on march,which clarified the previous letter by stating that,given the statute limitation to wire or oral communications,jean would not be in violation if she removed the audio portion of the recording from her website.
procedural history 
on february,jean filed a complaint in federal district court in massachusetts seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the massachusetts state police,state police superintendent thomas robbins,and attorney general thomas reilly in their individual and official capacities collectively,the police citing her right to free speech under the first amendment,jean sought to preclude defendants from threatening her with prosecution or enforcing section against her.the district court granted a temporary restraining order preventing the police from interfering with jean disclosure,use,or display,including posting on the internet,of the recording.
after briefing and a hearing,the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction on april.finding the case controlled by bartnicki vopper,d,the court noted that jean played no part in the recording of the video,that she had obtained the tape lawfully,and that the videotape related to a matter of public concern.the court concluded that jean had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of her first amendment claim,that irreparable harm would result from the absence of an injunction,and that the balance of burdens and public interests weighed in favor of jean.consequently,it granted the preliminary injunction.this appeal ensued.
standard of review 
under a,we have jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal of an order granting a preliminary injunction.we review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.wine spirits retailers,rhode island,cir.within that framework,findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo.id.thus,we will set aside a district court ruling on a preliminary injunction motion only if the court clearly erred in assessing the facts,misapprehended the applicable legal principles,or otherwise is shown to have abused its discretion.id.
in considering the motion for a preliminary injunction,a district court weighs four factors the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits the potential for irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction whether issuing an injunction will burden the defendants less than denying an injunction would burden the plaintiffs and the effect,if any,on the public interest.bl a ck tea soc y city of boston,cir.the police contest only the first factor jean likelihood of success on the merits.that inquiry is the most important part of the preliminary injunction assessment i f the moving party can not demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest,the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.new comm wireless,sprintcom,cir.moreover,to the extent that the police could have argued that the other three factors assist in demonstrating abuse of discretion by the district court,they have now waived those arguments by failing to raise them on appeal.
thus,the question before us is whether the district court erred in granting a preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of.laws ch,against jean for her receipt and internet posting of the recording of pechonis arrest.like the district court,we evaluate whether,in light of the record before us,she has a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.
bartnicki vopper 
we agree with the district court that this case is controlled by the supreme court decision in bartnicki vopper,d.therefore,we must examine that decision closely before applying it to the facts of this case.
background 
in bartnicki,the supreme court considered what degree of protection,if any,the first amendment provides to speech that discloses the contents of an illegally intercepted communication.id.at.the dispute in bartnicki arose during contentious collective bargaining negotiations between a pennsylvania school board and a union representing teachers at the local high school.an unidentified person intercepted and recorded a cellular phone call between the union chief negotiator and the president of the local union,during which the president stated if they not gon na move for three percent,we gon na have to go to their,their homes to blow off their front porches id.at.first omission in original internal quotation marks omitted.
jack yocum,the head of a local taxpayer organization,subsequently found a recording of the intercepted conversation in his mailbox.he played the tape for members of the school board and later delivered the tape to frederick vopper,a radio commentator,who played the tape on his public affairs talk show.the union officials brought an action for damages under federal and state wiretap statutes against yocum and vopper,who invoked their first amendment right to speak on issues of public importance.
the relevant provision of the federal wiretap statute,c,provides that any person who intentionally discloses,or endeavors to disclose,to any other person the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication,knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire,oral or electronic communication in violation of this subsection may be sued.the pennsylvania state wiretap statute contains a similar provision.both statutory schemes also provide for recovery of damages for violations.c.a.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment before the district court.the court denied both motions and granted a motion for an interlocutory appeal to the third circuit.that court concluded that the statutes were invalid as applied because they deterred significantly more speech than was necessary to protect the privacy interests at stake,and remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment for defendants.bartnicki,at.citing bartnicki vopper,cir.the supreme court then granted certiorari to determine whether the first amendment shielded defendants from suits for damages for violation of c and its pennsylvania analog.
since the grant of certiorari followed a remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for defendants,the majority opinion authored by justice stevens and joined by five other justices viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.bartnicki,at.it assumed that the interception was intentional,and therefore unlawful,and that,at a minimum,defendants had reason to know that it was unlawful.id.at.the plaintiffs were thus entitled to recover damages under the statutes unless application of the statutes in such circumstances would violate the first amendment.id.the court also accepted three other factual propositions that serve to distinguish most of the cases that have arisen under.first,the defendants played no part in the illegal interception.rather,they found out about the interception only after it occurred,and in fact never learned the identity of the person or persons who made the interception.second,defendants access to the information on the tapes was obtained lawfully,even though the information itself was intercepted unlawfully by someone else.third,the subject matter of the conversation was a matter of public concern.id.
the supreme court analysis 
the court first held that c was content neutral,explaining that the statute does not distinguish based on the content of the intercepted conversations,nor is it justified by reference to the content of those conversations.rather,the communications at issue are singled out by virtue of the fact that they were illegally intercepted id.at.the court also explained that the statute,as applied to the facts of the case,is fairly characterized as a regulation of pure speech.id.it noted that the delivery of a tape recording is like the delivery of a handbill or pamphlet,and as such,it is the kind of speech that the first amendment protects.id.at.
having established these principles,the court then balanced the state interests served by the statute against the public interest in the disclosure of information.the court identified two interests served by the statute removing an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations and minimizing the harm to persons whose conversations have been illegally intercepted.id.at.the court accorded little weight to the first interest,id.at,noting that it would be quite remarkable to hold that speech by a possessor of information can be suppressed in order to deter conduct by a third party,id.at,and explaining that there is no empirical evidence to support the assumption that the prohibition against disclosures reduces the number of illegal interceptions,id.at.it found the second interest in the situation before it more immediately relevant,noting that disclosure of the contents of a private conversation can be an even greater intrusion on privacy than the interception itself.id.at.given this concern,it found a valid independent justification for prohibiting disclosures by persons who lawfully obtained access to the contents of an illegally intercepted message,even if such prohibition does not deter the initial interception.id.in particular,the fear of public disclosure of private conversations might well have a chilling effect on private speech.id.
with respect to the public interest in disclosure,the court emphasized that if a newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance then state officials may not constitutionally punish publication of the information,absent a need of the highest order.id.at.quoting smith daily mail publ g,d omission in original.given the presumption in favor of protecting publication of truthful information,the issue presented in bartnicki was narrow where the punished publisher of information has obtained the information in question in a manner lawful in itself but from a source who has obtained it unlawfully,may the government punish the ensuing publication of that information based on the defect in a chain id.quoting boehner mcdermott,sentelle,dissenting.
although the court thus noted that there are important interests to be considered on both sides of the constitutional calculus,id.at,it ultimately concluded that privacy concerns give way when balanced against the interest in publishing matters of public importance,id.at.surveying the many cases in which it had protected speech on matters of public concern,id.at,the court explained that o ne of the costs associated with participation in public affairs is an attendant loss of privacy,id.at.consequently,the court concluded that a stranger illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the first amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.id.at.because the collective bargaining negotiations in bartnicki were unquestionably a matter of public concern,and respondents were clearly engaged in debate about that concern,the first amendment prohibited recovery of damages against defendants.id.
application of bartnicki to jean circumstances 
as a preliminary matter,we note that,like the statutes in question in bartnicki,section is a law of general applicability,id.at.it does not distinguish based on the content of the intercepted conversations,nor is it justified by reference to the content of those conversations.id.like the delivery of the recording in bartnicki,which the court analogized to the delivery of a handbill or a pamphlet,id.at,section prohibition against disclosure also constitutes a regulation of pure speech.
as did the court in bartnicki,we consider the interests implicated by the disclosure of the information.with respect to the state interest in protecting the privacy of its citizens,the privacy interests discussed in bartnicki are less compelling here.bartnicki emphasized the importance of encouraging the uninhibited exchange of ideas and information among private parties,id.at,and of avoiding the f ear or suspicion that one speech is being monitored by a stranger,id.at.quoting president commission on law enforcement and administration of justice,the challenge of crime in a free society.this interest in protecting private communication is clearly implicated by the interception of a private cell phone conversation in bartnicki.however,this interest is virtually irrelevant here,where the intercepted communications involve a search by police officers of a private citizen home in front of that individual,his wife,other members of the family,and at least eight law enforcement officers.
moreover,the state interest in deterring illegal interception by punishing a subsequent publisher of accorded little weight by the court in even less weight here,where the identity of the interceptor is known.in bartnicki,the government argued that punishing a subsequent publisher of information remov es an incentive for parties to intercept private conversations by deterring publishers of illegally intercepted material and thus reducing the demand for such material.id.at.this argument rested,in part,on the assumption that the interceptors themselves could not be punished because their identities usually were unknown.unimpressed,the court explained that the available evidence did not support this assumption of anonymity.first,the legislative record did not indicate that a significant number of interceptors were anonymous.id.at.moreover,fewer than ten of the cases filed under the federal wiretap statute involved an anonymous interceptor.id.thus,the court concluded that the relatively small number of anonymous interceptors meant that it was not difficult to identify the persons responsible for illegal interceptions and,consequently,not necessary to prohibit d
