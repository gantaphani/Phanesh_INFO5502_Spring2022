robert paul boyd pled guilty to a indictment charging him with receiving visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.the district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment,followed by five years of supervised release.boyd appeals three sentencing enhancements under the united states sentencing guidelines.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court,and remand for resentencing.
background 
factual background 
on december,robert paul boyd was released from prison in florida,where he had been serving a sentence for sexual battery and for lewd and lascivious acts with minors.he then began a term of probation.later that month,boyd relocated to mansfield,ohio,causing the supervision of his probation to be transferred to the richland county probation office.
boyd began receiving depictions of young children through his home computer in january of.he downloaded several thousand such images over the next four months.the children were naked in a majority of these images,with a substantial number featuring prepubescent minors.in many of the images,the children were engaged in sexually explicit conduct.boyd communicated with two people known as robb and stephan about child pornography,both of whom transmitted child pornography to him through their computers.
boyd probation officer,michael wallery,visited him at his residence on april.wallery questioned boyd about his use of the computer.although boyd denied using his computer to access or possess child pornography,wallery informed him that there would be a more thorough visit in a few days.boyd subsequently deleted many of his computer files in anticipation of the upcoming probation interview.nevertheless,when wallery returned three days later,he discovered pornographic images of young children on boyd computer.
wallery contacted sergeant jeff mcbride of the richland county sheriff department the same day to inform him of these circumstances.mcbride promptly interviewed boyd at the latter residence.at the conclusion of the interview,mcbride seized boyd computer.a search warrant was subsequently obtained to examine the computer contents.the ensuing search uncovered images of naked children.in many of the images,the children were engaged in sexual activity.
procedural background 
the grand jury for the northern district of ohio returned a indictment against boyd on september,charging him with knowingly receiving visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,in violation of a.boyd pled guilty.his case was then referred to the united states probation office for a presentence investigation and report.
the presentence report psr placed boyd base offense level at,pursuant to united states sentencing guideline,the guideline for receiving,transporting,shipping,or advertising material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.it then recommended enhancements to his offense level based upon use of a computer for transmission of the material,obstruction of justice,and distribution of the material.boyd objected to these enhancements.after a hearing,the district court overruled his objections and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court did not err in increasing boyd base offense level on the ground that a computer was used in the transmission of unlawful depictions 
boyd first contends that the district court erred in adding two points to his base offense level on the ground that a computer was used for the transmission of the material.sentencing guidelines manual b.the evidence underlying this enhancement is not disputed,and the issue effectively turns on interpreting a particular set of words in the guideline.our review is therefore de novo.see united states winbush,cir reviewing de novo whether a particular phrase warrants an enhancement for offense conduct amounting to a threat of death united states haas,cir.explaining that review of a sentencing enhancement should be de novo where the application of the guidelines is not.
robb and stephan used computers to send boyd child pornography,and boyd used his computer to receive these transmissions.the government contends that,on these facts,a computer was used for the transmission of the material.on the other hand,boyd argues that the enhancement should apply only to a defendant who uses a computer to transmit the material,not to one whose computer use is limited to its receipt.
boyd supports his argument by referencing,the guideline for possession of materials depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.that guideline provides for a base offense level of and a enhancement i f the defendant possession of the material resulted from the defendant use of a computer.sentencing guidelines manual b.boyd points out that if a defendant downloads images of child pornography but does not transmit the images,his offense level would be if he is sentenced pursuant to and the enhancement applies to receipt of the child pornography using a computer base of plus enhancement,but it would be if he is sentenced for possession of the child pornography under base of plus enhancement.this would yield the anomalous result of punishing the identical conduct differently depending on the guideline used.
boyd has a point,but it has little to do with computers.as the seventh circuit has recognized,t he puzzle is why receiving,which under the first guideline and the statute that it implements is punished as severely as sending,should be punished more severely than possessing,since possessors,unless they fabricate their own pornography,are also receivers.united states richardson,cir internal citation omitted.the specter of punishing identical conduct differently thus derives from the existence of these two different guidelines,not from the guidelines treatment of computer use.boyd,however,does not argue that he should have been sentenced under,so we have no reason to concern ourselves any further with this apparent inconsistency in the guidelines.
returning now to b,considerations of consistency counsel against boyd proposed interpretation of that section.section,by its title,applies equally to receiving and shipping material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor,and the enhancement applies i f a computer was used for the transmission of the material.the enhancement is not limited to transmission by the defendant.as the seventh circuit has reasoned 
a defendant who receives in the mails a magazine containing child pornography is punished the same apart from individual differentiating characteristics such as criminal history as the one who sent it.what sense would it make to break this punishment identity just because the mode of transmission was the internet rather than the mails use of the internet enhances the dangers that child pornography poses,because it is a more discreet and efficient method of distribution but if this makes the sender more dangerous,it likewise makes the receiver more dangerous.
richardson,at.we find richardson persuasive and conclude that the district court did not err in increasing boyd base offense level under b.
b.the district court did not err in increasing boyd base offense level on the ground that he obstructed the administration of justice 
we next turn to boyd contention that the district court erred in adding two points to his base offense level for obstruction of justice.united states sentencing guidelines manual requires such an increase where a the defendant willfully obstructed the administration of justice during the course of the investigation of the instant offense of conviction,and b the obstructive conduct related to i the defendant offense of conviction we review the district court application of under the clearly erroneous standard.united states,cir.
boyd admitted to mcbride that after wallery inquired about his use of the computer,he deleted to images of child pornography in order to avoid detection by his probation officer.destruction of material evidence amounts to obstruction of justice.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.d l
