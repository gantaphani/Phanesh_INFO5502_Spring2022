massachusetts institute of technology mit and electronics for imaging,efi appeal from the stipulated final judgment of noninfringement of the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.mit and efi urge that the district court claim construction on which the stipulated judgment of was based was erroneous.appellants also urge that the district court order granting microsoft motion to exclude windows as an infringing product was erroneous.we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings because we hold that the district court erred in its construction of aesthetic correction circuitry,and erred in excluding windows as an infringing product.we decline to address claim construction issues not implicated by the judgment.we dismiss the since the,if successful,would not expand the scope of the judgment.we decline to reach the question whether the district court properly denied the parties motions for summary judgment on the marking statute issues since the district court has not finally decided whether the marking statute bars the claims.we dismiss as moot the appeals insofar as they arise from orders that were granted in favor of fry electronics,fry and arcsoft,arcsoft because both those parties have been voluntarily dismissed from this action.
background 
patent the patent discloses a color processing system for producing copies of color originals.the invention discloses color reproduction process es which use a small number of colorants,usually three or four,in various mixtures,more or less to match the colors of the original.patent,ll.it is designed to address a problem common to conventional color editing,that the exact combination of colorants required for the match is not related,in any simple way,to measurements which can be made on the original.id,ll.the invention performs three basic steps a scanning a color image b displaying and interactively editing the scanned image and c accurately reproducing the displayed image.claim of the patent,the only claim at issue in this appeal,describes the three steps as follows 
a system for reproducing a color original in a medium using a selected multiplicity of reproduction colorants,the system comprising in serial order 
a scanner for producing from said color original a set of three tristimulus appearance signals dependent on the colors in said original 
display means connected to the scanner for receiving the appearance signals and aesthetic correction circuitry for interactively introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals and 
colorant selection mechanism for receiving said modified appearance signals and for selecting corresponding reproduction signals representing values of said reproducing colorants to produce in said medium a reproduction.
ll.emphases added.the pertinent claim construction dispute involves the emphasized language.
in step a of the disclosed embodiment,an image is scanned in by the scanner and stored in terms of appearance values,for example rgb red green blue,ll.these appearance values are the appearance signals referred to in claim a.
in step b,the appearance signals are sent to a tv or other display means,and t he image is displayed on the display means,ll.the image is a colorimetric match for the final reproduction,and can be used to judge its appearance,ll.an operator manipulates the tv image interactively in terms of appearance values,introducing aesthetic corrections and such other changes as desired,ll.in the language of claim b,aesthetic correction circuitry allows these aesthetically desired alterations to be introduce d into the appearance signals to produce modified signals.
in step c,the final step,the colorant selection mechanism csm receives the modified appearance signals and calculates i nk density images,as required for a colorimetric match with the corrected images,ll.thus,as claim recites,the csm select s corresponding reproduction signals representing values of colorants to produce a reproduction.the computed ink density images are used to control the amount of colorant delivered to the final page at each point,ll.
mit,the assignee of the patent,granted an exclusive license to efi.plaintiffs mit and efi filed an original complaint on december,alleging that defendants directly and contributorily infringed and induced infringement of the patent.on april,shortly before the patent expired,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,asserting infringement against a total of defendants.on august,the district court issued a docket control order dco that required mit to make preliminary infringement contentions,including a list of accused instrumentalities infringing products by september.mit served its preliminary infringement contentions on august.the accused instrumentalities included various types of image editing software,computer systems,digital cameras,scanners,and color reproduction systems.mit did not list windows as an accused instrumentality but stated that it believed that microsoft windows infringed and would seek related discovery.at.in the course of litigation,plaintiffs settled with some defendants and dismissed their claims against others,until only four remained microsoft,corel,roxio,and mgi software.
following a markman hearing,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on claim construction on july,construing various terms in claim.the district court issued a claim construction order largely adopting the magistrate recommendations on september.three claim terms are relevant to this appeal scanner,colorant selection mechanism,and aesthetic correction circuitry.
the court held that the term scanner is not a limitation.the district court concluded,however,that the scanner includes two limitations first,it must have relative movement between the scanning element and the object being scanned,and second,the color original that the scanner scans must be placed on or in close proximity to the scanner.
the court construed the term colorant selection mechanism as a limitation,and held that the recited functions are receiving said modified appearance signals and selecting corresponding reproduction signals representing values of said reproduction colorants to produce in said medium a reproduction.the court concluded that the structure that performs these functions is the components of the ink correction module icm.
finally,the court held that aesthetic correction circuitry is a limitation,that the recited function is introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals,and that the structures that perform this function are the five components that comprise the color translation module ctm.
following the claim construction ruling,the district court issued two orders that are pertinent to this appeal.first,on september,the district court granted microsoft motion to exclude windows as an accused product on the ground that windows had not been listed as an accused instrumentality when mit submitted its preliminary infringement contentions prior to the markman hearing.
second,on september,the district court denied both sides motions for summary judgment regarding mit compliance with the marking statute,which permits damages only when the infringing articles are marked or the infringer is on notice of infringement.
on november,the parties stipulate d to entry of final judgment of of the patent based on the court claim construction.at.the parties also stipulate d to the dismissal without prejudice of defendants counterclaims of invalidity and unenforceability.based on these stipulations,the district court entered a final judgment of and dismissed the defendants counterclaims on november.the stipulated judgment is thus based entirely on the claim construction issues decided adversely to the plaintiffs.mit timely appealed and microsoft,corel,and roxio.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we first address issues of claim construction.claim construction is a matter of law that we review without deference.cybor fas,en banc.
this case once again involves an effort by parties to a patent infringement case to have this court opine on a range of claim construction issues even though the judgment of the district court is not based on the resolution of those issues.we decline that invitation and limit our consideration to issues presented by the judgment under review.an appeal is not an opportunity to bring before the appellate court every ruling with which one of the parties disagrees without regard to whether the ruling has in any way impacted the final judgment.the fact that this is a patent case does not invoke a different legal regime.
as described above,the judgment here is a stipulated judgment of by the parties based on the district court claim construction.the stipulated judgment presents only the question whether the claim constructions adverse to the patentee were correct.we thus will not consider claim construction issues decided in favor of the patent holder that the accused infringers contend were incorrect,nor will we address issues that are pertinent only to dismissed claims of invalidity.revising the district court claim constructions in these respects would not affect the judgment of 
even with respect to the claim construction issues on which the judgment is based we perceive a problem with the mechanism by which this case has been litigated.as in lava trading,sonic trading,llc,the record does not disclose the nature of the accused devices,and our rulings on claim construction in this case unfortunately must be made without knowledge of the accused devices.see id.at without knowledge of the accused products,this court can not assess the accuracy of the infringement judgment under review and lacks a proper context for an accurate claim construction.see also exigent,atrana solutions,i t is appropriate for a court to consider the accused device when determining what aspect of the claim should be construed.moreover,the stipulated judgment does not identify which of the many claim construction rulings are dispositive.while it is highly undesirable to consider these issues in the abstract,here as in lava trading,we have proceeded to do so.
the parties dispute the meaning of the claim term scanner.the first element of claim recites,in pertinent part,a scanner for producing from said color original a set of three tristimulus appearance signals dependent on the colors in said original.patent,ll.emphasis added.
the district court concluded that the scanner must have relative movement between the scanning element and the object being scanned.we agree.
claims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part.phillips awh,en banc internal quotations omitted.indeed,the specification is u sually dispositive and is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.in this case,however,the specification does not define the term scanner either explicitly or implicitly.the most that can be said is that the specification is not inconsistent with a relative movement requirement.the specification discloses only one type of scanner,a hell model,which is a drum scanner that rotates a two dimensional original image past a scanning element.patent.the drum scanner operates by moving the original past a scanning element,and thus requires relative movement between the scanning element and the object being scanned.
under such circumstances it is appropriate for us to look to dictionary definitions of the terms.see phillips,at dictionaries or comparable sources are often useful to assist in understanding the commonly understood meaning of words and have been used both by our court and the supreme court in claim interpretation.dictionary definitions of scan and scanner at the time the patent application was filed in confirm that these terms require relative movement between a scanning element and an object being scanned.for example,the version of webster third new international dictionary defines scan as to cause a narrow beam of light to traverse an object in order to translate light modulations into a corresponding electrical current.subsequent dictionary definitions include the same limitation.the edition of dictionary of scientific and technical terms defines scanner as a ny device that examines an area or region point by point in a continuous systematic manner,repeatedly sweeping across until the entire area or region is covered.the definition in the version of webster is identical to the definition in the version.thus the definitions,both before and after,require relative movement.
mit argues that flying spot scanners existed in although not referenced in the specification and lacked the relative movement limitation.thus,mit urges that to a person of ordinary skill in,a scanner would not have required relative movement.in a flying spot scanner,a moving spot of light,controlled either mechanically or electrically,scans the image field to be transmitted.electronics and nucleonics dictionary ed emphasis added see dictionary of scientific and technical terms ed defining scanner as a scanner used for television film and slide transmission,electronic writing,and character recognition,in which a moving spot of light,controlled mechanically or electrically,scans the image field,and the light reflected from or transmitted by the image field is picked up by a phototube to generate electric signals.a dictionary of computing defines a flying spot as a point of light or the end of an electron beam that is movable at high speed back and forth across a field.frank.galland,dictionary of computing.this type of scanner is disclosed in patent the patent,filed on may.patent,ll.mit argues that because a flying spot scanner has no mechanical movement,it is an example of a scanner that is inconsistent with the district court relative movement limitation.although the mechanical components of a flying spot scanner may remain fixed,the scanner operates by sweeping a light beam across the object to be scanned.see definition patent,ll.we agree with the district court that the light beam qualifies as a scanning element,and thus that the flying spot scanner operates with movement between the scanning element and the object being scanned.
plaintiffs similarly argue that television cameras,which were available in,are scanners that operate without relative movement.we disagree.although a camera may achieve the same result as a scanner,the dictionary definitions confirm that a scanner,as it was understood in,required relative movement between a scanning element and the object being scanned.plaintiffs assert that patent the pugsley patent used the term scanner to refer to a camera and thus reveals that in a person of ordinary skill in the art viewed a camera as a type of scanner.however,the specification of the pugsley patent explicitly distinguishes between a camera which does not require relative movement and a scanner which does when it states that it is usual to form three separate images by photographing or scanning the original.pugsley patent,emphasis added 
we conclude that a camera that operates without relative movement is not a scanner within the meaning of the patent.
the district court also concluded that the scanner in claim a must involve placing the color original on or in close proximity to the scanner.here again the specification does not explicitly or implicitly define scanner as including a close proximity requirement.although the single disclosed scanner in the specification includes this limitation,we do not confine the claim to the disclosed embodiments.phillips,at.the pertinent dictionaries also offer no assistance.
under such circumstances,we must determine what meaning the term had in the relevant art at the time the patent issued by looking to other sources.this follows from our obligation to give the words of a claim their ordinary and customary meaning,which is the meaning that the words would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention,as of the effective filing date of the patent application.phillips,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis added see also markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d in construing claims,the courts focus on what one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would have understood the term to mean.chisum on patents g ed.in determining the meaning of a term within the pertinent art,it is appropriate to determine the mode of operation of the device at the time the patent application was filed 
here,the district court relying on the specification,expert testimony,and technical references concluded that in a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known of two general types of scanners,drum scanners and flatbed scanners.both these scanners require close proximity between the color original and the scanner.we see no basis for disturbing this conclusion and agree that the term scanner should be defined by what was known in the art at the time.plaintiffs argue that in cameras were scanners that did not require close proximity,but as we noted above,a camera that lacks the relative movement limitation is not a scanner.we conclude that the term scanner in should be construed to include a requirement of close proximity.
mit and efi argue that the district court erroneously held the phrase colorant selection mechanism was a limitation under section.that phrase appears in the patent together with a description of its functions,receiving said modified appearance signals and selecting corresponding reproduction signals representing values of said reproducing colorants to produce in said medium a reproduction.
the phrase colorant selection mechanism is presumptively not subject to because it does not contain the term means.ccs fitness,brunswick.however,a limitation lacking the term means may overcome the presumption against treatment if it is shown that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure or else recites function without reciting sufficient structure for performing that function.id.quoting watts xl.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the presumption here is overcome and that the phrase colorant selection mechanism should be construed as a limitation.the generic terms mechanism,means,element,and device,typically do not connote sufficiently definite structure.in personalized media commc ns,llc int l trade com n,we addressed the claim term digital detector.we contrasted the term detector,which recited sufficient structure to avoid,with generic structural term s such as means,element,or device,which do not.id.at.similarly,in lighting world,birchwood lighting,we recognized that section does not apply to a term that is simply a nonce word or a verbal construct that is not recognized as the name of structure and is simply a substitute for the term means for.id.at.
here the patentee used mechanism and means as synonyms.see patent,claim,referring to colorant selection means emphasis added,claim,ll.same.at least one dictionary definition equates mechanism with means.see the random house webster unabridged dictionary def.ed defining mechanism as the agency or means by which an effect is produced or a purpose is accomplished see also the random house dictionary of the english unabridged edition same.the term mechanism standing alone connotes no more structure than the term means.
claim language that further defines a generic term like mechanism can sometimes add sufficient structure to avoid.for example,in greenberg ethicon,which involved a mechanical device,we held that did not apply to the term detent mechanism,because the noun d etent denotes a type of device with a generally understood meaning in the mechanical arts,even though the definitions are expressed in functional terms.id.at.the court recited several dictionary definitions for detent,including a mechanism that temporarily keeps one part in a certain position relative to that of another,and can be released by applying force to one of the parts.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.these definitions connoted sufficient structure to avoid.we also concluded that t he fact that a particular detent mechanism is defined in functional terms is not sufficient to convert a claim element containing that term into a means for performing a specified function within the meaning of because m any devices take their names from the functions they perform.id 
in contrast,the term colorant selection,which modifies mechanism here,is not defined in the specification and has no dictionary definition,and there is no suggestion that it has a generally understood meaning in the art.we therefore agree with the district court that colorant selection mechanism does not connote sufficient structure to a person of ordinary skill in the art to avoid treatment 
the district court found that the functions of the colorant selection mechanism,as recited in claim,are receiving said modified appearance signals and selecting corresponding reproduction signals representing values of said reproduction colorants to produce in said medium a reproduction.the court further held that the corresponding structures are the components of the ink correction module icm.mit does not argue that if treatment was appropriate,the district court erred in its conclusions regarding the function and corresponding structure of the term.therefore,the district court construction will govern further proceedings.
claim b of the patent recites,display means connected to the scanner for receiving the appearance signals and aesthetic correction circuitry for interactively introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals.patent,ll.emphasis added.the phrase,aesthetic correction circuitry for interactively introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals,does not contain the term means,and is therefore presumptively not a limitation.nonetheless,the district court held that the presumption was overcome and proceeded to define the function and related structure.
mit urges that the term aesthetic correction circuitry connotes sufficient structure to avoid treatment.we agree.
in contrast to the term mechanism,dictionary definitions establish that the term circuitry,by itself,connotes structure.webster third new international dictionary,ed.defining circuit as the complete path of an electric current including any displacement current and circuitry as the detailed plan of an electric circuit or network as of a radio or television receiver see also linear tech.impala linear,technical dictionaries,which are evidence of the understandings of persons of skill in the technical arts,plainly indicate that the term circuit connotes structure the dictionary of computing ed defines circuit as the combination of a number of electrical devices and conductors that,when interconnected to form a conducting path,fulfill some desired function.random house webster unabridged dictionary,def.ed defining circuit as the complete path of an electric current rudolf graf,modern dictionary of electronics ed defining circuit as t he interconnection of a number of devices in one or more closed paths to perform a desired electrical or electronic function 
in two of our prior cases we concluded that the term circuit,combined with a description of the function of the circuit,connoted sufficient structure to one of ordinary skill in the art to avoid treatment.see linear,at w hen the term circuit is coupled with a description of the circuit operation,sufficient structural meaning generally will be conveyed to persons of ordinary skill in the art,and presumptively will not apply.apex raritan computer,t he term circuit with an appropriate identifier such as interface,programming and logic,certainly identifies some structural meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art.the claim language here too does not merely describe a circuit it adds further structure by describing the operation of the circuit.the circuit input is appearance signals produced by the scanner its objective is to interactively introduce e aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals and its output is modified appearance signals.patent,ll.this description of the operation of the circuit is sufficient to avoid.
in arguing to the contrary,the dissent appears to misapprehend the strength of the presumption that applies when the term means does not appear in the claim.as we stated in lighting world,at,w e have seldom held that a limitation not using the term means must be considered to be in form,and the circumstances must be unusual to overcome the presumption so too the dissent erroneously suggests that claims can not avoid treatment unless the claim term denotes a specific structure.but i n considering whether a claim term recites sufficient structure to avoid application of section,we have not required the claim term to denote a specific structure.instead,we have held that it is sufficient if the claim term is used in common parlance or by persons of skill in the pertinent art to designate structure,even if the term covers a broad class of structures and even if the term identifies the structures by their function.id.at.here,technical dictionaries supply ample evidence that the claim term designates structure.
we conclude that microsoft has not overcome the presumption that the aesthetic correction circuitry limitation is not a limitation.
microsoft urges that circuitry should be limited to hardware whereas mit urged below that it should include both hardware and software.we conclude that the term aesthetic correction circuitry is clearly limited to hardware.
the parties agree that the ctm is the aesthetic correction circuitry of the patent.as the summary of the invention explains,when the operator views an image of the scanned original on a tv screen,the operator can manipulate the tv image interactively in terms of appearance values,introducing aesthetic corrections and such other changes as desired.patent,ll.the ctm is the device that is used to correct the input errors in the image on the tv screen.in the preferred embodiment,it is composed of five modules,each of which corrects a specific type of error.
the specification describes the components of the ctm as hardware components.see,ll.the next step is conversion to form by a hardware implementation of the given transformation,followed by the color balance module,ll.the next two modules operate on chrominance in polar coordinates,so that the signals must be converted in a hardware cartesian to polar coordinate converter,ll.after special correction,hue and saturation are converted back to form by a hardware polar to cartesian coordinate converter,for passage to storage or the display.although the specification suggests that certain computations performed by the ctm can be accomplished with either hardware or software this reference does not alter the specification repeated description of the circuit itself as involving hardware.thus,the specification references do not require that circuit be interpreted to include software.dictionary definitions of circuit in,when the patent application was filed,did not include software see dictionary of scientific and technical terms ed defining circuitry as t he complete combination of circuits used in an electrical or electronic system or piece of equipment.we conclude that the term circuitry in claim is limited to hardware.
having decided that does not apply to the aesthetic correction circuitry limitation and that the term does not include software,we leave it to the district court to define this term with further particularity.
in conclusion,we agree that the district court properly construed the claim terms colorant selection mechanism and scanner in the respects described above.however,its construction of the term aesthetic correction circuitry was erroneous.
microsoft and corel contend that the district court erred in construing the term colorimetric match to permit a specific tolerance,the term scanner not to require color mixture curve filters,and the term color original not to require originals.mit contends that the district court should have adopted a narrower construction of the term system comprising in serial order,for purposes of the invalidity analysis.because the construction of these terms would not affect the judgment under review,we decline to address them.
microsoft urges an alternative ground for partial affirmance of the judgment of.microsoft contends that the district court properly granted microsoft motion to exclude windows as an infringing product.the district court granted the motion on the ground that mit preliminary infringement contentions should be treated as final,and thus mit should not be permitted subsequently to add new accused products except on a showing of good cause.
the docket control order dco set a september,deadline for asserting preliminary infringement contentions and defined the required disclosure as follows 
t he disclosure of asserted claims and preliminary infringement contentions shall contain each accused apparatus,product,device,process,method,act,or other instrumentality accused instrumentality of each opposing party of which the party is aware.this identification shall be as specific as possible,sic each product,device,and apparatus must be identified by name or model number,if known.
at.mit served its preliminary infringement contentions on august.the court claim construction order issued on july.on november,the court issued an amended dco,requiring the parties to update their preliminary infringement contentions in light of the claim construction order by november,later extended to december.in an order accompanying the amended dco,the district court noted for the first months after the original under the rules of practice before the honorable john ward of the eastern district of texas judge ward rules preliminary infringement contentions are deemed to be final,and can only be amended by order of the court on a showing of good cause.nonetheless,on december,mit attempted to update its preliminary infringement disclosures to include windows.microsoft moved to exclude windows on january,and the district court granted the motion on september.
the district court relied on rules and of judge ward rules rule provides that e ach party sic preliminary infringement contentions shall be deemed to be that party final contentions with immaterial exceptions.rule provides that a mendment or modification of the preliminary or final infringement contentions,other than as expressly permitted in,may be made only by order of the court,which shall be entered only upon a showing of good cause.the court concluded that mit had failed to show good cause for the delay in adding windows as an accused instrumentality.
under the law of the fifth circuit,which governs here,district courts are afforded broad discretion in interpreting their own orders however,the district court is obligated to provide clear notice of the requirements of its orders.federal rule of civil procedure b provides 
a judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law,rules adopted under and,and local rules of the district.no sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law,federal rules,or the local district rules unless the alleged violator has been furnished in the particular case with actual notice of the requirement.
we conclude that mit was not provided with sufficient notice that its preliminary infringement contentions would be deemed final or that they could only be updated upon a showing of good cause.the august,dco did not give notice that the preliminary infringement contentions would be deemed final.the district court did not state that judge ward rules would govern.nor did it state that a good cause standard would govern the addition of new products to mit preliminary infringement contentions.
the dissent appears to suggest that even if the district court here erred in relying on judge ward rules,its order was justified under the no excuses provision.the no excuses provision stated that a party is not excused from the requirements of the docket control order because it has not fully completed its investigation of the case can not justify the exclusion.at.the dissent suggests that mit purported to justify updating its infringement contentions to include windows for a single unpersuasive,that the district court unexpectedly construed aesthetic correction circuitry as a term.see dissenting op.at.on the contrary,mit relied primarily on the theory that it needed discovery into windows interaction with other products before it could determine whether windows infringed.see plaintiffs opposition to microsoft motion to exclude windows as an additional accused product and strike plaintiffs infringement contentions,at.in this respect,the dissent appears to urge that,even though the district court stayed discovery,mit should be held culpable for its failure to obtain the earlier discovery that would have permitted it to add windows as an accused product prior to the markman hearing.with respect,the no excuses provision can not reasonably be read as obligating mit to conduct the discovery for purposes of framing final infringement contentions when the district court had explicitly stayed discovery in the very same order.
because mit was not on actual notice that a showing of good cause was required to add accused instrumentalities to its preliminary infringement contentions,the district court erred in barring the addition of windows as an infringing product.
both mit and defendants microsoft and corel contend that the district court erred in denying their motions for summary judgment under the marking statute.microsoft and corel in this respect are improper since a favorable ruling would not broaden the scope of the judgment.see bailey dart container of,it is only necessary and appropriate to file a when a party seeks to enlarge its own rights under the judgment or to lessen the rights of its adversary under the judgment.the are therefore dismissed.to the extent that we have jurisdiction to consider the marking statute issues,we decline to address them because those questions have not been finally resolved by the district court.
we also have no authority to address two other arguments raised by mit.first,mit argues that the district court erred in granting fry motion for summary judgment of when it improperly determined that an infringing sale requires a completely assembled system.second,mit argues the district court erred in granting arcsoft and fry motion for partial summary judgment under the marking statute when it concluded that certain letters efi sent to the appellees failed to give actual notice of infringement under section a.both these conclusions were reached in rulings in favor of fry and arcsoft.mit agreed to dismiss both parties with prejudice,so challenges to those rulings are moot.bancorp mortgage bonner mall,d where mootness results from settlement the losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary process of appeal.mit argues that these rulings may limit their damages award,but this does not affect the mootness of the particular rulings at this stage of the proceedings.see reply brief for at.if the district court in the future relies on these rulings to limit damages with respect to a party,that reliance will give rise to a new ruling that may then be appealed if otherwise appropriate.
conclusion 
the district court erred in its construction of the term aesthetic correction circuitry in the patent and its decision to grant microsoft motion to exclude windows as an accused instrumentality.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment of of the patent and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we dismiss microsoft and corel from the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment concerning the marking statute.we dismiss mit appeal in part as moot.
and remanded 
i respectfully dissent from the majority vacatur and of the district court decision on the bases of the trial court incorrectly construing the claim term aesthetic correction circuitry under section and erring in the exclusion of windows as an infringing product,first suggested two years after the complaint was filed.i believe that in view of its specific language,aesthetic correction circuitry was correctly construed as a claim limitation.nor do the cases relied on by the majority support,much less require,a different disposition.moreover,i believe that excluding windows as an infringing product was not an abuse of the trial court discretion because mit itself urged,successfully,that discovery be delayed.
the district court correctly interpreted aesthetic correction circuitry as a claim despite the absence of the term means for in view of the presence of functional language because the limitation fails to recite sufficiently definite structure,as our precedent requires.thus,the presumption against application of section,paragraph was overcome.indeed,on this record,i find it overcome as a matter of law.
the parties agree that the term circuit ry,by itself connotes some structure to one skilled in the art.apex,raritan computer,emphasis added.the issue,however,is whether the aesthetic correction circuitry limitation recite s sufficiently definite structure,id.at emphasis added accord linear tech.impala linear,which is required to avoid section,paragraph in a claim using functional language,even in the absence of means for.
this definite structure requirement is in our precedent.to invoke this statute section,paragraph,the alleged claim element must not recite a definite structure which performs the described function.cole,see also braun,abbott,because this limitation does not recite definite structure in support of its function,it is subject to the requirements of,personalized media commc ns,llc int l trade comm n,in deciding whether either presumption means for with stated function presumes that section,paragraph applies,while no means for with stated function presumes that section,paragraph does not apply has been rebutted,the focus remains on whether the claim as properly construed recites sufficiently definite structure to avoid the ambit of.watts xl,t he focus remains on whether the claim recites sufficiently definite structure.ccs fitness,brunswick,life fitness can rebut this presumption if it demonstrates that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure.lighting world,birchwood lighting,the presumption that a limitation lacking the term means is not subject to section can be overcome if it is demonstrated that the claim term fails to recite sufficiently definite structure.internal quotations omitted.indeed,section,paragraph is rooted in the definiteness requirement of section,paragraph congress has provided this statute section,paragraph as a specific instruction on interpretation of the type of claim which otherwise might be held to be indefinite.data line micro,accord jonsson stanley works,see also laitram rexnord,absent section,claim language which requires only a means for performing a function might be indefinite.such a claim would,of course,be invalid under section,paragraph.although both apex and linear,relied on dispositively and exclusively by the majority,found sufficiently definite structure in the claim language,both are distinguishable from the instant case,in which the claim language is dramatically different.
in apex,a number of claim limitations using the term circuit were at issue.one such representative claim with the representative limitations was 
a first interface circuit for receiving keyboard and cursor control device signals from the workstation 
an programming circuit that produces video signals for display on the video monitor 
a programmed logic circuit coupled to the first interface that transmits the keyboard and cursor control device signals to the programmable switch and controls the programming circuit to produce the video signals upon the detection of a predefined input from a user of the workstation,the programmed logic circuit further operating to detect keyboard or cursor control device signals received while the programming circuit is producing video signals on the video monitor and to control the programmable switch in response to the keyboard or cursor control device signals detected and 
a second interface circuit disposed between the programmable switch and the selected computer for supplying the keyboard and cursor control device signals routed through the programmable switch to the selected computer.
at united states patent.in holding that the term interface circuit was not a limitation,we explained that the term circuit with an appropriate identifier such as interface,programming and logic,certainly identifies some structural meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art.apex,at emphases added.moreover,we elaborated that interface circuit connotes sufficiently definite structure because interface and interface circuit are defined in electronics and computing dictionaries so as to connote specific structures to one of ordinary skill in the art.id.at.we then remanded the case to the district court for further development of the record and a similar analysis for the remaining circuit terms.thus,not every adjectival qualification,connotes sufficiently definite structure for the term circuit,but rather an appropriate,as demonstrated in apex by technical dictionaries.
by contrast,the circuitry claim limitation in this case recites only the following and nothing more 
aesthetic correction circuitry for interactively introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals 
patent,ll.unlike in apex,here we have no evidence whatsoever that aesthetic correction is such an appropriate that it would connote sufficiently definite structure to one skilled in the art.indeed,aesthetic correction itself may be solely functional language.for example,we were shown no evidence that any technical dictionaries suggest to the artisan a sufficiently definite structure for aesthetic correction circuitry or even list such a term.nor did experts from either side opine that one skilled in the art would understand aesthetic correction circuitry to connote sufficiently definite circuit structure.while microsoft expert anthony johnson stated that one skilled in the art would have understood aesthetic correction circuitry to mean hardware that allows an operator to interactively introduce changes into the appearance signals to create modified appearance signals,this does not connote definite structure,but merely some unspecified hardware structure.the record on appeal does not reflect the opinion of mit expert,bradley paxton,regarding the meaning of aesthetic correction circuitry.rather,in the paltry portion of his testimony in the appellate record,he merely discusses circuitry and the fact that c ircuitry contains a lot of components,including wires.this fails to impart definite structure to aesthetic correction circuitry because the components and their arrangements are unstated.the inventor,william schreiber,explained that aesthetic correction circuitry means to one skilled in the art hardware or software used by the system operator to introduce desired alterations into the appearance signals of an image.again,this does not elucidate a definite structure,but merely suggests some generic structure,namely,some unspecified arrangement of unidentified hardware components or software.neither of mit experts even attempted to opine that aesthetic correction connotes definite structure such that aesthetic correction circuitry would suggest a sufficiently definite array of components to one skilled in the art.thus,i can not discern sufficiently definite structure from the term aesthetic correction circuitry to avoid treatment.
similarly,in linear,a representative claim with limitations concerning circuit recited 
a circuit for controlling a switching voltage regulator,the regulator having a switch circuit coupled to receive an input voltage and including a pair of synchronously switched switching transistors and an output circuit including an output terminal and an output capacitor coupled thereto for supplying current at a regulated voltage to a load,the control circuit comprising 
a first circuit for monitoring a signal from the output terminal to generate a first feedback signal 
a second circuit for generating a first control signal during a first state of circuit operation,the first control signal being responsive to the first feedback signal to vary the duty cycle of the switching transistors to maintain the output terminal at the regulated voltage and 
a third circuit for generating a second control signal during a second state of circuit operation to cause both switching transistors to be simultaneously off for a period of time if a sensed condition of the regulator indicates that the current supplied to the load falls below a threshold fraction of maximum rated output current for the regulator,whereby operating efficiency of the regulator at low output current levels is improved.
at.in ascertaining that these circuit limitations were not limitations,linear began with the approach of apex and ccs fitness to help determine whether a claim term recites sufficient structure,we examine whether it has an understood meaning in the art.id.at.linear then quoted two dictionary definitions of circuit,one identical to the dictionary definition in apex.yet,while apex merely concluded from these dictionary definitions that circuit connoted some structural meaning to one of ordinary skill in the art,apex,at emphases added,linear relied on these dictionary definitions,apex,and certain,operational claim language to state thus,when the term circuit is coupled with a description of the circuit operation,sufficient structural meaning generally will be conveyed to persons of ordinary skill in the art,and presumptively will not apply.linear,at citing apex,at emphases added.in its holding,however,linear also required expert testimony as to whether these descriptions of the circuit operation conveyed sufficient structure to an artisan we hold that because the term circuit is used in each of the disputed limitations with a recitation of the respective circuit operation in sufficient detail to suggest structure to persons of ordinary skill in the art,the circuit and circuitry limitations of such claims are not limitations id.at emphasis added.thus,not any operational language suffices.
linear therefore extended the reasoning of apex such that the use of circuit coupled with a description of the circuit operation may connote sufficient structural meaning,id.at,to one skilled in the art.in linear,this description of the first circuit operation was for monitoring a signal from the output terminal to generate a first feedback signal.id.the description of the second circuit operation was for generating a first control signal during a first state of circuit operation.id.at.similarly,the description of the third circuit operation was for generating a second control signal during a second state of circuit operation to cause both switching transistors to be simultaneously off.id.importantly,however,linear relied on expert testimony to determine whether these descriptions of the circuit operation conveyed sufficient structure to one skilled in the art.that persons of ordinary skill in the art would understand the structural arrangements of circuit components from the term circuit coupled with the qualifying language of claim was recognized by linear expert witness,id.at emphasis added,who opined that one skilled in the art would have an understanding of,and would be able to draw,structural arrangements of the circuit elements defined by the claims.id.emphases added.thus,in linear,it was not merely the particular descriptions of the operation of the circuit that connoted sufficient structure,but also the expert testimony that these descriptions conveyed sufficient structure to one skilled in the art because the artisan would be able to draw structural arrangements of the circuit elements.id.
here,we face a description of only the circuit function,not of how it operates with other circuits or devices to carry out that function.moreover,even assuming we had a description of the circuit operation,for interactively introducing aesthetically desired alterations into said appearance signals to produce modified appearance signals,patent,ll,we were shown no evidence from which to conclude that this description identifies the circuit components or conveys the arrangeme
