iii.discussion 
in,congress passed the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa or the act,app.i,stat,as an amendment to the trademark act of the lanham act.the acpa applies to a person who registers,traffics in,or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive mark or that is identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of a famous mark.acpa codified at d a.liability under the acpa requires a bad faith intent to profit,and the acpa provides a list of factors that courts may consider in determining whether a person acts in bad faith.acpa codified at d a b.
the acpa provides for injunctive relief,acpa a codified at a,and recovery of actual damages,acpa a codified at a.furthermore,the acpa permits a plaintiff to seek,subject to court approval,between and in statutory damages per domain name in lieu of actual damages.acpa b codified at d.the acpa applies to all domain names registered before,on,or after the date of the enactment of the acpa,but actual and statutory damages are not available with respect to the registration,trafficking,or use of a domain name that occurred before the date of the enactment.acpa codified at note.
in this case,the district court granted ford injunctive relief and in statutory damages because catalanotte used and trafficked in the domain name within the meaning of d by offering to sell the domain name to ford motor company.
registration 
catalanotte first argues that he can not be required to pay statutory damages for the registration,trafficking in,or use of the domain name because he registered the domain name before enactment of the acpa.ford contends that although catalanotte is not liable for damages for the registration of the domain name,he can be held accountable in damages for trafficking in the domain name because he offered to sell the domain name on october,after enactment of the acpa.
the acpa contains the following effective date provision 
sections a,and of this title shall apply to all domain names registered before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act,except that damages under subsection a or d of section of the trademark act of actual and statutory damages,as amended by section of this title,shall not be available with respect to the registration,trafficking,or use of a domain name that occurs before the date of the enactment of this act.
acpa codified at note.catalanotte argues that section precludes statutory damages where registration,trafficking,or use of a domain name has occurred before enactment of the acpa.thus,he claims that statutory damages can not be awarded against him because he registered the domain name before enactment of the acpa,even though the district court found that he trafficked in the domain name after enactment of the acpa.
catalanotte construction of the effective date provision of the acpa is contrary to the plain language of the provision.in fact,the first portion of the effective date provision makes clear that the acpa shall apply to all domain names registered before,on,or after the date of the enactment of the acpa.id.registration,trafficking,and use of a domain name are separate acts upon which liability may be based.although damages may not be awarded for registration,trafficking,or use,the fact that a domain name was registered before the act passage does not absolve the registrant from liability for trafficking or use.in this case,the district court did not award ford any damages for catalanotte registration of the domain name.instead,the district court awarded damages only for catalanotte trafficking in and use of the domain name after passage of the act,when catalanotte offered to sell the domain name to ford.
catalanotte cites several cases addressing the acpa,but they fail to support his position that the acpa precludes liability based on domain names that were registered prior to enactment of the acpa.in people for the ethical treatment of animals doughney,cir,the defendant registered the domain name in to host a website for people eating tasty animals,a parody of the plaintiff organization.the defendant used the domain name for six months in and before moving the website to a different domain name.id.at.the plaintiff in doughney sued seeking only injunctive relief.id.therefore,the court did not have an opportunity to consider whether an award of damages was appropriate,although the court found that the acpa applies retroactively to all domain names registered before enactment of the acpa.id.at.the court quoted the acpa prohibition against damages for conduct before the act enactment and noted that damages could not be awarded because the defendant registration and use of all occurred before enactment of the acpa.id.
catalanotte also relies on sporty farm sportsman market,cir,where the court found that damages under the acpa were unavailable because the domain name at issue was registered and used prior to the passage of the new law.what catalanotte fails to note,however,is that the infringing party in sporty did not use the domain name after enactment of the acpa therefore,the court had no reason to consider whether the infringer could be liable for damages for conduct after the acpa enactment.in sporty,a competitor of sportsman market,registered the domain name in.id.at.in,the competitor sold the domain name to a newly formed subsidiary,sporty farm,which grows and sells christmas trees.id.sporty farm soon began using the domain name for a website advertising its christmas trees.id.although the acpa was not enacted until the sporty case was on appeal,the district court had issued an injunction pursuant to the federal trademark dilution act,prohibiting sporty farm from using the domain name.id.thus,sporty farm never used or trafficked in the domain name after enactment of the acpa.unlike in doughney and sporty,the district court in this case found that catalanotte used and
