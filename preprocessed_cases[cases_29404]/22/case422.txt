appellants filed suit in missouri state court,alleging claims of negligence,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duties.after removal,appellee prudential savings bank prudential savings moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.appellants resisted the motion and filed a request for jurisdictional discovery.the district court then granted prudential securities motion and denied appellants request.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for jurisdictional discovery.
beginning in a group of martin frankel,john hackney,gary atnip,and and ran several insurance companies.after acquiring the companies,they allegedly engaged in an elaborate looting scheme,which converted and misappropriated the assets and funds of these insurance companies.the insurance companies are now insolvent and in receivership.appellants serve as the receivers of these insurance companies,which are located in their respective,mississippi,tennessee,and oklahoma.
appellee prudential savings is a savings bank.its principal place of business and its home office are located in the state of georgia.in december,as part of the scheme,hackney opened a custody account at prudential savings on behalf of franklin american life insurance company fal,a insurance company.on december,the account received a deposit of approximately million allegedly that money was later transferred to another bank account in tennessee and then to frankel swiss bank account.
after the alleged fraud was exposed and the insurance companies went insolvent,appellants filed a complaint against prudential savings and others in missouri state court.in pertinent part,the suit alleged that prudential savings was negligent and breached its contractual and fiduciary duties to fal when it allegedly permitted the million to be released to frankel without proper instruction from fal officers.after the suit was filed,the case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of missouri.
prudential savings then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,arguing that it has only one physical in that it has virtually no contact with missouri residents.appellants countered that from december to june,prudential savings did have sufficient contacts with the state of missouri.appellants noted that prudential savings maintained loans and lines of credit to missouri residents totaling around million,or one percent of its loan portfolio.in addition,appellants noted that prudential savings maintained a web.banking on which prudential savings services are offered to missouri residents.as an alternative,appellants requested leave for jurisdictional discovery.the district court,however,disagreed with appellants,granted prudential services motion to dismiss,and denied appellants motion for jurisdictional discovery.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for jurisdictional discovery.
we review de novo whether appellants have presented a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellants and resolving all factual conflicts in their favor.pecoraro sky ranch for boys,cir.as we sit in diversity for this suit,our analysis of personal jurisdiction involves two steps.we first must consider whether the state of missouri would accept jurisdiction under the facts of this case.sondergard miles,cir.then,we must determine whether that exercise of jurisdiction comports with constitutional due process restrictions.id.
jurisdiction 
the supreme court has noted that states exercise two broad types of personal jurisdiction specific jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,nn,d.specific jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over causes of action that arise out of or relate to a defendant activities within a state.burger king rudzewicz,d.general jurisdiction,on the other hand,refers to the power of a state to adjudicate any cause of action involving a particular defendant,regardless of where the cause of action arose.sondergard,at citation omitted see also helicopteros,at.
appellants first argue that they have established a prima facie case of specific jurisdiction.however,a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction can only be established if prudential savings has purposefully directed its activities at missouri residents,and the claim of this suit either arises out of or relates to these activities.burger king,at.citation omitted see also state ex rel.newport wiesman,en banc extending the missouri statute to the extent permissible under the due process clause.here,the cause of action prudential savings was negligent and breached its contractual and fiduciary duties to entirely unrelated to prudential securities activities in missouri.rather,the cause of action arises out of and relates to activities in the state of tennessee.as a result,appellants argument for specific jurisdiction fails.
appellants next argue that the facts of this prudential securities web site and its loans and lines of credit to missouri residents are sufficient to establish general jurisdiction over prudential securities.thus,we must examine whether missouri has authorized the exercise of general jurisdiction over corporations,and whether it would apply the doctrine in this case.sondergard,at.
the missouri supreme court has long held that a foreign corporation present and conducting substantial business in missouri is subject to the jurisdiction of missouri courts.state ex rel.holliger,en banc citing cases holding the same from forward.missouri courts have interpreted the phrase present and conducting substantial business to mean that jurisdiction will be established if a corporation has substantial and continuous contacts with the state of missouri morse chevrolet,citing int l shoe washington.see also shouse rfb constr.this is identical to the federal due process requirements.see int l shoe,at.see also helicopteros,at.perkins benguet consol.mining.
having determined that missouri courts have authorized general jurisdiction,we must now determine if a missouri court would apply the doctrine in this case.generally,missouri most hesitant to exercise general jurisdiction over defendants,at see also davis baylor.nevertheless,after reviewing the relevant factors and the applicable law,we conclude that appellants could establish a case of general personal jurisdiction if they are permitted to take jurisdictional discovery on remand.
business contacts 
first,from december to june,prudential savings maintained loans and lines of credit to persons in missouri.these contacts are continuous.loans and lines of credit are not single transactions.rather,the terms of these loans are typically measured in months and continuous contacts with the state of missouri.
appellants also argue that these business contacts are substantial because they total approximately million.prudential securities counters that the loans and lines of credit only makes up one percent of their total loan portfolio.they therefore reason that the contacts should be considered insubstantial to establish general jurisdiction while missouri courts have not commented on whether percentages of a corporation total business in a forum state should be given special consideration in this determination,at least one of our sister circuits has directly addressed this issue.provident bank cal.fed.sav.loan,cir dealing with this issue in a very similar factual scenario 
in provident,plaintiff provident sued defendant california federal in pennsylvania.id.at.california federal,a bank,whose headquarters were located in california,had branch offices in california,in florida,thirteen in georgia,and six in nevada,but no branches in pennsylvania.id.at.moreover,it maintained no pennsylvania office,employees,agents,mailing address,or telephone number.it had not applied to do business in pennsylvania,did no advertising in pennsylvania,and paid no taxes there.id.during the relevant period,california federal had about million in outstanding loans with pennsylvania residents.id.this,however,only amounted to of california federal total loan portfolio of billion.id.california federal also had pennsylvania depositors,whose total deposits amounted to around million,or of its total deposits.
california federal argued that the action should be dismissed for lack of general personal jurisdiction.it further argued that if a company does a small percentage of its business in a state,then such percentage should create a presumption for a lack of jurisdiction.the court of appeals disagreed,noting that the size of the percentage of california federal total business represented by its pennsylvania contacts is in general irrelevant id.at see also gehling george school of medicine,cir stating the same,but finding no jurisdiction.likewise,it did not find the absolute amount of dollars completely persuasive.instead,it found more convincing the nature of the deposits and the fact that the loans and deposits were central to the conduct of its business.id.finally,the court found significant the fact that california federal can become the owner of a loan secured by property in pennsylvania provident,at citation omitted.
we agree.percentage of a company sales in a given state are generally irrelevant.instead,our focus is on whether a defendant activity in the forum state is continuous and systematic.helicopteros,at.many companies conduct millions of dollars in sales worldwide yet only do a small percentage of their sales in any one state,bean,at sales in california for bean,only accounted for six percent of its total sales.however,our relevant inquiry is not whether the percentage of a company contacts is substantial for that company rather,our inquiry focuses on whether the company contacts are substantial for the forum.
as the record stands,prudential securities contacts are substantial.prudential securities has nearly million in its missouri loan portfolio.because loans and lines of credit can represent indebtedness of as little as a few thousand dollars million in such loans can represent the establishment of lending relationships with hundreds,if not thousands of missouri residents.moreover,it is noteworthy that loans and lines of credit are central to the conduct of prudential securities business.provident,at.while it is true that the loans were made in georgia,it is likely that such loans are secured with missouri residents property,which was used as collateral for the loan.see.et.if this is true,then prudential security will have liens on hundreds to thousands of pieces of real property in missouri and the power to use missouri courts to enforce them.see.however,it is unclear from the record if this is the case.appellants must be permitted to have the opportunity to establish these facts through jurisdictional discovery.
internet contacts 
second,appellants assert that prudential securities web site should render it subject to general jurisdiction.missouri courts have not yet addressed whether a web site may provide sufficient minimum contacts to invoke personal jurisdiction neither have we.however,many of our sister circuits have.unfortunately,the majority of these cases address whether a web site can provide sufficient contacts to invoke specific jurisdiction,toys r us,step two,cir specific jurisdiction in trademark infringement case als scan,digital serv,cir same bensusan rest.king,cir same cybersell,cybersell,cir same compuserve,patterson,cir same see also young new haven advocate,cir specific jurisdiction for defamation action.
the great majority of these cases have adopted the analytical framework of zippo manufacturing zippo dot com.in a case of specific court examined the few cases that had previously addressed the issue of whether a web site could provide sufficient contacts for specific personal jurisdiction.it applied the results of these cases to the traditional personal jurisdiction analytical framework,noting that the likelihood that personal jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and quality of the commercial activity that an entity conducts over the internet.at.in order to measure the nature and quality of the commercial activity,the court created a sliding scale to measure the likelihood of personal jurisdiction.it noted 
at one end of the spectrum are situations where a defendant clearly does business over the internet.if the defendant enters into contracts with residents of a foreign jurisdiction that involve the knowing and repeated transmission of computer files over the internet,personal jurisdiction is proper.at the opposite end are situations where a defendant has simply posted information on an internet web site which is accessible to users in foreign jurisdictions.a passive web site that does little more than make information available to those who are interested in it is not grounds for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.the middle ground is occupied by interactive web sites where a user can exchange information with the host computer.in these cases,the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the web site.

we agree with our sister circuits that the zippo model is an appropriate approach in cases of specific,ones in which we need only find minimum contacts.however,we are presented with a case of general personal,one in which we must find substantial and continuous contacts.the circuits that have addressed which analytical model to apply to a case of general jurisdiction have split on whether to accept the zippo sliding scale.compare bean,at applying zippo and finding general jurisdiction gorman ameritrade holding,same soma med.int l standard chartered bank,cir applying zippo,but finding no general jurisdiction with revell lidov,cir noting that the zippo sliding scale is not well adapted to the general jurisdiction inquiry bell imperial palace,d,noting that while the sliding scale suggested by the court in zippo may be a relevant factor in assessing general jurisdiction,it is not alone determinative footnote omitted.
we agree with the courts that do not apply the sliding scale presumptively for cases of general jurisdiction.certainly,we believe that a consideration of the nature and quality of a web site and a determination of whether it is interactive,does business,or is merely passive is an important factor in our analysis.however,we have long held that the nature and quality of contacts is only one factor to consider.instead,we consider a variety of on the a personal jurisdiction analysis.aftanase econ.baler,cir creating the five factors to consider for personal jurisdiction and applying them depending on their relevance to the case.
we first discussed the factors in aftanase.in this case,judge harry blackmun analyzed and summarized the controlling united states supreme court cases on the subject of personal jurisdiction.id.at summarizing hanson denckla,d mcgee int l life ins,d perkins,at.travelers health ass virginia ex rel.state.comm n.int l shoe,at.judge blackmun then observed that each of these cases established general instead of precise guidelines,but that each of the cases had several factors,which the supreme court repeatedly identified.id.at.specifically,judge blackmun noted that 
a t one time or another in the opinions,three primary factors,namely,the quantity of the contacts,the nature and quality of the contacts,and the source and connection of the cause of action with those contacts,are stressed,and that two others,the interest of the forum state and convenience of the parties,receive mention.
id.it is apparent that the primary factors relate to our consideration of a defendant contacts at a minimum,in a specific jurisdiction case we will consider the last two of the primary factors the nature and quality of the contacts,and their source and connection to the cause of action.in such a case,the zippo test would function appropriately.however,in a general jurisdiction case,we do not consider the source and connection to the cause of action,but rather we consider the nature and quality of the contacts as well as the quantity of the contacts.bell paper box,kids,cir citations omitted dist
