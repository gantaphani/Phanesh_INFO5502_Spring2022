background 
rio owns the rio all suite casino resort,the best hotel value in the world according to travel and leisure magazine,not to mention the best overall hotel in las vegas,according to the zagat survey of resorts,hotels and spas.in addition to its elegant hotel,rio gambling empire consists of the rio race sports book,which allows customers to wager on professional sports.to protect its exclusive rights in the rio name,rio registered numerous trademarks with the united states patent and trademark office.when rio sought to expand its presence onto the internet,it registered the domain name.at that address,rio operates a website that informs prospective customers about its hotel and allows those enticed by lady luck to make reservations.
rii is a costa rican entity that participates in an internet sports gambling operation,doing business variously as rio international sportsbook,rio online sportsbook,or rio international sports.rii enables its customers to wager on sporting events online or via a telephone number.far from a penny ante operation,rii grosses an estimated million annually.
rio became aware of rii existence by virtue of rii advertisement in the football betting guide preview.rio later discovered,in the nevada edition of the daily racing form,another rii advertisement which invited customers to visit rii website.rii also ran radio spots in las vegas as part of its comprehensive marketing strategy.
upon learning of rii,rio fired off an epistle demanding that rii cease and desist from operating the website.although rii did not formally respond,it promptly disabled the objectionable website.apparently not ready to cash in its chips,rii soon activated the url http to host an identical sports gambling operation.perturbed,rio filed the present action alleging various trademark infringement claims and seeking to enjoin rii from the continued use of the name rio.
to initiate suit,rio attempted to locate rii in the united states for service of process.rio discovered that rii claimed an address in miami,florida when it registered the allegedly infringing domain names.as it turned out,however,that address housed only rii international courier,iec,which was not authorized to accept service on rii behalf.nevertheless,iec agreed to forward the summons and complaint to rii costa rican courier.
after sending a copy of the summons and complaint through iec,rio received a telephone call from los angeles attorney john carpenter carpenter inquiring about the lawsuit.apparently,rii received the summons and complaint from iec and subsequently consulted carpenter about how to respond.carpenter indicated that rii provided him with a partially illegible copy of the complaint and asked rio to send him a complete copy.rio agreed to resend the complaint and,in addition,asked carpenter to accept service for rii carpenter politely declined.carpenter did,however,request that rio notify him upon successful completion of service of process on rii.
thus thwarted in its attempt to serve rii in the united states,rio investigated the possibility of serving rii in costa rica.toward this end,rio searched international directory databases looking for rii address in costa rica.these efforts proved fruitless however the investigator learned only that rii preferred communication through its email address,and received snail mail,including payment for its services,at the iec address in florida.
unable to serve rii by conventional means,rio filed an emergency motion for alternate service of process.rii opted not to respond to rio motion.the district court granted rio motion,and pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure h and f,ordered service of process on rii through the mail to carpenter and iec and via rii email address.
court order in hand,rio served rii by these methods.rii filed a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction.the parties fully briefed the issues,and the district court denied rii motion without a hearing.rii then filed its answer,denying rio allegations and asserting affirmative defenses.
as the case proceeded,rio propounded discovery requests and interrogatories on rii.rio granted rii two informal extensions of time in which to respond.nonetheless,rii eventual responses were almost entirely useless,consisting largely of the answer,ostensibly meaning not applicable.after additional futile attempts to elicit good faith responses from rii,rio brought a motion to compel discovery.in granting rio motion,the district court warned that in the event rii failed to comply,monetary sanctions would be an insufficient remedy and that preclusive sanctions would be awarded.when rii failed to comply with the district court discovery order,rio moved for terminating sanctions.although rii belatedly complied,in part,with rio discovery request,the district court granted rio motion for sanctions and entered default judgment against rii.citing rii reprehensible conduct and bad faith,the district court additionally directed rii to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs to rio in the amount of and respectively.
rii now appeals the sufficiency of the service of process,the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction as well as the propriety of the default judgment,and the award of attorneys fees and costs.
discussion 
i alternative service of processa.applicability of rule f 
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision regarding the sufficiency of service of process.walker sumner,cir.federal rule of civil procedure h authorizes service of process on a foreign business entity in the manner prescribed by rule f for individuals.the subsection of rule f relevant to our decision,rule f permits service in a place not within any judicial district of the united states by means not prohibited by international agreement as may be directed by the court.
as obvious from its plain language,service under rule f must be directed by the court and not prohibited by international agreement.no other limitations are evident from the text.in fact,as long as and not prohibited by an international agreement,service of process ordered under rule f may be accomplished in contravention of the laws of the foreign country.see bhi.but see.f advisory committee notes stating that under rule f,s ervice by methods that would violate foreign law is not generally authorized.
rii argues that rule f should be read to create a hierarchy of preferred methods of service of process.rii interpretation would require that a party attempt service of process by those methods enumerated in rule f,including by diplomatic channels and letters rogatory,before petitioning the court for alternative relief under rule f.we find no support for rii position.no such requirement is found in the rule text,implied by its structure,or even hinted at in the advisory committee notes.
by all indications,service under rule f is as favored as service available under rule f or rule f.see forum fin.group,llc president fellows.indeed,rule f is one of three separately numbered subsections in rule f,and each subsection is separated from the one previous merely by the simple conjunction or.rule f is not subsumed within or in any way dominated by rule f other subsections it stands independently,on equal footing.moreover,no language in rules f or f indicates their primacy,and certainly rule f includes no qualifiers or limitations which indicate its availability only after attempting service of process by other means.
the advisory committee notes advisory notes bolster our analysis.beyond stating that service ordered under rule f must comport with constitutional notions of due process and must not be prohibited by international agreement,the advisory notes indicate the availability of alternate service of process under rule f without first attempting service by other means.specifically,the advisory notes suggest that in cases of urgency,rule f may allow the district court to order a special method of service,even if other methods of service remain incomplete or unattempted.
thus,examining the language and structure of rule f and the accompanying advisory committee notes,we are left with the inevitable conclusion that service of process under rule f is neither a last resort nor extraordinary relief.forum fin.group,at.it is merely one means among several which enables service of process on an international defendant.
rii argues that graval bakrie,requires attempted service by other methods,including through diplomatic channels or letters rogatory,before resort to service under rule f.the court in graval believed that rule f was intended as a last resort,only to be employed when there are no other feasible alternatives.id.yet,the court in graval erroneously based this belief on an advisory committee note pertaining solely to rule f which simply does not apply to rule f.id.indeed,graval interpretation of rule f is indefensible it is unsupported by rule f language and structure or by any proper reading of the advisory committee notes.nor does any other case interpreting rule f or its predecessor endorse graval interpretation.thus,we disapprove of the statements in graval which would require attempted service by all feasible alternatives before service under rule f is allowed.instead,we hold that rule f is an equal means of effecting service of process under the federal rules of civil procedure,and we commit to the sound discretion of the district court the task of determining when the particularities and necessities of a given case require alternate service of process under rule f.
applying this proper construction of rule f and its predecessor,trial courts have authorized a wide variety of alternative methods of service including publication,ordinary mail,mail to the defendant last known address,delivery to the defendant attorney,telex,and most recently,email.see sec tome,cir condoning service of process by publication in the int l herald tribune smith islamic emirate,civ,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,authorizing service of process on terrorism impresario osama bin laden and by publication levin ruby trading,employing service by ordinary mail int l controls vesco,cir approving service by mail to last known address forum fin.group,at authorizing service to defendant attorney new eng.merchs.bank iran power generation transmission,allowing service by telex for iranian defendants broadfoot diaz in re int l telemedia,authorizing service via email.
in this case,rio attempted to serve rii by conventional means in the united states.although rii claimed an address in florida,that address housed only iec,rii international courier,which refused to accept service of process on rii behalf.rii attorney,carpenter,who was specifically consulted in this matter,also declined to accept service of process.rio private investigator subsequently failed to discover rii whereabouts in costa rica.thus unable to serve rii,rio brought an emergency motion to effectuate alternative service of process.
contrary to rii assertions,rio need not have attempted every permissible means of service of process before petitioning the court for alternative relief.instead,rio needed only to demonstrate that the facts and circumstances of the present case necessitated the district court intervention.thus,when rio presented the district court with its inability to serve an elusive international defendant,striving to evade service of process,the district court properly exercised its discretionary powers to craft alternate means of service.we expressly agree with the district court handling of this case and its use of rule f to ensure the smooth functioning of our courts of law.
reasonableness of the court ordered methods of service 
even if facially permitted by rule f,a method of service of process must also comport with constitutional notions of due process.to meet this requirement,the method of service crafted by the district court must be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane cent.hanover bank trust.jackson.
without hesitation,we conclude that each alternative method of service of process ordered by the district court was constitutionally acceptable.in our view,each method of service was reasonably calculated,under these circumstances,to apprise rii of the pendency of the action and afford it an opportunity to respond.
in particular,service through iec was appropriate because rii listed iec address as its own when registering the allegedly infringing domain name.the record also reflects that rii directed its customers to remit payment to iec address.moreover,when rio sent a copy of the summons and complaint to rii through iec,rii received it.all told,this evidence indicates that rii relied heavily upon iec to operate its business in the united states and that iec could effectively pass information to rii in costa rica.
service upon carpenter was also appropriate because he had been specifically consulted by rii regarding this lawsuit.he knew of rii legal positions,and it seems clear that he was in contact with rii in costa rica.accordingly,service to carpenter was also reasonably calculated in these circumstances to apprise rii of the pendency of the present action.
finally,we turn to the district court order authorizing service of process on rii by email at.we acknowledge that we tread upon untrodden ground.the parties cite no authority condoning service of process over the internet or via email,and our own investigation has unearthed no decisions by the united states courts of appeals dealing with service of process by email and only one case anywhere in the federal courts.despite this dearth of authority,however,we do not labor long in reaching our decision.considering the facts presented by this case,we conclude not only that service of process by email was is,reasonably calculated to apprise rii of the pendency of the action and afford it an opportunity to in this case,it was the method of service most likely to reach rii.
to be sure,the constitution does not require any particular means of service of process,only that the method selected be reasonably calculated to provide notice and an opportunity to respond.see mullane,at.in proper circumstances,this broad constitutional principle unshackles the federal courts from anachronistic methods of service and permits them entry into the technological renaissance.as noted by the court in new england merchants,in granting permission to effect service of process via telex on iranian defendants 
courts can not be blind to changes and advances in technology.no longer do we live in a world where communications are conducted solely by mail carried by fast sailing clipper ships.electronic communication via satellite can and does provide instantaneous transmission of notice and information.no longer must process be mailed to a defendant door when he can receive complete notice at an electronic terminal inside his very office,even when the door is steel and bolted shut.
at.we agree wholeheartedly.
although communication via email and over the internet is comparatively new,such communication has been zealously embraced within the business community.rii particularly has embraced the modern model and profited immensely from it.in fact,rii structured its business such that it could be contacted only via its email address.rii listed no easily discoverable street address in the united states or in costa rica.rather,on its website and print media,rii designated its email address as its preferred contact information.
unlike the iranian officials in new england merchants,rii had neither an office nor a door it had only a computer terminal.if any method of communication is reasonably calculated to provide rii with notice,surely it is method of communication which rii utilizes and prefers.in addition,email was the only method of service aimed directly and instantly at rii,as opposed to methods of service effected through intermediaries like iec and carpenter.indeed,when faced with an international scofflaw,playing with the federal court,email may be the only means of effecting service of process.certainly in this case,it was a means reasonably calculated to apprise rii of the pendency of the lawsuit,and the constitution requires nothing more.
citing wawa,christensen,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.july,unpublished,rii contends that email is never an approved method of service under rule we disagree.in wawa,the plaintiff attempted to serve the defendant via email absent a court order.although rii is correct that a plaintiff may not generally resort to email service on his own initiative,in this case,as in international telemedia associates,email service was properly ordered by the district court using its discretion under rule f.
despite our endorsement of service of process by email in this case,we are cognizant of its limitations.in most instances,there is no way to confirm receipt of an email message.limited use of electronic signatures could present problems in complying with the verification requirements of rule a and rule,and system compatibility problems may lead to controversies over whether an exhibit or attachment was actually received.imprecise imaging technology may even make appending exhibits and attachments impossible in some circumstances.we note,however,that,except for the provisions recently introduced into rule b,email service is not available absent a rule f court decree.accordingly,we leave it to the discretion of the district court to balance the limitations of email service against its benefits in any particular case.see,at declining to authorize alternative service under rule f.in our case,the district court performed the balancing test admirably,crafting methods of service reasonably calculated under the circumstances to apprise rii of the pendency of the action 
ii jurisdiction 
the district court determination that personal jurisdiction can be exercised is a question of law reviewed de novo.panavision int l,toeppen,cir.although the defendant is the moving party on a motion to dismiss,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists.see kvos,press.where,as here,the district court receives only written submissions,the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction to avoid the defendant motion to dismiss.omeluk langsten slip batbyggeri,cir data disc.tech,cir.in determining whether rio has met this burden,uncontroverted allegations in rio complaint must be taken as true,and conflicts between the facts contained in the parties affidavits must be resolved in rio favor.at t compagnie bruxelles lambert,cir.
to establish that personal jurisdiction over rii is proper,rio must show that nevada statute confers personal jurisdiction over rii and that the exercise of jurisdiction comports with the constitutional principles of due process.see omeluk,at.nevada statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction to the same extent as the constitution.hence,we consider only the constitutional principles of due process which require that rii have minimum contacts with nevada such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.
general jurisdiction is not at issue on appeal we consider only whether the district court properly exercised specific jurisdiction over rii.a test dictates whether specific jurisdiction can be exercised over the defendant rii must have performed some act or consummated some transaction with the forum by which it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in nevada rio claims must arise out of or result from rii activities and the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.burger king rudzewicz,d haisten grass valley med.reimbursement fund,cir.
purposeful availment 
the purposeful availment requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into court based upon random,fortuitous,or attenuated contacts with the forum state.see burger king,at.a defendant purposefully avails itself of the forum if its contacts with the forum are attributable to intentional acts expressly aimed at the forum causing harm,the brunt of which is which the defendant knows is likely to be the forum.see calder jones,d establishing an effects doctrine for intentional action aimed at the forum core vent nobel indus.ab,cir.
in cybersell,cybersell,cir,we considered the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a website advertiser.the website advertiser had done nothing other than register a domain name and post an essentially passive website.certainly,it had done nothing to encourage residents of the forum state to access its site.see id.at.we held that these acts were insufficient to confer jurisdiction over a defendant.the objectionable webpage simply was not aimed intentionally at the forum state knowing that harm was likely to be caused there.id.at.under the effects doctrine,something more was required to indicate that the defendant purposefully directed its activity in a substantial way to the forum state.id.at.
in panavision,at,toeppen,a cybersquatter,registered and posted a passive website at.toeppen then sent letters to panavision demanding in return for the hijacked domain name.by sending these letters into california,toeppen evinced knowledge that his cybersquatting injured panavision in principal place of business and the epicenter of the movie and television industry.looking beyond toeppen passive website,we found that his letters directly targeted the forum,and thus,constituted the requisite something more necessary to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction.see also sinatra enquirer,cir exercising personal jurisdiction over a swiss clinic that misappropriated frank sinatra name through a series of advertisements aimed at california residents and thereby caused injury in california.
here,the district court ruled on rii motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction after receiving only written submissions,including pleadings and affidavits.rio was thus charged with making a prima facie showing of facts that might establish personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.
rio alleged that rii operated a website that allows customers throughout the united states and the world to place wagers on sporting events.rii responded that merely operating an internet advertisement or a passive website can not confer personal jurisdiction.while rii assertion may be true,see panavision,at cybersell,at,operating even a passive website in conjunction with something more conduct directly targeting the sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.panavision,at.
here,rio sufficiently alleged that rii engaged in something more than the operation of a passive website.in its complaint,rio alleged that rii specifically targeted consumers in nevada by running radio and print advertisements in las vegas.in particular,rio alleged that rii advertised in the football betting guide preview and the daily racing form.in fact,rio attached to its complaint a copy of rii print advertisement from the nevada edition of the daily racing form.clearly,rii knowingly injured rio in principal place of business and the capital of the gambling industry.all told,rii actions in nevada,including its radio and print advertisements,demonstrate an insistent marketing campaign directed toward nevada.therefore,we have no problem finding that under the effects doctrine,the purposeful availment requirement for the exercise of personal jurisdiction is satisfied 
rii forum related activities 
the second requirement for specific jurisdiction is that rio claim arise out of rii activities.this requirement is satisfied if rio would not have been injured but for rii conduct i
