the united states appeals from the district court dismissal of several counts of an indictment charging david nosal with,inter alia,numerous violations of the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,subsection a,the subsection under which nosal was charged,subjects to punishment anyone who knowingly and with intent to defraud,accesses a protected computer without authorization,or exceeds authorized access,and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value.id.a.the indictment alleges that nosal exceeded their authorized access to their employer computer system in violation of a by obtaining information from the computer system for the purpose of defrauding their employer and helping nosal set up a competing business.
the district court relied on our decision in lvrc holdings llc brekka,cir,in determining that an employee does not exceed authorized access to a computer by accessing information unless the employee has no authority to access the information under any circumstances in other words,an employer restrictions on the use of the computer or of the information stored on that computer are irrelevant to determining whether an employee has exceeded his or her authorization.the government contends,on the other hand,that brekka counsels in favor of its interpretation of the statute that an employee exceeds authorized access when he or she obtains information from the computer and uses it for a purpose that violates the employer restrictions on the use of the information.
we have jurisdiction under,and we agree with the government.although we are mindful of the concerns raised by defense counsel regarding the criminalization of violations of an employer computer use policy,we are persuaded that the specific intent and causation requirements of a sufficiently protect against criminal prosecution those employees whose only violation of employer policy is the use of a company computer for personal but innocuous reasons.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to reinstate counts,and.
background 
for purposes of our review,the indictment allegations must be taken as true.united states fiander,cir.
the allegations against nosal 
from approximately april to october,nosal worked as an executive for international,an executive search firm.when nosal left in october,he signed a separation and general release agreement and an independent contractor agreement.pursuant to these contracts,nosal agreed to serve as an independent contractor for and not to compete with for one year.in return,agreed to pay nosal two payments in addition to twelve monthly payments of.
shortly after leaving his employment,nosal engaged three employees to help him start a competing business.the indictment alleges that these employees obtained trade secrets and other proprietary information by using their user accounts to access the computer system.specifically,the employees transferred to nosal source lists,names,and contact information from the searcher database a highly confidential and proprietary database of executives and companies which was considered by to be one of the most comprehensive databases of executive candidates in the world.
paragraphs of the indictment describe efforts to keep its database secure 
undertook considerable measures to maintain the confidentiality of the information contained in the searcher database.these measures included controlling electronic access to the searcher database and controlling physical access to the computer servers that contained the database.employees received unique usernames and created passwords for use on the company computer systems,including for use in accessing the searcher database.these usernames and passwords were intended to be used by the employee only.
required all of its employees to enter into agreements that both explained the proprietary nature of the information disclosed or made available to employees including the information contained in the searcher database and restricted the use and disclosure of all such information,except for legitimate business 
among other additional measures,also declared the confidentiality of the information in the searcher database by placing the phrase proprietary and confidential on every custom report generated from the searcher database.further,when an individual logged into the computer system,that computer system displayed the following notification,in sum and substance 
this computer system and information it stores and processes are the property of.you need specific authority to access any system or information and to do so without the relevant authority can lead to disciplinary action or criminal prosecution.

district court proceedings 
on june,the government filed a superseding indictment against nosal and one of his accomplices.counts through of the indictment allege that the employees who conspired with nosal and nosal himself as an aider and abettor violated a.
nosal filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.he argued that the cfaa was aimed primarily at computer hackers and that the statute does not cover employees who misappropriate information or who violate contractual confidentiality agreements by using information in a manner inconsistent with those agreements.in other words,the employees could not have acted without authorization,nor could they have exceed ed authorized access,because they had permission to access the computer and its information under certain circumstances.
recognizing that the question was one of first impression in the ninth circuit,the district court described the two lines of diverging case law on this issue 
some courts,including two courts of appeal,have broadly construed the cfaa to hold an employee acting to access an employer computer to obtain business information with intent to defraud,for their own personal benefit or the benefit of a competitor,act without authorization or exceed authorization in violation of the statute.these courts have generally held that authorized access to a company computer terminated once an employee acted with adverse or nefarious interests and against the duty of loyalty imposed on an employee in an agency relationship with his or her employer or former employer.
other courts have refused to hold employees with access and nefarious interests within the statute,concluding that a violation for accessing a protected computer without authorization or in excess of authorized access occurs only when initial access or the access of certain information is not permitted in the first instance.those courts have generally reasoned that the cfaa is intended to punish computer hackers,electronic trespassers and other outsiders but not employees who abuse computer access privileges to misuse information derived from their employment.
citations omitted emphasis added.
at first,the district court rejected nosal argument,holding that a person accessing a computer knowingly and with intent to defraud renders the access unauthorized or in excess of authorization.thus,the court refused to dismiss counts through of the superseding indictment 
after the district court denied nosal motion to dismiss,however,we decided lvrc holdings llc brekka,which considered the construction of the phrase without authorization.nosal then filed a motion to reconsider,arguing that brekka required dismissal of the cfaa counts.the district court agreed with nosal as to most of the counts and dismissed counts and.in doing so,the court held that the brekka decision compelled the dismissal and that the phrase exceeds authorized access as used in means having permission to access a portion of a computer or certain information on a computer,but accessing a different portion of the computer or different information on the computer that the employee is not entitled to access under any circumstances.
the district court stated that intent is irrelevant in determining whether a person exceeds authorized access,even if an employee access to the computer is expressly limited by the employer use restrictions.the district court gave as an example the following hypothetical 
i f a person is authorized to access the f drive on a computer or network but is not authorized to access the g drive of that same computer or network,the individual would exceed authorized access if he obtained or altered anything on the g drive.
on the other hand,if the employee accessed the f drive in a manner that violates the employer access restrictions,the employee would not have violated subsection a even if he did so with the intent to defraud,furthered the intended fraud,and obtained something of value.
because the conspirators had authority to obtain information from the searcher database for legitimate business purposes,the district court held that they did not exceed their authorized access by doing so,even if they acted with a fraudulent intent the government appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of an indictment,or of certain counts of that indictment,based on the district court interpretation of a federal statute.united states boren,cir.
discussion 
we are not faced in this appeal with an argument that nosal accomplices accessed the searcher database without authorization.the question we must answer here is whether those accomplices could have exceeded their authorized access by accessing information that they were entitled to access only under limited circumstances.we hold that an employee exceeds authorized access under when he or she violates the employer computer access restrictions including use restrictions.
the statutory language 
the cfaa prohibits a number of different computer crimes,the majority of which involve accessing computers without authorization or in excess of authorization,and then taking specified forbidden actions,ranging from obtaining information to damaging a computer or computer data.brekka,at.we begin our task of deciphering the meaning of this federal statute,as always,with its plain language.see united states maciel alcala,cir.subsection a subjects to punishment anyone who 
knowingly and with intent to defraud,accesses a protected computer without authorization,or exceeds authorized access,and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value,unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than in any year period.
although the statute does not define the phrase without authorization,it does state that exceeds authorized access means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.id.e emphasis added.
the government contends that nosal interpretation of exceeds authorized access would render superfluous the word so in the statutory definition.we agree.so in this context means in a manner or way that is indicated or suggested.webster third new int l dictionary philip babcock gove,ed.thus,an employee exceeds authorized access under e when the employee uses that authorized access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled in that manner to obtain or alter.we decline to render meaningless a word duly enacted by congress.see corley united states,o ne of the most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.because the statute refers to an accesser who is not entitled to access information in a certain manner,whether someone has exceeded authorized access must be defined by those access limitations.the plain language of the statute supports the government interpretation.
lvrc holdings llc brekka 
we must now address nosal argument that brekka requires us to decide this appeal in his favor notwithstanding the plain meaning of the phrase exceeds authorized access.we held in brekka that it is the employer actions that determine whether an employee acts without authorization to access a computer in violation of.brekka was an employee at an addiction treatment center who was negotiating with his employer,lvrc holdings,for the purchase of an ownership interest in the business.during the course of those negotiations,brekka emailed several business documents to his and his wife personal email accounts.the negotiations broke down,and brekka left his employment with lvrc.brekka,at.lvrc later discovered the emails brekka had sent to himself and sued him under g,which provides for a private right of action under the cfaa.
relying primarily on international airport centers,llc citrin,cir,lvrc argued that brekka acted without authorization because by accessing and emailing the documents he acted contrary to his employer interest.in citrin,the seventh circuit held that an employee loses authorization to use a computer when the employee violates a state law duty of loyalty because,based on common law agency principles,the employee actions terminated the relationship and with it his authority to access the computer.id.at.in the seventh circuit,therefore,an employee accesses a computer without authorization the moment the employee uses a computer or information on a computer in a manner adverse to the employer interest.
we rejected the citrin approach as inconsistent with our conclusion that,for purposes of,it is the action of the employer that determines whether an employee is authorized to access the computer 
if the employer has not rescinded the defendant right to use the computer,the defendant would have no reason to know that making personal use of the company computer in breach of a state law fiduciary duty to an employer would constitute a criminal violation of the cfaa.it would be improper to interpret a criminal statute in such an unexpected manner.
brekka.how is an employee supposed to know when authorization has been revoked if the employer does not inform the employee of the revocation it was this concern that motivated us to apply the rule of lenity,which is rooted in considerations of notice and requires courts to limit the reach of criminal statutes to the clear import of their text and construe any ambiguity against the government.id.at quoting united states romm,cir.because lvrc had not notified brekka of any restrictions on his access to the computer,brekka had no way to know whether or when his access would have become unauthorized.therefore,as long as an employee has some permission to use the computer for some purpose,that employee accesses the computer with authorization even if the employee acts with a fraudulent intent.
in determining that the phrase without authorization encompassed only those situations where a defendant had no authorization to access a computer at all,we also relied heavily on the statutory definition of the phrase exceeds authorized access.id.at.we rejected the argument that accessing a computer without authorization could mean accessing the computer for unauthorized purposes because to accept such an argument would effectively remove the exceeds authorized access language from the statute entirely.rather,the sensible interpretation we adopted in brekka gives effect to both prongs 
as this definition in e makes clear,an individual who is authorized to use a computer for certain purposes but goes beyond those limitations is considered by the cfaa as someone who has exceed ed authorized access.on the other hand,a person who uses a computer without authorization has no rights,limited or otherwise,to access the computer in question.
id.emphasis added second alteration in original.
our decision today that an employer use restrictions define whether an employee exceeds authorized access is simply an application of brekka reasoning.as we held in that case,i t is the employer decision to allow or to terminate an employee authorization to access a computer that determines whether the employee is with or without authorization.id.at.based on the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the word authorization,id.at quoting perrin united states,we held that an employer give
