facts and proceedings below 
appellant caldwell was an army specialist who served seven months in iraq,where he was a military police gunner.after returning from iraq in about march or april,he was stationed at fort bliss army base in el paso,texas.in the period beginning about nine or ten months after his return from iraq,the computer in his fort bliss home accumulated seventeen videos depicting child pornography and many more adult pornographic videos.in july of,federal agents discovered that this computer shared child pornography using a file sharing program known as limewire.programs like limewire allow users to share,search,and copy certain files over the internet.an investigation of the internet protocol address revealed that the computer belonged to the defendant.by using one of these programs,agents connected to caldwell computer and searched the files his computer shared on the network.they discovered over fifty files with titles indicative of child pornography.agents downloaded and confirmed that these files depicted child pornography.based on this information,the government executed a search warrant of the defendant home.when agents arrived at the defendant home on november,and provided him with a copy of the search warrant,the defendant spontaneously stated that he knew he had pornography on his computer.the agents found no one other than the defendant at home at the time of the search.
when they entered the defendant living room,the government agents found the defendant computer turned on with the limewire program downloading a file called,animal sex brazilian girl fucking dog.the government found seventeen pornographic videos depicting minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.forensic analysis of the hard drive revealed that these files were created between september,and november.along with child pornography,the agents found multiple videos depicting adult bestiality on the defendant computer.when the defendant testified,he denied ever looking at child pornography or bestiality videos.he denied using his computer to download any pornography on the morning of the search.the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts.
discussion 
displaying child pornography to the jury 
during the government,it offered and published to the jury three short clips taken from over an hour worth of child pornography.it introduced one video of child pornography,which lasted three minutes and seconds.that video was not itself published to the jury.however,the court allowed the government to publish to the jury a short excerpt of that video over the defendant objection.then,the government introduced and published to the jury excerpts from two more child pornography videos found on the defendant computer.these excerpts lasted or seconds and seconds,respectively.the government evidence showed that one of these videos had been opened and previewed approximately half an hour before the agents arrived on november.all three of these brief video excerpts were entered into evidence and published to the jury over the defendant rule objection.
the defense argued that because it had stipulated that the videos contained child pornography,under old chief united states,the government did not need to publish the videos to the jury,d.the stipulation which was read to the jury states 
the government and the defense have stipulated that the videos listed in government exhibit were found in the shared or incomplete limewire folders on the hard drive of the computer belonging to arkon caldwell and seized by george on november,from humphrey caldwell residence,which is located on fort bliss,texas,and is also located within the western district of texas.that these videos were transported to that computer in interstate or foreign commerce,that is,through the internet via limewire.
it is further stipulated that these videos contain visual depictions of minors under the age of,engaging in sexually explicit conduct,and that the parties have no evidence to suggest that actual minors were not used in the creation of those videos,and that the videos do show the minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
caldwell contends that the trial court committed reversible error because it did not conduct a weighing test.
while all relevant evidence tends to prejudice the party against whom it is offered,rule excludes relevant evidence when the probative value of that evidence is substantially outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial nature of the evidence.united states rocha,cir.when one party stipulates to a disputed fact,the stipulation conclusively proves that fact.old chief.at.any additional evidence offered to prove that fact,while still relevant,could potentially violate rule.id.
old chief addresses the admissibility under rule of additional relevant evidence in light of a stipulation.in old chief,the prosecution charged old chief with violating a law that prohibited possession of a firearm by anyone who has been convicted of a felony.id.at.old chief had previously been convicted of the felony offense of assault causing serious bodily injury.id.before trial,old chief moved in limine to prevent the prosecution from discussing the underlying felony and offered a stipulation of old chief convicted felon status at the time in question.id.at.the government refused the stipulation.id.on appeal,the court begins its analysis with the general rule the criminal defendant can not stipulate his way out of the full evidentiary force of the government case.id.at.the court concludes by reversing the conviction as an exception to the general rule because the defendant legal status felon is not part of the government narrative or story.id.at.a foundation of the old chief decision seems to turn on the contribution of the challenged evidence to the overall narrative of the government case.id.at evidence thus has force beyond any linear scheme of reasoning,and as its pieces come together a narrative gains momentum,with power not only to support conclusions but to sustain the willingness of jurors to draw inferences,whatever they may be,necessary to reach an honest verdict.
unlike old chief,child pornography is graphic evidence that has force beyond simple linear schemes of reasoning.it comes together with the remaining evidence to form a narrative to gain momentum to support jurors inferences regarding the defendant guilt.it provides the flesh and blood for the jury to see the exploitation of children.the general,conclusory language of the stipulation that the videos contain visual depictions of minors under the age of eighteen,engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not have the same evidentiary value as actually seeing the particular explicit conduct of the specific minors.jurors have expectations as to the narrative that will unfold in the courtroom.id.at.if those expectations are not met,jurors may very well punish the party who disappoints by drawing a negative inference.id.for example,jurors expect to see a gun in the case of a person charged with using a firearm to commit a crime.id.likewise,the actual videos exploiting children in a child pornography case form the narrative that falls within the general rule stated in old chief.moreover,the specific videos of which the evidence showed was opened and previewed the morning of the how likely it was that the defendant knew that the video depicted child pornography which knowledge the stipulation did not mention.we can not say the trial court abused its discretion when it showed the jury three short excerpts from three of the seventeen different videos of child pornography on defendant computer 
ii.displaying adult pornography to the jury 
during the trial,the government also introduced five adult pornography videos over the defendant rule objection.the trial court allowed the government to show excerpts from two of these videos to the jury first,the government showed the jury a second excerpt from the video that the defendant computer was downloading as agents entered his home.the full length version of this video lasted minutes and seconds,and involved adult bestiality.at the defendant request,the court gave this limiting instruction 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,the government wants to show a clip of the film that was being downloaded at the time the department of the army criminal investigation agent showed up at the quarters of caldwell.it is being shown for a very limited purpose.to summarize,the limited purpose is this it is shown because the government wants to establish that there was no mistake or unintentional aspect to the downloading of the pornographic films.
caldwell is not being charged with downloading obscene adult pornography.so this item of evidence is not being shown to you to show that he had done anything illegal by possessing that kind of pornography.it is simply being shown for the government to establish that he deliberately and intentionally downloaded that type.in other words,that he knew how to use the limewire to do that as shown by the fact that this was happening as the agents came.
do you understand that if any one of you does understand that,please raise your hand,because this limiting instruction is important just of an overabundance of caution.every other item of evidence that is admitted into evidence,you can use for any purpose.in other words,you can use for what it shows and for any reasonable inference you can draw from it,you see.
but this one,i am telling you,specifically,what is the narrow purpose that i am allowing the government to show the clip.
at this point,the trial court asked both parties if either wanted additional instructions.both agreed no additional instructions were necessary.
second,the government selected a similarly brief excerpt from a twenty minute video,entitled,sic zoophilie horse sex blowjob.the lower court gave the jury the following limiting instruction before playing the excerpt to the jury 
ladies and gentlemen,the same issue with respect to the viewing of this film.this is an adult pornography obscene material.caldwell is not being charged with anything having to do with that.however,it is being shown to you for the purposes of establishing lack of intent or mistake at the time that that was that was downloaded.
you may recall that i showed allowed the showing of the first one because that was the one one of the films that he had downloaded or was in the process of downloading at the time that the search warrant was executed.this is a similar film but downloaded using the same software,limewire,at a different point in time.
the record reflects that this particular adult pornography video first came onto caldwell computer on september,and was most recently accessed on november.further,the child pornography video which was accessed on november,before the agents arrived,first came onto caldwell computer on september.
the defendant complains on appeal that the trial court allowed the government to publish the excerpts of the already admitted videos to the jury he does not complain of their admission into evidence itself.caldwell relies on two cases and contends the trial court abused its discretion under rule b when it admitted and displayed the adult pornography.see united states grimes,cir united states lachapelle,cir.as noted in grimes,the fifth circuit uses a two prong test to assess admissibility.grimes,at citing united states beechum,cir.first,we determine whether extrinsic offense evidence is relevant for propensity purposes.id.second,if relevant,we conduct a balancing test under rule to ensure the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence does not substantially outweigh its probative value.id.
in grimes,the court found sexually explicit narratives downloaded a year prior to the offense were still relevant.id.at narratives involved sexual conduct between adults and minors.here,both of the videos in question satisfy the first prong of this test.at the trial court,the defense theory,argued in defense counsel opening statement,was that caldwell lacked knowledge of the child pornography.in direct examination,caldwell denied ever downloading or having any knowledge of any of the child pornography or bestiality videos.yet,the adult bestiality video,the excerpt of which was published to the jury,had just completed downloading from limewire onto caldwell computer when the federal agents entered the defendant home.in fact,testimony revealed the monitor of caldwell computer was turned on,and this particular file downloaded on the monitor.since no one other than the defendant was home at the time,the government could use this to show the defendant knowledge under rule b.b.
the trial court appropriately conducted the rule weighing test.while the court in grimes found the extrinsic offense evidence failed the second prong,grimes is the exception,not the rule.grimes,at.the extrinsic offense evidence in grimes involved gruesome violence,including young girls in chains,handcuffs,and other references to blood in the second case the defendant cites,lachapelle,the court finds the extrinsic offense evidence prejudicial because the offense was committed when it was lawful to commit such acts.lachapelle,at.the eight circuit nevertheless found admission of the evidence harmless error.id.in united states layne,this court upheld the admission of other child pornography not charged in the indictment as relevant on the issue of the defendant knowledge,upholding the trial court decision to admit other child pornography,while excluding other adult pornography.the layne decision turned on the need for the evidence to prove knowledge and the fact that the trial court scrutinized the evidence carefully,refused to admit all of the evidence that was offered,and gave an appropriate limiting instruction.id.at.
here,the record contains a fourteen page discussion between the court and the parties about the nature of the evidence,the purposes it was offered for,and the potential prejudicial effect.before allowing the jury to see the very brief portions of two of the many admitted adult pornography videos,the trial court gave the jury two limiting instructions.beyond its probative value for knowledge,the video that downloaded as federal agents searched the defendant home has additional probative value as an integral part of the charged offense.see united states coleman,cir united states wilson,cir often called res gestae.the story of the raid and search of the defendant home would remain incomplete without telling the jury the evidence the agents found downloading on the same program that was used to download child pornography.furth
