defendants haar communications and richard haar appeal from the order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard conway casey,district judge,preliminarily enjoining them from using internet domain names consisting of variations of the words the children place.the district court held that these names were likely to dilute plaintiff tcpip holding company trademark and service mark,the children place,in violation of the federal trademark anti dilution act dilution act or ftda,c,and to infringe plaintiff mark in violation of section a of the lanham act,a.
to the extent the court ruling was on the basis of the dilution act,it is vacated.because plaintiff mark,the children place,for a store selling children clothes,is descriptive and lacks inherent distinctiveness,it does not qualify for the protection of the act in addition,plaintiff failed to show that its mark is famous,as required by the act.to the extent the injunction was granted under the lanham act on the basis of likelihood of confusion,we affirm as to a number of the defendants domain names that are confusingly similar to plaintiff mark.however,some of the defendants domain names are sufficiently different from plaintiff mark,especially given its weak,descriptive character,that no infringement is properly found.
background 
plaintiff,tcpip holding company,tcpip,operates a chain of stores,primarily in the eastern half of the united states,selling children clothing and accessories.plaintiff stores operate under the registered mark,the children place.the articles sold in the stores are also labeled the children place.plaintiff has conducted this activity under its mark for about thirty years.its has grown from stores in to in,and its sales volume has increased during this same period from approximately million to million.
in august,tcpip registered two internet domain names,and,which can be used to gain access to its web site,though which it sells goods bearing the mark,the children place.
defendants,haar communications,a new york corporation,and richard haar,its president and sole employee collectively haar or defendant,offer consulting and networking services in the area of telecommunications.haar communications was incorporated on april,and is located in a manhattan apartment.around the fall of,richard haar developed the idea of creating a portal on the internet for children.this portal would be a webpage that would facilitate surfing the web for materials concerning children by providing links to a broad array of products,services and information.
on november,haar registered the domain name,with the domain name registrar,network solutions,nsi.after obtaining this domain name,haar posted the following on the domain website 
this is the future home of

in late january,tcpip discovered that haar had registered the domain name.counsel for tcpip sent a letter demanding that haar cease and desist from using plaintiff mark and that haar transfer to it the domain name registration for.
haar then purchased and registered at least more domain names containing variations of the words children and place in combination,at the price of per name approximately half of the names are identical to the other half,but for the fact that half end with the of,while half end with as in and,or and.they also vary in that they employ combinations of the singular and plural forms of child and place,as well as of the possessive form of.in some cases,the word the is either omitted or is replaced by a,your,or our.examples include and 
by letter dated february,haar refused to cease using the domain name.around this time,richard haar contacted ezrah dabah,the chief executive officer of tcpip,and requested a meeting to discuss the possibility of a joint venture.dabah agreed to meet because tcpip wished to acquire the domain name.
haar and dabah met on february.at this meeting,haar presented to dabah a business plan for creating a portal on the internet and invited dabah to enter into a joint venture to that end.dabah declined this offer and,instead,asked haar to name a price for.
by letter dated march,haar offered to sell tcpip a domain matrix package,including and of the other domain names,for.by letter of march,haar offered another package of names,for.
dabah rejected the offers and proposed to purchase alone for.haar responded by offering to sell a package of sixteen domain names,including and at the price of per name,or,plus tcpip transfer of its registration for to haar.dabah refused,and tcpip filed suit.
proceedings below 
tcpip complaint alleged,inter alia,that haar was liable for trademark infringement,unfair competition and dilution,and sought declaratory judgment,injunction,and punitive damages.the complaint listed of haar registered domain names 
on may,the district court heard oral argument on tcpip motion for preliminary injunction and granted the motion.finding a high degree of similarity between tcpip mark and haar domain names,the court ruled that tcpip was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims under the dilution act and for infringement under the lanham act.the court directed tcpip to submit a proposed order listing the domain names to be enjoined.
tcpip submitted a proposed order listing domain names to be enjoined,consisting of the names listed in footnote,plus an additional similar names that begin with your or our,rather than the or haar argued that the domain names which commence with the word your,or our,or a,or child,or the child,or children are not confusingly similar or likely to cause dilution of the mark the children place,and defendants should not be enjoined from use of the same.haar proposed a that would enjoin only eight names.
on may,the court signed tcpip proposed order,preliminarily enjoining haar from using,as part of a domain name or otherwise tcpip mark,the children place,or any colorable imitation thereof,including the names proposed by tcpip.
on december,the district court granted tcpip motion to expand the scope of the injunction by adding an additional fourteen domain names haar had registered at some point that year bringing the total number of enjoined domain names to.
discussion 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,tcpip must establish the likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of such an injunction,and either a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation plus a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor.federal express federal espresso,cir.the standard of appellate review of a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is said to be abuse of discretion.see,north atl.instruments,haber,cir otokoyama wine of japan import,cir.however,that standard is generally considered satisfied if the district court relied on incorrect law.see north atl.instruments,at.
the dilution claim 
tcpip employs the mark the children place to designate stores that are devoted to the sale of children clothing and accessories,as well as the children clothes and accessories sold in these stores.a store that specializes in children merchandise is a children place that sells children merchandise,a place to buy what children need.the use of the words children place as a mark for such a store is thus highly descriptive.descriptive marks are considered and weak under trademark law.the first question we face is whether the special broad protection of the dilution act is available to a descriptive mark.
in considering the precise terms of the dilution act,its fit with the general trademark law as set forth in the lanham act,the policies underlying trademark law,and the legislative history of the dilution act,we conclude that a descriptive mark does not come within the protection of the dilution act.
a the requirement of distinctiveness 
the dilution act provides that t he owner of a famous mark shall be entitled,subject to the principles of equity,to an injunction against another person commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name,if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.c emphasis added.because the act protects against the dilution of the mark distinctive quality,trademark owners seeking protection under the act must establish that their marks possess a distinctive quality in order to state a claim for dilution.see nabisco,pf brands,cir a mark that,notwithstanding its fame,has no distinctiveness is lacking the very attribute that the antidilution statute seeks to protect.the act furthermore invites courts to consider the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark,c a,among other listed factors.
the relevance of the degree of distinctiveness suggests that a bare minimum of distinctiveness is not adequate.if it were,the degree of distinctiveness would have no relevance.we turn first to explore the meaning and significance of the term distinctive quality or distinctiveness in the trademark law.
the inherent distinctive quality of a mark has long been an important standard in trademark law.the law has always disfavored marks that lack distinctiveness and either denied them protection outright or grudgingly granted protection under special conditions.distinctiveness is traditionally measured on a scale memorably described by judge friendly in abercrombie fitch hunting world,cir.the scale,progressing from least to most distinctive,is described in terms of marks that are generic descriptive suggestive and arbitrary or fanciful.judge friendly noted that the ascending order reflected not only eligibility to trademark status,but also the degree of protection accorded.id.at.
generic marks,consisting of words that identify the type or species of goods or services to which they apply,are totally lacking in distinctive quality they are not entitled to any protection against infringement,even if they have become famous as marks,because according such protection would deprive competitors of the right to refer to their goods by name.see id.at see also nabisco,at.
descriptive marks are marks that describe a product or its attributes.because they are descriptions,they also lack distinctive quality as marks.the same policy considerations that justify barring protection for generic marks disfavors the grant of protection to descriptive marks,albeit to a lesser degree.according trademark exclusivity to a descriptive mark would inhibit competitors from using descriptions of their competing products.thus,at common law,and under the trademark act of,neither those terms which were generic nor those which were merely descriptive could become valid trademarks.abercrombie,at.over time,this rule was softened in deference to the merchant and the public shared interest in maintaining the reliability of marks that had developed consumer recognition through use in commerce.in contrast to prior law,the lanham act accorded registrability to a descriptive mark if the public had come to associate the mark with the goods or services of the trademark parlance,if the mark had acquired secondary meaning.in permitting the registration of descriptive marks that have acquired secondary meaning,judge friendly explained,the lanham act strikes the balance between the hardships to a competitor in hampering the use of an appropriate word and those to the owner who,having invested money and energy to endow a word with the good will adhering to his enterprise,would be deprived of the fruits of his efforts.id.at.
the compromise of the lanham act that made such descriptive marks registrable is set forth in e and f.clause e denies registrability to a mark which when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive.id.e.clause f,however,provides that nothing in the chapter shall prevent registration of a mark which has become distinctive of the applicant goods in commerce.id.f.thus,secondary meaning,or acquired distinctiveness saves a mark from unregistrability and.nonetheless,it is the policy of the act to grant broader protection to those marks with a higher degree of inherent distinctiveness.see abercrombie,at the ascending order of the four categories of marks reflects the degree of protection accorded arrow fastener stanley works,cir holding that the strength or distinctiveness of a mark determines the degree of protection it will be accorded internal quotation marks omitted.in short,descriptive marks are traditionally disfavored under the law and have been granted a minimum of protection under the lanham act when secondary meaning has been shown,due to equitable concerns about the unfairness of depriving those who have invested in a mark of the goodwill they have thereby developed and depriving the public of the ability to rely on a mark it has come to recognize as an emblem of quality.
marks that do not directly describe goods or services or their attributes,but rather are suggestive of them,have some distinctive quality and are thus protected without need to prove secondary meaning.see abercrombie,at nabisco,at.the most distinctive marks,and thus the strongest,are marks that are arbitrary or fanciful.arbitrary or fanciful marks enjoy the broadest protection of the trademark laws.see abercrombie,at nabisco,at.
in creating a cause of action for dilution,see federal trademark dilution act of,stat,congress greatly expanded the scope of protection available to owners of famous trademarks.under the traditional action for infringement,the owner of a mark may bar another from using a mark in a manner that creates a likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source of goods.see a.thus,as a general proposition,under traditional trademark law,a mark is enforceable within the area of commerce in which the mark has been established.its establishment in one segment of commerce generally does not prevent others from using the same or a similar mark in a different,area ordinarily,little confusion will result when the junior use is in an area of commerce that is outside the senior owner area.
in contrast,the dilution act gives the owner a far greater scope of exclusivity.it permits the owner of a qualified,famous mark to enjoin junior uses throughout commerce,regardless of the absence of competition or confusion.see providing that dilution may be found regardless of the presence or absence of competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,or likelihood of confusion,mistake,or deception,at,reprinted in,dilution is an injury that differs materially from that arising out of the orthodox confusion.one circuit has characterized the dilution act as coming very close to granting rights in gross in a trademark.avery dennison sumpton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the dilution act further differs from traditional trademark law in that the class of entities for whose benefit the law was created is far narrower.the action for infringement under the lanham act serves the interests of consumers,as well as sellers,in having trademarks functions as.by preventing competitors from marketing their goods under the same or a confusingly similar mark,the action for infringement helps assure a producer that it and not an imitating competitor will reap the financial,rewards associated with a desirable product.qualitex jacobson prods,d.at the same time,it reduce s the customer costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions,for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that the item with this mark is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked or disliked in the past.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in contrast,the dilution act is designed solely for the benefit of sellers.its purpose is to protect the owners of famous marks from the kind of dilution that is permitted by the trademark laws when a junior user uses the same mark in a way in an unrelated area of commerce.the dilution act offers no benefit to the consumer to the owner.
against a background of policies that strongly disfavor marks lacking inherent distinctiveness,according them only narrow protection,we think it highly unlikely that congress intended to extend to such marks the expanded rights conferred by the dilution act.see lund trading kohler,cir t he standard for fame and distinctiveness required to obtain protection is more rigorous than that required to seek infringement protection.as we observed in nabisco,the degree of distinctiveness of the senior mark has a considerable bearing on the question whether a junior use will have a diluting effect.at.in our view,the language of the act,specifying the need for a showing of dilution of the distinctive quality of the plaintiff mark,and inviting the court to assess its degree of distinctiveness,is entirely consistent with the policies rooted in traditional trademark law that have always disfavored,descriptive marks,because their enforcement tends to deprive others of the opportunity to use proper descriptions of their products.we conclude that the dilution act accords its special,broad protection only to marks that have a significant degree of distinctiveness.
the tenuous compromise wrought by the lanham act,according descriptive marks the minimum degree of protection,would be seriously distorted if such marks now became entitled to the much broader scope of exclusivity accorded by the dilution act.descriptive marks,often asserting geographical identity or prominence,or claiming merit or strength,abound in the marketplace.a few examples are american,national,continental,metropolitan,pacific,southern,texas,chicago,federated,united,consolidated,allied,first national,acme,merit,and so forth.some of the holders of these inherently weak marks are huge companies as a function of their commercial dominance,their marks have become famous it seems unlikely that congress could have intended that the holders of such marks would be entitled to claim exclusivity for them throughout all areas of commerce.innumerable junior users of the same weak marks,who have developed goodwill in these marks,would be denied further use of their marks to their detriment and that of their customers.and,throughout all areas of commerce,the use of ordinary,descriptive marks like american would be restricted to one famous user and others whose use the plaintiff user achievement of fame.
some confirmatory indication of our assessment of the meaning of the statute may be drawn from the house report.see,reprinted in.in explaining the operation of the new statute and the need for protection against dilution,congress focused on three famous marks as to which a junior use would be actionable under this legislation,at,reprinted in.the three marks cited as possible beneficiaries of the act were dupont,buick,and highly distinctive,arbitrary or fanciful marks.see id.we recognize that one can not read examples in a legislative report as indicating the limits of a statute coverage.we therefore attach little importance to this passage in the legislative report,but note only that it tends to confirm the indications from the text of the statute,the history and theory of trademark doctrine,and the inherent improbability that congress would have wished to grant exclusivity throughout all areas of commerce to weak descriptive marks.
all of these reasons lead us to the conclusion that descriptive marks,which possess no distinctive quality,or at best a minimal degree,do not qualify for the act protection.the children place,for stores selling children merchandise,is such a mark.
b the relevance of acquired distinctiveness 
the next question we face in considering the applicability of the dilution act to a,descriptive mark is whether the mark lack of inherent distinctiveness can be compensated by the fact that the mark has achieved secondary meaning,or acquired distinctiveness.
although the district court never expressly stated that tcpip mark has acquired secondary meaning,we believe it implicitly made such a finding in holding that the mark is strong,given the duration of its existence and its prominence in the relevant market.we have no doubt,furthermore,that tcpip can establish that its mark has acquired secondary meaning,given the evidence that it operates about retail stores under its mark in states,sold million worth of goods in,and has expended tens of millions of dollars advertising its mark in the last decade.see,furs,cir holding that evidence relevant to a finding of secondary meaning includes the senior user advertising expenditures,and sales success.
the argument might be made that the dilution act requirement of distinctiveness may be satisfied by either inherent distinctiveness or acquired distinctiveness.there is ambiguous language in the statute that could be read to support that argument.the statute states in determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous,a court may consider a the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark,among other listed factors.id.c a.
on the basis of this language,two arguments might be advanced clause a treats inherent and acquired distinctiveness as equivalents and if acquired distinctiveness does not satisfy the statute requirement of distinctiveness,then the reference to acquired distinctiveness is meaningless and superfluous and such an interpretation of a that renders a portion of the statute be avoided.
both arguments are.as to the first argument,the fact that the statute invites courts to consider both inherent and acquired distinctiveness in no way implies that they are to be deemed equivalent to one another.in fact,they refer to quite different phenomena.inherent distinctiveness refers to a mark theoretical capacity to serve forcefully as an identifier of its owner goods,regardless whether the mark has fulfilled those expectations.acquired distinctiveness refers to a different phenomenon,one measured solely by the extent of recognition that the mark in fact has earned in the marketplace as a designator of its owner goods or services,regardless of the mark innate suitability to serve as a mark.not only are the two phenomena different,but they serve very different purposes under the statute,as described below.the mention of each as a relevant factor neither states nor implies that they should be deemed equivalent.
as to the second argument,it is incorrect that the concept of acquired distinctiveness has no discernable function in the statute,unless as a substitute for inherent distinctiveness.the list of factors set forth in c a h is relevant to two separate questions.the factors are listed as pertinent to the court determin ation whether a mark is distinctive and famous.c emphasis added.the degree of acquired distinctiveness of the plaintiff mark is directly relevant to the determination whether the mark is famous,as the act requires.acquired distinctiveness is the essential ingredient in the determination of fame,within the meaning of the statute.the statute requirement of fame is not satisfied by any kind of fame.the mark must have become famous as the designator of the plaintiff goods or services.a merchant taking a famous or the mark for its product would not thereby satisfy the statute requirement of fame.it is true,such a mark would be famous in the sense that universal recognition would attach to the name shakespeare or zeus.to satisfy the statute,however,the mark must be famous in its capacity as a mark designating the plaintiff goods in other words,to be famous within the meaning of the statute,the mark must have achieved a high degree of acquired distinctiveness,meaning that it must have become very widely recognized by the consumer public as the designator of the plaintiff goods.
because a high degree of acquired distinctiveness is crucial to a finding of fame,there is no merit to the proposition that the statute reference to acquired distinctiveness would be meaningless unless the element of distinctiveness could be satisfied by acquired distinctiveness.indeed,it is just the other way around.if the statute requirement of distinctiveness could be satisfied by acquired distinctiveness,as opposed to inherent distinctiveness,the reference to inherent distinctiveness would become superfluous.why is this so in order to qualify for the act protection,the mark must be famous.by definition,every mark that is famous,in the sense intended by the act,has a high degree of acquired distinctiveness.thus,no mark can qualify for the act protection without acquired distinctiveness.if that acquired distinctiveness satisfies not only the fame requirement,but also the distinctiveness requirement,then there will never be a case when a court needs to consider whether the mark has inherent distinctiveness.the statute invitation to courts to consider the mark degree of inherent distinctiveness would serve no function.
we therefore understand clause a of c to invite two inquiries has the plaintiff mark achieved a sufficient degree of consumer recognition acquired distinctiveness to satisfy the act requirement of fame does the mark possess a sufficient degree of inherent distinctiveness to satisfy the act requirement of distinctive quality.the latter requirement can not be satisfied by the mere fact that the public has come to associate the mark with the source.thus,weak,descriptive marks do not qualify for the act protection,even if famous.
because tcpip mark,the children place,as a designator of stores for children clothing and accessories,is descriptive,and thus,lacks inherent distinctiveness,it can not qualify for the protection of the dilution act.the mark deficiency in inherent distinctiveness is not compensated by the fact that tcpip mark has achieved a significant degree of consumer recognition.
the question next arises whether the distinctiveness requirement is satisfied in view of the fact that tcpip uses it mark,the children place,not only to designate its stores,but also to designate the merchandise sold in the stores.merchandise is not a place.accordingly,it may be argued that,even if the children place,designating stores for children merchandise,is insufficiently distinctive to qualify for the protection of the dilution act,the same mark as a designation for children merchandise is not.
arguments to the contrary are because the mark is used only on merchandise sold at a store or website bearing the mark,the children place,it remains descriptive and the dilution act requires a significant degree of inherent distinctiveness a bare minimum will not suffice even if the mark is less descriptive hence,more distinctive when used on children merchandise than when used on a store,it is nonetheless too low in distinctiveness to qualify under the dilution act.
we need not resolve the controversy because there is another reason why the plaintiff has not shown entitlement to the preliminary injunction premised on the dilution act it has failed to show compliance with the statutory requirement of fame.
c the requirement that the mark be famous 
as noted above,the benefits of the dilution act are available to owners of a famous mark.the act does not tell how famous a mark must be.nor does it provide any direct guidance as to how courts should answer the question.the word famous is susceptible to many widely different understandings.if a hypothetical grendel coffee shop in smalltown,has for years been the favorite hangout of smalltown high school students,grendel may well be famous among the students and graduates of smalltown high.or another mark for a catalogue selling rare plant specimens may be famous among collectors scattered throughout the country.are those then famous marks within the meaning of the statute the argument might be made that if the plaintiff mark is famous in any sense coming within a dictionary definition,it qualifies for the statute protection.
the merriam webster third new international dictionary defines famous,in the relevant entries,as.much talked about honored for achievement celebrated does this mean that the hypothetical grendel famous among the students of smalltown the catalogue among collectors of rare plant be found to qualify as famous marks under the act 
in our view,this is a question of statutory interpretation for which dictionaries provide no answer.legislatures do not in all instances undertake to specify the precise standards courts must follow.they do not necessarily regard courts as adversaries to be rigidly controlled,lest they take unreasonable liberties of interpretation with the meaning of a statute.in some enactments,legislatures look upon the courts as their partners.recognizing the difficulty of answering all questions prospectively,legislatures at times deliberately use a vague term,like combination in restraint of trade,or famous,knowing full well that its meaning is not precisely communicated,but counting on courts to understand the legislature intentions and to interpret the word or phrase in a sensible manner to carry out those intentions.
it seems most unlikely that congress intended to confer on marks that have enjoyed only brief fame in a small part of the country,or among a small segment of the population,the power to enjoin all other users throughout the nation in all realms of commerce.the examples of eligible famous marks given in the house,buick,and kodak,see,at,reprinted in,marks that for the major part of the century have been household words throughout the united states.they are representative of the best known marks in commerce.once again,we recognize that examples in a legislative report can not be taken as defining the limits of a statute coverage.putting together the extraordinary power the act confers on a famous mark and the improbability that congress intended to grant such outright exclusivity to marks that are famous in only a small area or segment of the nation,with the hints to be gleaned from the house report,we think congress envisioned that marks would qualify as famous only if they carried a substantial degree of fame.
we do not believe tcpip submissions to the district court demonstrated the degree of fame necessary to qualify.the submissions were quite sketchy.according to tcpip affidavit,in it operated retail stores in states under the mark the children place,and achieved sales in of million,having grown from million in sales though stores in.over the past decade,the affidavit asserts,tcpip spent tens of millions of dollars advertising its mark,but does not tell how many millions,when expended,or how effectively.nor did tcpip submit consumer surveys,press accounts,or other evidence of fame.the affidavit gives no statistics of any kind pertaining to any year earlier than.while it asserts that the plaintiff and its predecessors have used the mark continuously and exclusively for thirty years,it gives no further from unsubstantiated conclusory phrases like the mark the children place has been widely recognized by american consumers that would enable a court to determine the extent or dimension of public recognition of the mark and whether it has fame sufficient to meet the requirement of the act.while the information given undoubtedly shows considerable commercial success and growth,the aggregate sales under the mark since it originated which have not been furnished to us may well not equal the sales of dupont,buick,or kodak in any given month.
we express no view whether tcpip may be capable of showing at trial that its mark is famous within the meaning of the statute,if it submits appropriate evidence.but in its motion for preliminary injunction,it did not make an adequate showing on that question.for that reason,as well as others,the preliminary injunction must be vacated to the extent it was premised on the dilution act.
the lanham act infringement claim 
to establish a likelihood of success on its claim for trademark infringement under the lanham act,tcpip was required to show that haar use of its domain names containing variations of the words child and place was likely to cause consumer confusion.see a stating that a ny person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which is likely to cause confusion shall be liable for trademark infringement.
in this circuit,courts generally begin the inquiry by considering whichever may be relevant of the list of factors set forth by judge friendly in polaroid polarad elecs,cir a the strength of the plaintiff mark b the degree of similarity between the plaintiff and the defendant marks c the proximity of the products d the likelihood that either owner will bridge the gap,using the mark on products closer to the other area of commerce e the sophistication of the buyers f the quality of the defendant product g actual confusion and h good or bad faith.see time,petersen publ g,cir.
a strength of the senior mark.as discussed above,a mark strength may be measured in two very different ways inherent strength,resulting from the mark degree of inherent distinctiveness,usually measured on the ladder ranging from unprotectable generic marks to arbitrary,fanciful marks that enjoy the broadest protection,see abercrombie,at and acquired strength,reflecting the degree of consumer recognition the mark has achieved.the policies of trademark law disfavor according exclusive rights to marks that are descriptive.see id.at.the lanham act compromise allowed descriptive marks registration and a minimal scope of protection,upon establishing that the mark had acquired a secondary meaning as a designator of source.
the narrower scope of protection commanded by weak,descriptive marks has two explanations.the first is that granting one merchant a monopoly over the use of descriptive marks tends unfairly to prevent competing merchants from employing appropriate descriptive terms in their marketing.the second has to do with the character of descriptive marks in relation to the likelihood of consumer confusion.the more arbitrary and fanciful the mark in relation to the goods on which it is used,the more the consumer is likely to assume that a similar mark designates the owner of the first as the source of the goods.the arbitrariness of the mark in relation to those goods makes it unlikely that an unrelated merchant would select a similar mark for closely related goods.conversely,the more descriptive the mark is of the goods,the less likely a consumer is to assume that a similar mark used on related goods came from the same source.the similarity between the two marks is as likely explained by the fact that each seeks to describe the goods,as by their coming from the same merchant.
to illustrate the point,if a car is marked buicke,or film in a yellow box is labeled kodok,the unsophisticated observer may well fail to notice the slight differences and assume that they come from the makers of buick and kodak.conversely,if a consumer knows crunchy candy bars coming from confectioner a under the mark crunchies and later encounters cookies branded crunchy delights,the consumer is as likely to attribute the similarity of name to two unrelated confectioners independently selecting names that describe and vaunt the crunchy texture of their products.likewise,a person walking down broadway who sees first a broadway theater,and later a broadway deli is unlikely to assume that they belong to the same owner the descriptive nature of the mark suggests that unrelated merchants may have chosen their marks for the same descriptive reason.thus,similarity in descriptive marks is less likely to cause confusion than similarity in arbitrary or fanciful marks.
likelihood of confusion depends on consumer expectations.if the similarity between two marks would lead consumers to expect that they identify the same source,that similarity is likely to cause confusion.if the similarity between the two marks would lead consumers to assume the similar marks were chosen because they describe similar,desirable attributes of the products,the similarity is less likely to invite a mistaken assumption that the products must come from the same source.
as noted above,the children place is a weak,descriptive mark,especially as used on a store for children merchandise,and also although to a lesser extent as used on children merchandise sold in a store of the same name specializing in children merchandise.because the plaintiff mark has achieved consumer recognition,it is not denied the protection of the trademark law,but it commands a lesser degree of protection than arbitrary,fanciful marks.
b similarity of the marks.all of the defendant domain names are not equally similar to tcpip mark.the closest of them are different only in that the separate words are run together without separating spaces or punctuation,and the resulting word is followed by a domain identifier of,or.those differences,however,are of little or no significance.it is necessary in the registration of an internet address to eliminate spaces and possessive punctuation.see tami lefko,the west just got tamer appeals court considers use of trademarks in domain names and metatags,computer,at.it is necessary,furthermore,to add a domain at the end of the address.thus,consumers would see the domain name as employing functionally the same name as the children place.
others of haar disputed domain names,such as childrensplace,achildrensplace,and thechildrenplace,are so close to plaintiff mark that the differences are scarcely noticeable however,as the differences separating the defendant names from the plaintiff mark become more noticeable,the similarities are likely to appear to consumers as more reflective of the fact that both are being used to designate something having to do with children and places,rather than indicating a common source.domain names like achildplace,achildplaces,yourchildsplace,yourchildplaces,mychildsplace,mychildrensplace,and ourchildrensplaces seem to us to be sufficiently dissimilar to plaintiff descriptive mark that the similarities to plaintiff mark will be attributed to descriptive goals,rather than to common source.
c and d proximity of the products and likelihood of bridging the gap.because haar plans are as yet only vaguely formulated,it is not easy to discern with assurance the degree of proximity between plaintiff and defendant areas of commerce.nonetheless,it appears that haar plans for a portal will provide links for the purchase of children merchandise.the district court so found.thus,there is sufficient proximity of goods and services covered that confusion can easily arise if the similarity between the two marks is sufficient.because the defendant is expected from the start to use its mark in the same area of commerce as plaintiff use,the issue of the likelihood of bridging the gap is of no relevance.there is no gap to be bridged.
e sophistication of consumers.the more sophisticated the consumers,the less likely they are to be misled by similarity in marks.see cadbury beverages,cott,cir the sophistication factor recognizes that the likelihood of confusion between the products at issue depends in part on the sophistication of the relevant purchasers.internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,there is no reason to expect that plaintiff consumers and users of defendant portal will be particularly sophisticated.plaintiff solicits a general clientele of purchasers of children clothing and accessories.defendant expects to solicit users generally exploring matters of interest to children,including purchasers of children merchandise.there is no reason to expect that a high degree of sophistication will protect consumers from confusion resulting from confusingly similar marks.
f the quality of haar product.the quality of haar product can not as yet be discerned because it has scarcely taken first steps to launch a portal.if haar in fact follows through with the establishment of a portal under names confusingly similar to plaintiff mark and the site functions badly,or provokes consumer dissatisfaction in any way,this could harm plaintiff mark to the extent that consumers believe there is an association between the two.
g actual confusion.when two marks have existed side by side in commerce,the evidence of actual confusion among consumers,or of absence of confusion,can be very helpful in determining whether a likelihood of confusion results from the junior use of a mark similar to the senior mark.here,because haar has not yet launched its portal in a serious way,there has been little or no opportunity for actual confusion to be manifested.as a result,the absence of evidence of actual confusion sheds no light whatever on the probl
