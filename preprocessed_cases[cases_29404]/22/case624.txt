this case stems from the efforts of seven words llc to register sixteen internet domain names based on the george carlin seven dirty words routine when network solutions,nsi refused to register the names,seven words brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that nsi refusal to register the names infringed its rights under the liberty of speech clause of the california constitution,article,a.
on nsi motion under federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court dismissed the case.at the time seven words appealed,twelve of the sixteen domain names had already been registered to third parties.after the parties filed their briefs on appeal,the remaining four domain names were registered to third parties.we conclude,therefore,that this case is now moot,and it must be dismissed.
background 
nsi domain name registration service 
in the early,the national science foundation nsf,an agency of the federal government,assumed responsibility for coordinating and funding management of the nonmilitary portion of the internet infrastructure.thomas network solutions,cert.denied,d,june.through a competitive bid process,nsi was selected to provide nonmilitary domain name registration services and entered into a cooperative agreement with nsf.see also,network solutions,d.during the period when the events giving rise to this lawsuit took place,nsi had the exclusive authority to register domain names to the public for four internet domains,and.in practical terms,this exclusivity meant that anyone seeking to register a name under one of those domains could only do so through nsi.
through its registration service,nsi ensured that no two parties registered the same domain name.for the most part,nsi registration process was completely electronic,requiring no human intervention by the company.the application was available on the internet and was transmitted to nsi by electronic mail.nsi system would then compare the requested domain name with all previously registered names.generally,if the name had not already been assigned to another party,nsi would register it to the applicant for a fee.
in september,nsf transferred responsibility for administering the cooperative agreement with nsi to the department of commerce.two months later,in response to a presidential initiative to privatize,increase competition,and promote international participation in the domain name system,the department of commerce transferred control of internet domain names from the government to a private,nonprofit corporation,internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann.icann was then responsible for overseeing the transition from a to a system.see,d at,june.nsi exclusive arrangement ended in june.
seven words i 
seven words initially sought to register ten domain names that were based on carlin seven dirty words routine.nsi refused to register the names,however,because it had a policy prohibiting registration of domain names containing certain words that it deemed inappropriate,including six of carlin seven dirty words.as a consequence of this policy,in march,seven words filed its first lawsuit against nsi in federal court in the central district of california,seven words llc network solutions,seven words i,requesting an injunction ordering registration of the disputed domain names to seven words and a declaration that nsi policy and the refusal to register the domain names violated seven words rights under the federal and california constitutions.
seven words thereafter sought registration of six additional domain names,which,like the first ten,were based on carlin seven dirty words routine.again,nsi refused registration.seven words therefore sought to amend the complaint in seven words i to include the six additional domain names,as well as a claim for damages,but the district court did not rule on the request.rather,as explained below,then began seven words hopscotch litigation odyssey from california to new hampshire and back again.although the dates of the various rulings are not per se critical to the story,they are provided to assist in keeping the chronology in mind and to give a flavor of how the litigation was intertwined.
in june,nsi status as the exclusive registrar expired,and other companies joined nsi in offering domain name registration services in the,and domains.in anticipation of that change,seven words filed an application for a temporary restraining order tro,requesting that nsi be enjoined from allowing other domain name registrars to register the contested domain names during the pendency of seven words although the district court granted the tro,it was subsequently discharged and no preliminary injunction issued.nsi tendered control over the disputed domain names to the district court through a deposit of domain name declaration,under which the domain names could only be released for registration upon order of the seven words i court or dismissal of the action.
in this same time frame,the district court learned that there was a related case against nsi pending in federal court in new hampshire,national advertising,network solutions,d haberstroh.in that case,plaintiff lynn haberstroh,who had no connection to seven words,sought a declaration that nsi refusal to register six domain names violated her constitutional rights.four of those names were identical to those sought by seven words,and haberstroh,like seven words,argued that nsi policy of refusing to register the domain names violated the first amendment.
recognizing the overlap between the two lawsuits,in may,the district court in california directed nsi to file a motion to transfer seven words i to the district of new hampshire for consolidation with haberstroh.the district court granted the motion in june,ordered that the remaining federal claims be transferred to the haberstroh court,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over seven words state constitutional claim because it involved a novel and complex issue of state law.seven words i was thereafter transferred to the new hampshire court,along with the deposit of domain name declaration.
seven words ii and subsequent litigation 
meanwhile,after the seven words i court first raised the issue of transfer and only a month before argument on the motion,in may,seven words surreptitiously filed the instant action against nsi,seven words ii,in california superior court seven words did not advise the district court in seven words i or nsi of this filing the complaint was not served until after the district court granted the transfer motion in june.the complaint asserted the same factual allegations as seven words i,but it included all sixteen domain names and did not include a federal claim.rather,seven words alleged that nsi failure to register the domain names violated the liberty of speech clause of the california constitution.nsi removed the case to federal court based on diversity,and seven words ii was assigned to the same judge as seven words 
in july,nsi filed a motion to dismiss seven words ii under rule b,arguing that seven words failed to state a claim under state law or,in the alternative,that the court should transfer the action to the district court in new hampshire for consolidation with seven words i and haberstroh.seven words opposed the motion and filed its own motion,seeking remand of seven words ii to the california superior court on the ground that the district court should abstain from deciding the california constitutional question.
in october,at the same time the district court transferred seven words i to new hampshire,the court also granted nsi motion to dismiss seven words ii,denied seven words motion to remand,and dismissed seven words ii with prejudice for failure to state a claim against nsi under the california constitution.this dismissal is the order from which seven words appeals.
after the appeal of seven words ii to this court,seven words,its own words tactical reasons,failed to comply with various orders issued by the new hampshire court in the seven words i litigation,resulting in dismissal of seven words i in january.by its terms,the deposit of domain name declaration,which granted the seven words i court control over the registrations of the domain names at issue,expired with the dismissal of that case.the new hampshire court,however,maintained control of the four domain names that were at issue in haberstroh.
seven words affirmatively chose to put all of its eggs in the seven words ii basket.back in july,six of the requested domain names were registered to third parties by other domain name registrars.in february,seven words sought a tro from the seven words ii district court,restraining nsi from allowing another domain name registrar to register the ten remaining domain names to third parties pending this appeal.the district court denied the application.seven words,however,never appealed the district court ruling and did not make any further application for injunctive relief.as a result,by the time the parties filed their briefs on appeal,a total of twelve of the sixteen domain names for which seven words sought registration had already been registered to third parties by other domain name registrars the other four domain names remained in the control of the haberstroh court.
after the parties briefing on appeal in this case,in september,the new hampshire district court filed its opinion in haberstroh.see,d at holding that nsi did not violate haberstroh constitutional rights by refusing registration of the disputed domain names.thereafter,the new hampshire court nsi released the four remaining domain names.again,seven words took no action to prevent their release.
by february,the domain names had been registered by other domain name registrars to third parties.thus,more than two months before argument in this case,all sixteen disputed names had already been registered.just days before oral argument,nsi informed this court of this development,moving to vacate the district court judgment with instructions to dismiss the case as moot.we note,with respect to both parties,that i t is the duty of counsel to bring to the federal tribunal attention,without delay,facts that may raise a question of mootness.arizonans for official english arizona,d emphasis in original.although the parties addressed mootness in their briefing on appeal,they did so before the remaining domain names had been registered to third parties.
discussion 
before we can consider the merits of seven words appeal,we must first address the threshold issue of whether this case is moot.under article iii,of the constitution,we have jurisdiction to address only actual cases or controversies.const.art.iii,cl.a n actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.arizonans for official english,at.quoting preiser newkirk,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the supreme court observed more than a century ago,
w hen,pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court,and without any fault of the defendant,an event occurs which renders it impossible for this court,if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff,to grant him any effectual relief whatever,the court will not proceed to a formal judgment,but will dismiss the appeal.
mills green.in other words,w here the activities sought to be enjoined have already occurred,and the appellate courts can not undo what has already been done,the action is moot,friends of the earth,bergland,cir,and it must be dismissed.see united states dist.court,cir.
nsi has the heavy burden of establishing that there is no effective relief remaining for us to provide.id.as nsi points out,seven words,in its complaint,sought only declaratory and injunctive relief.in practical terms,the injunctive relief that seven words sought is no longer abandoned its policy prohibiting registration of domain names containing certain words,nsi is no longer the exclusive domain name registrar and,most importantly,the sixteen domain names that seven words sought to register have been registered to third parties.
the question before us is whether this case is nevertheless still a live controversy because,as seven words argues,it may still be entitled to damages declaratory relief.seven words never sought damages in this litigation until a few days before argument in this court and,indeed,effectively disavowed damages for tactical reasons.as for the declaratory relief,which is closely intertwined with the injunctive relief,there is no longer a live controversy.at this juncture,seven words effectively seeks an advisory opinion.we conclude that neither of these claims is sufficient to resurrect seven words suit.
in an effort to overcome the mootness challenge,seven words rests its argument primarily on z channel.partnership home box office,cir,where we held that i f the plaintiff is entitled to collect damages in the event that it succeeds on the merits,the case does not become moot even though declaratory and injunctive relief are no longer of any use.that statement may make perfect sense in the context of z channel,but it can not be extended to the circumstances presented here.
z channel filed a complaint.count one alleged that enforcement of various agreements,agreements with movie distributors prohibiting z channel from displaying paid advertisements by home box office hbo constituted unreasonable restraints of trade in violation of the sherman act.z channel sought declaratory and injunctive relief on count one.id.at.in count two,z channel alleged that the agreements were the result of a group boycott,also in violation of the sherman act.on that count,in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief,z channel sought damages.id.finally,z channel complaint asserted that it was entitled to damages based on state contract and tort claims.id.
following discovery,z channel abandoned count two,and hbo moved for summary judgment on count one.the district court granted the motion and ordered all counts dismissed.id.z channel stopped showing movies,however,after the filing of its appeal.id.because the only claim remaining in the case was count one,for which z channel requested only declaratory and injunctive relief,hbo argued on appeal that the case was moot.id.z channel countered that it was entitled to seek damages if it was successful on count one.id.at.
the panel agreed with z channel and concluded that the case was not moot,stating 
a case or controversy still exists because the parties are disputing whether enforcement of and insistence on the agreements constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade.if z channel prevails,it may recover damages for loss of advertising revenue.federal rule of civil procedure c allows the district court to award damages if z channel proves facts entitling it to relief even though z channel never requested damages.
it is clear that z channel did not foreclose relief in damages by failing to ask for them in its count one prayer.e very final judgement shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings.c emphasis added.
hbo asserts,however,that it is far too late for z channel to talk of damages now.it points out that we dismissed a portion of an appeal for mootness in dan caputo russian river county sanitation,cir,because only declaratory and injunctive relief had been requested and the moment had passed when those remedies might have been useful.we think that hbo reads too much into caputo.
here,z channel now seeks damages,and count one of its complaint,construed favorably to it,alleges restraints that could have resulted in financial damage to z channel.we conclude,therefore,that the damages remedy is sufficiently before us to preclude a dismissal for mootness.

there are critical differences,however,between this case and z channel.unlike the plaintiff in z channel,seven words effectively disavowed any claim for damages.z channel,at
