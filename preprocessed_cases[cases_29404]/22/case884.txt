worthington and barbary coast appeal,contending that matrixx failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis for disregarding the first amendment right to speak anonymously on the internet.matrixx responds that it had a right to discovery of the anonymous defendants identity,and it adds that appellants lacked standing to oppose the discovery order.we agree with matrixx second point and must therefore affirm the order on that ground.
procedural background 
matrixx is a pharmaceutical company that produces and sells pharmaceutical products,including several that are marketed through its subsidiary,zicam,llc.matrixx is traded on the nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol mtxx.
the present action arose in maricopa county,arizona,where matrixx has its principal place of business.in its sixth amended complaint,matrixx asserted causes of action for defamation,interference with contractual relations and business expectancies,and trade libel against five named individuals and john doe defendants.matrixx alleged that these defendants had published false and injurious statements on two internet message boards accessible through the finance and silicon investor websites.yahoo.com and.as a result of these false statements,matrixx had suffered unusual fluctuations in its stock,such as relatively selling near the close of the market.
among the anonymous posters on the two message boards were those using the aliases veritasconari and gunnallenlies.veritasconari posted disparaging statements about matrixx on the finance message board between may and october.in february,gunnallenlies began posting similar statements on the same message board.matrixx served subpoenas on for information leading to the identification of the two posters,and complied.both posters,however,had used software that enabled them to avoid being identified and subpoenaed.
finally,on one occasion gunnallenlies neglected to activate the screening service before posting on the finance message board.using the information provided by,matrixx was able to trace gunnallenlies to barbary coast,a hedge fund managed by worthington.worthington was deposed in san francisco,but he refused to answer any questions about the identity of veritasconari or gunnallenlies,including whether he himself was veritasconari or gunnallenlies.he did admit knowing one of the named defendants in the case,floyd schneider,as both had once been defendants in an unrelated california lawsuit he also admitted being a paying subscriber to the eyeshade report,to which veritasconari had referred for support in denigrating matrixx 
on february,matrixx moved in santa clara county to compel worthington deposition answers.in opposition,appellants contended that the motion could not withstand the heightened scrutiny necessary to overcome the posters first amendment right to speak anonymously on the internet.appellants specifically argued that the complaint was fatally deficient by failing to name veritasconari and gunnallenlies as defendants and matrixx was unlikely to prevail on the underlying defamation claim.after considering the written and oral arguments of the parties,however,the trial court granted matrixx motion.
discussion 
appellants renew the arguments they presented below.they maintain that gunnallenlies and veritasconari have a fundamental first amendment right to speak anonymously,which can not be overcome absent a valid cause of action.in this case,they argue,matrixx had failed to make a prima facie showing that the targeted postings were defamatory.appellants also point out that matrixx did not specify that veritasconari was a doe defendant or even mention gunnallenlies in the complaint 
in response,matrixx raises a new argument that appellants lack standing to assert the rights of gunnallenlies and veritasconari as a basis for resisting discovery.matrixx contends that appellants are unable to satisfy the prerequisites for asserting the constitutional rights of another.
although matrixx did not raise this issue below,the issue of standing is so fundamental that it need not even be raised alone a prerequisite to our consideration.payne anaheim memorial medical center,th,d see also marshall pasadena unified school dist.th,d lack of standing not waived by failure to raise it in the trial court but may be raised at any point in the proceedings common cause board of supervisors cal d,contentions based on a lack of standing involve jurisdictional challenges and may be raised at any time in the proceeding.moreover,appellants have had the opportunity to address the question in their reply brief and at oral argument.
neither party,however,has submitted adequate authority or analysis on this fundamental question.both cite powers ohio,d,which offered an exception to the general rule that in seeking relief litigants must assert their own legal rights rather than rely on the rights or interests of third parties.id.at.the court limited the exception to circumstances in which three criteria are met the litigant suffers a distinct and palpable injury in fact,thus giving him or her a concrete interest in the outcome of the dispute the litigant has a close relationship to the third party such that the two share a common interest and there is some hindrance to the third party ability to protect his or her own interests.id.at.lujan defenders of wildlife,d allen wright,d.the first criterion is derived from the case or controversy requirement of article iii of the united states constitution,which is not at issue here the second and third are prudential considerations that are invoked in the exercise of judicial restraint.elk grove unified school dist.newdow,d.p rudential standing encompasses the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.id.at.the prudential limitations add to the constitutional minima a healthy concern that if the claim is brought by someone other than one at whom the constitutional protection is aimed,the claim not be an abstract,generalized grievance that the courts are neither well equipped nor well advised to adjudicate.secretary of state of joseph munson,fn,d.without such related to art.iii concerns but essentially matters of judicial courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.warth seldin,d.
these principles rest on more than the fussiness of judges.they reflect the conviction that under our constitutional system courts are not roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the nation laws.citation.constitutional judgments are justified only out of the necessity of adjudicating rights in particular cases between the litigants brought before the court.broadrick oklahoma,d.
the united states supreme court has acknowledged that it has been quite forgiving with these criteria in certain circumstances in particular,in first amendment attacks on overly broad statutes.kowalski tesmer,d.in such cases litigants are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated,but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.broadrick oklahoma,supra,at.even where a
