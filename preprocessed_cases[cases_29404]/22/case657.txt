this decision consolidates two cases from the northern district of oklahoma.larry wayne thompson and robert john naus appeal their sentences for knowingly possessing any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography a b.the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in sentencing by applying a enhancement for possession of ten or more items pursuant to b of the united states sentencing guidelines,which provides if the offense involved possessing ten or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other items,containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor,increase by levels.united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,b.the district court interpreted the term items to include computer files on the disks rather than the disks themselves.we affirm.
background 
thompson was found in possession of child pornography after a south carolina customs agent informed an oklahoma city customs agent that thompson had sent child pornography images to a south carolina target.hundreds of visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit activity were found on thompson computer with more such depictions on compact disks and floppy disks.notwithstanding the hundreds of files,the prohibited material was contained on fewer than ten computer hard disks,compact disks,or floppy disks.on april,thompson pled guilty to eight counts of violating a b.he was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment based in part on a enhancement under b for possessing ten or more computer files containing child pornography.
naus was found in possession of child pornography as well.western union records obtained by customs showed that naus sent to persons in moscow,russia who were trafficking in child pornography.during an initial search,naus indicated that he believed he had downloaded approximately images of child pornography.four disks were discovered with images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct with other children,adults or both.after seizure of naus computer system and floppy disks,an agent discovered an additional three images of child pornography on another disk.two super floppy disks which can store mb of data,in contrast to a regular floppy disk that can store mb contained and images of child pornography.thus,visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct were found on five floppy disks and two super floppy disks.
on june,naus entered a guilty plea to one count of violating a b.he was sentenced to months imprisonment as a result of a enhancement under b.both thompson and naus were also sentenced to three years supervised release following imprisonment.on appeal,thompson and naus contend that neither of them possessed more than ten items as prescribed by b,if that term is understood to refer to the media on which images of child pornography were stored rather than the files themselves.the government responds that in b each computer graphics file maintained on a computer hard drive,floppy disk,or other storage medium constitutes a separate item.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court legal interpretation of the guidelines.united states gacnik,cir.the guidelines are interpreted as though they were a statute or court rule,with ordinary rules of statutory construction.united states tagore,cir.adopting a narrower interpretation is at odds with our precedent 
while we apply the rule of strict construction to criminal statutes,and by extension to the guidelines,that does not mean the guidelines must be given their narrowest possible meaning.rather,the rule of strict construction is satisfied if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the manifest intent of the lawmakers.
united states reaves,cir quotations and citations omitted.
as noted,the statute,b speaks of knowing possession of any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography and the guideline speaks of possession of ten or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other items,containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.b.
while it is true that the two are largely symmetrical,computer disk stands alone in the statute,as does items in the guideline.although the issue is one of first impression in this circuit two courts considering convictions under a b have determined that the term items in b means computer files,not the entire disk.see united states harper,cir per curiam united states perreault,cir.other courts have reached the same conclusion under a similar statute.united states fellows,cir conviction under a b united states demerritt,cir same united states hall,cir same united states wind,cir conviction under a.
merely because the statute includes the term disk and the guideline includes the term items does not necessarily mean that the two must be equated.as the panel observed in perreault,the statute may criminalize knowing possession of a computer disk,while the guideline addresses culpable conduct in connection with that possession of the disk,here the number of files on the disks.perreault,at.stated another way,the fact the statute criminalizes certain conduct has never meant that a court is restricted to the offense of conviction when deciding the appropriate sentence.united states watts,d per curiam witte united states,d.thus,the guidelines employ the concepts of relevant conduct,and offense levels under the applicable offense guideline are determined in part based upon specific offense characteristics,including relevant conduct.a b b a a specific offense characteristics to be determined based upon all acts and omissions committed by the defendant,cmt with respect to offenses involving contraband including controlled substances,the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved.
we turn next to the placement and purpose of the words other items in the scheme envisioned by the guidelines.see reaves,at.defendants argue that although other items is not defined in the version of the guidelines,the context of b makes it clear that it refers to containers beyond those specifically listed books,magazines,periodicals,films,and video tapes,containing visual depiction.they correctly point out that each of the listed containers can contain multiple images,just as computer disks,compact disks,and zip disks can.according to the defendants,t o say that a graphic image file is the container holding the image would be the equivalent of saying that the square of cardboard that makes up the polaroid is the container for the photograph,or even the piece of canvas upon which davinci painted was merely the container for the mona lisa.aplts.br.at.we think this argument underestimates the importance of a file when it comes to computers.a file is a collection of information such as text,numbers,graphics,sound or video stored on a particular medium.a file is always in a particular format.a graphic image does not exist without a format of the file defines the image.a file extension after the name of the file tells the computer which program or application is required to utilize the information.
in fellows,the court concluded that the nearest computer analogue to books,magazines,periodicals,films,and videotapes was files because v isual depictions in a computer are compiled and stored in graphics files,much like photographs are compiled and stored in books or magazines t he computer user can separately view,copy,delete,or transmit each discrete graphics file.fellows,at.it might appear that by this logic,each page or individual piece of paper in a book,magazine or periodical,or each frame in film or videotape,qualifies as a container and an item for the enhancement.but as a practical matter,an individual page or a frame simply lack the portability and transmissability of discrete computer files,which may be contained in a variety of storage media,hard disk,floppy disk,cd,or zip disk,and are transported electronically far more easily than the listed items.
electronic files do need a medium or container to be encoded,but it is doubtful that the drafters of the guideline intended the enhancement to be applied based upon the fortuitousness of the storage media when it came to computers,even in when the guideline was adopted.see demerritt,at.graphic images are usually conveyed file by file how they are stored varies from user to user.the dissent contends that our interpretation of the guideline,which would be correct in the,was unimaginable in.modem speeds,internet access,operating systems and storage capability have all improved since,but the basic unit of storage,use,portability and.it is also worth noting that our fourth amendment cases have rightly concentrated the analysis on computer files.see,united states walser,cir the advent of the electronic age and,as we see in this case,the development of desktop computers that are able to hold the equivalent of a library worth of information,go beyond the established categories of constitutional doctrine.analogies to other physical objects,such as dressers or file cabinets,do not often inform the situations we now face as judges when applying search and seizure law.united states carey,cir.
in sum,after our analysis and those of our sister circuits,we are not left with a reasonable doubt about the scope of the guideline when it comes to this this situation.see moskal united states,d.the rule of lenity is a rule of last resort,reserved for when a guideline suffers from grievous ambiguity or uncertainty.chapman united states,d tagore,at.an alternative interpretation of the guideline,standing alone,is insufficient to invoke the rule.moskal,at.while the dissent and the defendants have come up with another interpretation,we think we have found a reasonable interpretation.
in the alternative,we could consider an amendment to the commentary to and reach the same result.a subsequently enacted amendment may be applied retroactively,provided it is merely a clarifying amendment.united states gigley,cir.amendment added the following commentary 
for purposes of subsection b,a file that a contains a visual depiction and b is stored on a magnetic,optical,digital,other electronic,or other storage medium or device,shall be considered to be one item.
if the offense involved a large number of visual depictions,an upward departure may be warranted,regardless of whether subsection b applies.
whether the amendment is applicable,however,depends on whether it is clarifying or substantive.see b.amendment,which took effect november,after the plea agreement and sentencing by the district court,merely clarifies the guideline applied by the district court.under section b,a court shall consider subsequent amendments,to the extent that such amendments are clarifying rather than substantive changes.see united states,cir.as to the reason for the amendment,the commission wrote 
t he amendment clarifies the meaning of the term item in subsection b of the amendment adopts the holding of all circuits that have addressed the matter that a computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the enhancement.the amendment also provides for an invited upward departure if the offense involves a large number of visual depictions of child pornography,regardless of the number of items involved.this provision invites courts to depart upward in cases in which a particular item,such as a book or a computer file,contains an unusually large number of pornographic images involving children.
id.supp.to app.at.
distinguishing between amendments that are substantive and those that merely clarify is,at times,a difficult task,but not in this case.see,at.in united states kissick,cir,this court laid out factors which tend to show that an amendment is for clarification purposes rather than a substantive change it does not overrule existing precedent it revises a commentary note rather than a guideline and the authors characterized it as clarifying.applying these factors in analyzing the amendment to section b,we conclude that the amendment is merely clarifying.the amendment affirmed the conclusions of the four circuits that had previously ruled on the guideline,the amendment revised commentary,and the commission characterized the amendment as clarifying.thus,the amendment may be applied retroactively to the defendants.see gigley,at.
i am unable to join the majority opinion.i am not persuaded the united states sentencing guidelines commission and congress intended the term other items to include computer files rather than computer disks.furthermore,i believe the vagueness of b at least requires that we apply the rule of lenity in this case.united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual.with all due respect,i dissent.
when congress created the sentencing guidelines commission,it fundamentally altered the nature of the judicial and legislative roles in determining criminal punishment.prior to promulgation of the guidelines,courts had wide latitude in assigning punishments for people convicted of crimes.a central goal of the guidelines was to take such latitude away from individual judges,instead requiring adherence to a set of rules.ch,pt,intro.comment.in essence,congress replaced the common law system of sentencing that had long been in place with a civil code system.in a civil code system,
t he picture of the judicial process that emerges is one of fairly routine activity.the judge is presented with a fact situation to which a ready legislative response will be readily found in all except the extraordinary case.his function is merely to find the right legislative provision,couple it with the fact situation,and bless the solution that is more or less automatically produced from the union.
john henry merryman,the civil law tradition ed.
in such a system,judges have less reason to interpret statutes.by adopting the sentencing guideline system,the legislative branch has removed much of this responsibility from independent judges in favor of a body that can incorporate new policy concerns and empirical research while maintaining uniformity in sentences.ch,pt.a,intro.comment at.accordingly,the sentencing guidelines are reissued on a regular almost annual basis.id.at.if new situations present themselves,if technology changes,it is now the prerogative of the sentencing guidelines commission to revise and amend the guidelines to reflect such changes.for sentencing purposes,then,judges should not read present circumstances into past guidelines.
if we are to be bound by the sentencing guidelines,as i acknowledge we are,then we should also exercise caution in our reading of them,being careful to interpret them narrowly.the commission has the power to revise and amend guidelines with relative ease.ch,pt.a,intro.comment at.if we offer a narrower reading of ambiguous provisions than the commission wishes,the commission can easily make clear its intent,as it did by amending the guideline in the case now before us.
the guideline we interpret here was originally adopted in and provides if the offense involved possessing ten or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other items,containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor,increase by levels.b emphasis added.the majority believes that the meaning of other items in the computer context is quite plain.it readily adopts the ninth circuit reasoning in united states fellows,cir.however,the ninth circuit,and by extension the majority interpretation here,reads other items in the technological context of the late,thus reading into it a meaning that was not imaginable earlier in that decade when the guideline was adopted.
in fellows,the ninth circuit held that the plain meaning of the term item in section b included computer files.id.at.the court analysis turned on the fact that a computer user can separately view,copy,delete,or transmit each discrete graphics file,id.at,and that a graphics file can store one or more visual depictions.id.prior to the decision in the instant case,two circuits had relied on fellows in ruling on the issue now before us.see united states harper,cir construing section b in light of a b united states perreault,cir same.one circuit had followed fellows in construing the guideline in light of a b.see united states demerritt,cir.
i am not convinced by the ninth circuit conclusion and the cursory opinions of the courts that have followed it,particularly when considered in the context of the statute to which thompson and naus pled guilty.the advent of the internet,and its use as a means of distributing child pornography,has forced many courts to parse the ambiguous meanings of statutes written prior to the technology boom of the past decade.statutes written and amended in the early were,by the end of that decade,no longer as clear.as a result,the meaning of the guideline is not plain and requires application of the canons of statutory construction.
canons of constructiona.lists and other associated terms 
because there is no plain meaning for item in section b,we must resort to the canons of statutory construction to resolve the ambiguity in the language.two aids assist us in this process noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis.the first states that when the legislative intent or meaning of a statute is not clear,the meaning of doubtful words may be determined by reference to their relationship with other associated words and phrases.norman singer,sutherland statutory construction ed.the second states,where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.id.at.
the question is whether a computer disk of any sort or a computer file is an item similar in nature to those items listed.the parties in this case have focused on the term contain used in the guideline as it modifies the term item.to qualify as an item,they argue,the thing in question must qualify as a container of one sort or another.
the central problem rests on which thing,a computer disk or a computer file,is most like books,magazines,periodicals,films,and video tapes.b.the items listed all consist of collections of a combination of images,text,sound.unfortunately,the computer and cyberspace analogue to the class of items listed in the guideline is not at all obvious.the court in fellows reasoned,the commonality between the items specifically enumerated in the section is that they are all discrete containers for visual depictions capable of being separately manipulated and distributed.fellows,at.because the computer user can separately view,copy,delete,or transmit,each discrete graphics file,the court concluded a computer file constituted an item under the guideline.id.at.
by this logic,however,a page of a book,magazine,or periodical could be considered a container,contrary to the intent manifested in the guideline.after all,a page or individual piece of paper can be used to compile and store multiple visual depictions.a page from any newspaper contains multiple photographs,advertisements,and discrete news stories,yet we would not consider an individual newspaper page an item under the guideline.see united states dauray,cir.the majority counters that a key distinction lies in the fact that computer files possess a portability and transmissibility.op.at.this is,of course.however,the technology that makes such portability and transmission possible today was either or in a primordial state at the time the guideline was passed 
thompson and naus argue that a container is a thing that physically stores within it the graphic images,just as a book,magazine or videotape contain images.their argument makes sense as well.computer disks are used as containers for discrete images in the form of data.computer data can not exist without a disk in much the same way that a video image can not exist without the tape on which it is recorded.similarly,a computer file,without a medium on which to be encoded,no more exists than a printed image can exist without paper.it is arguably the disk that contains the image,while the separate files organize the data thereon.
the disagreement here is understandable.in dauray,at,the second circuit engaged in a similar attempt to interpret the meaning of the word matter as used in a b,which at the time made it a crime to knowingly possess or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,videotapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction emphasis added.in interpreting the word contain as used in that statute,the court found two equally plausible definitions.first,to contain could mean to have within hold.id.second,to contain could mean to consist of wholly or in part comprise,include.id.the defendants in dauray argued,as do thompson and naus,that a picture is not a thing that contains itself.id.the government in dauray asserted that the paper and ink on which the images were printed were the matter containing the picture.id.here,the majority makes a similar argument,that the computer file contains the image in line with the second definition.
while both arguments are plausible interpretations,such conjecture is not convincing either way as to whether the framers of the guideline believed that a computer file contains an image or is the image itself much like a polaroid photo or an image on a page within a book or magazine.when guideline section b was adopted in,the internet was in its infancy and data storage was not nearly as advanced as it is today.see supra note.disks could hold much less,making them more akin to a book or magazine than a library.when the framers drafted the guideline,therefore,it is more likely that they considered the computer disk to be analogous to an item under the guideline.because these means of construction prove,however,we turn to related statutes in hopes of drawing a conclusion as to the framers intent.
statutory structure 
a statute is to be considered in all its parts when construing any one of them.lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d.guideline section was written to apply to a.b,comment.section a b makes it a crime to possess books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction,of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct.a b emphasis added.in its argument,the government points to other circuits interpretations of this statute as helpful in construing the sentencing guideline.aplee.br.at.in my judgment,however,these cases reveal the confusion surrounding such language.three courts have interpreted the meaning of other matter.they have split on whether the term encompasses computer disks or the computer files thereon.
in united states lacy,cir,the court concluded that matter is the physical medium that contains the visual this case,the hard drive of the computer and the disks id.at.it reached this conclusion by applying the two principles of statutory interpretation discussed above,noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,concluding as it did because matter appeared at the end of a list of physical media capable of containing images.id.
in dauray,the defendant was found in possession of thirteen unbound pictures of minors.id.at the pictures were pieces of magazine pages and photocopies of those pages.after employing the canons of construction,the second circuit concluded that the statute meaning was irretrievably ambiguous and applied the rule of lenity.id.at.
in united states vig,on the contrary,the eighth circuit held other matter to mean simply something which,at a minimum,must be capable of containing a visual depiction,cir.the court continued,to conclude,as defendants argue,that a hard drive is the computer equivalent of a book,magazine,periodical,would result in the absurd scenario where an individual who possesses three books with one visual depiction apiece violates the statute,but an individual with hundreds of images on a hard drive does not.id.at.the dissenting judge asserted that the majority conclusion led to a similarly absurd result where someone who possessed three books containing one proscribed image each would be in violation of the statute,while someone who possessed a computer file containing hundreds of such images would not be.id.at arnold,dissenting emphasis added.his dissent concluded,
is a hard drive like a book or a library is it significant
