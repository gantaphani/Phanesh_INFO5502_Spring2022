background 
owns the and patents,which relate to computer keyboard positioning systems.the patent involves a clamping system that allows adjustment of the keyboard to a negative tilt position,with the palm rest adjusted above the plane of the keys.the patent involves a tray system that positions the keyboard in a similar negative tilt position.a view of this system is shown in figure of the patent,reproduced below 
on april,filed suit against steelcase,office details,and office concepts,asserting infringement of both patents.steelcase stipulated that it was liable for office details,and the case was bifurcated against office concepts.the claims against office details and office concepts were therefore dismissed,and the case proceeded against steelcase alone.
the claim terms at issue in this appeal were construed in a memorandum opinion and order of november,following a hearing on claim construction.at issue in the patent was a limitation related to keyboard position as highlighted in claim below 
a device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward tilted position,the device comprises 
b a clamp engaged with said bracket said clamp being engagable with a keyboard such that the keyboard may be oriented in a backward tilted position defined by the rear end of the keyboard being disposed below the front end of the keyboard,to prevent the keyboard from falling off when the keyboard is orientated in said backward tilted position 
patent,ll.the district court construed this language to mean that the support device permits the bottom of a keyboard to be tilted backward,at any angle of less than degrees.at issue in the patent was the sidewall limitation highlighted in claim below 
a device for mounting a keyboard to a base and for positioning the keyboard in a backward tilted position,the device comprising 
c a support tray comprising 
a support surface and 
a keyboard stop member comprising a stop wall,said support surface comprising a front portion,a rear portion,a first sidewall,and a second sidewall,such that said stop wall extends from said first side wall to said second side wall and wherein said stop wall is disposed in said rear portion of said support surface,
patent,ll.the district court construed sidewall to mean a structure projecting or extending upward,above the plane of the support surface,from either side of the support tray.finding that steelcase products did not possess sidewalls that projected or extended upward,the district court granted steelcase motion for partial summary judgment of of the patent.
after a hearing on various pretrial motions,the district court granted steelcase motion in limine to exclude certain portions of testimony by john rosecrance,designated expert.specifically,rosecrance was allowed to testify to his field of expertise,ergonomics,but was precluded from testifying as an expert regarding designs of keyboard support systems and the prior art at the time of the invention.
as trial began on the patent,steelcase stipulated that its accused devices infringed.in turn,stipulated that steelcase kbs device was conceived and reduced to practice before invention was conceived in november,and that the kbs device taught each limitation of the asserted claims.thus,the primary issue for trial was whether the kbs device anticipated the patent under g or qualified as prior art for obviousness purposes.
with respect to the kbs device,requested that the jury be instructed that in order to constitute prior art under section g,the prior inventor could not have suppressed or concealed the invention.the district court found that there was not sufficient evidence to support such an instruction and denied request.
during deliberations,the jury requested clarification regarding what is considered public and prior art.the district court defined public as information not restricted by confidentiality.as to prior art,the court responded 
in answer to your question,anything made or built in the united states by another person before the date of the claimed invention can be prior art for purposes of obviousness even if it is not publically sic available before the date of the claimed invention keep in mind that you should consider what i have just written,together with all the other instructions that i gave you earlier.all the instructions are important,and you should consider them as a whole.
the jury returned a verdict for steelcase,finding the patent invalid under both g and.did not make a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol or move for a new trial.
after entering judgment for steelcase,the district court considered steelcase motion for a determination of inequitable conduct in procuring the patent.steelcase argued that failed to disclose to the patent and trademark office the patent office a letter and photographs from a competitor that constituted prior art material to patentability.steelcase also argued that failed to disclose the kbs device to the patent office,and that patent counsel made a false declaration in his petition to make special because he did not investigate the photographs or the kbs device in his search of the prior art.the court concluded that steelcase failed to show clear and convincing evidence of an intent to deceive and therefore denied the motion.
on appeal,challenges the district court jury instructions,the court ruling limiting rosecrance expert testimony,and the court claim construction of disputed terms in the and patents.on,steelcase challenges the district court finding that clear and convincing evidence did not demonstrate inequitable conduct in procuring the patent.we have jurisdiction under a.

jury instructions 
the district court found that had failed to establish a sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that there was suppression or abandonment by steelcase in connection with the kbs device under g.
relying on lutzker plet,and young dworkin,argues that sufficient evidence supports a prima facie case of suppression or concealment under section g.contends that steelcase intentionally kept the kbs device a secret from the time of its reduction to practice in until its disclosure at a trade show in june,while making only modest improvements for commercialization purposes.points to shindelar holdeman,for support that three months is a reasonable time to draft and file a patent application,as opposed to the nearly seven months involved in drafting the application for the kbs device.adds that because the kbs device was suppressed,it was not prior art for purposes.moreover,asserts that the district court responses to the jury questions compounded this error.
steelcase responds that checkpoint systems,united states international trade commission,and dow chemical,control and that suppression or concealment is negated as a matter of law by either the commercialization of the kbs device or by the filing of a patent application on may.alternatively,steelcase argues that suppression or concealment is an equitable determination for the judge.steelcase adds that failed to proffer a correct jury instruction.
we must first determine if there is disputed evidence of record supporting an instruction on suppression or concealment of the kbs device.we conclude that there is none and agree with the district court and steelcase that did not make out a prima facie case of suppression.
patent law provides that a person shall be entitled to a patent unless before such person invention thereof,the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned,suppressed,or concealed it.g dow chemical,at.if prior invention has been established,the burden shifts to the patentee to produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the prior inventor abandoned,suppressed,or concealed the invention.dow chemical,at.there are two types of suppression or concealment cases in which the inventor intentionally suppresses or conceals his invention,and cases in which a legal inference of suppression or concealment can be drawn based on an unreasonable delay in making the invention publicly known.id.at fujikawa,at.
first argues that the kbs device was intentionally suppressed or concealed.intentional suppression occurs when an inventor designedly,and with the view of applying it indefinitely and exclusively for his own profit,withholds his invention from the public.paulik rizkalla,en banc quoting kendall winsor,how.see also fujikawa,at.the only evidence offers for this argument is the time taken to file the patent application for the kbs device and the fact that the device was kept secret during that time.intentional suppression,however,requires more than the passage of time.it requires evidence that the inventor intentionally delayed filing in order to prolong the period during which the invention is maintained in secret.fujikawa,at emphasis added.the record demonstrates that after reduction to practice,steelcase moved almost immediately towards both filing a patent application and commercially disclosing the kbs device at a trade show,actions which indicate an intent to make a public disclosure.both the patent application and commercialization efforts came to fruition about six and months later.that the device was kept secret during this time is not,by itself,indicative of intentional suppression or concealment.see du pont de nemours phillips petroleum,because work is secret does not necessarily mean that it has been abandoned,suppressed or concealed.because did not offer any evidence indicating a designed intent to withhold the kbs device from the public,we conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to support a jury instruction regarding intentional suppression or concealment.
next argues that the delay in filing a patent application for the kbs device supports an inference of suppression or concealment.the failure to file a patent application,to describe the invention in a published document,or to use the invention publicly,within a reasonable time after first making the invention may constitute abandonment,suppression,or concealment.dow chemical,at citations omitted see also checkpoint,at.there is no particular length of delay that is per se unreasonable,checkpoint,at,and m ere delay,without more,is not sufficient to establish suppression or concealment.young,at.e ach case involving the issue of suppression or concealment must be considered on its own particular set of facts.paulik,at quoting shindelar,at.
our case law provides guidance on what constitutes a reasonable delay when an invention is disclosed to the public by commercializing the invention.in dow chemical,we held that a delay of two and years between reduction to practice and the commercialization of an invention did not constitute a prima facie case of suppression or concealment where the first inventor made reasonable efforts to bring the invention to market.at quoting checkpoint,at.in that case,the first inventor actively and continuously took steps towards commercialization including the procurement of financing to build a new production plant and attention to safety considerations.id.we noted that the fastest route to commercialization was not required,only reasonable efforts.id.similarly,in checkpoint,we agreed with an administrative law judge determination that a delay of four years between reduction to practice and commercialization was reasonable when the first inventor took steps to bring the invention to market such as disclosing it to his employer,conducting further tests,purchasing supplies from vendors,and helping develop a system for mass production.at.
in this case,offered no evidence to indicate that steelcase delay of six and months between reduction to practice and commercialization of the kbs device was not the result of reasonable steps to bring the invention to market.after reduction to practice,steelcase resolved design issues and spent on tooling for the parts to the kbs device.the lead times for creating the tooling varied from four weeks to approximately six months.therefore,it does not appear that steelcase could have brought the kbs device to market much sooner than the trade show unveiling in june.
at the same time,steelcase patent counsel began drafting a patent application for the kbs device,submitting a first draft to steelcase in march.the draft was reviewed by the four named inventors and filed in may.no evidence indicated that this amount of time was unreasonably long 
because offered no evidence to demonstrate that steelcase failed to take reasonable steps toward market,and because offered no evidence that a delay of six and months from reduction to practice to filing an application was unreasonable,we conclude that there is not sufficient evidence to support a jury instruction regarding an inference of suppression or concealment.
we disagree with contention that lutzker and young command a different result.first,both lutzker and young address disclosing a prior invention only by filing a patent application they do not is the case through commercialization.in an interference context,we have held that delayed filing due to commercialization efforts or improvements not reflected in the patent application are inexcusable.lutzker,at young,at.however,we h
