plaintiff virtual countries,appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york allen schwartz,judge that dismissed its petition for relief under the declaratory judgment act,based on the court conclusion that defendants republic of south africa the republic and the south african tourism board satour have sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act of,fsia or the act,virtual countries,republic of south africa,d.the district court further concluded that none of the act exceptions to immunity applied.id.at.because the republic act of which virtual countries complains had no direct effect in the united states,we conclude that none of the fsia exceptions,including a on which the plaintiff particularly relies,creates subject matter jurisdiction.we therefore need not and do not address the district court alternative holding that the republic act was not commercial.
background 
virtual countries is a seattle,corporation,that owns internet domain names including,and,most pertinently for this appeal.virtual countries has owned since at least may,using it since october to provide access to news,weather,tourist information,and online shopping opportunities,particularly related to travel,and goods and services,available within or pertaining to the southern region of the african continent.compl.
the republic,a foreign sovereign nation,owns.satour,its national tourism agency,has new york offices,operates a web site at,and owns the domain names and.
two international organizations figure in this appeal.first,the world intellectual property organization wipo is one of the specialized agencies of the united nations system of organizations that administers international treaties dealing with different aspects of intellectual property protection.about wipo,at last visited august.one hundred countries maintain membership in wipo.id.second,the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann was established in as a,private sector corporation that coordinates a select set of the internet technical management functions currently performed by the government or its contractors and volunteers.icann a structural overview,at last modified march.since october,icann has supervised a arbitral system,the uniform domain name dispute resolution policy udrp,for resolving domain names disputes.udrp proceedings are conducted by administrative dispute resolution service providers approved by icann icann has accredited four service providers and wipo is one of them.sallen corinthians licenciamentos ltda,cir.
in july,in response to various governments requests to assess,inter alia,the extent of and possible solutions for bad faith,abusive,misleading or unfair use of geographical indications,wipo initiated the second internet domain name process.in the course thereof,the republic submitted comments to wipo arguing that domain names and generic domains gtlds that are the same as the official or common names of sovereign nations should be protected against bad faith,abusive,misleading,or unfair registration and use.the republic cited as examples domain names containing the word southafrica,albeit without explicit reference to virtual countries,as having substantial political and economic value that were national assets belonging to the sovereign nation.the republic further recommended binding udrp arbitration governed by the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of in disputes over such names.only in april,after the relevant events in this dispute had transpired,did wipo issue an interim report exploring possible solutions.
on october,the republic issued a press release,the act that lies at the core of this litigation.the release asserted that the republic could be the first country in the world to make a challenge for the right to own its own domain name in the generic top level domain.the press release explained that the republic intended to lodge an application claiming the domain with wipo before november,because it wished to use that domain as a strategic marketing tool in promoting trade and tourism.the press release also noted the republic aim to take this matter the ownership of up in international fora such as icann.and it reaffirmed the republic position that sovereign countries ha ve the first right to own their own domain names.
the complaint and district court decision 
one week later,on november,virtual countries filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking declaratory relief pursuant to to the effect that the republic lacked rights to the domain name.the plaintiff also sought injunctive relief against any arbitration or court proceedings in any forum worldwide challenging its rights to that domain name.compl.b.according to the complaint,the republic october press release demonstrated its intent to because it lacked a legitimate claim that could be established either before an icann arbitral forum or under united states law.compl.in a declaration responding to the defendants motion to dismiss,virtual countries president and principal shareholder,gregory paley,explained that the press release had a devastating and direct effect on virtual countries short and business operations.paley decl.paley asserted that the press release placed a cloud on virtual countries ownership of domain names,obliging it to sell.id.in addition,he said,a possible strategic alliance with a south african firm had failed due to the potential partner fear of reprisals from the south african government.id.
on april,the defendants moved pursuant to.b to dismiss the action for want of subject matter jurisdiction.they submitted a declaration of andile abner ngcada,director general of the south african department of communications,in which ngcada explained that the republic,in issuing the press release,had been engag ed in international multistate,and regional international diplomacy regarding the appropriate position that the relevant international bodies should follow regarding domain name registration of the names of sovereign nations.ngcada decl.ngcada further stated that the republic had decided not to commence an arbitration before wipo or any other organization that has adopted icann udrp under the udrp procedures currently in place.id.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss because it concluded that subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia was wanting.virtual countries,d at.the district court observed that absent the availability of a statutory exception,the fsia granted general immunity from suit to foreign states,including both the republic and its instrumentality,satour.id.at.according to the court,the sole possible basis for subject matter jurisdiction required that the republic act,the preparation and initial dissemination of the press release,had been taken in connection with a commercial activity and had had a direct effect in the united states on the plaintiff.id.at.the court concluded,however,that issuance of a press release was not a commercial activity.id.at.rather,the press release was part of the republic diplomatic efforts before wipo,an international organization.id.at.the district court further held that the press release had no direct effect in the united states.id.even assuming that financial loss or opportunity loss sufficed as a basis for jurisdiction,the district court rejected the plaintiff allegations to this effect as entirely conclusory.id.at.finally,the district court noted that virtual countries failed to state a claim against satour,which had played no part in preparing or issuing the press release.id.at.
virtual countries appeals.
discussion 
virtual countries contends that we must vacate the district court judgment because its sovereign immunity analysis was erroneous and because of fatal procedural mistakes in the district court proceedings.we disagree,concluding that the district court i correctly found that the republic press release had no direct effect in the united states,and ii committed no procedural error.we affirm on these grounds and therefore need not and do not reach the question whether the district court correctly concluded that the republic issuance of the press release was not commercial activity.
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to dismiss an action for want of subject matter jurisdiction on a rule b motion for clear error with respect to factual findings and de novo with respect to legal conclusions.see zappia middle constr.emirate of abu dhabi,cir accord robinson gov t of malaysia,cir.de novo review is appropriate even where,as here,the district court supplements the allegations in the complaint with undisputed facts from the record.robinson,at.
ii.claims against satour 
the district court dismissed all claims against satour under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because virtual countries had not alleged that satour was involved in the october press release.virtual countries,d at.virtual countries does not now dispute this conclusion,which is therefore undisturbed on appeal.reg l econ.cmty.action program,city of middletown,cir holding that where one of the district court independent grounds for dismissing a complaint as against one of several defendants goes unchallenged by the plaintiff,the dismissal of that defendant is not at issue on appeal.the sole defendant remaining is therefore the republic.
iii.federal court subject matter jurisdiction over actions involving foreign states 
under the fsia,federal district courts 
have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections of or under any applicable international agreement.
a.the fsia further provides that a foreign state shall be immune from such jurisdiction except as provided in sections to of the fsia.id.at.the fsia thus provides the sole basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the united states.republic of argentina weltover,d internal quotation marks omitted accord saudi arabia nelson,d.
most of the exceptions to foreign states immunity are contained in,which provides in pertinent part 
general exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.virtual countries contends that the republic is not immune from suit in a united states court because,under the third clause of a,the claims in this case are based upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act cause d a direct effect in the united states.id.for a defendant foreign state to be amenable to jurisdiction under the third clause,the lawsuit for which jurisdiction is sought must be based upon an act outside the territory of the united states that was taken in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state outside this country and that caused a direct effect in the united states.weltover,at internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted.we focus on the third requirement,a direct effect in the united states,and find the absence thereof dispositive of this appeal.

a.the press release effect 
virtual countries argues that the preparation and initial dissemination of the press release cause d a direct effect in the united states,a,by having a devastating and direct effect on its business operations,paley decl.paley explains that the press release message damaged the plaintiff ability to raise capital,threaten ed virtual countries continued corporate existence,and forced it to divest one of its assets,to obtain funds to cover operating expenses.id.paley further explains that the principal injury,a diminishment in virtual countries ability to raise capital,is particularly acute because the plaintiff continued growth and ultimately its corporate survival as an company depends entirely upon its ability to raise funds in the capital markets.id.emphasis added.
but even accepting the plaintiff account for purposes of the motion to dismiss,the press release effect falls at the end of a long chain of causation and is mediated by numerous actions by third parties.first,the republic issued the press release.then wire services and newspapers in south africa and elsewhere obtained the release and wrote articles about it.current or potential in the united states,perhaps in other countries,and perhaps in a potential strategic business partner in south africa,allegedly then learned of the release contents.drawing on news reports,they then formed their own independent assessments of the republic intentions and the possible effect of those intentions on virtual countries and people who would do business with it.among these independent assessments was speculation about possible reprisals by the republic.paley decl.only then could investors and the prospective business partner have decided to give effect to their doubts as to the validity of the plaintiff current registration of and their fears of reprisal by the republic,by declining to invest in or do business with virtual countries.
at a minimum,two independent kinds of the press and then investors,potential investors,and potential business between issuance of the press release and any alleged injurious effect on the plaintiff.united world trade,at concluding that there was no jurisdiction where the direct effect was dependent on an intervening factor.any ultimate effect on virtual countries depended principally on a shift in investors sentiments regarding the plaintiff prospects the press release effect thus depended crucially on variables independent of the republic.this tangled causal web does not provide the requisite immediacy to establish jurisdiction.see weltover,at.united world trade,at finding no direct effect under any common sense reading of that phrase following a series of banking transactions from sicily to london to new york to paris.
nor,in our view,would extending the commercial acts exception to the type of remote harm alleged here further the act purposes.the legislative history of the fsia suggests that congress adopted it to mitigate the considerable uncertainty that arises when a private party deals with a foreign government and immunity is decided on the basis of nonlegal considerations,at,reprinted in.defining direct effect to permit jurisdiction when a foreign state actions precipitate reactions by third parties,which reactions then have an impact on a plaintiff,would foster uncertainty in both foreign states and private.neither could predict when an action would create jurisdiction,which would hinge on third parties independent reactions and conduct,even if in individual cases,such as the one at bar,a particular effect might be foreseeable.to permit jurisdiction i
