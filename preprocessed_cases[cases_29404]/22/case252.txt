factual and procedural background 
in march,a woman in jamestown,new york,complained to the police that she had received an internet message from someone with the yahoo id famcple,who proceeded to show her images of young children engaged in sexual acts.this complaint was forwarded to the buffalo,new york division of the federal bureau of investigation fbi.the fbi sent a subpoena to incorporated yahoo seeking information regarding the user of yahoo id famcple.yahoo responded with information that the user login name was,that the user full name was rob ram,and that on the dates when the child pornography was transmitted,the user had been using the ip address.
the fbi determined that the owner of the ip address was time warner cable time warner.after being served with a subpoena,time warner informed the fbi that the ip address in question was assigned to javier perez,residing at scenic brook drive,austin,texas.the fbi performed a public records check,a utilities company check,and an internet white pages check,all of which indicated that there was a javier perez living at scenic brook drive,austin,texas.special agent robert britt britt of the fbi sought a warrant to search that address.on june,a united states magistrate judge issued a warrant authorizing the search of the residence,business,outbuildings,and motor vehicles on the curtilage located at scenic brook drive,austin,tx.
on june,britt and other officers executed the search warrant.when the officers arrived at the front door of scenic brook drive,they were met by edwin atterbury atterbury,who explained that he was a housemate of perez and that a third person also resided in the house britt proceeded with the search but confined it to perez room and the common areas of the house.after the officers searched perez room,in which they located compact discs containing child pornography,perez,who was present during the search,directed the officers to storage bins in the garage,where more such compact discs were found.in total,approximately compact discs containing thousands of images of child pornography were seized by the officers.

perez arguments 
perez argues that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his premises on june.perez first insists that there was insufficient probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant.perez alleges that mere association between an ip address and a physical address is insufficient to establish probable cause.even if the initial determination that probable cause existed was reasonable,however,perez argues that t he discovery that multiple people resided at perez residence undermined the basis for the magistrate determination.perez argues that the officers discovery of perez housemates should have indicated to them that there was no longer probable cause to believe that perez was the source of the unlawful transmissions.he further argues that the existence of these two housemates was material information that the officers had a duty to report to the issuing magistrate.finally,perez argues that the exception does not apply because the officers reliance on the warrant was no longer objectively reasonable once they discovered that two other persons lived with perez at scenic brook drive.
guiding supreme court precedent 
like this case,maryland garrison,d,involved the constitutionality of a search executed pursuant to a warrant authorizing the search of a structure that turned out to contain more individual residences than was believed at the time the warrant was issued.in garrison,baltimore police obtained a warrant to search the third floor apartment of park avenue.id.at.when applying for the warrant and when executing it,police reasonably believed that the third floor of that address had only one apartment and that this apartment was occupied by the suspect mcwebb.id.at.in the course of their search,the police realized that the third floor actually contained two apartments,and that they were in the process of searching the apartment of garrison.id.the officers ceased their search of garrison quarters,but the contraband they had discovered before doing so became the basis for garrison conviction.id.at.the supreme court held that under the circumstances presented,the seizure of contraband from garrison apartment did not violate the fourth amendment.id.at.
while the instant case is not identical to garrison in all relevant particulars,garrison does lay out a framework for how the analysis of this case should proceed.there,the supreme court stated that i n our view,the case presents two separate constitutional issues,one concerning the validity of the warrant and the other concerning the reasonableness of the manner in which it was executed.id.at.perez appeal presents the same two overarching issues.
validity of warrant to search scenic brook drive 
a valid search warrant may be issued only upon a finding of probable cause.united states brown,cir.the information necessary to show probable cause must be contained within a written affidavit given under oath.id.probable cause does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt a magistrate need only have a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing.id.a magistrate determination is entitled to deference by reviewing courts.id.
in this case it is clear that there was a substantial basis to conclude that evidence of criminal activity would be found at scenic brook drive.the affidavit presented to the magistrate included the information that the child pornography viewed by the witness in new york had been transmitted over the ip address,and that this ip address was assigned to javier perez,residing at scenic brook drive,austin,texas.perez argues that the association of an ip address with a physical address does not give rise to probable cause to search that address.he argues that if he used an unsecure wireless connection,then neighbors would have been able to easily use perez internet access to make the transmissions.but though it was possible that the transmissions originated outside of the residence to which the ip address was assigned,it remained likely that the source of the transmissions was inside that residence.see united states grant,cir stating that even discounting for the possibility that an individual other than defendant may have been using his account,there was a fair probability that defendant was the user and that evidence of the user illegal activities would be found in defendant home emphasis in original p robable cause does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.brown,at.
perez also argues that evidence that illicit transmissions we
