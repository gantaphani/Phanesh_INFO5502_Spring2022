since,title ii of the electronic communications privacy act of,stat,codified as amended at,commonly referred to as the stored communications act,has authorized the federal government to require internet service providers to disclose the contents of electronic communication s of their customers in certain circumstances,including by way of an ex parte court order.id.d.the government obtained two such orders in to search steven warshak.when warshak learned about the orders,roughly a year later,he filed a declaratory judgment action,seeking to invalidate d under the fourth amendment,and he moved for a preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin the government from conducting further ex parte searches.the district court granted the motion and enjoined the government from using d to seize the contents of any personal email account belonging to warshak or any resident of the southern district of ohio without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.ja.we vacate the preliminary injunction because warshak constitutional claim is not ripe for judicial resolution.
the stored communications act prohibits unauthorized access to certain electronic communications,see,and places restrictions on a service provider disclosure of certain communications,see id.it also permits a governmental entity to compel a service provider to disclose the contents of communications in certain circumstances.see id.
three relevant definitions bear on the meaning of the provisions of the act.e lectronic communication service s permit users to send or receive wire or electronic communications,id,a definition that covers basic services,see patricia bellia et,cyberlaw problems of policy and jurisprudence in the information age ed.e lectronic storage is any temporary,intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication and any storage of such communication by an electronic communication service for purposes of backup protection of such communication.r emote computing service s provide computer storage or processing services to customers,id,and are designed for storage,see orin kerr,a user guide to the stored communications act,and a legislator guide to amending it,geo.
the provisions give different levels of privacy protection based on whether the is held with an electronic communication service or a remote computing service and based on how long the has been in electronic storage.the government may obtain the contents of that are in electronic storage with an electronic communication service for days or less only pursuant to a warrant.a.the government has three options for obtaining communications stored with a remote computing service and communications that have been in electronic storage with an electronic service provider for more than days obtain a warrant use an administrative subpoena or obtain a court order under d.id.a,b.
under d,the provision at issue in this case,a court of competent jurisdiction may issue an order based on specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication,or the records or other information sought,are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.id.d.although the statute generally requires the government to give the user prior notice of the disclosure unless it obtains a warrant,it contains an exception,id.b b,which says the government may delay notice in increments,id.a,if notification would result in a endangering the life or physical safety of an individual b flight from prosecution c destruction of or tampering with evidence d intimidation of potential witnesses or e otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial,id.a see also id.b authorizing the government to seek a court order preventing the service provider from disclosing the subpoena if the same conditions are met.
warshak is the president and sole owner of berkeley premium nutraceuticals,which became the target of an investigation into mail and wire fraud,money laundering,and other federal offenses based on its nationwide marketing,distribution,and sale of products.ja.the government sought permission from a magistrate judge to require warshak internet service communications and to turn over warshak account information,a ll l og files and backup tapes and the contents of that had been accessed,viewed,or downloaded or that were more than days old.ja.
on may,and again on september,the magistrate judge granted the applications under d of the act.as required,the orders were based on specific and articulable facts showing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the records or other information sought were relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.ja,see d.as permitted,the orders did not give warshak immediate notice of the disclosures.b b.concluding that notice to warshak would seriously jeopardize the investigation,the magistrate judge ordered the government to delay notice for days and mandated that the o rder s be sealed until otherwise ordered by the court.ja,see b b,a.
on may,roughly a year after the court issued the first d order,the government gave warshak notice of the orders.in response,he sued the government on june,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.among other complaints,warshak alleged that d violated the fourth amendment on its face and as applied because the searches were based on a showing of less than probable cause and were not supported by a warrant.
on june,warshak filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.the court granted the motion and enjoined the government from using d to search the contents of any personal email account maintained by an isp in the name of any resident of the southern district of ohio without providing the user prior notice and an opportunity to be heard.ja.the court reasoned that warshak likely would succeed on his fourth amendment claim because internet users have a reasonable expectation of privacy in,and because the orders authorized warrantless searches on less than probable cause.the court also concluded that warshak faced imminent harm based on the two prior orders and the government refusal to pledge not to seek additional orders in the future.the court enjoined the government from enforcing d or related sections of the act sections b b ii and to the extent that they authorize the ex parte issuance of search and seizure orders without a warrant and on less than a showing of probable cause.ja.while the court relied in part on the threat of irreparable injury to warshak,it explained that the constitutional flaws are facial in nature.id.
on september,a federal grand jury indicted warshak for bank fraud,mail fraud and money laundering,among other federal crimes.see indictment,united states warshak.on february,a jury convicted him on counts.see jury verdict as to steven warshak,warshak.
the constitution does not extend the judicial power to any legal question,wherever and however presented,but only to those legal questions presented in cases and controversies.const.art.iii.a claim is not amenable to the judicial process,steel citizens for a better env t,d,when it is filed too early making it unripe,when it is filed too late making it moot or when the claimant lacks a sufficiently concrete and redressable interest in the dispute depriving the plaintiff of standing.this case implicates at least two of these doctrines today,ripeness and standing,both of which unquestionably overlap,airline prof ls ass of the int l of teamsters airborne,cir,and at some point could well implicate the third mootness in view of the motion to suppress that warshak filed in his criminal case.as there is no obligation to favor one of these justiciability doctrines over the other and as none of these questions goes to the merits of the case,we may address them in any sequence we wish.see arizonans for official english arizona,d.we ripeness.
like standing,ripeness is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,d internal quotation marks omitted.the ripeness doctrine serves to avoid premature adjudication of legal questions and to prevent courts from entangling themselves in abstract debates that may turn out differently in different settings.id.at.in ascertaining whether a claim is ripe for judicial resolution,we ask two basic questions is the claim fit for judicial decision in the sense that it arises in a concrete factual context and concerns a dispute that is likely to come to pass and what is the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration abbott labs.gardner,d see also ammex,cox,cir adult video ass of justice,cir.
there are several reasons why this claim is not fit for judicial review.to start,we have no idea whether the government will conduct an ex parte search of warshak account in the future and plenty of reason to doubt that it will,making this a claim that depends on contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.answering difficult legal questions before they arise and before the courts know how they will arise is not the way we typically handle constitutional litigation.see lujan wildlife fed n,d.
past is precedent,warshak responds government agents have conducted two ex parte searches of his before,so it is fair to assume they will do so again.making that prospect more likely,he adds,is the government reluctance to promise not to search warshak accounts in the future.but this position overlooks a central feature of the statute.searches under the statute generally require what warshak demands prior notice.b b.in conducting its previous searches of warshak,the government obtained judicial permission to delay notice to warshak on the ground that disclosure would seriously jeopardiz e the investigation.id.a e.that possibility no longer exists.warshak has ample notice of the notice of the worst sort he has been indicted and now convicted.the question,as framed by the complaint,is not whether the government will conduct another search of warshak it is whether the government will conduct another ex parte search of his,a possibility that is exceedingly remote given that the reason the government kept these searches they would jeopardize the ongoing longer exists.it is within the realm of possibility,we suppose,that a new investigation could commence or that some other reason for delaying notice could arise,such as the need to avoid endangering the life or physical safety of an individual flight from prosecution destruction of or tampering with evidence intimidation of potential witnesses or unduly delaying a trial.id.a a e.but these possibilities are just and remote possibilities at that making it eminently unpredictable whether,when or why the government would seek judicial permission to conduct another ex parte search of warshak.
not only do we have no idea whether or when such a search will occur but we also have no idea what accounts,or what types of accounts,the government might investigate.toilet goods ass n,gardner,d.that uncertainty looms large in a debate about the expectations of privacy in accounts.the underlying merits issue in the case is this in permitting the government to search based on reasonable grounds,is d consistent with the fourth amendment,which generally requires probable cause and a warrant in the context of searches of individuals,homes and,perhaps most analogously,posted mail the answer to that question will turn in part on the expectations of privacy that computer users have in their inquiry that may well shift over time,that assuredly shifts from agreement to agreement and that requires considerable knowledge about technologies.because t he task of generating balanced and nuanced rules in this area requires a comprehensive understanding of technological facts,orin kerr,the fourth amendment and new technologies constitutional myths and the case for caution,warshak claim epitomizes the kind of dispute that would profit from a concrete factual context,ammex,at.
think of just one of these moving variety of agreements and the differing expectations of privacy that come with them.an agreement might say that a service provider will not read or disclose subscribers to anyone except authorized users.united states maxwell,describing testimony about aol policy.an agreement might say that a service provider will not intentionally monitor or disclose any private email message but that it reserve s the right to do so in some cases.see privacy statement for juno members,last visited july.an agreement might say that a service provider may or may not content,but shall have the right but not the obligation in its sole discretion to,refuse or move any content that is available via the service as indeed warshak account did.ja.an agreement might say that will be provided to the government on indeed the same account did.an agreement might say that other individuals,besides the recipient of the,will have access to it and will be entitled to use the information in it.see,ja explaining that gmail,a service provided by google,gives users an enormous amount of storage capacity in exchange for terms of service which say that google is allowed to take a look at the content of users and target advertising at users accordingly.or an agreement might say that the user has no expectation of privacy in any of her communications.see,ja government counsel explaining that every day when we log into our account,we agree that we have no expectation of privacy in the account.
some of these agreements could cast doubt on the validity of d in a given case others might not.better,we think,to decide the validity of the statute in the context of a specific agreement and a specific search and seizure.
nor can we rely on previous government searches of warshak to hypothesize the factual context of the next search.even if the record contained the full text of the nuvox and agreements it does not it contains just part of the agreement,we would run into a similar conjecture problem.just as there is little basis for assuming the government will conduct another ex parte search of warshak,there is little basis for assuming any future search will concern facilitated by these service providers,as opposed to facilitated by other service providers.in view of warshak knowledge of the investigation and knowledge of his agreements before he filed the complaint,it is surely possible that he might switch to a service provider that gave him a greater expectation of,by contracting with a service provider that promises not to screen.or he might decide that the convenience of free,is ultimately worth the tradeoff of allowing the service provider to screen his.we simply have no way of knowing what kind of accounts warshak is likely to possess in the future and no basis for assuming that future will be controlled by the same type of agreement he used in the past.the operation of the statute,in short,will be better grasped when viewed in light of a particular application.texas,at.
concerns about the premature resolution of legal disputes have particular resonance in the context of fourth amendment disputes.in determining the reasonableness of searches under the fourth amendment and the legitimacy of citizens expectations of privacy,courts typically look at the totality of the circumstances,samson california,d internal quotation marks omitted,reaching determinations that turn on the concrete,not the general,and offering incremental,not sweeping,pronouncements of law,see ortega,d.courts thus generally review such challenges in two discrete,settings a motion to suppress in a criminal case or a damages claim under or under bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,against the officers who conducted the search.in both settings,the reviewing court looks at the claim in the context of an actual,not a hypothetical,search and in the context of a developed factual record of the reasons for and the nature of the search.a challenge to future searches,by contrast,provides no such factual context.the fourth amendment is designed to account for an unpredictable and limitless range of factual circumstances,and accordingly it generally should be applied after those circumstances unfold,not before.
that is why warshak this case presents a purely legal question,toilet goods,at.little weight.in addition to the fact that this purely legal question remains a purely speculative legal question,this case presents a legal question that may be answered differently in different settings and a legal question that depend s on an understanding of complex factual issues.id.in such cases,judicial appraisal is likely to stand on a much surer footing in the context of a specific application of the law than could be the case in the framework of a generalized challenge.id.at.
making matters worse,warshak complaint sought,and the district court injunction gave him,relief not just on behalf of himself but on behalf of all users.the point of this attack on the statute,like all facial challenges,was to leave nothing prevent d from ever being enforced without a warrant and probable cause,no matter the circumstances,no matter the individual expectation of privacy,no matter the government interests in obtaining the information without tipping the suspect off to the investigation.
that is not how constitutional litigation typically proceeds,and that is why the federal courts do not lightly uphold facial challenges.many of the concerns that underlie the ripeness t he operation of the statute will be better grasped when viewed in light of a particular application and that the proper exercise of the judicial function avoids deciding abstract and speculative questions,texas,at.internal quotation marks omitted underlie,and are indeed echoed by,the courts reluctance to grant relief in the face of facial,as opposed to,attacks on statutes.when determining whether a law is facially invalid,as when determining whether a case is ripe,we must be careful not to speculate about hypothetical or imaginary cases or to premature ly interpret statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.state grange.state republican party,d internal quotation marks omitted.exercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge frees the court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues,but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states raines,d.basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication remain the preferred route.gonzales carhart,d internal quotation marks omitted wildlife fed n,at.noting that the ripeness doctrine turns in part on the fact that t he approach is the traditional,and remains the normal,mode of operation of the courts.
litigation by hypothetical becomes particularly risky in the face of and technology.carhart.at.the complexities of modern electronic communications,which already have changed markedly since,make it especially difficult to do what facial invalidation requires to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has been especially reluctant to invalidate statutes on their face under the fourth amendment.the constitutional validity of a warrantless search is the sort of question which can only be decided in the concrete factual context of the individual case.sibron new york,d.on this basis,sibron refused to be drawn into the abstract and unproductive exercise of entertaining a fourth amendment challenge to the facial validity of new york statute,which authorized police to stop and search individuals in certain circumstances.id.at.see generally skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d bell wolfish,d.
even outside the imperatives of fourth amendment decisionmaking,the supreme court has expressed increasing skepticism of facial challenges in recent years.in united states salerno,d,the court held that the bail reform act is not facially invalid under the due process clause of the fifth amendment or the excessive bail clause of the eighth amendment,id.at.the court reasoned that a facial challenge to a legislative act is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.the fact that the bail reform act might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid id.at.in sabri united states,d,the court rejected a facial challenge to a bribery statute,explaining that f acial adjudication carries too much promise of premature interpretatio n of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.although passing on the validity of a law wholesale may be efficient in the abstract,the court explained,any gain is often offset by losing the lessons taught by the particular,to which common law method normally looks.id.at.even in the abortion context,where in the past it has applied a more relaxed standard to facial challenges,see planned parenthood of se.casey,d,the court recently expressed its preference for challenges.in carhart,the court refused to engage in conjecture about potential applications of an abortion statute,saying that it would indeed be undesirable for this court to consider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of complex and comprehensive legislation.at internal quotation marks omitted.
this trend continued in the supreme court most recent term.in crawford marion county election board,d,the court explained that plaintiffs mounting facial challenges bear a heavy burden of persuasion,then rejected a facial challenge to indiana requirements,id.at.in washington state grange,the court explained that f acial challenges are disfavored,raise the risk of premature interpretation,run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint and threaten to the democratic process.at.refusing to hold washington primary system unconstitutional in all its applications,the court reasoned that the plaintiffs claim rested on sheer speculation that the system would confuse voters and that there was no evidentiary record to provide guidance.id.at.that the system could conceivably be implemented in a constitutional manner was fatal to the facial challenge,leaving claims of voter confusion to await an challenge.id.at.a similar conclusion applies here because we can only speculate as to the sorts of accounts and privacy terms that different users may have today and may have in the future,it is far more prudent to await an challenge to decide whether the act is constitutional in a discrete factual setting.
in the face of these considerations and this case law,berger new york,d,offers warshak little help.berger,it is true,appeared to invalidate a new york eavesdropping statute on its face.id.at.but the court did not discuss the distinction between and facial challenges,and accordingly did not reach,and necessarily did not discuss,the question whether it would have made sense to proceed differently.one year later,when the court decided sibron,it did discuss this distinction,it interpreted berger narrowly and it advised courts to consider challenges to t he constitutional validity of a warrantless search on an basis.sibron,at.unlike berger and sibron,moreover,this case involves not just the risk of guessing about other fact patterns in which a statute might be applied but the risk of guessing how the statute will be applied even to this fact that makes the facial invalidation of this statute especially inappropriate.
no doubt,warshak is correct that the court has issued fourth amendment rulings that effectively invalidated statutes in whole or in part.see,payton new york,d torres puerto rico,d.but in these cases,too,the court reviewed applications of statutes in concrete to suppress that sought to prevent the information obtained in a search from being used against the defendant.see payton,at.torres,at.that is a distant cry from the relief warshak seeks today.
nor,for a separate reason,was it appropriate in this case to grant a preliminary injunction in favor of persons other than warshak.while district courts are not categorically prohibited from granting injunctive relief benefitting an entire class in an individual suit,such broad relief is rarely justified because injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.sharpe cureton,cir emphasis omitted.warshak did not seek relief,and he has made no or the injunction needed to run in favor of other individuals in order to protect him.
our reluctance to hypothesize how the government might conduct a conjectural search of warshak,then resolve the constitutionality of that search as well as any others the government might conduct under the statute,is reinforced by another reality the stored communications act has been in existence since and to our knowledge has not been the subject of any successful fourth amendment challenges,in any context,whether to d or to any other provision.if it is often true that reviewing legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function,texas,at.internal quotation marks omitted,the same is assuredly true when we have no precedent to guide us,raines,at.discretion,indeed,is the better part of valor.
there also is no meaningful risk of hardship to warshak of withholding court consideration.abbott,at.the prototypical case of hardship comes from the claimant who faces a choice between immediately complying with a burdensome law or risk ing serious criminal and civil penalties.id.at.compare id.with toilet goods,at.yet warshak faces no such conflict.the relevant provisions of the act do not require warshak to do anything.they do not force warshak to modify his behavior in order to avoid future adverse consequences,see ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d,or require warshak to engage in,or to refrain from,any conduct,see texas,at.because the act does not purport to regulate his primary conduct at all,much less impose criminal and civil penalties for,it does not put warshak in an untenable bind between undertaking an irreversible burden or risking criminal indictment.
hardship is difficult to maintain on this record for another reason.individuals subjected to allegedly unconstitutional searches and seizures have at least two alternatives short of a,facial attack on the enabling statute.they may file a motion to suppress in the event the government tries to use the evidence against them in a criminal prosecution.or they may file a or a bivens action against the officers who conducted the search.warshak filed a motion to suppress in his criminal case and,for reasons of his own,has not filed a bivens action.
warshak responds that these options will not allow him to obtain what he wants a constitutional ruling on the validity of d.as he sees it,the courts could apply the leon doctrine in denying his motion to suppress,see united states leon,d,and they could reject his bivens claim on the ground that the invalidity of the statute had not been clearly established.both rulings,he points out,would not generate a fourth amendment determination.even accepting for a moment warshak premise that one of the hardship concerns that may ripen a claim into a justiciable controversy is a litigant interest in obtaining a constitutional ruling,warshak is only half right.yes,leon permits courts to decide the question without determining whether the search was valid.see leon,at.illinois krull,d.and indeed,since the oral argument in this case,the district court has rejected warshak suppression motion solely on the ground that the officers acted in good faith.opinion and order,warshak,wl at.
but the same is not true of a bivens action.the court has insist ed on a strict order of engagement in bivens and actions,requiring courts to turn to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry and preventing them from skip ping ahead to the question whether the law clearly established that the officer conduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.saucier katz,d emphasis added.if a constitutional ruling is what warshak wanted,a bivens action would have given it to him.
but even if a bivens claim did not guarantee warshak the constitutional ruling he seeks,see scott harris,d saving for another day whether to reconsider the requirement that the constitutional issue must be resolved first in a or bivens action,that would not alter our conclusion.warshak offers no authority for the proposition that an claim may be entertained on the ground that it will facilitate a judicial ruling on the merits.and we doubt that any such authority exists.a central tenet of the requirement after all is that a general interest in a judicial ruling on the merits does not by itself confer jurisdiction on the federal courts.otherwise,a claimant interest in a judicial ruling itself would justify reaching the question,prematurely or not.and even if the supreme court were to permit lower courts to sidestep constitutional rulings in addressing motions to suppress and and bivens actions,that presumably would be because the court took the view that in some settings it did not make sense to decide constitutional questions prematurely.see scott.at.that of course is the same concern underlying the ripeness concern we would hardly respect by permitting such claims through,facial attacks instead.
also unavailing is warshak concern that,without a constitutional ruling,he will be exposed to future unconstitutional searches.that contention,as we have shown,turns on a long list of speculative the government will again seek to obtain his contents,even though he has already been indicted and convicted,it will choose to do so through d,as opposed to a search warrant or subpoena,a court will determine that the d requirements are met,the government will seek to invoke the provision and a court will find that notice of the search would imperil the existence of an investigation.that is not a plausible theory of hardship.
warshak also has argued on appeal that the act creates a chilling effect on his use of email.although a chilling effect might relax ripeness requirements in a first amendment case,see,anderson spear,cir,warshak never made a first amendment claim.the first time he claimed a chilling effect of any sort as to him was at oral argument before the en banc court.the only other chilling effect concern raised in the litigation was in his memorandum in support of a preliminary injunction,in which he alleged that denying the injunction would cause harm to others because it would have a chilling effect on the general public use of email as a form of communication because people and businesses would regard it as unsecured.ja.because warshak does not challenge the government action on first amendment grounds,this is a amendment case and the traditional ripeness requirements apply.rifle ass of am.magaw,cir.
the dissent makes two points that deserve a response that the court should reach the question that is on everyone mind the validity of the provision of the act,dissent at see id.why do today what can be done tomorrow,and that the court should contain its zeal to uphold the power of the government to intrude into the privacy of citizens,id.at,and that its decision is but another step in the ongoing degradation of civil rights in the courts of this country,id.at.
as a matter of efficiency,the dissent is quite right.the ripeness doctrine,like all limitations on the judicial power,prevents us from do ing today what can be done tomorrow and,in the process,prevents us from announcing interpretations of the constitution that some citizens and commentators may wish to hear today.but efficiency is not the only end of the constitution,and it is hardly a value that necessarily favors the promotion of civil rights,at least if history is any guide.see stanley illinois,d.whatever value efficiency has when it comes to the interpretation of constitutional rights,at any rate,that consideration must be balanced against other judicial values deciding constitutional questions correctly,which
