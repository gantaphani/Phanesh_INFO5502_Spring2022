ty,the manufacturer of beanie babies,the beanbag stuffed animals,brought this suit for trademark infringement against ruth perryman.perryman sells beanbag stuffed animals,primarily but not exclusively ty beanie babies,over the internet.her internet address domain name,a particular focus of ty concern,is.she has a web site where she advertises her wares.ty suit is based on the federal antidilution statute,c,which protects famous marks from commercial uses that cause dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.see nabisco,pf brands,cir.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ty and entered an injunction that forbids the defendant to use beanie or beanies or any colorable imitation thereof whether alone or in connection with other terms within any business name,internet domain name,or trademark,or in connection with any products.perryman appeal argues primarily that beanies has become a generic term for beanbag stuffed animals and therefore can not be appropriated as a trademark at all,and that in any event the injunction which has remained in effect during the appeal is overbroad.
the fundamental purpose of a trademark is to reduce consumer search costs by providing a concise and unequivocal identifier of the particular source of particular goods.the consumer who knows at a glance whose brand he is being asked to buy knows whom to hold responsible if the brand disappoints and whose product to buy in the future if the brand pleases.this in turn gives producers an incentive to maintain high and uniform quality,since otherwise the investment in their trademark may be lost as customers turn away in disappointment from the brand.a successful brand,however,creates an incentive in unsuccessful competitors to pass off their inferior brand as the successful brand by adopting a confusingly similar trademark,in effect appropriating the goodwill created by the producer of the successful brand.the traditional and still central concern of trademark law is to provide remedies against this practice.
confusion is not a factor here,however,with a minor exception discussed at the end of the opinion.perryman is not a competing producer of beanbag stuffed animals,and her web site clearly disclaims any affiliation with ty.but that does not get her off the hook.the reason is that state and now federal law also provides a remedy against the dilution of a trademark,though as noted at the outset of this opinion the federal statute is limited to the subset of famous trademarks and to dilutions of them caused by commercial uses that take place in interstate or foreign commerce.beanie babies,and beanies as the shortened form,are famous trademarks in the ordinary sense of the term everybody has heard of them they are truly prominent and renowned,in the words of professor mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,as distinguished from having a merely local celebrity.tcpip holding haar communications,cir.and while both this court and the third circuit have held,in opposition to the second circuit tcpip decision,that fame,though it can not be local,may be limited to niche markets,syndicate sales,hampshire paper,cir times mirror magazines,las vegas sports news,cir,this is not a conflict to worry over here ty trademarks are household words.and perryman use of these words was commercial in nature and took place in interstate commerce,and doubtless,given the reach of the aptly named world wide web,in foreign commerce as well.
but what is dilution there are at least three possibilities relevant to this case,each defined by a different underlying concern.first,there is concern that consumer search costs will rise if a trademark becomes associated with a variety of unrelated products.suppose an upscale restaurant calls itself tiffany.there is little danger that the consuming public will think it dealing with a branch of the tiffany jewelry store if it patronizes this restaurant.but when consumers next see the name tiffany they may think about both the restaurant and the jewelry store,and if so the efficacy of the name as an identifier of the store will be diminished.consumers will have to think as it were a higher imagination recognize the name as the name of the store.exxon exxene,cir mead data central,toyota motor sales,cir the legislative history of new york antidilution statute disclosed a need for legislation to prevent such hypothetical anomalies as dupont shoes,buick aspirin tablets,schlitz varnish,kodak pianos,bulova gowns mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,supra,to.so blurring is one form of dilution.
now suppose that the restaurant that adopts the name tiffany is actually a striptease joint.again,and indeed even more certainly than in the previous case,consumers will not think the striptease joint under common ownership with the jewelry store.but because of the inveterate tendency of the human mind to proceed by association,every time they think of the word tiffany their image of the fancy jewelry store will be tarnished by the association of the word with the strip joint.hormel foods jim henson productions,cir mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,supra.so tarnishment is a second form of dilution.analytically it is a subset of blurring,since it reduces the distinctness of the trademark as a signifier of the trademarked product or service.
third,and most in its implications for the scope of the concept of dilution,there is a possible concern with situations in which,though there is neither blurring nor tarnishment,someone is still taking a free ride on the investment of the trademark owner in the trademark.suppose the tiffany restaurant in our first hypothetical example is located in kuala lumpur and though the people who patronize it it is upscale have heard of the tiffany jewelry store,none of them is ever going to buy anything there,so that the efficacy of the trademark as an identifier will not be impaired.if appropriation of tiffany aura is nevertheless forbidden by an expansive concept of dilution,the benefits of the jewelry store investment in creating a famous name will be,as economists say,internalized that is,tiffany will realize the full benefits of the investment rather than sharing those benefits with as a result the amount of investing in creating a prestigious name will rise.
this rationale for antidilution law has not yet been articulated in or even implied by the case law,although a few cases suggest that the concept of dilution is not exhausted by blurring and tarnishment,see panavision int l,toeppen,cir intermatic,toeppen,rhee,han ah reum,d,and the common law doctrine of misappropriation might conceivably be invoked in support of the rationale that we have sketched.see rochelle cooper dreyfuss roberta rosenthal kwall,intellectual property cases and materials on trademark,copyright and patent law.the validity of the rationale may be doubted,however.the number of prestigious names is so vast and,as important,would be even if there were no antidilution laws that it is unlikely that the owner of a prestigious trademark could obtain substantial license fees if commercial use of the mark without his consent were forbidden despite the absence of consumer confusion,blurring,or tarnishment.competition would drive the fee to zero since,if the name is being used in an unrelated market,virtually every prestigious name will be a substitute for every other in that market.
none of the rationales we have canvassed supports ty position in this case.perryman is not producing a product,or a service,such as dining at a restaurant,that is distinct from any specific product rather,she is selling the very product to which the trademark sought to be defended against her infringement is attached.you ca sell a branded product without using its brand name,that is,its trademark.supposing that perryman sold only beanie babies a potentially relevant qualification,as we see,we would find it impossible to understand how she could be thought to be blurring,tarnishing,or otherwise free riding to any significant extent on ty investment in its mark.to say she was would amount to saying that if a used car dealer truthfully advertised
