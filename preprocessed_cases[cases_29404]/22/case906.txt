in this case we hold that a city is not subject to suit for damages or an injunction for offering unrestricted access to the internet through computers at a public library.
this case was filed against respondent city of livermore by appellant kathleen individually,and in her capacities as a taxpayer and as guardian ad litem for brandon,her minor son.the amended complaint includes causes of action for waste of public funds,nuisance,premises liability,and denial of substantive due process hereafter.respondent demurrer was sustained without leave to amend on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,and the case was dismissed.
respondent library has computers linked to the internet,which patrons of any age are free to use.brandon went to the computers without appellant knowledge and downloaded sexually explicit photos from the internet onto a floppy disk that he brought to the library.without any adult knowledge or permission brandon printed the photos at a relative computer.he engaged in this activity on about occasions.appellant alleges that the photos brandon obtained are harmful to minors and that some of them are obscene.one of the photos is reproduced in color on the first page of the complaint and others are attached as exhibits.in one of the exhibits a middle school schedule is superimposed over the image of a scantily clad woman.brandon showed the photos to other minors.
a copy of the internet access policy adopted by respondent library board of trustees is attached to the complaint.this policy states in part the board of trustees supports the idea that all members of the community have free and equal access to the entire range of library resources,regardless of content,approach,format or amount of detail.these rights extend to all users of the public library including minors the internet and its available resources may contain materials of a controversial nature.the livermore public library does not monitor and has no control over the information accessed through the internet and can not be held responsible for its content library patrons use the internet at their own risk individuals must accept responsibility for determining what is appropriate.the library upholds and affirms the right of each individual to have access to constitutionally protected materials and also affirms the right and responsibility of parents to determine and monitor their children use of library materials and resources.parents and guardians are encouraged to work closely with their children.parents are expected to monitor and supervise children use of the internet in selecting material that is consistent with personal and family values.the livermore public library does not provide this monitoring or supervision.the policy lists examples of unacceptable use of computers,including use for other than educational,informational and recreational purposes,or for unauthorized,illegal or unethical purposes.
in her state law claims appellant alleges that respondent is wasting public funds on computers that provide access to obscenity and matter harmful to minors it is a public nuisance for respondent to knowingly allow its computers to be used to access obscenity and matter harmful to minors and the library is unsafe for minors because the computers provide them with access to harmful matter.the section claim alleges that minors are expected to go to the library to complete public school assignments the library encourages minors to use its computers the library has a policy of allowing minors to view and download obscenity and pornography on the computers minors exposed to obscenity and pornography suffer emotional and psychological damage and damage to their nervous systems respondent knows its actions and policies are placing minors at grave risk of harm and respondent tries to keep parents ignorant of that risk.
all of appellant causes of action seek injunctive relief.the state claims seek to enjoin respondent from acquiring or maintaining computers which allow people to access obscenity or minors to access harmful sexual matter from maintaining any premises where minors have that ability and from expending public funds on such computers.the section claim is to enjoin respondent from knowingly and intentionally allowing its computers to display obscene and pornographic images where brandon and other children can view them.the nuisance and premises liability claims also request declarations that respondent is liable for all future damages appellant children suffer from sexual and other material harmful to minors they access at library computers connected to the internet.
ii.discussion 
a public library is in a damned if you do,damned if you do situation in deciding whether to restrict access to the internet from its computers to prevent harm to minors.a case in virginia shows that the library can be sued if it limits internet access mainstream loudoun bd.of trustees of loudoun d loudoun ii use of filtering software violated first amendment this case shows that the library can be sued if it does not.this case,unlike the virginia one,is untenable.the state law claims in this case are preempted by federal law,and there is no entitlement to relief under section.
state law causes of action 
the state causes of action are precluded by title united states code section.section c states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.this provision prohibits hold ing interactive computer services liable for their failure to edit,withhold or restrict access to offensive material disseminated through their medium.blumenthal drudge.this prohibition was enacted to promote the continued development of the internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media,and to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the internet and other interactive computer services,unfettered by federal or state regulation.b,see blumenthal drudge,supra.at.thus,b y its plain language,c creates a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service.zeran america online,cir,see also ben ezra,weinstein,america online cir.
respondent is entitled to that immunity here.an interactive computer service is any information service,system,or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,including specifically a service or system that provides access to the internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.f,italics added.respondent provides an interactive computer service in this case because its library computers enable multiple users to access the internet.respondent is not an information content provider in this case because it is not responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of any of the harmful matter accessible through its computers.f.
appellant contends that section c immunity does not extend to governmental entities.nothing in the text or stated purposes of that provision supports this argument.the argument rests on mainstream loudoun board of trustees of loudoun d loudoun i.in that case,a public library board of trustees was alleged to have violated the first amendment rights of adult patrons by installing filtering software on library computers to block internet sites which contained matter harmful to minors.the board claimed immunity under section c,a different immunity than the one asserted here.unlike the immunity here,the immunity claimed in loudoun i conflicted with section stated purposes.also,appellant reading of loudoun i is belied by the court subsequent opinion in loudoun ii.for all of these reasons appellant reliance on loudoun i is misplaced.
the immunity provision at issue in loudoun i reads as follows no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of a any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,excessively violent,harassing,or otherwise objectionable,whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.c.this immunity has nothing to do with this case,where the claims are that respondent unlawfully failed to restrict access to obscene and harmful matter.loudoun i held that this immunity did not extend to the plaintiffs first amendment claim because was enacted to minimize state regulation of internet speech was not enacted to insulate government regulation of internet speech from judicial review.loudoun i,supra,d at.
this sentence in loudoun i discussion of section c a immunity can not be stretched to deprive governmental entities of immunity under section c.section c immunity serves rather than undermines the purpose of minimizing state regulation of internet speech insofar as it precludes claims based on public entities failure to undertake that regulation.thus,the rationale for the denial of immunity in loudoun i has no application in this case moreover,the court noted that its holding in loudoun i would have been the same e ven if were construed to apply to public libraries.loudoun i,supra,d at.thus,any suggestion in loudoun i that section could never be applied to public libraries would have been dicta.in any event,there can be no doubt that the loudoun court thought that public libraries could claim immunity under section c because the court ventured in loudoun ii that this immunity should alleviate any concern the library might have had with potential criminal liability.loudoun ii,supra,d at,fn.we therefore reject appellant argument based entirely on loudoun i that defendant has no immunity because it is a governmental entity.
appellant contends that section can not be interpreted to confer immunity in this case because her claims are consistent with the aims of congress in passing that law.appellant notes that title united states code section was enacted along with section as part of the communications decency act of,and submits that certain of section provisions addressed the same concerns as her lawsuit.appellant refers to section d b,which made it a crime to use any interactive computer service to display in a manner available to a person under years of age,any comment,request,suggestion,proposal,image,or other communication that,in context,depicts or describes,in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,sexual or excretory activities or organs,regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the communication,and section d,which made it a crime to knowingly permit any telecommunications facility under one control to be used for such activity with the intent that it be used for such activity.
appellant acknowledges that these criminal laws were struck down on first amendment grounds in reno american civil liberties union,d.however,she argues that these laws show what congress meant when it stipulated that n othing in section shall be construed to prevent any state from enforcing any state law that is consistent with this section.e.appellant reasons that because section e likewise directs that n othing in this section shall be construed to impair the enforcement of section or any other federal criminal statute,and because her lawsuit like section seeks to prevent the distribution and display of obscene pornography to minors,section can not properly be interpreted to preclude her state law claims.
the problem with this line of argument is that this is not a criminal case.at most,the statutes appellant cites raise the issue of whether section prevents enforcement of state laws pertaining to criminal conduct,an issue not presented by the allegations of the complaint in this civil case.appellant attempts to raise this issue in her briefs with charges and hypotheticals involving intentional provision of obscene pornography to minors.appellant asserts that it is not the providing of unrestricted internet access which is the problem it is the provision of obscene pornography to children.appellant likens the library conduct to set ting up a display of obscene images and inviting minors to view them.appellant asks us to imagine an adult enticing minors to view obscene images he had called up on a library computer screen,and suggests that to grant the library immunity here would insulate this adult from criminal prosecution or liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress.appellant describes this result as patently absurd and hardly what congress intended.the man wrong exists not in creating or distributing the images but in choosing to publicly exhibit them to impressionable youngsters.it is no different with the library which knowingly allows minors to access obscenity on its premises and,when asked,would even facilitate them doing so with help.according to appellant briefs,the library is giv ing operating instructions on how to call up harmful images.
this conduct described in the briefs is not alleged in the amended complaint.when a case has been dismissed for failure to state a cause of action,all properly pled material facts are accepted as true.blank kirwan cal d.we must thus assume,as the complaint alleges,that respondent purchases and maintains computers which it knows can and have been used by library patrons,including minors,to access and display material which is obscene and harmful to minors.we can not assume that respondent librarians exhibit obscenity or other matter harmful to minors,or that they help minors use the library computers to access those materials,because that conduct is not alleged either expressly or by reasonable implication in the complaint.see ibid.complaint must be given a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.
any such implication would be contrary to the library policy attached to the complaint,which among other things prohibits the use of computer resources for illegal purposes.see,subd.a prohibiting exhibition of harmful matter to minors.consistent with the library stated mission of encouraging children to develop a lifelong interest in learning,the library presumably seeks to impart the e lectronic information research skills the policy deems increasingly important to students and others.librarians can not be prosecuted for providing such instruction,moore younger d,and we can not presume that such instruction would include lessons on finding obscenity or other harmful matter on the internet.such lessons would not further the library stated mission,and would not be consistent with its policy that computers are to be used only for educational,informational and recreational purposes.
at various points in her arguments appellant suggests that respondent can be held liable for providing obscene pornography to minors,even if librarians themselves do not actually exhibit such matter to minors or teach them how to access it,merely because of the ease with which such images can be obtained from the internet.in reno american civil liberties union,supra,at page,the court recognized that s exually explicit material on the internet includes text,pictures,and chat and extends from the modestly titillating to the.it may be accessed either deliberately or unintentionally during the course of an imprecise search.however,the court found that users seldom encounter such content accidentally.almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to content.for that reason,the odds are slim that a user would enter a sexually explicit site by accident.id.at.here,it is not alleged that brandon stumbled across anything harmful by accident.nevertheless,appellant has likened library computers to a machine where you push a red button,and obscene pornography appears on the screen.appellant briefs represent that an impressionable child need only type the word girl into a library computer and click thrice to view obscene perversions of the darkest order.appellant has advised that she has experts who can demonstrate it so easy to obtain obscene pornography from library terminals in the city o
