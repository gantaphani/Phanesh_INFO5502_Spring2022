mangosoft,and mangosoft corporation collectively,mangosoft appeal from a final judgment of the district court following a summary judgment order holding that oracle corporation oracle did not infringe mangosoft patent the patent.mangosoft,oracle,d summary judgment opinion.because mangosoft arguments on appeal relate solely to claim construction,and because we find no error in the district court construction of the sole claim term raised on appeal,we affirm.
background 
mangosoft owns the patent,which relates to computer networking systems and methods that provide shared memory systems and services.patent.specifically,the patent discloses systems that can create and manage a virtual memory space that can be shared by each computer on a network and can span the storage space of each memory device connected to the network.id.in contrast to traditional networks,where servers with significant memory capacity served as central repositor ies of network data,id,the patent describes a system that pools together the storage capacity of individual computers or nodes on the network to form a virtual memory space,see id.thus,the disclosed storage system emphasizes decentralized storage,which leverages the storage capacity of individual client computers by allowing all of the nodes of the network to contribute portions of their local persistent,hard disk storage and volatile,ram memory to a virtual pool of storage and memory accessible by the entire network.
in,mangosoft filed suit against oracle and accused oracle real applications clusters rac software,sold in conjunction with its and database software,of infringing a total of claims of both the patent and a related patent.oracle counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity,unenforceability,and.in,the district court construed several disputed claim terms after holding a markman hearing.with respect to the term local,it held that 
the word local when used to modify a computer device means a computer device,a hard drive that is directly attached to a single computer processor by,for example,the computer bus.
mangosoft,oracle,wl,slip op.at,claim construction opinion noting additionally that a hard disk that is local to one computer may also be shared with,or accessed by,other computers on the network.the district court distinguished local memory devices from shared,networked,or remote memory devices,and rejected mangosoft request to construe local to simply requir e a computer memory device that is somehow linked to a computer whether directly or indirectly.id.at noting that such a construction would render the term local superfluous or redundant in light of claim requirement that local memory devices be coupled to a computer.
following this order,mangosoft amended its list of asserted claims to allege infringement only of claims,and of the patent.the parties then filed for summary judgment on the issues of infringement,invalidity,and unenforceability of the patent.summary judgment opinion at.the district court concluded that,as a matter of law,oracle did not infringe any of the asserted claims the court left most of the invalidity and inequitable conduct issues unresolved.id.at.in so holding,the district court agreed with oracle that the memory space shared in rac clusters does not span local persistent memory devices.id.at.approximately one year later,the district court dismissed oracle counterclaim without prejudice,and entered judgment of in favor of oracle.mangosoft,oracle,d.mangosoft timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
this appeal presents a question of claim construction involving a single claim term.the parties arguments turn on the singular issue of what it means for a storage device,such as a hard disk,to be local to a particular computer,or node,in a computer network.mangosoft contends that in construing the claim term local,the district court improperly imported what mangosoft characterizes as the direct and unique connection limitations.see claim construction opinion at requiring that local memory devices be directly attached to a single computer processor emphases added.it argues that the district court derived these limitations solely from a technical dictionary definition proffered by oracle,although this dictionary was not cited by the district court.see id.at.mangosoft contends that a local memory device should be construed as a memory device that can be contributed to the shared addressable memory space by a particular node.oracle responds that the claim language,specification,prosecution history,and reliable extrinsic evidence support the district court construction.we agree with oracle.
mangosoft relies heavily on the fact that the district court opinion preceded phillips awh,en banc,and principally argues that the result was improperly influenced by references made by the parties to a technical dictionary.mangosoft position is misplaced for several reasons and places undue weight on what it contends was the district court reliance on the texas digital methodology.see generally phillips,at discussing.digital,telegenix.first,while there is no question that dictionaries were considered,even phillips recognized that reference to such sources is not prohibited so long as the ultimate construction given to the claims in question is grounded in the intrinsic evidence and not based upon definitions considered in the abstract.phillips,at noting that dictionaries,and especially technical dictionaries,endeavor to collect the accepted meanings of terms used in various fields of science and technology and thus have been properly recognized as among the many tools that can assist the court in determining the meaning of particular terminology to those of skill in the art of the invention see also acumed llc stryker,although in phillips we rejected an approach in which a broad dictionary definition is adopted and then whittled down only if contradicted by the specification,we did not prohibit the use of dictionaries in claim construction,nor did we define at what point in the claim construction analysis they may be consulted.internal citation omitted old town canoe confluence holdings,the district court reference to the dictionary was not an improper attempt to find meaning in the abstract divorced from the context of the intrinsic record but properly was a starting point in its analysis,which was centered around the intrinsic record consistent with phillips.second,we review judgments,not opinions,and need not focus on the methodology used by the district court.interactive gift express,compuserve,noting the familiar principle that this court does not review supporting arguments,but only the decisions reached by the trial court citing stratoflex,aeroquip,see also acumed,at our de novo review means that we need not decide whether the logic or subsidiary definitions used by the district court to reach the correct construction were sound we review only the district court finished product,not its process.finally,even though the district court did not have the benefit of phillips at the time of its decision,the court claim construction is fully consistent with and supported by the intrinsic well as the thus fully comports with our precedent.we begin with the language of the claims.
the district court construction of the term local is consistent with the language of claim.the same can not be said for mangosoft position.mangosoft construction would read local to mean something beyond the breadth of anything in the claims or the specification by giving that term attributes of control.the problem is that nothing in the intrinsic record describes or supports such an expansive meaning.moreover,the broader construction proffered by mangosoft a memory device that can be contributed to the shared addressable memory space by a particular node would render the claim term local superfluous.this was recognized by the district court.see claim construction opinion at.claim requires that each local persistent memory device be coupled to a computer comprising a node on the network and that the shared addressable memory space be mapped across said plurality of local persistent
