on summary judgment,the united states district court for the district of delaware held patent the patent,the patent,the patent,and the patent invalid as anticipated by sri international,sri own prior art publication live traffic analysis of gateways live traffic.sri int l,internet sec,d.the district court also granted summary judgment of invalidity of the patent as anticipated by a paper entitled emerald event monitoring enabling responses to anomalous live disturbances emerald.id.because the district court correctly determined that the emerald paper anticipated the patent,this court affirms that decision.however,due to genuine issues of material fact about the public accessibility of the live traffic paper,this court vacates and remands the district court other determination.
sri owns the,the,the,and the patents.the sri patents relate to cyber security and intrusion detection.specifically,the patents describe a method of hierarchical event monitoring and analysis within an enterprise network including deploying network monitors in the enterprise network,detecting,by the network monitors,suspicious network activity based on analysis of network traffic data.patent abstract.all four patents originated from a november,application by inventors phillip porras and alfonso valdes.
sri had done considerable research on network intrusion detection.in fact,sri event monitoring enabling responses to anomalous live disturbances emerald project attracted considerable attention in this art field.sri first received funding for the emerald project in august and almost immediately began publicizing emerald at a workshop in november.in june,sri posted an emerald paper on its sri file transfer protocol ftp server.in october,sri presented emerald at the national information systems security conference.the conference published the article.
the emerald paper contains a detailed description of a tool for tracking malicious activity across large networks.furthermore,the emerald paper discusses sri early research in intrusion detection expert system ides technology.the paper then explains the development of the next generation ides nides.this technology uses a wide range of multivariate statistical measures to profile user behavior and detect anomalies in network traffic.the emerald paper describes the use of nides to detect network anomalies.emerald also teaches signature analysis,among other analysis engines.the emerald paper and the specification contain some overlapping material.for instance,both the patent specification and the emerald article feature two nearly identical figures.figures and in the emerald paper are nearly identical to figures and from the patent,shown below.
patent specification 
the emerald paper and the patent specification also share overlapping text.the paper and the specification contain similar descriptions of the nides algorithm for statistical detection.the paper also discusses changes to the algorithm to accommodate network traffic.sri int l,d at.specifically,emerald and the patent both state 
profiles are provided to the computational engine as classes defined in the resource object.the mathematical functions for anomaly scoring,profile maintenance,and updating do not require knowledge of the data being analyzed beyond what is encoded in the profile class.event collection interoperability supports translation of the event stream to the profile and measure classes.at that point,analysis for different types of monitored entities is mathematically similar.this approach imparts great flexibility to the analysis in that fading memory constants,update frequency,measure type,and so on are tailored to the network entity being monitored.
sri int l,d at fn.patent ii.
during prosecution of the patent,sri disclosed the emerald paper in its information disclosure statement,listing the paper in the patent other publications section.the trial court found that sri does not argue that the emerald paper fails to disclose each of the limitations of the asserted claims of the patent.id.at.instead,sri contends that the emerald paper is not an enabling disclosure with respect to the patent.on this basis,sri challenges the district court grant of summary judgment.
b.the live traffic paper 
the inventors drafted the live traffic paper based on the emerald project.porras and valdes authored the paper in.sri displayed the paper on its web site on november.the four patents in this case incorporate the paper by reference.furthermore,sri listed the live traffic paper in its information disclosure to the government agency that funded some of sri cyber security research.
sri filed its patent application on november,one day before the critical date of november.the live traffic paper,as published in the december,proceedings of the symposium on network and distributed systems security sndss,was cited in the information disclosure statement of the.
the internet society isoc posted the sndss call for papers on its web site.the call for papers stated that all submissions were to be made via electronic mail by august,with a backup submission sent by postal mail.the call for papers announcement did not include any information on confidentiality of paper submissions.on august,porras sent an email to bishop,the program chair for sndss,in response to the sndss call for papers.porras attached the live traffic paper to his email.porras stated that sri would make a copy of the live traffic paper available on the sri ftp server as a backup.he included the specific ftp address,ftp,in the email.
the following listings show an index of the sri ftp server 
the record reflects seven instances in which porras previously directed people to the emerald subdirectory to find other papers related to the emerald project.in four instances,porras provided the full path and filename of the paper.in every instance,porras directed the people to a specific paper,which included the term emerald in the filename.sri brought an action against defendants internet security systems,iss and symantec corporation symantec for infringement of the,the,the,and the patents.defendants moved for summary judgment that each of the four is invalid under b.the live traffic paper served as the prior art for the summary judgment motion.defendants also moved for partial summary judgment that the emerald paper was enabling and thus constituted anticipatory prior art.
sri countered with a motion for partial summary judgment that the live traffic paper did not qualify as a printed publication under b.sri also moved for partial summary judgment that the emerald paper did not anticipate.
the district court ruled that the live traffic paper was a printed publication that anticipated all asserted claims of the four.the trial court also determined that the emerald paper was enabling and anticipated the patent.sri appeals the district court grant of summary judgment of invalidity as to the live traffic paper and the emerald paper.this court has jurisdiction under a.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment without deference,reapplying the same standard as the district court.bruckelmyer ground heaters.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.id.whether an anticipatory document qualifies as a printed publication under is a legal conclusion based on underlying factual determinations.cooper cameron kvaerner oilfield.
as a matter of law,this court must review the decision that the emerald publication disclosed sufficient information to enable use of this prior art to invalidate the patent.the trial court determined that the emerald paper anticipated the patent,rendering the patent invalid under b.a patent claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found,either expressly or inherently described,in a single prior art reference.verdegaal union oil of.
sri does not argue that the emerald paper fails to disclose each of the limitations of the asserted claims of the patent.rather,sri asserts that emerald can not anticipate claim of the patent because it does not provide an enabling disclosure of the claimed invention.sri int l,d at.the standard for enablement of a prior art reference for purposes of anticipation under section differs from the enablement standard under.novo nordisk,biotechnology.significantly,this court has stated that anticipation does not require actual performance of suggestions in a disclosure.rather,anticipation only requires that those suggestions be enabled to one of skill in the art.id.internal quote from squibb ben venue labs.
on summary judgment,the district court found that no reasonable jury could conclude that the emerald paper was a proposal or an intent to try statistical profiling of network traffic.sri int l,d at.the district court finds the similarity in disclosure between emerald and the specification of the patent convincing with respect to enablement.id.at.thus,if the specification of the patent was sufficient to enable the claims of that patent,so,too,is the description of emerald.id.citing in re epstein.besides the similarities between the disclosures,the district court accepted sri broad construction of statistical detection method to encompass any method of detecting suspicious activity by applying one or more statistical functions to analyze network traffic data.sri int l,d at.because sri asserted that a variety of statistical functions fall within the scope of the patent,the district court found that a person of ordinary skill in the art would find the emerald paper enabling with respect to the invention.id.the district court clarified that a person of ordinary skill in this art field would have a background in computer science,electrical engineering,or computer engineering as well as knowledge of cyber and internet security.id.at.
sri asserts that the emerald paper is not an enabling disclosure and does not anticipate the claims of the patent because implementing the emerald concepts required extensive and undue experimentation.in particular,sri points to the declaration of one of the inventors,porras,that the paper was completed just at the outset of the emerald project.after the paper,sri itself engaged in a great deal of time,effort,and research before achieving a workable system.kesidis,sri expert,also explained that the emerald paper was a mere statement of intent to try several prior art techniques and would not have enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to make a functional system.
the defendants respond that one of ordinary skill in the art,without undue experimentation,could have combined the teachings in emerald with general knowledge in the art to practice the invention using any species of the statistical detection method.see elan,mayo.furthermore,the defendants contend that substantial evidence from a number of different sources,including references in the patent,confirmed that statistical detection methods were known in the art and used to analyze network traffic data.see,valdes,et,statistical methods for computer usage anomaly detection using nides intrusion detection expert system,international workshop on rough sets and soft computing,san jose,ca,as listed in the other publications section of the patent.in sum,the defendants contend that a person of ordinary skill in the art was capable of applying a statistical methodology in the analysis of network traffic data before the date of the claimed invention.
this court discerns that the district court correctly determined that the emerald paper enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to practice the claimed invention.based on the patent specification,the emerald paper,and the record before the district court,no reasonable jury could conclude that the emerald paper did not enable statistical profiling of network traffic.
both the patent specification and the emerald paper contain similar sections explaining statistical detection.for example,both the specification and the publication contain similar descriptions of the use of nides algorithms for statistical detection.furthermore,the identical figures are a graphical depiction of a network monitor to scrutinize an event stream and a diagram of a resource object that configure the network monitor.these figures show an architecture for network monitoring based on a profile engine and configurable event structures sufficient to enable one skilled in the art.
indeed,these disclosures helped the inventors obtain issuance of the patent.the issuance itself shows that the specification satisfied the enablement requirements of.with the paper providing similar,or even a partially identical,disclosure to the patent specification,the record meets the lower enablement standard for prior art under b.thus,the publication with its similarities in technical scope and description to the specification of the patent meets the enabling hurdle for a prior art reference.see constant advanced,the disclosure in exhibit is at least at the same level of technical detail as the disclosure in the patent.if disclosure of a computer program is essential for an anticipating reference,then the disclosure in the patent would fail to satisfy the enablement requirement of,first.
kesidis testimony is not sufficient to overcome the weight of evidence that the emerald paper offers an enabling disclosure for b.his testimony contains only generalized conclusions without any analysis regarding the alleged differences between the patent disclosure and the emerald paper.in short,kesidis just restated sri position.as such,sri only semblance of possible evidence to show a lack of an enabling disclosure in the emerald paper was not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.therefore,this court affirms the district court ruling,as a matter of law,of invalidity of the patent as anticipated by the emerald paper.
b.the live traffic paper 
this court must determine the accessibility to the public of the live traffic paper before the critical date.if this paper qualifies as prior art,the parties agree that its disclosure renders the asserted patents,and invalid under b.the printed publication bar states a person shall be entitled to a patent unless b the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country,more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states b emphasis added.the bar is grounded on the principle that once an invention is in the public domain,it is no longer patentable by anyone.application of bayer.
because there are many ways in which a reference may be disseminated to the interested public,public accessibility has been called the touchstone in determining whether a reference constitutes a printed publication bar under b.in re hall,emphasis added.a given reference is publicly accessible upon a satisfactory showing that such document has been disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject matter or art exercising reasonable diligence,can locate it.bruckelmyer ground heaters.the decision whether a particular reference is a printed publication must be approached on a basis.in re cronyn,internal quote from in re hall,see also in re wyer,decision in this field of statutory construction and application must proceed on a basis.
the district court granted summary judgment of invalidity under b as to all four.the district court based its summary judgment ruling on its interpretation of the evidentiary record.according to the district court,the evidentiary record indicates that the ftp site was publicly accessible.sri int l,d at.furthermore,the district court determined that the evidence clearly showed porras provided this aforementioned ftp site to other members of the intrusion detection community both in presentations and via email.id.the district court thus determined that sri ftp server directory structure gave access to the article to a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.in the district court view,one of ordinary skill would know that the sri ftp server contained information on the emerald project and therefore would navigate through the folders to find the live traffic paper.id.
sri asserted that,as a matter of law,the file on sri ftp server containing the live traffic paper fell short of a publication under b.sri contends that the live traffic paper sent to bishop via email and placed on the ftp server for as a backup to this email was a private prepublication communication.sri also asserts that the district court misread this court jurisprudence with respect to the ability of a person of ordinary skill to navigate the ftp server directory structure to find the live traffic paper.sri contends that the file name of the live traffic paper was not indexed or catalogued in any meaningful way to enable a person of ordinary skill to locate the paper.
the defendants assert that the district court properly applied this court printed publication case law in finding that the live traffic paper was publicly accessible before the critical date.the defendants point out that posting the live traffic paper to a publicly accessible ftp server made the paper publicly available to persons interested and skilled in the art.furthermore,posting to a publicly accessible ftp server could not constitute a private transmission as alleged by sri.
after review of the record,this court perceives factual issues that prevent entry of summary judgment of invalidity based on the live traffic paper.specifically,this court does not find enough evidence in the record to show that the live traffic paper was publicly accessible and thus a printed publication under b.
this court case law has discussed public accessibility under b,in one line of cases illustrating a lack of public accessibility and in another line of cases pointing out public accessibility.for instance,application of bayer and in re cronyn illustrate situations that do not warrant a finding of public accessibility.in re wyer,in re klopfenstein and the recently decided bruckelmyer ground heaters,on the other hand,illustrate situations that found public accessibility.
from the perspective of cases lacking public accessibility,bayer featured a graduate thesis in a university library.the library had not catalogued or placed the thesis on the shelves.only three faculty members even knew about the thesis.application of bayer.under these circumstances,this court predecessor found that the thesis did not constitute a printed publication because a customary search would not have rendered the work reasonably accessible even to a person informed of its existence.id.at.similarly,in in re cronyn,the thesis document was in a library with an alphabetical index by the author name.this court found no public accessibility because the only research aid in finding the theses was the student name,which of course,bears no relationship to the subject of the student thesis.in re cronyn.
several cases have also illustrated situations that rendered documents available to the public.for example,in wyer,an australian patent application was laid open to the public and properly classified,indexed or abstracted to enable public access to the application.in re wyer.wyer explained various factors involved in the public accessibility determination,including intent to publicize and disseminating activities.still the court emphasized each printed publication case must be decided on the basis of its own facts.id.at.in klopfenstein,two professional conferences displayed posters.these posters were printed publications because their entire purpose was public communication of the relevant information.in re klopfenstein.and,most recently,in bruckelmyer,this court found that a canadian patent application,properly abstracted,indexed and catalogued,was a printed publication under b.this court explained t he canadian patent was classified and indexed,similar to the abstract in wyer,further providing a road map that would have allowed one skilled in the art to locate the patent application.bruckelmyer ground heaters.
based on this appeal record,this case falls somewhere between bayer and klopfenstein.like the uncatalogued thesis placed in the library in the bayer case,the live traffic paper was placed on the ftp server.yet,the ftp server did not contain an index or catalogue or other tools for customary and meaningful research.neither the directory structure nor the readme file in the pub subdirectory identifies the location of papers or explains the mnemonic structure for files in the emerald subdirectory,or any subdirectory for that matter.in fact,the emerald subdirectory does not contain a readme file.further,the summary judgment record shows that only one person,bishop,specifically knew about the availability of the live traffic paper,similar to the knowledge of the thesis availability by the three professors in bayer.
the record on summary judgment does not show that an anonymous user skilled in the art in would have gained access to the ftp server and would have freely navigated through the directory structure to find the live traffic paper.to the contrary,the paper author,porras,thought it necessary to provide bishop with the full ftp address for the file.surely bishop,the program chair for sndss,would have qualified as one of ordinary skill in the art in.yet,despite his knowledge of the field,ftp servers,and the paper,bishop apparently would not have found the reference without porras precise directions.it is doubtful that anyone outside the review committee looking for papers submitted to the internet society symposium would search a subfolder of an sri ftp server.these are separate entities.it is also doubtful that anyone outside the review committee would have been aware of the paper or looked for it at all in early august.these facts seem to militate against a finding of public accessibility.at least they warrant examination upon remand.
in one respect,the public accessibility factors are less compelling for the live traffic paper than they were for the thesis in bayer.in bayer,the thesis was complete and ready for public consumption,while the live traffic paper was still subject to review.the live traffic paper was not a finished thesis,but was posted on the ftp server solely to facilitate peer review in preparation for later publication.
on the other hand,similar to the posters in klopfenstein,the live traffic paper was posted on an open ftp server and might have been available to anyone with ftp and knowledge of the emerald subdirectory.unlike the posters hung at a conference in klopfenstein,the live traffic paper was not publicized or placed in front of the interested public.in effect,the live traffic paper on the ftp server was most closely analogous to placing posters at an unpublicized conference with no attendees.the live traffic paper,like posters at a vacant and unpublicized conference,was available by being posted,but available only to a person who may have wandered into the conference by happenstance or knew about the conference via unpublicized means.indeed the record does not show that anyone accessed the live traffic paper via the ftp server during the seven days in which it was posted.while actual retrieval of a publication is not a requirement for public accessibility,this record does not evince that the live traffic paper was accessible to anyone other than the committee,thus further suggesting an absence of actual public accessibility.see constant advanced.
the record reflects seven instances in which porras previously directed people to the subdirectory to find other papers related to the emerald project.in four instances,porras provided the full path and filename of the paper,presumably to provide an adequate research aid for a user to locate the paper.in every instance,porras directed the people to a specific paper,which included the term emerald in the filename.in this case,there was no such specific direction,and the filename did not mimic the subdirectory or publicized project name.thus,the record offers no suggestion that because people had been told that they could find other papers in the past in the subdirectory,they there for an unpublicized paper with a relatively obscure filename.
the current record leaves the live traffic paper on the bayer side of this principle,not on the klopfenstein side of public accessibility.therefore,on summary judgment,this court finds that the prepublication live traffic paper,though on the ftp server,was not catalogued or indexed in a meaningful way and not intended for dissemination to the public.see in re wyer,application of bayer,in re klopfenstein.
the ftp server directory structure of a institution in the intrusion detection community and the acronym of might have hinted at the path to the live traffic paper however,an unpublicized paper with an acronym file name posted on an ftp server resembles a poster at an unpublicized conference without a conference index of the location of the various poster presentations.as noted,the feature also suggests no intent to publicize.without additional evidence as to the details of the sri ftp server accessibility,this court vacates and remands for a more thorough determination of the publicity accessibility of the live traffic paper based on additional evidence and in concert with this opinion.
conclusion 
this court affirms the district court grant of summary judgment as to the invalidity of the patent based on the emerald paper.however,this court vacates and remands the district court summary judgment ruling of invalidity based on the live traffic paper because of genuine issues of fact about public accessibility.

the majority concludes without any evidence or support in the record that the ftp server did not contain an index or catalogue or other tools for customary and meaningful research.op.at.i agree with the district court that all of the evidence of record supports the conclusion that the navigable directory structure of the ftp server rendered the live traffic paper publicly accessible.the subject matter of this publication is complex computer software technology on computer detection.there is no dispute that the ordinarily skilled artisan is quite computer savvy.sri,d at.the defendants introduced evidence indicating that the version of the ftp server had navigable directories and subdirectories exactly the same as the version of the ftp server.

this record evidence supports the district court conclusion that the ftp server was widely known and easily navigable.sri presents no evidence to the contrary.in fact,sri primary argument on appeal was 
but most importantly,there was no evidence that in,at the time the draft was supposedly placed on the server for one week,sri ftp server was structured to allow an anonymous user to navigate through directories and subdirectories to find a specific file without knowing its specific,complete address.
in fact,as the defendants point out,sri presents no evidence that any ftp server was not navigable in.see oral arg.at,available at.in contrast,the defendants presented evidence that the ftp server was navigable in which sri does not dispute,and the emails and presentations indicate that the ftp server was similarly navigable in.in fact in the december,email,porras directed lunt to and told her to go to the pub directory.if this ftp server was not navigable,this email would be meaningless.moreover,sri never responds to the evidence indicating widespread use of the ftp server by the cyber security community at the relevant time including citations,and evidence that the ftp server was referenced seventy times by individuals on google groups and other newsgroup forums.sri,d at.sri does not respond to the fact that many of the usenet references from just cite the ftp server leaving individuals to navigate to the material of interest see oral arg.at,available at.mp.in the face of all this evidence,sri offers nothing other than a hollow claim that defendants did not prove it navigable in.it must also be acknowledged that this ftp server was at all times within sri control.hence,if contrary to all the evidence,it was not navigable in,sri should be able to proffer some proof.
in light of the mountain of evidence presented by the defendants and the complete absence of any contrary evidence presented by sri,the district court determination that the ftp server was publicly accessible by virtue of the navigable directory structure must be affirmed.
i agree with the majority that this case,placing a paper on an ftp server,is not clearly governed by either our library cases,such as in re bayer,in re hall,or in re cronyn,or our dissemination cases,such as in re klopfenstein.
library cases 
like a thesis in a library,the live traffic paper was placed on the ftp server.however,unlike the library cases,the live traffic paper was in a navigable directory structure.as the district court held,once at the ftp server,to get to the live traffic paper,one only needed to enter the directory entitled pubs there were only two directories to choose from pubs and dev and once in pubs enter the subdirectory emerald.sri,d at.it was undisputed that people of skill in the art were aware of the emerald project to which the live traffic paper pertained prior to the critical date.id.at.the district court concluded from the extensive record evidence that a person of ordinary skill in this art,having the ftp host address available to,could readily navigate through two subfolders on a
