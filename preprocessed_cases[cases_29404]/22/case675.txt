the two main issues in this appeal relate to restitution under the mandatory victim restitution act,was it an abuse of discretion to assign the same restitution value to each stolen good,regardless of whether that good was later sold by the offender and was a purchaser of the stolen goods,who was sued by and settled with the manufacturer on grounds not disclosed in the record,a victim entitled to restitution of the cash paid in settlement a jury convicted joseph robertson of wire and mail fraud for fraudulently obtaining software from novell,through the use of fictional purchasers.robertson sold many units of that software to network systems technology.network systems later paid novell to settle a civil suit filed by novell on grounds not disclosed in the record.the district court sentenced robertson to months of imprisonment and ordered restitution to novell for the wholesale price of every unreturned unit of software and restitution to network systems for the money it paid novell to settle.in addition to his appeals of two convictions and the application of a sentencing enhancement,all of which we affirm,robertson challenges the calculation of the restitution owed novell and argues that network systems was not a victim entitled to restitution.we agree with the latter argument,but not the former one.because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it calculated the restitution owed novell,we affirm that order of restitution.we vacate the order of restitution to network systems because it was not a victim.
background 
we divide our description of the factual and procedural background into three parts.first,we describe robertson fraudulent acquisition of software from novell.second,we describe robertson sale of the stolen software to network systems.third,we discuss robertson convictions and sentencing.
a.the acquisition of the units of software 
novell manufactures computer software called netware.novell sells units of netware,each of which includes a copy of the software and a license to use it,directly to end users,distributors,companies,and government agencies.during the period in which robertson fraudulently acquired netware from novell,the company was headquartered in utah.to order from novell,a customer would communicate with the company by,telephone,or facsimile.novell offered netware to educational institutions at discounted prices,which could be as much as percent lower than the retail prices.
in may,novell received a purchase order by facsimile from acl learning center for units of netware at discounted prices.the order was signed joe learning center,and the address for shipment was that of a house in georgia rented by robertson mother,where he then lived and maintained an office with file cabinets,a bed,a computer,copy machines,and a facsimile machine.novell shipped the units of software and received two similar orders in june,for which it shipped additional units.
in august,novell received a purchase order by facsimile from james turner of cobb academy for units of netware at discounted prices.as requested in the order,novell shipped the units of software to a post office box at a mail boxes store.the post office box was rented by robertson.
in november,novell shipped units of netware at discounted prices to fulton county educational services,but novell has no record of how the order was placed.the address for fulton county educational services was,in fact,the address for an apartment complex where heather sharpe then lived.sharpe knew robertson,although she testified that she never received a package for him,and there was no evidence that robertson knew sharpe address or ever went to her apartment.
in february and march,novell received three purchase orders by facsimile from jay mcghee of atlanta city educational services for units of netware at discounted prices.as requested in the order,novell shipped the units of software to trinity avenue,which was actually the address for an apartment rented by lee ann vance.vance knew robertson and received at her apartment two or three packages for him.
novell shipped a total of units of netware to acl learning center,cobb academy,fulton county educational services,and atlanta city educational services.each unit had a unique part number and license serial number.novell never received payment for any of the units shipped.it is the policy of novell not to ship software to any customer who has an outstanding balance for more than days.
b.the sale of units of software to network systems 
in june,an individual who identified himself as gino barrett offered to sell units of netware for approximately each to network systems,a computer hardware and software engineering firm owned by michael oken.because the wholesale price would have been around each,oken sent two individuals,scott richardson and donald coleman,to inspect the units of software.when asked how he obtained the units,barrett stated that he was a dealer of novell software.at trial,richardson and coleman identified robertson as barrett.
network systems purchased units of netware from robertson on more than ten occasions.during the period in which robertson acquired netware from novell,network systems bought netware only from robertson.robertson admits that network systems purchased of the units of netware shipped by novell to acl learning center,cobb academy,fulton county educational services,and atlanta city educational services.there is no evidence that robertson sold the other units.
network systems resold the units of netware for a profit of.if the customer requested it,the unique serial number of each unit purchased was printed on the sales invoice.serial numbers reflected in the sales invoices of network systems match serial numbers of units of netware shipped by novell to all four fictional educational institutions.
in november,network systems and novell settled civil litigation related to the netware purchased from robertson.as part of a confidential settlement agreement,network systems paid novell.robertson asserts that novell sued network systems for breach of a distributor agreement,because network systems purchased units of novell software from a source other than novell or an authorized novell distributor,but there is no evidence in the record of the precise grounds for the lawsuit between network systems and novell.in a victim impact statement made at sentencing,oken mentioned t he lanham act but did not elaborate further.
robertson convictions and sentencing 
in january,robertson was convicted by a jury on eight counts of wire fraud,for causing eight purchase orders to be sent in interstate commerce by facsimile on behalf of acl learning center counts through,cobb academy count,fulton county educational services count,and atlanta city educational services counts through.robertson was also convicted on eight counts of mail fraud,id,for causing novell products to be sent by private and interstate carrier boxes to acl learning center counts through,cobb academy count,fulton county educational services count,and atlanta city educational services counts through.robertson moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the counts relating to fulton county educational services counts and,and the district court denied the motion.
the presentence investigation report applied the edition of the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time robertson committed his offenses,see united states sentencing guidelines,because the later edition of the guidelines in effect at sentencing would have resulted in higher offense levels.the presentence report calculated a total offense level of,which included an enhancement of levels for sophisticated means.see id.b c.the presentence report recommended restitution of to novell,which was the wholesale price of all of the fraudulently obtained and unreturned units of software.the presentence report then mentioned the possibility of restitution of to network systems for the money network systems paid novell to settle its civil suit.under the restitution act,defendants convicted of wire or mail fraud must make restitution to any victim of their offenses.see united states dickerson,cir restitution required for wire fraud united states yeager,cir mail fraud.
the district court followed the recommended guidelines calculations and imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment.robertson objected to the application of the enhancement for sophisticated means.the district court then ordered restitution to network systems in the amount of and to novell in the amount of,which the court calculated by subtracting from.robertson objected to the calculation of the amount of restitution owed novell and to any award of restitution to network systems.

iii.discussion 
robertson presents five arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on the counts of fraud related to fulton county educational services counts and.second,he argues that the district court should not have applied a sentencing enhancement for sophisticated means.third,he asserts that the district court miscalculated the restitution owed novell,because the court did not consider that some unreturned units of netware may not have been sold.fourth,robertson argues that network systems was not a victim entitled to restitution.fifth,robertson contends,as an alternative to his fourth argument,that the district court incorrectly calculated the amount of restitution owed network systems.
a.the evidence was sufficient to convict robertson on the counts of fraud related to fulton county educational services.
robertson argues that the government did not offer direct evidence sufficient to convict him on the counts of mail and wire fraud related to fulton county educational services.the government responds that it presented sufficient circumstantial evidence for a reasonable jury to convict.we agree with the government.we first discuss the count of mail fraud and then turn to the count of wire fraud.
mail fraud consists of an intentional participation in a scheme to defraud a person of money or property,and the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.united states sharpe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.robertson contends that the government failed to offer direct evidence that he caused novell to mail units of software to fulton county educational services.this argument is unavailing.
mail fraud can be proved by circumstantial evidence,see united states metallo,cir,and the government offered sufficient circumstantial evidence.the evidence established that novell received an order from fulton county educational services that requested shipment to an address where heather sharpe lived and sharpe was acquainted with robertson.although sharpe testified that she did not receive any packages for robertson,we make all reasonable inferences and credibility determinations in favor of the government.see united states dennis,cir.the evidence established that,during a period when network systems bought units of netware only from robertson,network systems sold units of netware that bore the unique serial numbers of units shipped to fulton county educational services.based on this evidence,a reasonable jury could have convicted robertson on the count of mail fraud related to fulton county educational services.
to establish the offense of wire fraud,the government must prove intentional participation in a scheme to defraud and use of the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme.united states hasson,cir.robertson argues that the government failed to produce a facsimile cover sheet or other direct evidence that an interstate wire was used.this argument also fails.
because t he only difference between mail and wire fraud is that mail fraud requires proof of the use of the mails while wire fraud requires proof of the use of the wires,beck prupis,cir,wire fraud,like mail fraud,can be proved by circumstantial evidence.we agree with the sixth circuit that t here is no requirement that the government produce direct proof in the form of telephone bills or facsimile cover sheets.united states griffith,cir.as p roof of a routine practice of using the mail to accomplish a business end is sufficient to support a jury determination that mailing occurred,united states waymer,cir,proof of a routine practice of using the wires to accomplish a business end is sufficient to support a count of wire fraud.
the government presented ample circumstantial evidence.it offered evidence that robertson routinely sent purchase orders to novell by interstate facsimile.the government proved that robertson was located in or around atlanta,georgia,and novell was located in utah where customers contacted it by,telephone,or facsimile.the government proved that robertson had a facsimile machine and sent seven other purchase orders to novell by facsimile.based on this evidence,a reasonable jury could have found that robertson sent by facsimile the purchase order on behalf of fulton county educational services and convicted robertson of wire fraud.
b.the district court correctly applied a sentencing enhancement for sophisticated means.
robertson contends that the district court erroneously applied a sentencing enhancement for sophisticated means.he argues that he employed a simple scheme in which he ordered items and did not pay.we disagree.
section b c of the edition of the guidelines provides a enhancement if an offense of fraud otherwise involved sophisticated means.b c.the commentary explains that sophisticated means means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.id.cmt.for example,i n a telemarketing scheme,locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction would ordinarily indicate sophisticated means.id.conduct such as hiding assets or transactions,or both,through the use of fictitious entities,corporate shells,or offshore bank accounts also ordinarily would indicate sophisticated means.id.
the district court found that robertson had employed a rather clever and sophisticated method of doing business,and we are not,in our review of that finding,left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.robertson attempted to insulate himself by hiding behind false names,such as james turne
