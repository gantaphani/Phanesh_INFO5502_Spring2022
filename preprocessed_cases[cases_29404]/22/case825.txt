plaintiff dan popescu sued apple apple for damages after he was fired by his employer,constellium rolled products ravenswood,llc constellium.he alleged that between august and october of,apple took affirmative steps to convince constellium to terminate him in retaliation for his resistance to apple alleged illegal conduct.the court sustained apple demurrer to poposecu first amended complaint complaint without leave to amend.
this appeal involves popescu claim for intentional interference with contractual relations contract interference and his claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage business interference.claims for contract interference and business interference are separate but related torts.the elements of the two claims are substantially the same,but a plaintiff alleging business interference must also show that the defendant action was wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.citation.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,della penna.as a general rule,this wrongfulness element is not required in a contract interference claim because contracts are entitled to greater protection from interference.
among the issues we will address in this appeal are whether an employee popescu whose employment contract is terminated as a result of a third party apple interference must allege that the defendant conduct was independently wrongful to state a contract interference claim and a third party alleged anticompetitive conduct may constitute independently wrongful acts to support a business interference claim,even if the plaintiff is not directly harmed by the wrongful acts.
in our review of the sustaining of a demurrer,we must accept as true all material allegations of fact that are in the complaint blickman turkus,lp mf downtown sunnyvale,llc th,regardless of how improbable they may be.citation.del webb structural materials d,del webb based upon this standard and the law applicable to contract and business interference claims,we conclude the trial court erred.
in sustaining the demurrer to the contract interference claim,the trial court concluded that popescu had alleged an employment agreement with constellium,and that under reeves hanlon cal th reeves,popescu could not state a contract interference claim as a matter of law.as to the business interference claim,the court held that apple alleged anticompetitive conduct did not constitute an independently wrongful act supporting popescu claim because it was not designed to,and did not actually cause interference with the economic relationship between popescu and constellium.
we will conclude that the trial court correctly found that popescu had alleged an employment agreement.but the court then erroneously interpreted and applied reeves as compelling the conclusion that popescu can not state a claim for intentional interference with contract.reeves,however,concerned a type of claim that is not at issue here a claim by a former employer whose employee was hired away by a new employer.because of the dual policy concerns of employee mobility and the promotion of legitimate competition,the california supreme court held in reeves that the former employer had to show that the new employer conduct in recruiting and hiring its employee was independently wrongful.reeves,supra,cal th at.those same policy considerations do not exist here.this case involves an employee not his former employer suing a third party for interfering with his employment agreement.we thus hold that reeves does not require popescu to allege or prove as part of his contract interference claim that apple conduct in interfering with his employment contract was independently wrongful.
we also hold that popescu alleged the required elements of a business interference claim.as part of that claim,popescu was not required to allege that he was directly harmed by an independently wrongful act so long as he alleged as he did that apple wrongful act interfered with his economic relationship with constellium.
because the demurrer to both causes of action should have been overruled,we need not address popescu contention that the trial court abused its discretion by denying leave to amend.we will reverse the judgment with directions that the court vacate its prior order and enter a new order overruling the demurrer to both causes of action.
procedural background 
on july,popescu initiated this action against apple,alleging contract interference and business interference claims.apple filed a demurrer to the initial pleading.apple demurrer was not heard by the court because,in response to the demurrer,popescu filed an amended pleading,the complaint,that is at issue in this appeal.
popescu,an arizona resident,alleged that he is an aluminum engineering manager who developed cutting edge alloys for customers.the gist of his action is that he objected to apple unlawful trade practices,and that apple therefore convinced his employer to terminate him for cause on a trumped up basis,thereby blackball ing popescu from his profession.
in,popescu was working for alcoa,alcoa.he was hired that year by algroup alusuisse algroup,an aluminum supplier that is alcoa largest competitor.algroup hired popescu because he had expertise in marketing aluminum substrates directly to end users in industries.algroup and popescu entered into an employment agreement,which included the following provision for popescu benefit an extended separation support package as an exception to current policy which would provide you with up to twelve months of base salary and coverage through paid cobra,as well as outplacement services,should your employment terminate for any reason other than misconduct or resignation.algroup was acquired by alcan corporation alcan in.
popescu alleged that he was a stellar and highly valued employee who survived a series of corporate transactions that resulted in his employment by constellium.in a june written employment agreement,constellium reaffirmed popescu severance provision in his prior agreement with algroup algroup severance plan provisions of the algroup severance,offered to you at the time of your employment with algroup,will continue to be honored,up to one year severance pay while unemployed,cobra benefits if not eligible elsewhere,outplacement services and unused earned vacation.
popescu alleged that he received performance reviews from alcan and constellium that were exemplary.his employer used a scoring system that rated him as very successful or exceptional.during his last review in february,constellium designated popescu as being in the very highest critical resource category.the next month,it designated him as the lead employee in pursuing a relationship with apple in which it was looking to expand the aluminum look and design of the macbook and ipad to its iphone.popescu performed superbly.
by early,apple had determined it would replace the stainless steel iphone body with a thinner and lighter extruded,anodized aluminum alloy.apple approached constellium to develop an alloy with specifications that were very demanding and required state of the art expertise and technology.in march,the business unit president of constellium global ati of which constellium is a subdivision designated popescu to lead in the pursuit of a relationship with apple in the latter goal of using an aluminum alloy for its iphone products.popescu was designated the project lead because of his expertise and performance.
popescu and a team of engineers from constellium commenced work on the apple custom alloy project.between april and august,popescu oversaw the project,which involved apple engineers and managers in california,constellium research and development center in france,and constellium manufacturing unit.apple sought and obtained a large degree of information from constellium,including its trade secrets regarding aluminum alloy manufacturing formulas and processes.constellium,through popescu,also gave apple samples of its extruded custom alloy and other alloys.
while development was progressing,apple insisted that constellium sign a development agreement containing restrictive terms,including provisions that a apple was not obligated to purchase any developed products or to use constellium as its supplier,and b constellium,for an effective period of five years,would be precluded from supplying alloy to any manufacturer of consumer electronics.apple advised constellium that constellium competitors other elite aluminum alloy suppliers had already signed such an agreement.popescu objected to the agreement and refused to sign it on constellium behalf.
popescu alleged that he subsequently attended a meeting with apple in cupertino on august.the apple engineers with whom popescu had worked for months were silent,while their superiors,who were new to the project,led the meeting and were visibly upset that the nearly complete custom alloy had outpaced the execution of the development agreement.apple representatives insisted that constellium sign the development agreement,which included an additional restrictive term that required constellium to transfer its intellectual property interests in the custom aluminum alloy to apple.popescu again refused to sign the agreement on behalf of constellium.
popescu alleged that apple wanted to use the executed development agreement to restrict competition in the smartphone market.he alleged that by lock ing up the elite aluminum suppliers with the r estrictive development agreement,apple would be free to develop its own extruded alloy body for the iphone,and to prevent its competitors from developing a smartphone with a comparable aluminum alloy body.apple saw popescu as an obstacle to the development agreement,so he was an obstacle to the larger scheme to restrict competition in smartphones.
popescu also alleged that,during the august meeting,he had inadvertently activated the recording feature of his livescribe smartpen the recording incident.apple attorney noticed that the meeting was being recorded,confiscated the smartpen,and the meeting continued.after the meeting,apple insisted that constellium commence an investigation into the recording incident.apple also requested that constellium terminate popescu,but his supervisors resisted.apple then appealed to the executive management of the private equity firm that owned constellium,after which popescu was terminated for cause.popescu alleged that apple used the recording incident to leverage both his termination and constellium execution of the development agreement.apple action allegedly prevented popescu from obtaining other employment in the aluminum alloy industry.at the time he was terminated on october,popescu earned more than per year,and he intended to work at constellium for at least more years,until he retired.
after popescu was terminated,constellium signed the development agreement.constellium was the last of the elite aluminum suppliers to sign the development agreement and,thus,the last supplier capable of producing an extruded alloy case equal or superior to apple extruded iphone case.popescu alleged that as a result of his termination and constellium execution of the development agreement,apple was able to misappropriate constellium aluminum alloy trade secrets.he alleged that the development agreements signed by constellium and other elite aluminum suppliers which agreements were naked output contracts in which a firm bargains for another entire output on the condition that the seller does not deal with the firm rivals had anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace because apple competitors were denied a potentially resource while the public was denied a better,more durable smartphone.he also alleged that apple anticompetitive actions negatively impacted elite aluminum suppliers,consumer electronics companies including smartphone manufacturers,and smartphone consumers.
in the first cause of action,popescu alleged a claim for contract interference.he claimed he had an employment contract with constellium that restricted its ability to terminate him and therefore he was not an employee when he was terminated.he also alleged that apple was aware of his contract it intentionally induced constellium to terminate his employment as a result of apple actions,constellium terminated him,purportedly for cause,on october,and he was damaged as a result of apple conduct.
in the second cause of action,popescu alleged a purported claim for business interference.he claimed he had an employment relationship with constellium under which there was a probability he would receive future economic benefits he had intended to work for at least more years at the time his employment was terminated and had it not been for apple actions,it was extremely likely he would have stayed employed with constellium as he had planned.he also alleged that apple was aware of his employment relationship with constellium,apple intentionally induced constellium to terminate his employment,and constellium terminated him,purportedly for cause,on october,as a result of apple actions.
popescu claimed in the second cause of action that apple actions were independently wrongful because the development agreement was a contract in restraint of trade in violation of the sherman act and business and professions code section apple engaged in a trust to restrict trade and prevent competition in violation of the cartwright act bus,et apple conduct was a scheme to misappropriate constellium trade secrets in violation of civil code section apple conduct constituted intentional interference with popescu contract with constellium and apple conduct violated business and professions code section et,in that it a threatened an incipient violation of antitrust laws or a violation of the policy and spirit of the laws,b violated business and professions code section,c was an unfair business practice,d was a deceptive business practice,e was an unlawful business practice,and f included implementation of the development agreement which contained unconscionable terms.
ii.the demurrer 
apple filed a demurrer to the complaint under code of civil procedure section asserting that the first and second claims failed to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action,subd.e and were uncertain,subd.f.apple urged that the court sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.in a lengthy order filed october,the court reasoned,among other things,that popescu failed to state a cause of action for contract interference because his allegations demonstrated he was an employee,and for business interference because he had not alleged that apple,in allegedly taking action to encourage constellium to launch an investigation into the recording incident that resulted in popescu termination,had committed an independently unlawful act.judgment was entered in favor of apple.

ii.order sustaining demurrer to contract interference claim 
background 
five elements must be alleged to support a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations contract interference.they are a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party defendant knowledge of this contract defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damage.pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d,pg e.it is not a requirement that the defendant conduct be wrongful apart from the interference with the contract itself.citation.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,quelimane.furthermore,a plaintiff need not establish that the primary purpose of the defendant actions was to disrupt the contract.the tort is shown even where the actor does not act for the purpose of interfering with the contract or desire it but knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his or her action,quoting rest d torts,com.j.
on its face,the complaint alleges facts demonstrating each of the five elements of a contract interference claim.but the trial court held that the allegations of the complaint demonstrated that popescu had an employment relationship with constellium,and because popescu was an employee,he can not state a claim for intentional interference with contract.in reaching this conclusion,the court cited reeves,supra,cal th.
popescu claims on appeal that he was not an employee,and that in any event,an employee is not barred under reeves,supra,cal th from asserting a contract interference claim.apple responds that the allegations of the complaint demonstrated that popescu had an employment relationship with constellium,and that the trial court correctly held that popescu contract interference claim was barred under reeves.apple argues in the alternative relying on applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th applied equipment that because it was not a stranger to popescu employment relationship with constellium,it was immune from suit for intentional interference with that contractual relationship.
apple claim it was not a stranger to the contract 
in applied equipment,our high court addressed whether a contracting party may be held liable in tort for conspiracy to interfere with its own contract.applied equipment,supra,cal th at.the court said it could not.it concluded that the imposition of tort liability upon a contracting party would illogically expand the doctrine of civil conspiracy by imposing tort liability for an alleged wrong interference with a contract that the purported tortfeasor is legally incapable of committing and obliterate vital and established distinctions between contract and tort theories of liability by effectively allowing the recovery of tort damages for an ordinary breach of contract.id.at.the court noted that california recognizes a cause of action against noncontracting parties who interfere with the performance of a contract.id.at,original italics.but in rejecting the imposition of tort liability upon a breaching party to the contract,the court held while the imposition of liability in tort upon the interferer may be justified in all cases for his or her intentional disruption of the contractual relation,the party who merely breaches his or her contract should in all cases be exposed only to contractual liability as he or she has not assumed the role of an intentional interferer.to impose tort liability upon the contract breaker because of the involvement of a third person when liability is limited to contract damages when the contract breaker is acting alone undermines the policies which have developed limited contractual liability.citation.id.at.
apple relies on applied equipment to argue it has no liability for contract interference because,while it was not popescu employer,apple nevertheless was not a stranger to his employment arrangement with constellium.apple contends that popescu alleged that apple contracted with constellium to develop a proprietary aluminum extruding process.citation.this research and development process would represent a significant investment of time and resources by apple.apple therefore had a legitimate economic interest in making sure the individuals constellium staffed the project with would not cause apple any harm.apple relies on the following language in applied equipment it has long been held that a stranger to a contract may be liable in tort for intentionally interfering with the performance of the contract.citation.however,consistent with its underlying policy of protecting the expectations of contracting parties against frustration by outsiders who have no legitimate social or economic interest in the contractual relationship,the tort cause of action for interference with contract does not lie against a party to the contract.citations.applied conspiracy theory is fundamentally irreconcilable with the law of conspiracy and the tort of interference with contract one contracting party owes no general tort duty to another not to interfere with performance of the contract its duty is simply to perform the contract according to its terms.the tort duty not to interfere with the contract falls only on strangers interlopers who have no legitimate interest in the scope or course of the contract performance.applied equipment,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted,original italics.
we do not read the foregoing language from applied equipment as asserted by apple to immunize a noncontracting party from tort liability because the noncontracting party has a legitimate interest in the scope or course of the contract performance.the plaintiff there,applied equipment applied,alleged that the codefendants litton saudi arabia limited litton and varian associates varian were both liable for conspiracy to interfere with two applied contracts a subcontract with litton and a purchase order with varian.applied equipment,supra,cal th at.the issue was whether a contracting party could be found liable for conspiring with a third party to deprive the plaintiff of the benefits of its contract namely,whether litton could be liable in tort for conspiracy with varian in connection with the breach of the subcontract,and varian could be liable in tort for conspiracy with litton in connection with the breach of the purchase order.the court did not address whether a tort claim for contract interference or conspiracy could be made against a noncontracting party who had a legitimate interest in the contract,let alone hold that such a claim could never be asserted as a matter of law.cases are not authority for propositions not considered.kinsman unocal cal th.
dictum in applied equipment suggests a conclusion adverse to apple position.in the opinion penultimate paragraph,the court noted that,since the plaintiff alleged the disruption of two contracts with two different contracting parties,n othing we have said suggests that litton may not be held liable for direct interference with the applied purchase order to which it was not a party or that varian may not be held liable for direct interference with the applied subcontract to which it was not a party,provided that each of the elements of the tort of interference with contract is satisfied.applied equipment,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.we thus conclude that the stranger to a contract language id.at which immediately follows the high court statement that noncontracting parties may be held liable for interference with a contract is used as a synonym for noncontracting party.
an extension of applied equipment holding to immunize a third party from tortious interference claims simply because the third party asserts some economic or other interest in a contract would significantly undercut the tort itself and the public policy underlying it.as noted recently by the ninth circuit court of appeals to shield parties with an economic interest in the contract from potential liability would create an undesirable lacuna in the law between the respective domains of tort and contract.a party with an economic interest in a contractual relationship could interfere without risk of facing either tort or contract liability.this result is particularly perverse as it is those parties with some type of economic interest in a contract whom sic would have the greatest incentive to interfere with it.such a result would hardly serve the established goal of protecting a formally cemented economic relationship from interference by a stranger to the agreement.citation.united nat.maintenance,san diego convention center,cir,quoting della penna,supra,cal th at.
in support of apple position that under applied equipment,supra,cal th,it can not be liable for contract interference,apple quotes from marin tug barge,westport petroleum,cir marin tug california law has long recognized that an entity with a direct interest or involvement in that relationship is not usually liable for harm caused by pursuit of its interests.citation.quoting from marin tug,at.this reliance is misplaced.marin tug was concerned with a business interference claim,not a contract interference claim.moreover,the marin tug court did not cite applied equipment in its opinion.
we find woods fox broadcasting,th woods to be instructive.in woods,the plaintiffs,employees of fox family who held stock option rights by contract,sued their employer majority shareholder a nonparty to the stock option contracts for interference with contractual relations.id.at.the trial court sustained the defendant demurrer to the contract interference claim because the defendant was not a stranger to the contracts.id.at.but the appellate court reversed,rejecting the defendant contention similar to apple here that under applied equipment,supra,cal th,a noncontracting party that is not a stranger to the contract and that has some interest in the contract is immune from a contract interference claim.woods,supra,th at.the woods court noted when applied equipment did use the term stranger to a contract,it did so interchangeably with the terms noncontracting parties citation and third parties.citation.id.at.accordingly,the appellate court held that applied equipment should not be read as holding that persons or entities with an ownership interest in a corporation are automatically immune from liability for interfering with their corporation contractual obligations.citations.woods,at see also asahi kasei pharma actelion th,corporate defendant that acquired entity with existing license agreement not immune from suit for interference with that agreement under theory it was not a stranger to it a stranger,as used in applied equipment,means one who is not a party to the contract or an agent of a party to the contract.
apple also cites mintz blue cross of california th mintz in support of its position.there,the plaintiff,an insured under a health insurance plan pers plus which was issued and funded by calpers,sued blue cross of california blue cross,the administrator of the plan.the claims arose out of the denial of insurance coverage for a requested treatment blue cross deemed investigational.blue cross advised the plaintiff of his right to appeal the decision by asking for another review,but it did not advise him that he had a right under his policy to request an independent external review of the decision.id.at.in his suit,the plaintiff alleged,among other things,interference with contractual relations.ibid.the plaintiff appealed from a dismissal entered after a demurrer was sustained.id.at.on appeal,the court,citing applied equipment,supra,cal th at page,noted that only a stranger to the contract may be liable for interfering with it.citation.mintz,at.the court held that blue cross could not be sued for interference with the insurance contract for which it acted as administrator because the insurance contract expressly identified blue cross as the agent for calpers in administering the contract ibid.and it is settled that corporate agents and employees acting for and on behalf of a corporation can not be held liable for inducing a breach of the corporation contract.citations.id.at,quoting shoemaker myers cal d.
mintz is distinguishable.apple was not mentioned as a named agent or otherwise in popsecu employment contract.nor did apple act on behalf of constellium in connection with the employment agreement.thus,apple relationship to the agreement was wholly tangential.apple nonetheless describes itself as having a legitimate economic interest in making sure that individuals constellium staffed the project with,popescu would not cause apple any harm.while we do not question the result in mintz that a defendant is immune from a contract interference claim because it was serving as an of a contracting party it can not be read to support apple view that any noncontracting defendant that can articulate an interest in an contract is immune from tort liability.see powerhouse motorsports group,yamaha motor,th,motorcycle could not claim not a stranger immunity to claim for interference with contract for sale of dealership by franchisee to third party.
apple also relies on warwick university of the pacific,wl dist.lexis warwick.in warwick,the plaintiff was an independent contractor panel attorney with a california parole advocacy program calpap operated by the university of the pacific uop.id.at.the program arose out of a injunction requiring the state to establish a program providing attorneys for parole revocation proceedings.id.at.the contract provided it was terminable at will by either party upon notice,and calpap retained sole discretion as to the assignment of any parolee clients to the plaintiff.id.at.after approximately six months during which time various issues arose the plaintiff contract was terminated.id.at pp.after the plaintiff sued uop,defendants california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdrc and various individuals moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion of the cdcr as to the contract interference claim because the plaintiff admitted she had an contract with calpap.the district court observed that u nder california law,a party who interferes with an contract can not be sued for interference with contract.citation.id.at.citing reeves,supra,cal th at page,the court concluded that a ny such claim is more properly viewed as an interference with prospective economic advantage claim.citation.ibid.
warwick does not support apple position here.first,in the context of a contract interference claim,warwick did not hold that a noncontracting party having an economic interest in a contract is immune from tort liability for alleged disruption of a contractual relationship.indeed,the district court did not cite applied equipment.further,we disagree with the warwick court recitation of california law as it concerns contract interference claims based upon contracts.as we will discuss see pt,post,we conclude that under reeves,supra,cal th,where an employee contract is terminated as a result of interference by a third party,the employee may assert a contract interference claim against the third party without showing that the third party committed an independently wrongful act.and,more generally,to the extent warwick suggests that under california law a third party may not be held liable for interfering with a business relationship whether or not based upon an existing contract because the third party is not a stranger to that relationship and has a substantial interest in it,we disagree.the warwick court,in support of this position,cited no california cases,instead relying on marin tug,supra.no california case has made such a sweeping pronouncement that would immunize third parties from liability for contract interference and business interference claims.
we conclude that apple,even as a third party having some interest in the manner in which popescu performed his employment agreement with constellium,is not immune from tort liability for interfering with his contract.we next address whether the trial court correctly found that popescu alleged an employment relationship with constellium,and,if so,whether his contract interference claim was precluded as a matter of law.
popescu at will employment relationship 
under california law,it is presumed that employment with no specified term is and may be terminated at any time for any lawful reason by the employer or employee.while the statutory presumption of employment is strong labor code section does not prevent the parties from agreeing to any limitation,otherwise lawful,on the employer termination rights.citation.guz bechtel national cal th,guz,original italics see also foley interactive data cal d,foley presumption may be rebutted by evidence that despite the absence of a specified term,the parties agreed that the employer power to terminate would be limited in some way,by a requirement that termination be based only on good cause.the contractual understanding need not be express,but may be implied in fact,arising from the parties conduct evidencing their actual mutual intent to create such enforceable limitations.citation.guz,at,italics omitted.factors that may bear upon a determination of the existence of an contract and its contents include the personnel policies or practices of the employer,the employee longevity of service,actions or communications by the employer reflecting assurances of continued employment,and the practices of the industry in which the employee is engaged.citation.foley,at,quoting pugh see candies,d.the existence or nonexistence of an contract under which the employee may be terminated only for good cause is generally a question of fact.foley,at see also stillwell v.the salvation army th.
it is the statutory presumption in arizona the state of popescu domicile that the relationship between employer and employee is at will.see.under arizona law,an employee except a public employee may bring suit for wrongful discharge under only three circumstances termination in breach of a written contract signed by both the employer and employee or expressly included in an employment handbook setting forth that the employment relationship shall remain in effect for a specified duration of time or otherwise expressly restricting the right of either party to terminate the employment relationship termination in violation of an arizona statute or termination in retaliation for the refusal to violate the arizona constitution or an arizona statute.bodett coxcom,cir.
popescu argues that the trial court erred by failing to apply arizona law to the issue of whether he had an employment relationship with constellium.he contends there were sufficient facts alleged in the complaint that he was not an employee under arizona law because he alleged that his contract restricted constellium ability to terminate him and he was not an at will employee at the time of his termination on october.
popescu did not make the assertion below that arizona law applied to the determination of whether he was an employee.rather,he argued citing guz,supra,cal th and crst van expedited,werner enterprises cir crst that under california law,because his agreement restricted constellium ability to terminate him,he was not an employee.further,although he alleged that he was at all times a resident of phoenix,arizona,he did not allege the location of the execution,performance,or termination of his employment agreement with constellium.and in his appellate briefs,popescu fails to provide a substantive legal argument in support of his contention that arizona law applies to the issue of whether he was an employee.we conclude that since popescu has not shown that arizona law differs from california law on whether he was an employee,there is no choice of law issue presented here.see hurtado superior court cal d,no choice of law issue presented where the laws of the two states are identical see also smith cimmet th.
renewing its argument below,apple argues on appeal that popescu was an employee,relying in part on dehorney bank of america nat.trust sav.cir dehorney.the trial court likewise relied on dehorney in concluding popescu was an employee.
in dehorney,a terminated bank teller alleged,among other things,a cause of action for wrongful discharge.dehorney,supra,at.under her written agreement with the bank,dehorney acknowledged that she would not be a permanent employee until a conclusion of a trial period,which shall not exceed three months days,and that during such trial period,i may be released with or without cause and shall be entitled only to my salary at the agreed upon rate to the date of release.id.at.the agreement also provided in section that after dehorney became a permanent employee,she would be entitled to two weeks notice or month salary in lieu thereof in case of dismissal unless such dismissal results from her dishonesty,disloyalty,insubordination or other good cause.ibid.the ninth circuit court of appeals agreed with the district court that the agreement demonstrated that dehorney was an employee,reasoning section is unmistakably clear that permanent employees are not in fact permanent,but are only entitled to certain benefits upon termination,depending on whether they are dismissed for cause or without cause w hen dehorney signed the contract,she agreed that bank of america could terminate her with or without cause,so long as the bank complied with the notice and severance provisions set forth in section of the contract.see also siddoway bank of america,following dehorney in concluding that identical provisions created employment contract.
we find the reasoning in dehorney persuasive.the agreement between popescu and constellium as pleaded here was subject to the presumption under labor code section that it was terminable at will.as pleaded,constellium retained the right to terminate popescu for any lawful reason.thus,as was true in dehorney,the fact that constellium was obligated to pay compensation if it terminated popescu for reasons other than his misconduct did not convert an otherwise agreement into a agreement.dehorney,supra,at see also kelly th,rejecting contention that employer bonus program created implied contract that the plaintiff employment would continue until date second installment was due.
popescu nonetheless contends he adequately pleaded that he was not an employee by so averring,and by alleging that his employment contract restricted constellium ability to terminate him.these conclusory allegations were insufficient to support a claim based upon an alleged employment contract under which the plaintiff may be terminated only for good cause.although a demurrer admits pleaded facts,it does not admit pleaded matters,such as popescu legal status as an employee,that are contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law zelig county of los angeles cal th,demurrer admits pleaded facts see also building industry marin mun.water dist.d,demurrer does not admit the truth of argumentative allegations about the legal construction,operation,and effect of statutory provisions.
accordingly,the trial court correctly concluded that popescu had an employment relationship with constellium,not a agreement 
application of reeves hanlon 
the trial court held that since popescu had alleged facts demonstrating he was an employee,under reeves,supra,cal th,he could not state a contract interference claim.it therefore sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend.popescu argues that the court erred because it erroneously interpreted reeves as holding that an employee can not maintain a contract interference claim.
in reeves,the plaintiffs,a law firm and one of its partners,alleged that the defendants,attorneys who left the firm,unlawfully lured the plaintiffs employees to join the defendants new firm.reeves,supra,cal th at.the plaintiffs prevailed at trial.id.at.the supreme court addressed a contract interference theory as it pertained to the workers who were induced to leave plaintiffs law firm,and a claim for violation of the uniform trade secrets act,et.reeves,at.it was undisputed that the nine employees who left the law firm,including six who went to work for the defendants,were the plaintiffs employees.id.at.the reeves court considered the correctness of the court of appeal legal conclusion that an employer may recover for interference with the employment contracts of its employees by a third party when the third party does not show that its conduct in hiring the employees was justifiable or legitimate.id.at.
the supreme court noted initially that it has been recognized historically that a contract interference claim may be based upon disruption of an contract under the theory that a third party interference with an contract is actionable interference with the contractual relationship because the contractual relationship is at the will of the parties,not at the will of outsiders.citations.reeves,supra,cal th at,quoting pg e,supra,cal d at.the court also noted that this principle had been applied historically to employment contracts.reeves,at.but it observed that this state public policy has long been that a former employee has the right to engage in a competitive business for himself and to enter into competition with his former employer,even for the business of his former employer,provided such competition is fairly and legally conducted.citations,quoting continental car na var moseley cal d.further,the court noted that it is not ordinarily a tort to hire the employees of another for use in the hirer business,subject to the exception that liability will be imposed if unfair methods are used in interfering in such advantageous relations.citation.reeves,at,quoting buxbom smith cal d.
based upon these policy considerations,the court concluded that w here no unlawful methods are used,public policy generally supports a competitor right to offer more pay or better terms to another employee,so long as the employee is free to leave.reeves,supra,cal th at.accordingly,the court held a plaintiff may recover damages for intentional interference with an employment relation under the same california standard applicable to claims for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.that is,to recover for a defendant interference with an employment relation,a plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act,an act proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard citation that induced an employee to leave the plaintiff.id.at,fn.omitted.
the trial court here interpreted reeves,as applied to popescu employment relationship,as barring his contract interference claim.apple reiterates on appeal its view that under reeves,popescu can not assert a contract interference claim.apple contends he can only assert a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.
even if we were to construe reeves as requiring in all circumstances involving a claim for intentional interference with an employment contract that a plaintiff must show that a defendant conduct was independently wrongful,it would be incorrect to say that a plaintiff as a matter of law can not state a contract interference claim.our high court clearly held that a contract interference claim involving an contract is viable under california law.reeves,supra,cal th at.but it held that a plaintiff,to establish such a contract interference claim,must plead and prove the defendant action in inducing the employee to terminate his or her employment involved the defendant commission of an independently wrongful act.id.at.the court did not hold that a contract interference claim involving an employment contract is not actionable under any circumstance.rather,it concluded that a plaintiff could recover under such a claim under the same california standard applicable to claims for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.ibid.in other words,our high court did not negate the contract interference claim involving an employment agreement entirely it merely subjected it to an additional independent wrongful act requirement.see quelimane,supra,cal th at noting that contract interference and business interference claims are separate and distinct torts.
the trial court appears to have concluded that reeves held that a plaintiff,in all circumstances,may only pursue a contract interference claim based upon an employment relationship if the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act.reeves,supra,cal th at.as noted above,however,the supreme court based its conclusion that interference with an employment relationship was not actionable without an independent wrongful act upon the dual public policy considerations of employee freedom of movement and a business right to legitimately compete in the marketplace.id.at.those underlying policy considerations are specific to the typical employment contract interference claim at issue in reeves where the defendant company current employer has induced an employee to breach an employment contract he or she had with the plaintiff company former employer and competitor of the defendant.by contrast,the claim here is an atypical one in which the defendant company not a prospective employer allegedly induced an employer apple business partner,not its competitor to breach an employment agreement with the plaintiff employee.under these circumstances,neither policy consideration that animated our high court holding in reeves is present.
furthermore,the dispositive language in reeves shows that our high court intended the independently wrongful act requirement to apply to the specific circumstances of that case t o recover for a defendant interference with an employment relation,a plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act that induced an employee to leave the plaintiff.under this standard,a defendant is not subject to liability for intentional interference if the interference consists merely of extending a job offer that induces an employee to terminate his or her employment.reeves,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted,italics added.
we hold that reeves additional requirement of pleading and proof of an independently wrongful act in contract interference claims involving employment contracts does not apply where,as here,the employee is the alleged victim of a third party conduct in inducing its business partner to terminate his or her employment contract.see chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group,i noting that reeves involved suit by employer against competitor,and may not apply to employee suits against third parties who induce termination of his or her employment.accordingly,since popescu alleged each of the five elements of a contract interference claim pg e,supra,cal d at,it was error to sustain the demurrer to the first cause of action.

the elements of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage business interference are an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of that relationship intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.citation.youst longo cal d,fn.the business interference tort is considerably more inclusive than actions based on contract or interference with contract,and is thus not dependent on the existence of a valid contract.buckaloo johnson cal d,disapproved on other grounds in della penna,supra,cal th at,fn.
although business interference is related to contract interference,our high court has noted that a distinction must be made between the two,and a greater solicitude must be afforded to those relationships that have ripened into agreements.della penna,supra,
