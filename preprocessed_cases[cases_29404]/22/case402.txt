lieutenant kent smock of the iowa internet crimes against children task force of the black hawk county,iowa sheriff office established the undercover profile of a fictional fourteen year old iowa girl with the screen name brenda.acting with that identity,he entered a yahoo internet chat room for romance seekers in the state of iowa.on february,the undercover profile was contacted by an individual,later determined to be graeme pierson,using the screen name.in response to questioning by pierson,indicated that she was a fourteen year old girl.after pierson requested a picture of her,lieutenant smock sent him several photographs of a female officer taken when she was approximately thirteen years old.pierson responded that was cute,mentioned that he was looking for a girlfriend,and asked the undercover profile to have sex with him.pierson was forty four years old at the time.
over the course of the following several months,pierson communicated regularly with in chat rooms,through instant messaging,and offline via cellular telephone text messaging.the conversations were invariably sexually explicit and typically revolved around pierson attempt to induce the undercover profile to have sexual relations with him and to perform graphic sexual acts for transmission to him over the internet.
in order to achieve this goal,pierson relied on a coterie of distinct internet personas,styling himself variously as a handsome nineteen year old male,terminally ill and love starved thirty six year old brother,a twenty year old female,and ostensibly the actor johnny depp.
pierson initially utilized his teenage persona,to make contact with,earn her trust,and determine whether she was open to sexual relations with an adult.satisfied that she was willing,pierson needed to introduce an older persona into the mix in order to have sex with because was supposedly nineteen while pierson was forty four.at this point pierson introduced gpierson,modelman adopted thirty six year old brother who supposedly was dying of cancer and desperately in need of the succor only sex could provide.then began communicating regularly with the undercover profile.in his efforts to procure sex and personal pornography from,depended on both natural compassion for the terminally ill and cold hard cash.for instance,informed that if she were willing to provide him with sex and explicit imagery,he would assist her in obtaining a job as a model where she might earn as much as.
pierson multi purpose female persona,first approached in the guise of an undercover officer on the hunt for pedophiles.as,pierson asked if she too was a police officer.when the undercover profile reported this to and threatened to terminate their relationship for fear of parental punishment,pierson responded that was a friend who was merely attempting to confirm that was not a law enforcement officer.later,satisfied that was a minor,pierson employed to attempt to persuade to have sex with.shared fictional tales of her own underage sexual relationship with the adult.these relations,according to,led to a lucrative career as a model.finally,contacted.pierson,posing as the international film star,explained that he too had befriended through.asserted that his friendship and untold riches awaited if she would only have sex with.
after pierson mailed twenty seven dollars to the undercover profile for the purpose of purchasing a webcam for her to use in a sexually explicit performance,agents of the united states postal inspection service obtained search and arrest warrants and arrested him on may.pierson was read his miranda rights,signed a waiver of those rights,and agreed to speak with the agents.during this interview,pierson made a series of damaging admissions.he admitted to using the,and screen names.he admitted to engaging in sexually explicit communications with the undercover profile.he admitted to sending money to the undercover profile for the purpose of purchasing a webcam.he admitted that he wanted the undercover profile to transmit nude pictures of herself to him via the webcam.he admitted that he would be sexually aroused by viewing explicit photographs and moving images of a fourteen year old girl.he admitted attempting to set up at least two meetings with the undercover profile.finally,pierson maintained that while he had initially doubted whether the undercover profile was actually fourteen years old,he had come to believe that she was a minor over the preceding several weeks.
at trial pierson attempted to paint a more benign portrait.he described the internet chat rooms in which he spent his time as a virtual playground where visitors indulged their fantasies through masquerade.the corpulent described themselves as svelte.the old described themselves as young.indeed,pierson admitted at trial that he used the screen name to appear to be a female.he also testified that he had once entered into an online relationship with an individual who purported to be a minor only to later discover that the object of his attention was middle aged.pierson asserted that he therefore believed throughout the course of their contact that the undercover profile was an adult imitating a child.at one point pierson conducted research based upon identifying information provided by the undercover profile and came to believe that he was communicating with a forty year old woman rather than a fourteen year old girl.pierson played along nonetheless he said because the thought of engaging in sexual activity with a fourteen year old was exciting to him.although pierson denied that he would ever act on his desire to engage in sexual contact with a minor,the government introduced evidence prior to the conclusion of trial that he had previously been convicted in iowa for indecent contact with a child.
the jury found pierson guilty of one count of attempted production of child pornography,in violation of a,and one count of attempting to induce a child to engage in sexually explicit activities,in violation of b.at sentencing the district court found pierson eligible for the enhancement for repeat and dangerous offenders and the mandatory minimum sentence under e for offenders with a qualifying prior conviction under state law.
pursuant to,which covers offenses involving the sexual exploitation of a minor,pierson base offense level was.because the offense involved a minor between the age of twelve and sixteen,pierson offense level was increased by two pursuant to b b.because the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of the participant identity with the aid of a computer in order to persuade a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct,pierson offense level was increased by a further two levels.finally,because pierson is a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors under,his offense level was increased one additional level to and his criminal history category was increased from i to with a total offense level of and a criminal history category of v,pierson guideline sentencing range was to months.
the mandatory minimum sentence for attempted production of child pornography under a is fifteen years,but an individual with a prior qualifying conviction is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty five years or months under e.a conviction under b for attempting to induce a child to engage in criminal sexual activities carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years or months.the government did not object to a below guideline sentence.the district court sentenced pierson to months or twenty five years on count i and ten years on count ii,to be served concurrently.
on appeal,pierson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,the admission at trial of his prior conviction for indecent contact with a child,and his eligibility for both the enhancement and the statutory mandatory minimum under e.
pierson first contends that the record contains insufficient evidence to support his convictions,arguing that no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the elements of counts i and ii were satisfied.in determining whether sufficient evidence exists to support a conviction,we must decide whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in the original.evidence supporting conviction need not preclude every outcome other than guilty.united states ramirez,cir.moreover,t his standard is a strict one,and a jury verdict should not be overturned lightly.united states sykes,cir.
in order to convict a defendant of the crime of attempted production of child pornography,in violation of a,as charged in count i,the government must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant believed during the time period alleged in the indictment that the child named in the indictment was under the age of eighteen that the defendant attempted to use,persuade,induce,entice,or coerce that child to engage in sexually explicit conduct as defined in that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally engaged in this behavior for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct and that the materials used to attempt to produce the visual depiction were mailed,shipped,or transported,including by computer,in interstate or foreign commerce.
since pierson does not dispute element four,the question is only whether a reasonable jury could find that the government proved elements one through three beyond a reasonable doubt.in respect to element two,there was evidence that pierson attempted on numerous occasions to persuade the undercover profile to engage in sexually explicit conduct,as defined in,for transmission to him via a webcam.the evidence showed that pierson requested naked photos of the undercover profile,asked if she would perform sexually explicit acts in front of a webcam and transmit the images to him over the internet,requested her address so that he could send money to purchase the webcam,and offered to pay her if she would convince her twelve and thirteen year old friends to pose nude in front of the webcam.the government therefore carried its burden on element two.element three requires little comment.since there was no evidence that pierson was coerced into requesting these sexually explicit depictions or was actually seeking something altogether different,the government met its burden on the third element.
we also conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that pierson believed that the undercover profile was a minor.pierson relies primarily on the argument that his personal internet research and thorough questioning of the undercover profile show that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he believed he was communicating with a minor.there was evidence that after pierson requested a telephone number from the undercover profile,he discovered that the number had at one time been registered to a forty year old woman who was coincidentally named brenda.pierson repeatedly quizzed the undercover profile about her biography in an effort to determine whether she was actually fourteen.the jury could find from the evidence at trial that pierson attempts to determine the age of the undercover profile were designed not only to confirm that he was not communicating with an undercover officer,but also to confirm that he was communicating with a minor.
moreover,there was credible evidence that pierson believed that the undercover profile was a minor female.during one online chat with the undercover profile pierson stated that he believed that she was a fourteen year old female.during another online chat pierson stated i know your sic and in grade right i do not care if you are i still like you okay please just tell me the truth from now on please.i am going to like you and help you model for real.i am not going to get you in any trouble just please do not get me in any trouble okay pierson also told the postal inspector after his arrest that during the last two weeks i was starting to think she was fourteen.pierson was also wary of meeting with the undercover profile before she transmitted live images of herself to him via webcam.the following exchange is illustrative 
undercover profile r u ever gon na come c me since u aint sick no more 
pierson yes after i see you nude on the cam.
undercover profile 
pierson then i know your safe okay 
undercover profile huh 
pierson if i see you nude on the cam i will know yur real.
these facts,when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,would allow a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the essential elements of the offense.
in order to convict a defendant of the crime of attempting to induce a child to engage in criminal sexual activities,in violation of b,as charged in count ii,the government must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used a facility of interstate commerce,such as the internet or the telephone system that the defendant knowingly used the facility of interstate commerce with the intent to persuade or entice a person to engage in illegal sexual activity and that the defendant believed that the person he sought to persuade or entice was under the age of eighteen.the government need not prove that the defendant intended to participate in a physical sexual act.it is sufficient for the government to prove that the defendant intended to persuade or entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual activity.factual impossibility is not a defense to the charge.
we conclude that the government has carried its burden in count ii.pierson does not dispute element one.the same evidence that was relevant on count i for elements two and three of the crime of attempted production of child pornography is relevant to the second element of attempting to induce a child to engage in criminal sexual activities,and the evidence applying to the first element of the crime charged in count i is relevant to the third element of the crime of attempting to induce a child to engage in criminal sexual activities.
pierson next contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the government to cross examine him at trial about his prior conviction for indecent contact with a child.a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states cook,cir.
the district court admitted the evidence under federal rule of evidence b.under rule b,evidence of other crimes may not be offered to prove criminal propensity but it is admissible to prove motive,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,and absence of mistake or accident.united states johnson,cir.w e construe rule b as a rule of inclusion and have frequently upheld the admission of prior convictions in cases where the defendant denied committing the charged offense.cook,at.rule b is of course subject to the balancing requirement found in rule which requires the court to balance the probative value of evidence with its prejudice.id.thus,although all rule b evidence is inherently prejudicial,the test for exclusion under rule is whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.id.emphasis in the original.moreover,even unfairly prejudicial evidence is generally admissible if the person against whom the prejudicial evidence was offered opened the door to its admission by offering related favorable evidence.united states senffner,cir.
prior to trial pierson moved in limine to exclude his prior conviction for indecent contact with a child pursuant to rules and
