imaging business machines,llc,produces document scanners.it alleges that banctec,developed a competitive document scanner by copying trade secrets and confidential features of an imaging business machines scanner.
the district court orally denied imaging business machine motion for a preliminary injunction,finding a lack of evidence of damages.in so finding,the district court expressly discounted evidence that two customers purchased the infringing banctec scanner rather than a newer model of imaging business machines scanner.in a written amendment,the district court further reasoned that imaging business machines failed to show banctec copied features that were trade secrets.subsequently,the district court specifically limited discovery of damages to the scanner model that banctec copied.the district court then granted banctec motion for summary judgment for essentially the same reasons that it denied the preliminary injunction.imaging business machines appeals the grant of summary judgment we have jurisdiction pursuant to and reverse the grant of summary judgment.
in,imaging business machines began marketing the imagetrac i,a,color document scanner several years later,the company introduced the imagetrac ii to market,which model was both quicker and had a better camera.during this time,banctec began marketing its own scanners,the.in general,however,the two product lines did not compete with each other.indeed,banctec foreign subsidiaries purchased imagetrac scanners for resale,which imaging business machines as banctec scanners for the foreign subsidiaries.
on march,imaging business machines and banctec entered into a reseller agreement.the agreement required banctec to refrain from copying or reverse engineering imaging business machines products.the reseller relationship between the two companies continued after march.during and,banctec began development of a scanner that would directly compete with the imagetrac scanners.banctec developed its scanner by copying mechanical features of the imagetrac ii.
when imaging business machines asked banctec whether it was developing a scanner to compete with the imagetrac scanners,banctec falsely stated that it was not developing such a scanner.banctec introduced its scanner to the market as the docuscan in march.
during the same time that banctec developed the docuscan,imaging business machines developed and introduced two updated versions of its imagetrac scanners the imagetrac iii and iv.the primary difference between the imagetrac ii and iv is that the latter has a higher speed camera that allows the scanner to run faster.otherwise,the imagetrac iv generally uses the same mechanical components of the imagetrac ii that banctec copied and used to develop the docuscan.
banctec has sold at least eleven docuscan since its introduction.as to at least two of those sales,the customer purchased the docuscan rather than an imagetrac iv.imaging business machines,however,did not offer evidence that the docuscan specifically competed against an imagetrac ii for any particular sale,or that any customer purchased a docuscan rather than an imagetrac ii.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards that bound the district court,and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.cruz publix super,cir internal quotes and emphasis omitted.a grant of summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
we begin by examining whether summary judgment was appropriately granted as to imaging business machines claim for fraud because it failed to offer evidence supporting the element of injury in its motion for summary judgment,banctec attacked imaging business machines claim for fraud solely on the basis that the plaintiff was not injured.we conclude that banctec never met its initial burden on summary judgment.
in alabama,a party who commits a wrongful act is responsible for the injuries that the wrongful act causes to another.it is well established by many decisions in alabama that persons who perpetrate torts are,as a rule,responsible for the consequences of the wrongs they commit.that is,unless the tort be the proximate cause of the injury complained of,there is no legal accountability.louisville maddox,so.
proximate cause is an act or omission that in a natural and continuous sequence,unbroken by any new independent causes,produces the injury and without which the injury would not have occurred.the requirement of foreseeability is imposed to preclude a finding of liability when the defendant conduct was part of the causal chain of events leading to the injury but the resulting injury could not have been reasonably anticipated by the defendant.foreseeability does not require that the particular consequence should have been anticipated,but rather that some general harm or consequence could have been anticipated.
thetford city of clanton,so d.in the context of a motion for summary judgment arguing a lack of injury,the defendant initial burden is to show that a plaintiff lacks evidence regarding each injury alleged to be proximately caused by its wrong.
in this case,imaging business machines alleged in its complaint that it continued to sell scanners to banctec in reliance on the fraudulent representation that the latter was not developing a competing scanner.this imaging business machines lost the economic opportunity of altering its relationship with banctec from reseller to future plainly a sufficient allegation of an injury.although banctec correctly recited this allegation of injury in its motion,it nevertheless relied upon the district court finding first stated in the oral ruling denying the motion for a preliminary injunction that imaging business machines failed to show a loss of customers.the district court finding regarding lost customers,however,was irrelevant to whether imaging business machines lost the economic opportunity of altering its business relationship with banctec.further,banctec did not offer any other argument suggesting that imaging business machines could not offer evidence of the injury alleged in the complaint.accordingly,banctec did not meet its initial burden on summary judgment and the burden never shifted to imaging business machines to offer evidence of its injury resulting from the alleged fraud.
although the burden never shifted to imaging business machines to offer evidence that it suffered an injury,we note that it nevertheless offered sufficient evidence of several injuries proximately caused by the fraud to preclude a grant of summary judgment.first,imaging business machines submitted the affidavit of its president,gary murphy,that the corporation would have ceased selling scanners to banctec,thus limiting the latter access to the market,if the latter had truthfully stated that it was developing a competing scanner.a could readily infer that a manufacturer is injured when it loses an opportunity to timely react to a reseller plans to become a competitor.thus,murphy affidavit was sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact whether imaging business machines suffered the injury specifically alleged in the complaint.
second,as recognized by the district court,imaging business machines offered evidence that it lost two sales to banctec docuscan.plainly the loss of a sale is an injury.the district court,however,summarily discounted this evidence in its order denying the preliminary injunction solely because the sales involved the imagetrac iv rather than the imagetrac ii.the injured party,however,is not the imagetrac ii but is imaging business machines.thus,the relevant query is not limited to whether banctec conduct proximately caused injury to sales of the imagetrac ii,but whether that conduct proximately caused injury to imaging business machines.in light of the record established below,whether banctec fraudulent representation proximately caus
