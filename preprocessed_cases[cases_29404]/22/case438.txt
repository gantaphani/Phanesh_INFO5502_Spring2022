one social networking company,facebook,has sued another,power ventures,over a promotional campaign.power accessed facebook users data and initiated form emails and other electronic messages promoting its website.initially,power had implied permission from facebook.but facebook sent power a cease and desist letter and blocked power ip address nevertheless power continued its campaign.facebook alleges that power actions violated the controlling the assault of pornography and marketing act of,the computer fraud and abuse act of cfaa,and california penal code section.we hold that power did not violate the act because the transmitted messages were not materially misleading.we also hold that power violated the cfaa and california penal code section only after it received facebook cease and desist letter and nonetheless continued to access facebook computers without permission.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the district court.
background 
defendant power ventures,a corporation founded and directed by ceo steven vachani,who also is a defendant here,operated a social networking website.the concept was simple.individuals who already used other social networking websites could log on to and create an account.would then aggregate the user social networking information.the individual,a power user,could see all contacts from many social networking sites on a single page.the power user thus could keep track of a variety of social networking friends through a single program and could click through the central power website to individual social networking sites.by,the website had attracted a growing following.
plaintiff facebook also operates a social networking website.facebook users,who numbered more than million during power promotional campaign,can create a personal profile a web page within the site and can connect with other users.facebook requires each user to register before accessing the website and requires that each user assent to its terms of use.once registered,a facebook user can create and customize her profile by adding personal information,photographs,or other content.a user can establish connections with other facebook users by friending them the connected users are thus called friends.
facebook has tried to limit and control access to its website.a user generally may not use the website to send messages,post photographs,or otherwise contact facebook users through their profiles.instead,facebook requires developers or websites that wish to contact its users through its site to enroll in a program called facebook connect.it requires these third parties to register with facebook and to agree to an additional developer terms of use agreement.
in december,power began a promotional campaign to attract more traffic to its website it hoped that facebook users would join its site.power placed an icon on its website with a promotional message that read first people who bring new friends to win.the icon included various options for how a user could share power with others.the user could share with friends through my photos,share with friends through events,or share with friends through status.a button on the icon included the words yes,i do if a user clicked the yes,i do button,power would create an event,photo,or status on the user facebook profile.
in many instances,power caused a message to be transmitted to the user friends within the facebook system.in other instances,depending on a facebook user settings,facebook generated an message.if,for example,a power user shared the promotion through an event,facebook generated an message to an external account from the user to friends.the message gave the name and time of the event,listed power as the host,and stated that the power user was inviting the recipient to this event.the external were form,generated each time that a facebook user invited others to an event.the from line in the stated that the message came from facebook the body was signed,the facebook team.
on december,facebook first became aware of power promotional campaign and,on that same date,facebook sent a cease and desist letter to power instructing power to terminate its activities.facebook tried to get power to sign its developer terms of use agreement and enroll in facebook connect power resisted.facebook instituted an internet protocol ip block in an effort to prevent power from accessing the facebook website from power ip address.power responded by switching ip addresses to circumvent the facebook block.through this period,power continued its promotion even though it acknowledged that it took,copied,or made use of data from without facebook permission.
power campaign lasted less than two months.on december,facebook filed this action.toward the end of january,power ended its campaign.in april,power ceased doing business altogether.in total,more than external promoting power were sent through the facebook system.an unknown number of internal facebook messages were also transmitted.
in this action,facebook alleged violations of the cfaa,the act,and california penal code section and moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to facebook on all three claims.the district court awarded statutory damages of,compensatory damages,and permanent injunctive relief,and it held that vachani was personally liable for power actions.discovery disputes persisted after the judgment a magistrate judge ordered power to pay in costs and fees for a renewed federal civil procedure rule b deposition.power filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.defendants timely appeal both the judgment and the discovery sanctions.

discussion 
the act grants a private right of action for a provider of internet access service adversely affected by a violation of section a of this title.g.in relevant part,a makes it unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission,to a protected computer,of a commercial electronic mail message,or a transactional or relationship message,that contains,or is accompanied by,header information that is materially false or materially misleading.
the act does not ban spam outright,but rather provides a code of conduct to regulate commercial email messaging practices.gordon virtumundo,cir.to prove a violation of the statute,facebook can not simply identify excessive electronic messages.rather,assuming all facts in favor of the party,the offending messages must be materially false or materially misleading.a.
the statute provides that 
the term materially,when used with respect to false or misleading header information,includes the alteration or concealment of header information in a manner that would impair the ability of an internet access service processing the message on behalf of a recipient,a person alleging a violation of this section,or a law enforcement agency to identify,locate,or respond to a person who initiated the electronic mail message or to investigate the alleged violation,or the ability of a recipient of the message to respond to a person who initiated the electronic message.
id.a.a from line that accurately identifies any person who initiated the message shall not be considered materially false or materially misleading.id.a b.and,further,header information that is technically accurate but includes an originating electronic mail address,domain name,or internet protocol address the access to which for purposes of initiating the message was obtained by means of false or fraudulent pretenses or representations shall be considered materially misleading.id.a a.
here,two types of messages might rise to the level of materially misleading under the act external sent when power caused a facebook event to be created and internal facebook messages authored by power that power users transmitted to their facebook friends.
we first consider the external.facebook generated these whenever a power user created a facebook event,promoting power.the from line of the emails identified facebook as the sender.the body was signed thanks,the facebook team.the header stated that a friend of the recipient invited her to an event entitled bring friends and win bucks 
because the statute provides that a from line that accurately identifies a person who initiated the message is not misleading,it is relevant whether facebook,identified in the from line,initiated the messages.the statute defines initiate as to originate or transmit such message or to procure the origination or transmission of such message,but shall not include actions that constitute routine conveyance of such message.id.it provides that more than one person may be considered to have initiated a message.id.a power user gave power permission to share a promotion,power then accessed that user facebook data,and facebook crafted and caused form to be sent to recipients.these actions all go beyond the routine conveyance of a message.all the actions require some affirmative consent clicking the yes,i do button or some creative license designing the form.because more than one person may be considered to have initiated the message,we hold that,within the meaning of the statute,power users,power,and facebook all initiated the messages at issue.
because facebook among others initiated the messages,the from line accurately identified a person who initiated the messages.accordingly,the from line is not misleading within the meaning of the statute.similar reasoning also leads us to conclude that the header is technically accurate.because a power user consented to share power promotion through an event invitation,a header line that stated that a recipient friend invited the recipient to the event does not conceal or misstate a creator of the.
it is true that the act includes as materially misleading a technically accurate header that includes information accessed through false or fraudulent pretenses or representations.id.a a.but power users consented to power access to their facebook data.in clicking yes,i do,users gave power permission to share its promotion through event invitations.on this record,power did not use false pretenses or fraudulent representations to obtain users consent.therefore,the external messages were not materially misleading within the meaning of the act.
we next consider internal messages sent within the facebook system.we can find these messages misleading only if they impaired the ability of the recipient to respond to a person who initiated the electronic mail message or the ability of facebook to locate the initiator of the messages.id.a.two factors convince us that the messages are not misleading under this standard.first,the body of the messages included both power name and a link to the power website.a reasonable recipient could understand that power had drafted the message or had some part in its construction.second,facebook users who were identified as the senders did authorize the sending of these messages.it was not misleading for such users to be identified in internal messages sent through the facebook system.
because neither nor internal messages sent through power promotional campaign were materially misleading,power did not violate the act.we reverse the district court on this claim and remand for entry of judgment in favor of defendants.
the cfaa prohibits acts of computer trespass by those who are not authorized users or who exceed authorized use.it creates criminal and civil liability for whoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,and thereby obtains information from any protected computer.a c.the statute thus provides two ways of committing the crime of improperly accessing a protected computer obtaining access without authorization and obtaining access with authorization but then using that access improperly.musacchio united states.the cfaa provides a private right of action for a ny person who suffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section.g.
first,we hold that facebook suffered a loss within the meaning of the cfaa.the statute permits a private right of action when a party has suffered a loss of at least during a period.id.c a i i.the statute defines loss to mean any reasonable cost to any victim,including the cost of responding to an offense,conducting a damage assessment,and restoring the data,program,system,or information to its condition prior to the offense,and any revenue lost,cost incurred,or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.id.e.it is undisputed that facebook employees spent many hours,totaling more than in costs,analyzing,investigating,and responding to power actions.accordingly,facebook suffered a loss under the cfaa.
we next consider whether power accessed facebook computers knowing that it was not authorized to do so.we have previously considered whether a defendant has accessed a computer without authorization or in a manner that exceeds authorized access under the cfaa in three separate opinions.
most recently,in united states nosal,slip op.at cir.july,nosal ii,we considered the definition of without authorization.in that case,an employee,david nosal,had worked at an executive search firm,until he decided to leave and start his own competing business.id.at.though explicitly revoked nosal computer access credentials,nosal enlisted the support of his former executive assistant,who remained authorized to access the company computers.he used her password to continue accessing company computers and privileged information.id.at.after nosal was prosecuted and convicted under the cfaa,on appeal,we were asked to decide whether the without authorization prohibition of the cfaa extends to a former employee whose computer access credentials have been rescinded but who,disregarding the revocation,accesses the computer by other means.id.at.we concluded that it did.we held that 
without authorization is an unambiguous,term that,given its plain and ordinary meaning,means accessing a protected computer without permission.this definition has a simple corollary once authorization to access a computer has been affirmatively revoked,the user can not sidestep the statute by going through the back door and accessing the computer through a third party.
the holding in nosal ii clarified our two earlier cases on the cfaa.in lvrc holdings lcc brekka,cir,an employee logged onto his employer computer,accessed confidential information,and sent from the computer to himself and his wife with the intention of starting a competing business.we held that a person is without authorization under the cfaa when the person has not received permission to use the computer for any purpose such as when a hacker accesses someone computer without any permission,or when the employer has rescinded permission to access the computer and the defendant uses the computer anyway.id.at.because the employee had sent while he still had authorized access to the company computers,his actions did not constitute unauthorized use and did not run afoul of the cfaa.id.that fact was key had the employee accessed company computers without express permission,he would have violated the cfaa.i f the employee had accessed lvrc information on the load website after he left the company in september,the employee would have accessed a protected computer without authorization for purposes of the cfaa.id.at.
in united states nosal,cir.en banc nosal i,an earlier case stemming from the same events that led to nosal ii,we considered whether a group of employees who logged on to a work computer,downloaded information from a confidential database,and transferred it to a competing business exceed ed authorized access.id.at.wary of creating a sweeping mandate,we applied the rule of lenity to the cfaa and reversed liability for the defendant.id.at.the decision broadly described the application of the cfaa to websites terms of service.not only are the terms of service vague and generally unknown but website owners retain the right to change the terms at any time and without notice.id.at.as a result,imposing criminal liability for viola
