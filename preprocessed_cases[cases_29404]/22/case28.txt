we present a brief summary of the facts as the jury could have found them,or,for matters disposed of on summary judgment,as the summary judgment record compels us to take them.see kenda,pot money leagues,cir challenges to verdict hodgkins new england telephone,cir summary judgment standard.we reserve a more detailed discussion of some facts for our analysis.
uncle henry is a maine corporation based in augusta that publishes a swap or sell it guide.while best known in maine,the guide is also distributed throughout new england and parts of canada.uncle henry president and sole shareholder is joseph sutton,who resides in texas.his two sons,justin and jason,both residents of maine,run uncle henry operations.
uncle henry first website was launched in,with the intent of expanding uncle henry business to compete with and.this first website was not as successful as the suttons had hoped.further,because it was developed piecemeal,its structure and development were very poorly documented.ultimately,in the summer of,uncle henry sought to hire a website developer capable of creating a new and vastly improved website.
after considering certain other developers,uncle henry selected edgewing,a division of plaut,to build its new website.plaut is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in atlanta,georgia,and offices in various cities,including waltham,massachusetts.during extensive negotiations,the parties discussed such issues as migrating every feature from the existing website into the new site albeit in an improved form and the need to reverse engineer the existing site to determine its exact functions due to the shortcomings in the existing site documentation.the negotiations took place primarily in maine,although justin and jason sutton made one visit to plaut waltham facility.uncle henry ultimately accepted plaut proposal to build the new website for thereafter,the parties endeavored to reduce their understanding to a formal written contract,several versions of which passed among the parties and their respective attorneys.
the various versions of the contract included a generalized master agreement and a more specific website development statement of work sow,which included a scope matrix section that listed the various components of the proposed website collectively the contract.all versions provided that the contract would be governed by massachusetts law.
on october,justin sutton signed the then most recent version of the contract october contract and sent plaut two checks totaling.a check represented the first payment on the website development agreement,and a check represented the first payment on a separate website hosting agreement that the parties had entered into contemporaneously with the website development agreement the october contract contemplated a january,website completion date.plaut began work on the website development project in october,primarily in its atlanta office.plaut original staff on the project became known as team i.
on october,plaut notified uncle henry that its counsel wished to make further changes to the contract.a subsequent version november contract,signed by plaut president,paul shaughnessy,was sent to,but not signed by,uncle henry.further negotiations ensued.ultimately,on december,after approval by uncle henry counsel,justin sutton signed a revised version of the contract december contract.justin sutton acknowledged at his deposition that this document represented the parties agreement.nevertheless,the signed version of the december contract was apparently never sent to plaut.the december contract differed from the october contract in three significant respects it limited plaut liability to uncle henry to no more than the full contract price plus the value of any change orders,capped recoverable attorney fees at percent of plaut maximum liability and foreclosed consequential damages.a few weeks after signing the december contract,uncle henry purchased dell servers worth for use with the new website and delivered them to plaut waltham facility.
uncle henry maintains that,during the course of the negotiations and shortly thereafter,plaut made various misrepresentations regarding its capabilities,intentions,and the status of the project.further complicating matters,during both the negotiation and contract period,third parties performed work on the existing website for uncle henry.the parties dispute whether this outside work was further development of the site including new features or simply repairs and maintenance.
the parties difficulties began in november during the design phase of the project.during this phase,plaut attempted to get uncle henry to sign off on certain functional specifications.essentially,plaut asked uncle henry to agree that the only items that the new website needed to contain were those in a detailed list of functional specifications that plaut generated.plaut maintained that such a sign off was essential because plaut could not create a new website unless it knew exactly what the site was to contain.uncle henry was hesitant to agree,however,because it believed that the functional specifications tendered by plaut did not include all the features from the original site that uncle henry wanted incorporated.an impasse was reached,but plaut continued to work on the site without a final approval of its listed functional specifications.as deadlines came and went,plaut announced new completion dates,which also came and went.the design phase of the project was never completed.
on april,uncle henry sent a formal notice of default to plaut,triggering the cure period provided for in the contract.in the following weeks,there were heated negotiations for a new,modified contract,many of which took place between joseph sutton and paul shaughnessy.during this period,plaut assembled a second project team team ii to assess team i progress and determine how best to proceed on the project.among the options considered was starting the project over from scratch.during this period,work on the website was transferred from plaut atlanta office to its waltham facility 
the negotiations during this period appear to have been focused on the possibility of a new agreement that plaut would create a website that had the features uncle henry believed were required in the original agreement,but at an extended deadline date and for a sum approximately equal to the balance owed on the original contract.plaut expended significant resources working to create such a website during this period.no new agreement was reached,however,and uncle henry terminated the contract on july.the new uncle henry website was completed by stroudwater nhg stroudwater approximately one year later,at a cost to uncle henry of for the basic website and many hundreds of thousands of dollars more for additional features.
in due course,uncle henry brought this diversity action against plaut asserting violation of the massachusetts unfair trade practices act.laws ch.chapter,fraud,negligent misrepresentation breach of contract,and conversion uncle henry also sought a declaratory judgment that the december contract limitation clauses were unenforceable.plaut responded with a number of counterclaims breach of contract breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing quantum meruit and promissory estoppel.plaut also sought a declaratory judgment that the december contract governed the parties relationship.
after discovery,plaut filed a motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment on uncle henry various claims.the motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who issued a report and recommendation on the motion for summary judgment and on a motion to reconsider filed by uncle henry after his initial ruling see uncle henry,plaut consulting,d.
the magistrate judge rejected uncle henry chapter claim because the challenged activity did not occur primarily and substantially in massachusetts a statutory requirement.see id.at.in this respect,the magistrate judge looked to where the defendant committed the alleged deceptive acts,where the plaintiff was deceived and acted upon the deception,and the situs of plaintiff losses.see id.at applying the three factor test stated in roche royal bank of canada,cir.pointing out that all the challenged misrepresentations were received and relied upon in maine although some were also received in massachusetts,that the contract was primarily negotiated in maine,and that any damages were incurred in maine,the magistrate judge concluded that the deception was not centered in massachusetts.see id.he also emphasized that when deceptive statements are made in massachusetts but received and acted upon in another jurisdiction,the wrongful conduct does not occur primarily and substantially in massachusetts.see id.citing bushkin,raytheon,and m i heat transfer products,gorchev,cir.
the magistrate judge further concluded that the fraud and misrepresentation claims were governed by maine law and that plaut was entitled to summary judgment on the great majority of the allegedly misleading statements.see id.at specifically,he determined that of the alleged misrepresentations were not actionable under maine law for one of three reasons misrepresentations,and were mere promises of future performance misrepresentations,and were mere puffing and misrepresentations,and were not relied upon by uncle henry.id.at.in so ruling,the magistrate judge determined that uncle henry was not at plaut mercy because uncle henry was a sophisticated business entity and was represented by experienced counsel who could and did make a detailed investigation prior to uncle henry entering into the agreement.id.at.the only surviving misrepresentation number one was one plaut allegedly made in early december,about the amount of progress it was making on the project.id.at.
next,the magistrate judge determined that the december contract,with its significant limitation on damages,governed the parties relationship.see id.at.in reaching this conclusion,he deemed the following facts significant there was no prescribed method of acceptance,so uncle henry could accept by silence negotiations continued after uncle henry signed the october contract negotiations continued after plaut signed the november contract uncle henry counsel conveyed approval of the december contract to plaut uncle henry signed the december contract and uncle henry admitted that the december contract represented the parties agreement.id.at.the magistrate judge also concluded,in ruling upon uncle henry motion to reconsider,that even if the october contract was a binding contract,the december contract constituted a written modification of it.
finally,as to the conversion claim,the magistrate judge first concluded that it failed for a lack of evidence that plaut refused to return the equipment.see id.at.upon reconsideration,however,the magistrate judge concluded that there was a triable issue as to whether plaut had improperly failed to return the equipment during the period between the contract termination july,and the date that plaut attempted but failed to return the equipment august.
the parties filed numerous objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,but the trial judge adopted it in its entirety.thereafter,the case proceeded to trial on uncle henry claims of breach of contract fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and conversion,and plaut claims of breach of contract and quantum meruit.
at trial,both sides presented several occurrence witnesses and experts.uncle henry case theory was that it had relied upon plaut expertise in the development of the website,and plaut had failed to live up to its obligations under the contract.uncle henry asserted that plaut improperly narrowed the scope of its duties under the contract by declaring elements outside the scope of the contract,and improperly foisted website development obligations on uncle henry that should have fallen to plaut as the expert.uncle henry also maintained that plaut had misled it about progress on the new website,which led uncle henry to remain in the relationship longer than warranted to its detriment.
plaut responsive case theory was that uncle henry had been obliged to sign off on the functional specifications as a condition precedent to plaut performance,and that uncle henry failure to do so excused plaut from performing.indeed,plaut maintained that this failure rendered plaut timely performance impossible.plaut also argued that uncle henry breached the contract by unfairly insisting that plaut include features in the site that had not been bargained for.in so arguing,plaut took the position that uncle henry continued development of its original website during the design period made it impossible to determine the features from the old site that were to be incorporated into the new one.
following the close of evidence,the jury found that plaut breached the december contract,uncle henry was entitled to in damages for the breach,plaut did not commit fraud,plaut did make a negligent misrepresentation,uncle henry was entitled to in damages for this misrepresentation,plaut did not convert uncle henry property,there was no agreement to modify the december contract,uncle henry did not breach the december contract,plaut was entitled to a quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of its services performed after may,and plaut was entitled to recover for these services.
concerned about possible duplication of damages,the trial judge stated that judgment would not be entered until the parties had presented arguments concerning the appropriate interpretation of the verdict.the judge considered these filings to be separate from any motions that the parties would file.in response to these submissions,the court concluded that the breach of contract and quantum meruit judgments were sustainable.see uncle henry,plaut consulting,d.but,the court did reduce the award for the negligent misrepresentation count to.id.at.in so doing,the court found that uncle henry had expressly stipulated during the jury charge conference and closing argument that the only damages suffered due to the misrepresentation were those incurred in connection with its purchase of the dell servers.id.
the parties multiple other motions were essentially all denied except for uncle henry motion regarding an award of prejudgment interest.with regard to that motion,the district court concluded that,based upon the massachusetts choice of law provision in the contract,uncle henry was entitled to prejudgment interest on its contract damages at the percent rate specified under massachusetts law.the court applied the maine prejudgment interest rate on all other awards.
on appeal,uncle henry presents five arguments the district court erred in entering summary judgment against it on its chapter claim the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether the december contract bound the parties the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the bulk of uncle henry fraud and misrepresentation claims the jury quantum meruit award had no evidentiary support and the district court improperly granted a remittitur on the misrepresentation claim without giving uncle henry the option of a new trial.plaut presents three arguments in its the district court erred in upholding the negligent misrepresentation verdict the district court erred in upholding the breach of contract verdicts and the district court erred in applying the massachusetts percent prejudgment interest rate to the contract damages.for ease of analysis,we shall reconfigure some of these arguments and address at least some of them under more general headings.

challenges to entry of summary judgment 
the claims 
uncle henry argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on of its alleged misrepresentations.uncle henry asserts that the court erroneously applied maine choice of law principles in concluding that maine law applied,erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that certain statements were mere puffing,and erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that certain statements were nonactionable promises of future performance uncle henry argues that the jury could have found all the misrepresentations to have been actionable because plaut controlled the information presented to uncle henry,and because the misrepresentations were intended as assurances as to facts rather than mere opinions.uncle henry also maintains that there was a issue as to whether it was entirely at plaut mercy regarding the veracity of plaut statements.
as to the choice of law issue,the parties agree that maine looks to the restatement second of conflict of laws,and that conclusion is consistent with our precedent.see ricci alternative energy,cir.for claims of fraud and misrepresentation,the restatement provides 
when the plaintiff action in reliance took place in whole or in part in a state other than where the false representations were made,the forum will consider such of the following contacts,among others,as may be present in the particular case in determining the state which,with respect to the particular issue,has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties 
a the place,or places,where the plaintiff acted in reliance upon the defendant representations 
b the place where the plaintiff received the representations 
c the place where the defendant made the representations 
d the place of incorporation and place of business of the parties 
e the place where a tangible thing which is the subject of the transaction between the parties was situated at the time and 
f the place where the plaintiff is to render performance under a contract which he has been induced to enter by the false representations of the defendant.
restatement second of conflict of laws.
we discern no error in the magistrate judge conclusion that maine law governs uncle henry fraud and misrepresentation claims.while uncle henry is correct that few of the factors took place entirely in a particular state,each factor occurred primarily in a particular state.four factors weigh in favor of maine uncle henry acted in reliance on the misrepresentations in maine,uncle henry received all the misrepresentations in maine although some were also received in massachusetts,uncle henry is incorporated in maine and has its principal place of business in maine,and uncle henry would perform under the contract predominantly in maine.that plaut made most of the misrepresentations in massachusetts and that the unfinished website would be hosted in massachusetts do not significantly alter the balance.
turning to whether the magistrate judge properly entered summary judgment against uncle henry on of the alleged misrepresentations,we begin by noting that uncle henry has presented its challenge to these rulings at so high a level of generality,and in such an manner,as to render any individualized assessment of each of the magistrate judge specific rulings an exercise in guesswork.such an individualized assessment of the various statements is critical,as the various representations are of different types and were made at different times,and some could conceivably qualify as actionable under the relevant legal standards while others may not.under the circumstances,we think that uncle henry has forfeited the right to an individualized assessment of the correctness of the magistrate judge rulings with regard to each of the statements in question.united states zannino,cir judges are not expected to be mindreaders.consequently,a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold its peace citation and internal quotation omitted.
this still leaves uncle henry more general argument,which is that all of the contested if they would ordinarily constitute statements of opinion,promises of future performance,or mere puffing,see,kearney king auction,cir veilleux national broadcasting,cir schott motorcycle supply,american honda motor,cir are actionable here because uncle henry was at plaut mercy due to plaut exclusive control over the relevant information its deliberate concealment of critical information during the course of the negotiations.see kearney,at exception to general rule that statements of opinion or future performance are nonactionable if receiver is at the mercy of speaker veilleux,at the relationship of the parties or the opportunity afforded for an investigation and the reliance,which one is thereby justified in placing on the statement of the other,may transform into an averment of fact that which under ordinary circumstances would be merely an expression of opinion citation and internal quotations omitted schott,at puffing statements may be deemed actionable if,under the circumstances,they could be reasonably understood as assurances as to specific facts,rather than mere opinion in this case,no reasonable factfinder could agree with uncle henry premise that it was at plaut mercy with regard to these representations.rather,as the magistrate judge correctly observed,uncle henry is a sophisticated business entity and was represented in the transaction by experienced counsel who investigated the proposed transaction at great length before uncle henry entered into the agreement.we also note that uncle henry negotiated the agreement aggressively the contract price was percent lower than the original bid,had experience with website development based upon its own efforts from,and was in contact with plaut developers during the project.we can discern no error.
contract issues 
uncle henry argues that granting summary judgment on the issue of which contract governed the parties relationship was improper because there were disputed issues of fact that warranted taking the matter to the jury.uncle henry claims that the december contract can not be binding because it did not constitute a valid offer by plaut and uncle henry never manifested acceptance of it.in its view,signing a document without delivering it to,or providing any other indication of assent to,the opposing party is not sufficient to constitute acceptance as a matter of law.uncle henry further maintains that a reasonable jury could conclude that the october contract is the controlling document because it was signed by uncle henry,it was delivered to plaut,uncle henry made the first payment based upon it,and plaut conveyed acceptance by cashing the check and starting performance.relatedly,uncle henry contends that the december contract was not a modification of the october contract finally,uncle henry asserts that,because the december contract does not govern the parties relationship,the district court erred in applying its significant limitations on damages.
we think that the magistrate judge alternate even if the october contract was a binding contract,the december contract constituted a written modification of unassailable and renders further discussion academic.the october contract contains the following provision 
section amendment and waiver 
no supplement,modification,amendment or waiver of this master agreement or any sow shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party against whom enforcement of such supplement,modification,amendment or waiver is sought 
there is no dispute that plaut is seeking to enforce the december contract limitation provisions against uncle henry,and that justin sutton signed the december contract and acknowledged that it represented the parties agreement.the october contract requires nothing more for a successful modification.thus,even if the parties formed a valid contract in october,the december contract would govern their relationship as a binding,written modification that superseded the october contract.
chapter claim 
uncle henry maintains that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its chapter claim.uncle henry argues that the magistrate judge applied a legal standard in assessing the viability of the claim,and,as a consequence,erred in concluding that the alleged deceptive practices did not take place primarily and substantially in requirement for the operation of chapter.
after the magistrate judge ruled,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts issued a ruling disavowing the use of any particular set of factors in determining whether alleged wrongful conduct occurred primarily and substantially in massachusetts for purposes of chapter.see kuwaiti danish computer digital equip.instead,the court opted to apply a more general standard which looks to whether the center of gravity of the circumstances that give rise to the claim is primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.kuwaiti danish,at.we have acknowledged this modification in massachusetts law.see kenda,at.
uncle henry says that,under kuwaiti danish,a number of facts not taken into account by the magistrate judge militate in favor of a finding that the conduct at issue occurred primarily and substantially within massachusetts.but the facts that uncle henry tenders,even if made newly relevant by kuwaiti danish a matter we do not decide,are not difference makers.some of the facts certainly remain largely beside the point,notably that the existing website was hosted in massachusetts and that the servers for the new website were stored in massachusetts and as to the other factors,they simply do not outweigh the facts that informed the magistrate judge ruling.
in holding that a set list of factors was of limited utility to the chapter inquiry,see at,the kuwaiti danish court certainly did not hold or imply that the factors identified by the district court derived from our roche decision are irrelevant to the chapter calculus.nor did the court suggest that its prior decisions regarding how particular fact patterns are to be interpreted for purposes of chapter situs example,situations in which a misrepresentation is made in massachusetts to a third party in another state who relies upon it there,see bushkin,at been overruled or superseded.most significantly,kuwaiti danish did not retreat from the proposition that,if the significant contacts of the competing jurisdictions are approximately in the balance,the conduct in question can not be said to have occurred primarily and substantially in massachusetts.see bushkin,at see also auto shine car wash systems,nice n clean car wash,applying bushkin in danish case in determining whether plaintiff satisfied the primarily and substantially requirement.and under bushkin,the magistrate judge decision was clearly correct,especially in view of his finding that the alleged misrepresentations were received primarily in maine,where their impact primarily was felt.d at.
challenges to the trial results 
the quantum meruit award 
uncle henry argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law because the jury quantum meruit award can not be sustained.uncle henry provides several reasons why quantum meruit is based on contract principles and no new agreement was formed after uncle henry issued the default letter the parties relationship was governed by an express contract,which was not terminated until july,rendering quantum meruit inapplicable plaut did not expect payment beyond that contemplated in the contract the circumstances show that plaut work was done gratuitously no services were rendered to uncle henry,as the partial website was worthless and plaut presented inadequate evidence of proper quantum meruit damages,as the cost of its services does not reflect their true value of.
to sustain a claim for quantum meruit under maine law,which the parties agree governs here,the claimant must establish that services were provided to the other party by the claimant,that the services were provided with the knowledge and consent of the other party,and that the services were rendered under circumstances that make it reasonable for the claimant to expect payment.see jenkins walsh,me.d amages are not measured by the benefit realized and retained by the defendant,but rather are based on the value of the services provided by the plaintiff.paffhausen balano,me.mathematical certainty is not required in determining quantum meruit damages.see jenkins,at.while quantum meruit is based upon implied contract principles,the formalities of an express contract are not required,and recovery may be had even if there is not a clear agreement by both sides to the same terms.see paffhausen,at see also forrest passamaquoddy tribe,me quantum meruit is a theory.
uncle henry arguments can be dispensed with in short order.its contention that a modification agreement was never agreed to is irrelevant.it is undisputed that the parties were aggressively seeking to create a new agreement,and one does not need a formal contract to collect quantum meruit damages.see paffhausen,at.
uncle henry alternative assertion that an express contract already governed the parties relationship and therefore precluded a quantum meruit action also falls short.as an initial matter,a viable quantum meruit claim can with an express contract.see,combustion engineering,miller hydro group,applying maine law,aff,cir prest town of farmington,me.but in any event,while the contract was not formally terminated until july,the jury was entitled to find that the parties dealings were during the period relevant to plaut quantum meruit claim,given the apparent impossibility of completing the website during the cure period and the immediate,intense negotiations for a new,modified contract.maine courts have applied the quantum meruit doctrine in circumstances where parties continue to work together to complete a project after a material breach of their underlying contract.see,jenkins,at.the jury was entitled to find that this was such a situation.
all of uncle henry other arguments invite us to disregard the jury prerogative as.we decline the invitation.the jury heard voluminous and conflicting evidence regarding the negotiations for a new agreement,the dispute about the scope of the original contract,the parties expectations regarding payment,plaut reliance on the negotiations,both parties actions during this period,the completeness and quality of plaut work on the website including demonstrations of the website,and the efforts and resources expended by plaut during the relevant period.the jury weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences,judges the credibility of witnesses and draws the ultimate conclusions as to the facts.blake pellegrino,cir citation and internal quotation omitted.the jury was free to credit plaut evidence over uncle henry on these issues.
the breach of contract award 
plaut argues that the jury award of damages for breach of contract can not stand.plaut maintains that no rational jury could have concluded that uncle henry fulfilled the condition precedent to plaut on a basic website design.plaut also contends that the district judge erred in concluding that the contract was ambiguous,which opened the door to jury confusion by permitting uncle henry to introduce irrelevant and misleading evidence about the contract terms.in plaut view,uncle henry should not receive any award to compensate it for the stroudwater website,as the arrangement with stroudwater was not reasonable cover under the contract.plaut further maintains that,to the extent that uncle henry is entitled to any contract award,it should be limited to the amount that uncle henry paid to plaut under the contract.
from plaut perspective,uncle henry failure to agree on a website design excused plaut from any obligation to provide a completed website by the date.but in so arguing,plaut seeks to disregard the opposing evidence.uncle henry presented considerable evidence showcasing plaut role in the failure to finalize a design.as we have just stated,it is the jury role to assess conflicting evidence.see united states patel,cir.here the jury decision is adequately supported.
as to whether the district court erred in concluding that the contract was ambiguous and allowing extrinsic evidence to be presented plaut thesis is that there is no ambiguity because the scope matrix in the sow completely and unambiguously laid out exactly what the new website was to contain.plaut position is unpersuasive.
a contract is not ambiguous simply because the parties interpret it differently it is ambiguous only if the language is susceptible to more than one meaning and reasonable persons could differ as to which meaning was intended.see foisy,at.here there was ample support for the district judge conclusion that the contract was ambiguous.first,the scope matrix included several sections marked tbd,meaning to be determined.thus,the scope matrix was obviously not complete in and of itself as to every detail.second,the sow included both the statement that the existing website will be migrated to the new platform with the term migrated undefined and unelaborated references to contemplated improvement s and enhancement s of the migrated features third,the sow stated that a website was to be developed that would include the items in the scope matrix,which does not necessarily imply that the website was to be restricted to the items listed.fourth,the items discussed in the scope matrix were stated in such a clipped manner that a reader could not reasonably have understood what they consist of without an explanation.
plaut also maintains that the award can not stand because the website ultimately created by stroudwater was not reasonable cover under the contract.the parties agreement provided a choice of the following remedies to uncle henry in the event of a breach by plaut i a complete refund of amounts paid hereunder plus relocation costs under section,or ii reasonable costs of cover in obtaining development services from another qualified provider of the services described herein as necessary to attain go live status for such a web site.plaut concedes that a replacement website need not be identical to the one that plaut attempted to create,but argues that the stroudwater website could not reasonably be regarded as cover because it was based on a different software platform and included features not included in the agreement between plaut and uncle henry,and because stroudwater made no attempt to complete the site that plaut had partially built.
plaut again disregards the evidence presented to the jury that was contrary to its position.the jury heard evidence about the stroudwater arrangement,expert assessments of the quality and degree of completion of the plaut website,expert assessments of the utility of completing the plaut web site,uncle henry activities in obtaining the website from stroudwater,and plaut assessment of its own progress.significantly,the jury did not award uncle henry the full value of the basic stroudwater contract.we may infer that the jury partially credited plaut evidence and reduced uncle henry award accordingly.as to the amount of the award,t ranslating legal damage into money damages is a matter peculiarly within the jury ken.monroig,cir citation and internal quotation omitted.plaut presents no basis for disturbing the balance struck by the jury on this issue.
the negligent misrepresentation award 
both sides challenge the award of on the negligent misrepresentation claim.uncle henry claims that it is entitled to the jury original award of for the following reasons the award was not excessive and was amply supported by the evidence the district court engaged in an improper remittitur procedure that deprived uncle henry of its seventh amendment jury trial rights uncle henry did not stipulate to a lesser recovery,as lawyer argument is neither evidence nor a de facto jury instruction and the award was not duplicative,as the jury clearly intended to award uncle henry the full value of the stroudwater contract,but deducted the that it awarded uncle henry under the misrepresentation theory from the contract award to avoid duplication.for its part,plaut argues that the award can not stand because the jury rejected the conversion claim,it is duplicative of the contract award,there was no reliance on the alleged misrepresentation,the alleged misrepresentation was not a cause for the equipment being purchased,and uncle henry suffered no damages,as the equipment has not declined in value and remains available for uncle henry.
uncle henry claims are undermined by the following statement made by counsel during closing argument 
did plaut commit fraud on uncle henry as the court has defined it.we submit the answer is clearly yes.what are the damages for that.the damages are that uncle henry right after that,that same month,went out and purchased the dell equipment.and in that dell equipment,they spent that would not have been spent because justin testified we would have gone forward with the contract had we known about that fraud.
the next question is for negligent misrepresentation,and it slightly different from fraud,but basically the same facts,and the same number would apply here.
the next one is for a conversion,did plaut consulting convert the equipment.we talked about the facts for that.the amount of the damages would be this same amount.
emphasis added.perhaps more significantly,similar comments were made in the jury instruction conference,in which uncle henry emphasized that the misrepresentation damages were limited to the value of the dell equipment to allay the trial judge concerns about duplication issues among the various claims.
on this record,the district court was justified in concluding that uncle henry stipulated to damages in the amount of on the misrepresentation claim,or,phrased differently,waived any damages in excess of on the claim uncle henry made an affirmative representation to the court and opposing counsel,and the district court was entitled to hold uncle henry to it.see generally cmm cable,ocean coast,cir we consider an express representation by an officer of the court to be a solemn undertaking,binding on the client.crellin,equipmentlease,cir counsel is not free to disclaim statements made in closing argument united states coady,cir counsel stipulation eliminated a defense see also south port marine llc gulf oil,d,plaintiff lawyer waived damages in excess of amount requested at closing argument,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds,cir.thus,contrary to uncle henry view,there was no improper remittitur procedure here.rather,at most,there was a correction to a jury award that was mistakenly duplicative of uncle henry contract damages to the extent that it exceeded.if a verdict form is not precise enough for the jury to account for duplicative damages,the trial judge can resolve any dispute that emerges after the verdict is rendered.see garshman,cir see also britton maloney,cir involving adjustments by the trial judge to avoid duplicative recovery
