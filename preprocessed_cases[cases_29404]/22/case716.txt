intellectual ventures i llc iv sued symantec and trend micro together,appellees or defendants for infringement of various claims of patent the patent,the patent,and the patent.the district court held the asserted claims of the patent and the patent to be ineligible under,and the asserted claim of the patent to be eligible.we affirm as to the asserted claims of the patent and patent,and reverse as to the asserted claim of the patent.
background 
iv owns the three patents at issue the patent,the patent,and the patent.iv sued symantec and trend micro,two developers of and software,for infringement of various claims of those patents.against symantec,iv asserted claims,and of the patent claims,and of the patent and claim of the patent.against trend micro,iv asserted claims,and of the patent and claims,and of the patent.
with respect to the two defendants,a patent eligibility issue arose at different stages of the proceedings.the case against symantec went to trial.the jury found that symantec had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that any asserted claims were invalid under and.the jury found symantec had infringed the asserted claims of the patent and patent,and had not infringed any asserted claims of the patent after trial,symantec brought a motion under fed.civ.c for a judgment that all the asserted claims of the three are unpatentable under,an issue not addressed in the jury verdict.
the case against trend micro did not go to trial.trend micro brought a motion for summary judgment of invalidity under for all of the asserted claims after trend motion had submitted its motion,iv withdrew its assertion of claim of the patent against trend micro,the only claim of the patent asserted against trend micro.thus the motions raised issues of patent eligibility as to the and patents with respect to both defendants,and as to the patent only with respect to symantec.
the patent is entitled,distributed content identification system.the patent application was filed on december,and the patent issued on october.the patent is directed to methods of screening emails and other data files for unwanted content.
the patent is entitled,automated post office based rule analysis of messages and other data objects for controlled distribution in network environments.the patent application was filed on june,and the patent issued on june.the patent is directed to methods of routing messages based on specified criteria,rules.
the patent is entitled,computer virus screening methods and systems.the patent application was filed on february,and the patent issued on november.the patent is directed to using computer virus screening in the telephone network.
in both cases the district court determined that the asserted claims of the patent and patent claimed ineligible subject matter under,and granted appellees motions with respect to those patents.the district court held,however,that symantec had failed to establish that the asserted claim of the patent is under,and denied symantec motion with respect to that patent.
final judgment was entered in favor of symantec and trend micro that the asserted claims of the and patents are under.id.see final judgment following jury trial symantec final judgment,intellectual ventures i llc symantec.march,ecf at judgment,intellectual ventures i llc trend micro.june,ecf at.this resolved all claims against trend micro.with respect to symantec,the district court entered final judgment in favor of iv that symantec infringed claim of the patent with damages in the amount of million,and that claim was also not proved invalid by symantec under or,or under.see symantec final judgment at.
iv now appeals the district court ineligibility determinations with respect to the patent and patent as to symantec and trend micro,and symantec the determination of eligibility for the patent.we have jurisdiction under a.

section of title defines subject matter.it provides,w hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process,machine,manufacture,or composition of matter,or any new and useful improvement thereof,may obtain a patent therefor.for over years,the supreme court has recognized an implicit exception to these broad categories encompassing l aws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas,which are not patentable.mayo collaborative servs.prometheus,citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also bilski kappos.
in mayo and in alice,the court set forth a framework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature,natural phenomena,and abstract ideas from those that claim applications of those concepts.alice.cls bank int l.at step one,a court must determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those concepts.id.the category of abstract ideas embraces fundamental economic practice s long prevalent in our system of commerce,id.at quoting bilski,at,including longstanding commercial practice s and method s of organizing human activity,id.but the category of abstract ideas is not limited to economic or commercial practices or methods of organizing human activity.see infra note.
if a claim is directed to a concept,the court must proceed to step two,and ask,what else is there in the claims before us alice,at citation and internal quotation citation omitted.step two is a search for an inventive concept,an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
at step two,the search is for an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into a application.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.and s imply appending conventional steps,specified at a high level of generality,which are well known in the art and consist of,routine,conventional activit ies previously engaged in by workers in the field,is not sufficient to supply the inventive concept.id.at,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the patent 
the district court held the asserted claims of the patent claims,and directed to filtering that have unwanted content.we agree with the district court.the parties agree that independent claim is representative.it recites 
a method for identifying characteristics of data files,comprising receiving,on a processing system,file content identifiers for data files from a plurality of file content identifier generator agents,each agent provided on a source system and creating file content ids using a mathematical algorithm,via a network 
determining,on the processing system,whether each received content identifier matches a characteristic of other identifiers and 
outputting,to at least one of the source systems responsive to a request from said source system,an indication of the characteristic of the data file based on said step of determining.
patent,ll.according to iv,this method of filtering emails is used to address the problems of spam and the use of to deliver computer viruses.
we agree with the district court that receiving and other data file identifiers,characterizing based on the identifiers,and communicating the characterization in other words,filtering is an abstract idea.
the supreme court has held that fundamental practice s long prevalent are abstract ideas.alice,at.the supreme court and we have held that a wide variety of and other activities constitute abstract ideas 
here,it was practice for people receiving paper mail to look at an envelope and discard certain letters,without opening them,from sources from which they did not wish to receive mail based on characteristics of the mail the list of relevant characteristics could be kept in a person head.characterizing based on a known list of identifiers is no less abstract.the patent merely applies a idea using generic computers to the particular technological environment of the internet.ddr holdings,llc,fed.cir.
the asserted claims of the patent also resemble claims we have held were directed to an abstract idea.recently,in bascom global internet services,mobility llc,we held that a claim to a content filtering system for filtering content retrieved from an internet computer network,to prevent users from accessing certain websites is directed to an abstract idea,fed.cir.and in content extraction,at,cert.denied,we found that the asserted patents were drawn to the abstract idea of collecting data,recognizing certain data within the collected data set,and storing that recognized data in a memory.
because we hold the asserted claims of the patent are directed to an abstract idea,we proceed to step two to determine whether the claims contain an inventive concept that renders them.claims that amount to nothing significantly more than an instruction to apply an abstract idea using some unspecified,generic computer and in which each step does no more than require a generic computer to perform generic computer functions do not make an abstract idea,alice,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted,because claiming the improved speed or efficiency inherent with applying the abstract idea on a computer does not provide a sufficient inventive concept.intellectual ventures i llc capital one bank usa intellectual ventures capital one bank,fed.cir.
iv argues that the jury verdict determined that symantec proffered prior art did not anticipate or render obvious the asserted claims of the patent,and that the jury anticipation and obviousness determination is inconsistent with a determination that the claims are.while the claims may not have been anticipated or obvious because the prior art did not disclose determining whether each received content identifier matches a characteristic or outputting an indication of the characteristic of the data file,that does not suggest that the idea of determining and outputting is not abstract,much less that its implementation is not routine and conventional.
indeed,t he novelty of any element or steps in a process,or even of the process itself,is of no relevance in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the categories of possibly patentable subject matter.diamond diehr,emphasis added see also mayo,at rejecting the government invitation to substitute,and inquiries for the better established inquiry under here,the jury general finding that symantec did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that three particular prior art references do not disclose all the limitations of or render obvious the asserted claims does not resolve the question of whether the claims embody an inventive concept at the second step of.
the steps of the asserted claims of the patent do not improve the functioning of the computer itself,alice,at,for example by disclosing an improved,particularized method of digital data compression,ddr holdings,at,or by improving the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory,enfish,llc microsoft,fed.cir.rather,these claims use generic computers to perform generic computer functions.
in intellectual ventures capital one bank,we found abstract an method for tracking financial transactions to determine whether they exceed a spending limit,budgeting.at.the fact that the claims recite d budgeting using a communication medium broadly including the internet and telephone networks,did not render the claims any less abstract.id.we also found abstract claims related to customizing website information based on information known about the user and navigation data,and similarly held that a generic web server with attendant software tasked with tailoring information and providing it to the user provides no additional limitation beyond applying an abstract idea,restricted to the internet,on a generic computer.id.at.
the claims here are also distinguishable from those in bascom,which allegedly improved an existing technological process by describing how a particular arrangement of elements is a technical improvement over prior art ways of filtering internet content,a filter implementation versatile enough that it could be adapted to many different users preferences while also installed remotely in a single location.at.there is not,in the patent,any specific or limiting recitation of improved computer technology,cls bank int l alice,fed.cir.en banc lourie,concurring,as the asserted claims describe only generic computer elements.
finally,iv argues that the patent shrink s the protection gap and moot s the volume problem.iv opening br.at.according to iv,the protection gap is the period of time between identification of a computer virus by an provider and distribution of that knowledge to its users.id.at.the volume problem is the exponential growth in malware and spam,increasing the amount of antivirus signatures to be downloaded.id.at.however,the asserted claims do not contain any limitations that address the protection gap or volume problem,by requiring automatic updates to the antivirus or antispam software or the ability to deal with a large volume of such software.we have explained that,for a perceived abstract idea,if the claim contains an inventive concept sufficient to transform the claimed abstract idea into a application,then the claims pass the test of eligibility under section.internet patents,at emphasis added quoting alice,at.but when a claim directed to an abstract idea contains no restriction on how the result is accomplished and t he mechanism is not described,although this is stated to be the essential innovation,id.at,then the claim is not.
the asserted claims of the patent are not under.
the patent 
the district court held ineligible claims,and of the patent,which relate to systems and methods for receiving,screening,and distributing,and we agree.according to iv,claim is representative of how the patent screens and recites 
a post office for receiving and redistributing email messages on a computer network,the post office comprising 
a receipt mechanism that receives an message from a sender,the message having at least one specified recipient a database of business rules,each business rule specifying an action for controlling the delivery of an message as a function of an attribute of the message 
a rule engine coupled to receive an message from the receipt mechanism and coupled to the database to selectively apply the business rules to the message to determine from selected ones of the business rules a set of actions to be applied to the message and 
a distribution mechanism coupled to receive the set of actions from the rule engine and apply at least one action thereof to the message to control delivery of the message and which in response to the rule engine applying an action of deferring delivery of the message,the distribution engine automatically combines the email message with a new distribution list specifying at least one destination post office for receiving the message for review by an administrator associated with the destination post office,and a rule history specifying the business rules that were determined to be applicable to the message by at least one rule engine,and automatically delivers the message to a first destination post office on the distribution list instead of a specified recipient of the message.
the written description is particularly useful in determining what is or conventional.see,internet patents,at.the patent abstract describes the invention as a system,method and various software products for automatic deferral and review of messages and other data objects in a networked computer system,by applying business rules to the messages as they are processed by post offices.patent,abstract.claim also describes the patented system as a post office albeit an electronic one.patent,ll.the district court held that the asserted claims of the patent are directed to concepts,which could be implemented in,for example,a post office.
we agree,and think the district court analogy to a corporate mailroom is also useful.such mailrooms receive correspondence,keep business rules defining actions to be taken regarding correspondence based on attributes of the correspondence,apply those business rules to correspondence,and take certain actions based on the application of business rules.those actions include gating the message for further review as in claim,and also releasing,deleting,returning,or forwarding the message,as described elsewhere in the patent,see,ll.
indeed,in recounting the background of the invention,the patent states,
m any corporate organizations have elaborate methods to control the flow of memorandum,publications,notices,and other printed information within the organization.an organization may limit the types of documents employees can distribute at work,and in some cases,control which persons within an organization communicate with each other.these various rules are typically documented as part of the organization business communication policies.
id.at,ll.thus,the patent itself demonstrates that the claimed systems and methods of screening messages are abstract ideas,fundamental practice s long prevalent in our system and method s of organizing human activity.alice,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also intellectual ventures capital one bank,at.
and iv itself informed the district court,in its technology tutorial,i n the typical environment,the post office resides on a mail server,where the company emails are received,processed,and routed to recipients.conceptually,this post office is not much different than a united states postal service office that processes letters and packages,except that the process is all and done electronically in a matter of seconds.
this demonstrates that the concept is and abstract.furthermore,with the exception of generic steps,there is nothing in the claims themselves that foreclose them from being performed by a human,mentally or with pen and paper.see cybersource,at.indeed,the specification expressly states that one type of post office,the gatekeeping post office,which provides for administrative review and processing of gated messages provides for both manual review by a gatekeeper a person designated to review gated messages and automatic review and processing.patent,ll.see also id.at,ll.the patent is directed to a conventional business practice the screening of messages by corporate organizations in the context of electronic communications.
since the claims are directed to an abstract idea,we proceed to step two.according to the specification,the claims can operate on a conventional communications network.id.at.the post offices are c ommunicatively coupled to the network through conventional protocols,and conventional mail servers and conventional post server combinations may be present.id.at,ll.the patent discloses only generic computers performing generic functions t he rule enforcing post offices and gatekeeping post offices are preferably implemented as software products executing on conventional computers,such as ibm compatible computers based on intel pentium processors.the servers operate in conjunction with conventional operating systems,such as unix,or microsoft or windownt.id.at,ll.the specification thus confirms that the implementation of the abstract idea is routine and conventional.the patent does not improve the functioning of the computer itself.alice,at citation omitted.nor does it solve a challenge particular to the internet.ddr holdings,at.
iv argues that the claims do not merely require routine and conventional use of computers and the internet because applying business rules to email is not what computers and the internet do in the absence of this claim limitation and because computers and the internet do not have rule engines as a matter of course.iv opening br.at.but the inquiry is not whether conventional computers already apply,for example,business concepts like hedging or intermediated settlement.rather,we determine whether each step does no more than require a generic computer to perform generic computer functions.alice,at emphasis added.here that is the case.
the asserted claims of the patent are not under.
the patent 
claim is the only asserted claim of the patent.the district court held eligible claim of the patent.claim depends from claim,which provides 
a virus screening method comprising the steps of 
routing a call between a calling party and a called party of a telephone network 
receiving,within the telephone network,computer data from a first party selected from the group consisting of the calling party and the called party 
detecting,within the telephone network,a virus in the computer data and 
in response to detecting the virus,inhibiting communication of at least a portion of the computer data from the telephone network to a second party selected from the group consisting of the calling party and the called party.
patent,ll.claim recites 
the virus screening method of claim further comprising the step of determining that virus screening is to be applied to the call based upon at least one of an identification code of the calling party and an identification code of the called party.
unlike the asserted claims of the and patents,claim involves an idea that originated in the computer era computer virus screening.but the idea of virus screening was nonetheless well known when the patent was filed.performing virus screening was a long prevalent practice in the field of computers,and,as the patent admits,performed by many computer users.the patent acknowledges that,prior to the invention,m any computer users had virus screening and detection software installed on their computers.id.at,ll.claim of the patent,however,does not claim a new method of virus screening or improvements thereto in fact,it requires only detecting a virus in the computer data.id.at,ll.the specification recites conventional virus screening software.see,patent,ll.by itself,virus screening is and constitutes an abstract idea.
at step two of,there is no other aspect of the claim that is anything but conventional.
the patent is directed to the use of virus screening software within the telephone network or the internet.we have previously determined that performing otherwise abstract activity on the internet does not save the idea from being.as we said in intellectual ventures capitol one bank,a n abstract idea does not become nonabstract by limiting the invention to a particular technological environment,such as the internet.w hile the claims recite budgeting using a communication medium broadly including the internet and telephone networks,that limitation does not render the claims any less abstract.at.see also ultramercial,at fed.cir.the claims invocation of the internet also adds no inventive concept.as we have held,the use of the internet is not sufficient to save otherwise abstract claims from ineligibility under.
just as performance of an abstract idea on the internet is abstract,so too the performance of an abstract concept in the environment of the telephone network is abstract,as intellectual ventures capitol one bank recognized.our recent decision in tli communications involved a similar situation.there,we held that a challenged claim was drawn to the concept of classifying an image and storing the image based on its classification.at.this was abstract because w hile the asserted claim requires concrete,tangible components such as a telephone unit and a server,the specification makes clear that the recited physical components merely provide a generic environment in which to carry out the abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in an organized manner.id.here,the recitation of a telephone network,like the telephone unit and server in tli communications,merely provides a generic environment in which to carry out the and abstract idea of virus screening.
nor does the asserted claim improve or change the way a computer functions.claim recites no more than generic computers that use generic virus screening technology.but the mere recitation of a generic computer can not transform a abstract idea into a invention.alice,at.for the role of a computer in a invention to be deemed meaningful in the context of this analysis,it must involve more than performance of,routine,and conventional activities previously known to the industry.content extraction,at quoting alice,at.
as the district court determined,claim calls for at least three computers the computer of the first party or sending party,the virus screening computer,and the computer of the second or receiving party.the sending and receiving computers can be generic they perform only sending and receiving functions.see buysafe,at.the virus screening computer fares no better.according to the specification,v irus screening can be facilitated in the telephone network using either a conventional telephone network processor adapted to run associated virus screening software or an additional processor which runs virus screening software.the processor can augment conventional network elements patent,ll,emphasis added.as is well known,each of the processors can have one or more associated modems to modulate computer data for transmission,and to demodulate received computer data.id.at,ll.there is no indication that the virus screening software installed on a conventional telephone network processor is any different than the virus screening software m any computer users have installed on their computers.id.at,ll.these generic computer components are insufficient to add an inventive concept to an otherwise abstract idea.tli commc ns,at.
iv argues that t he claims of the patent include meaningful limitations that narrow the claimed invention to a specific way of screening for computer viruses within the telephone network and does not preempt all virus detection.iv response and reply br.at.a narrow claim directed to an abstract idea,however,is not necessarily,for w hile preemption may signal patent ineligible subject matter,the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility.ariosa diagnostics,sequenom,fed.cir.see also oip,at t hat the claims do not preempt all price optimization or may be limited to price optimization in the setting do not make them any less abstract.
in summary,unlike the claims at issue in enfish,which involved a specific type of data structure designed to improve the way a computer stores and retrieves data in memory,at,claim of the patent does not improve or change the way a computer functions.nor does claim overcome a problem unique to the internet as was the case in ddr holdings.at.
citing bascom,the dissent argues that claim constitutes an improvement of the network itself and,thus,focuses on improving computers as tools.dissenting op.at.contrary to the dissent,this case is unlike bascom,where,o n a limited record and when viewed in favor of the patentee,the claims alleged a technical improvement over prior art ways of filtering internet content.at.the patent in bascom did not merely move existing content filtering technology from local computers to the internet which would not contain an inventive concept,but overc a me existing problems with other internet filtering systems,it solved the problem of inflexible remote filtering schemes caused by simply moving filtering technology to the internet by enabling individualized filtering at the isp server.id at.in other words,the patent in bascom did not purport to improve the internet itself by introducing prior art filtering technology to the internet.rather,the bascom patent fixed a problem presented by combining the two.here the record does not indicate that claim recites any improvement to conventional virus screening software,nor does claim solve any problem associated with situating such virus screening on the telephone network.
the dissent nonetheless urges that there are two advantages to using virus screening on the telephone network that qualify as inventive concepts shifting virus detection away from the networks of the sender and recipient,which allows users to communicate over a network without concern of receiving computer viruses and closing the protection gap,the problem of individual computer users having to periodically update their virus screening software.dissenting op.at.
regarding shifting virus detection to the telephone network,the claimed inventive solution of claim is to utilize an intermediary computer in forwarding information.but that solution is perfectly conventional and is applied any time an recipient performs virus screening and,acting as an intermediary,forwards the email to another recipient.as discussed above,there is no claim here describing a particular method of incorporating virus screening into the internet to be sure,it may be that other claims that recite particular features of intermediate computers,modeling to match the recipient computer architecture incorporate an inventive concept,but those claims are not before us.
as to the protection gap,claim of the patent does not describe or require a solution to the protection gap.see supra at explaining that the language of the challenged claims of the patent do not address the protection gap.the district court erred in relying on technological details set forth in the patent specification and not set forth in the claims to find an inventive concept.see accenture,at t he complexity of the implementing software or the level of detail in the specification does not transform a claim reciting only an abstract concept into a system or method.content extraction,at we focus here on whether the claims of the asserted patents fall within the excluded category of abstract ideas.emphasis added.
as we explained in tli communications,the claim here is not directed to a specific improvement to computer functionality.rather,it is directed to the use of conventional or generic technology in a nascent but environment,without any claim that the invention reflects an inventive solution to any problem presented by combining the two.at 
claim of the patent is not under.
costs to defendants.
i agree that all claims on appeal fall outside of.i write separately,however,to make two points patents constricting the essential channels of online communication run afoul of the first amendment and claims directed to software implemented on a generic computer are categorically not eligible for patent.
t he constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.this right to receive information and ideas,regardless of their social worth,is fundamental to our free society.stanley georgia,citations omitted.patents,which function as monopolies,invade core first amendment rights when they are allowed to obstruct the essential channels of scientific,economic,and political discourse.see united states playboy entm t,the distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree.see also in re tam,fed.cir.en banc explaining that the government may impermissibly burden speech even when it does so indirectly.
although the claims at issue here disclose no new technology,they have the potential to disrupt,or even derail,large swaths of online communication.patent the patent purports to cover methods of identifying characteristics of data files,patent,whereas patent the patent broadly claims systems and methods which allow an organization to control internal email distribution,patent,ll.patent the patent describes,in sweeping terms,screening a communication for viruses or other harmful content at an intermediary location before delivering it to an addressee.see patent,ll.the asserted claims speak in vague,functional language,giving them the elasticity to reach a significant slice of all email traffic.see gottschalk benson,benson explaining that claims are patent eligible only if they contain limitations sufficiently definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds.indeed,the claims of the patent could reasonably be read to cover most methods of screening for harmful content while data is being transmitted over a network.see patent,ll.describing screen ing computer data for viruses within a telephone network before communicating the computer data to an end user.
suppression of free speech is no less pernicious because it occurs in the digital,rather than the physical,realm.w hatever the challenges of applying the constitution to technology,the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press,like the first amendment command,do not vary when a new and different medium for communication appears.brown entm t merchs.ass n,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.essential first amendment freedoms are abridged when the patent and trademark office pto is permitted to balkanize the internet,granting patent owners the right to exact heavy taxes on conduits for online expression.
like all congressional powers,the power to issue patents and copyrights is circumscribed by the first amendment.see golan holder,eldred ashcroft.in the copyright context,the law has developed first amendment accommodations.eldred,at see also park fly,dollar park fly,noting that the lanham act contains safeguards to prevent trademark protection from tak ing from the public domain language that is merely descriptive.specifically,copyright law distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection.eldred,at see also harper row publishers,nation,explaining that copyright dichotomy supplies a definitional balance between the first amendment and the copyright act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author expression citations and internal quotation marks omitted.it also applies a fair use defense,permitting members of the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work,but also expression itself in certain circumstances.eldred,at see t he fair use of a copyrighted work,including such use by reproduction in copies for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.
just as the dichotomy and the fair use defense serve to keep copyright protection from abridging free speech rights,restrictions on subject matter eligibility can be used to keep patent protection within constitutional bounds.section creates a zone and places within it the indispensable instruments of social,economic,and scientific endeavor.see alice cls bank int l,emphasizing that the building blocks of human ingenuity are patent ineligible benson,at stating that mental processes and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable,as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work.online communication has become a basic tool,benson,at,of modern life,driving innovation and supplying a platform for political dialogue.see ultramercial,hulu,llc,fed.cir.noting that the internet is a ubiquitous medium see also telecom ass fed.commc comm n,cir.explaining that online communication has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives,from profound actions like choosing a leader,building a career,and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie.section,if properly applied,can preserve the internet open architecture and weed out those patents that chill political expression and impermissibly obstruct the marketplace of ideas.
as both the supreme court and this court have recognized,section imposes a threshold test,bilski kappos,one that must be satisfied before a court can proceed to consider subordinate validity issues such as under or adequate written description under.see parker flook,flook the obligation to determine what type of discovery is sought to be patented so as to determine whether it falls within the ambit of section must precede the determination of whether that discovery is,in fact,new or obvious.in re comiskey,fed.cir.only if the requirements of are satisfied is the inventor allowed to pass through to the other requirements for patentability,such as novelty under and under.citations and internal quotation marks omitted state bank trust signature fin,fed.cir.explaining that section is t he first door which must be opened on the difficult path to patentability citations and internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,if claimed subject matter is not even eligible for patent protection,any pronouncement on whether it is novel or adequately supported by the written description constitutes an impermissible advisory opinion.see,golden zwickler,emphasizing that article iii courts do not render advisory opinions citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the public has a paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope.cuozzo speed,llc lee,citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also medtronic,mirowski family ventures,llc.nowhere is that interest more compelling than in the context of claims that threaten fundamental first amendment freedoms.see palko connecticut,f reedom of thought and speech is the matrix,the indispensable condition,of nearly every other form of freedom.as the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed,the internet deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion.aclu reno,supp,aff.a robust application of section at the outset of litigation will ensure that the essential channels of online communication remain free to all men and reserved exclusively to none,funk brothers seed kalo inoculant.
most of the first amendment concerns associated with patent protection could be avoided if this court were willing to acknowledge that alice sounded the death knell for software patents.the claims at issue in alice were directed to a system for mitigating settlement risk.at.although the petitioners argued that their claims were patent eligible because they were tied to a computer and a computer is a tangible object,the supreme court unanimously and emphatically rejected this argument.id.at.the court explained that the mere recitation of a generic computer can not transform a abstract idea into a invention.id.at.accordingly,t he fact that a computer necessarily exist s in the physical,rather than purely conceptual,realm is beside the point in the section calculus.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
software is a form of language in essence,a set of instructions.see microsoft,explaining that software is the set of instructions,known as code,that directs a computer to perform specified functions or operations citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also defining a computer program,for purposes of the copyright act,as a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.it is inherently abstract because it is merely an idea without physical embodiment,microsoft,at emphasis added.given that an idea is not patentable,see,benson,at,and a generic computer is beside the point in the eligibility analysis,alice,at,all software implemented on a standard computer should be deemed categorically outside the bounds of section.
the central problem with affording patent protection to software is that standard computers have long been ceded to the public domain.see flook,at i n granting patent rights,the public must not be deprived of any rights that it theretofore freely enjoyed citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because generic computers are ubiquitous and indispensable,in effect the basic tool,benson,at,of modern life,they are not subject to the patent monopoly.in the section calculus,adding software which is as abstract as language to a conventional computer which rightfully resides in the public domain results in a patent eligibility score of zero.see alice,at stating an abstract idea while adding the words apply it with a computer simply combines those two steps,with the same deficient result.
software lies in the antechamber of patentable invention.because software is an idea insufficiently linked to any defining physical structure other than a standard computer,it is a precursor to technology rather than technology itself.see mackay radio.radio,while a scientific truth,or the mathematical expression of it,is not patentable invention,a novel and useful structure created with the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.it is well past time to return software to its historical dwelling place in the domain of copyright.see benson,at citing a report from a presidential commission explaining that copyright is available to protect software and that software development had undergone substantial and satisfactory growth even without patent protection citations and internal quotation marks omitted oracle,google,fed.cir.noting that several commentators have argue d that the complex and expensive patent system is a terrible fit for the software industry and that copyright provides a perfectly adequate means of protecting and rewarding software developers for their ingenuity citations and internal quotation marks omitted peter menell,an analysis of the scope of copyright protection for application programs,stan,explaining that patents were historically not seen as a viable option for the protection of most application program code and that many software programs simply do not manifest sufficient novelty or nonobviousness to merit patent protection.
software development has flourished despite not because of the availability of expansive patent protection.see brief of amicus curiae frontier found.in support of respondents,alice,wl,at eff brief the software market began its rapid increase in the early more than a decade before the federal circuit concocted widespread software patents in obviously,no patents were needed for software to become a industry by.mark lemley,software patents and the return of functional claiming,software patents have created a large number of problems for the industry,particularly for the most innovative and productive companies.t he existence of a vibrant open source community suggests that innovation can flourish in software absent patent protection.footnote omitted wendy seltzer,software patents software development,brook,seltzer present knowledge and experience now offer sufficient evidence that patents disserve software innovation.arti rai,john allison,bhaven sampat,university software ownership and litigation a first examination,while most small biotechnology firms that receive venture financing have patents,the available empirical evidence indicates that most software that receive venture financing,particularly in the first round,do not have patents.
from an eligibility perspective,software claims suffer from at least four insurmountable problems.first,their scope is generally vastly disproportionate to their technological disclosure.in assessing patent eligibility,the underlying functional concern is a relative one how much future innovation is foreclosed relative to the contribution of the inventor.mayo collaborative servs.prometheus,see also motion picture patents universal film,t he inventor is entitled to the exclusive use of just what his inventive genius has discovered.it is all that the statute provides shall be given to him and it is all that he should receive,for it is the fair as well as the statutory measure of his reward for his contribution to the public stock of knowledge.software patents typically do not include any actual code developed by the patentee,but instead describe,in intentionally vague and broad language,a particular goal or objective.see dan burk mark lemley,is patent law,berkeley tech,unfortunately,the federal circuit peculiar direction in the software enablement cases has effectively nullified the disclosure requirement for software patents.and since source code is normally kept secret,software patentees generally disclose little or no detail about their programs to the public.footnote omitted.here,for example,the patent discusses the objective of screen ing computer data for viruses before communicating the computer data to an end user,patent,ll,but fails to disclose any specific,inventive guidance for achieving that goal.in effect,the patent,like most software patents,describes a desirable destination but neglects to provide any intelligible roadmap for getting there.
a second,and related,problem with software patents is that they provide incentives at the wrong time.because they are typically obtained at the idea stage,before any real inventive work has been done,such patents are incapable of effectively incentivizing meaningful advances in science and technology.a player focused on patenting can obtain numerous patents without developing any of the technologies to useful levels of deployment or disclosure,leaving a minefield of abstract patent claims for others who actually deploy software.seltzer,brook.at.here,for example,it took no significant inventive effort to recognize that communications should be screened for harmful content before delivery.the hard work came later,when software developers created screening systems capable of preventing our email boxes from being overrun with spam or disabled by viruses.granting patents on software ideas before they have been actually reduced to practice has created a perverse incentive scheme.under our current regime,those who scamper to the pto early,often equipped with little more than vague notions about using computers to automate business and social practices,can reap hefty financial dividends.by contrast,those who actually create and deploy useful products are rewarded with mammoth potential infringement liability.see id.at in software the long road from idea to implementation often snags on patents early in the course.engineers can describe what they want software to do in terms that have been sufficient for the pto well before they have made it work.pressures to patent early produce a thicket of claims.eff brief,wl,at describing a study which found that between and,percent of patent lawsuits involved software patents,accounting for percent of the increase in the number of patent defendants during this timeframe.
yet another intractable problem with software patents is their sheer number.see brief of amici curiae checkpoint software,et in support of respondents,alice,wl,at b ecause computer products as opposed to patents inevitably integrate complex,multicomponent technology,any given product is potentially subject to a large number of patents.some industry experts have estimated that patents go into a modern smartphone.citations omitted.given the vast number of software patents most of which are replete with broad,functional claims it is virtually impossible to innovate in any technological field without being ensnared by the patent thicket.see id.describing the overwhelming set of overlapping patent rights that impede innovation.software patents impose a deadweight loss on the nation economy,erecting often insurmountable barriers to innovation and forcing companies to expend exorbitant sums defending against meritless infringement suits.see shawn miller,fuzzy software patent boundaries and high claim construction reversal rates,stan.tech,patent litigation is so expensive it has been described as the sport of kings.these expenses,however,may be dwarfed by the social cost of patent litigation in reducing incentives for producers to bring innovative products to market.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.
fourth,and most fundamentally,software invariably lacks the concrete borders the patent law demands.see,digital equip.altavista,supp,the internet has no territorial boundaries.to paraphrase gertrude stein,as far as the internet is concerned,not only is there perhaps no there there,the there is everywhere where there is internet access.patent protection is all about boundaries.an applicant has the right to obtain a patent only if he can describe,with reasonable clarity,the metes and bounds of his invention.see festo shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki,explaining that the patent monopoly is a property right and like any property right,its boundaries should be clear.a properly issued patent claim represents a line of demarcation,defining the territory over which the patentee can exercise the right to exclude.see nautilus,biosig instruments,emphasizing that a patent must be precise enough to afford clear notice of what is claimed,thereby appris ing the public of what is still open to them citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
software,however,is akin to a work of liter
