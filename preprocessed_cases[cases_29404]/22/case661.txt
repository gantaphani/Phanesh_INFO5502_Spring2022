the main issue in this appeal is whether the prying by a former bureaucrat is criminal that is,whether the defendant violated the computer fraud and abuse act,which prohibits intentionally access ing a computer without authorization or exceed ing authorized access,and thereby obtain ing information from any department or agency of the united states.a b.roberto rodriguez,a former employee of the social security administration,appeals his conviction for violating the act on the grounds that he did not exceed his authorized access to his former employer databases and that he did not use the information to further another crime or to gain financially.the administration prohibits accessing information on its databases for nonbusiness reasons,and rodriguez at trial admitted that he accessed information for nonbusiness reasons when he obtained personal identifying information,such as birth dates and home addresses,of persons he knew or their relatives.rodriguez also appeals his sentence of months of imprisonment on the ground that it is unreasonable.because the record establishes that rodriguez exceeded his authorized access and the act does not require proof that rodriguez used the information to further another crime or to gain financially,we affirm his conviction.we also conclude that rodriguez sentence is reasonable.
