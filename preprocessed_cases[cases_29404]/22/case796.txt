during prosecution of the patent,the examiner rejected all of the pending claims under a as obvious over patent lewen in view of patent arbel.on may,filed a response to that office action in which it distinguished lewen,which discloses a local area network that integrates voice,data,and image information over a single transmission link,by arguing that the claimed voice packets proceed directly from the communications system through the telephone line to a receiving communications system at the other end of the line.also described its specification as disclosing a communications system which operates over a standard telephone line,which establishes a connection between telephone equipment on each end of the line.notwithstanding arguments,the examiner again rejected the claims as obvious over lewen in view of arbel.on november,amended the claims that issued as claims and of the patent to require a modem,explaining that the claimed voice packets are sent through a modem connection between sites.both of responses to the examiner office actions were filed in the united states patent and trademark office pto after the patent had issued but before the patent issued 
on february,filed suit against in the united states district court for the district of minnesota for infringement of the,and patents as well as patent.on june,microsoft filed suit against in that same court,seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement,invalidity,and unenforceability of seven patents.filed a counterclaim alleging that microsoft infringed the,and patents.
in august,the district court construed the disputed claim terms for the two cases in a single markman order.microsoft,civil,wl,markman order.first and foremost,the court concluded that,for all five patents at issue,the intrinsic evidence limited inventions to use of a direct telephone line connection,slip op.at see also id.at.in particular,the court held that had disclaimed the transmission of information through a network such as the internet,based on the statements that it had made during prosecution of the patent.id.at.second,the court determined that the specification requires that the headers attached to the computer digital data packets identify the packet type and packet length and that the headers attached to the digital voice data packets identify whether the voice data contain silent sound or speech information.id.at,see also id.at.third,the court concluded that,acting as its own lexicographer,had defined the term multiplexing to be the combining of voice data and conventional data for transmission through the same channel by dynamically changing the time allocations for transmission of each type of data such that has higher priority over,and is substituted for silence packets which are detected and discarded.id.at see also id.at.fourth,the court construed the term speaker phone as describing a hardware arrangement integrated into a sophisticated telephone apparatus with its attached handset,headset and a telephone operation using the integrated microphone and speaker system.id.at citation omitted.the court also ruled that the term speaker phone refers to a telephone with a speaker that allows two people to talk at the same time and that it works in mode through the use of voice echo cancellation.id.at see also id.at.finally,the court construed the term digitizing to mean converting analog voice signals into digital signals.id.at.
following the district court claim construction order,stipulated that microsoft and did not infringe under those claim constructions.in the microsoft case,the court granted the parties joint motion for entry of final judgment of noninfringement of the,and patents pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b the court also stayed microsoft claims of invalidity and unenforceability pending this court resolution of the issues relating to claim construction and infringement.microsoft final judgment,slip op.at.in the case,the district court likewise entered a final judgment of noninfringement of the,and patents,but on the basis that counsel had conceded at the markman hearing that could not prove infringement literally or under the doctrine of equivalents if the court were to rule that had disclaimed transmission through a network.final judgment,slip op.at.

a.the sending,transmitting,and receiving limitations 
on appeal,first challenges the district court construction of the limitations that refer to sending,transmitting,and receiving data packets in claim of the patent claims,and of the patent and claim of the patent.argues that the court erred in restricting those limitations to the transmission of data packets over a direct telephone line connection.according to,the claims are directed only to the ends of the disclosed communications system and do not address what happens once the data packets are sent from the local user to the telephone line.also argues that the specification describes a telephone line connected to a modem,which may be a direct connection or may connect to a network such as the internet.furthermore,maintains that it did not disclaim transmission through a network during prosecution of the patent because it distinguished the lewen reference by amending claims and to require a modem.also argues that the term,which it used in remarks made to the pto during prosecution,can refer to a connection made over a network.in any event,contends,any disclaimer arising from the statements made during prosecution of the patent should not be applied to the other two patents because the patent issued before those statements were made and because the inventions claimed in the and patents are distinct from the invention claimed in the patent.
microsoft and respond that the claim language,particularly that of claim of the patent,and the specification require a direct connection over a telephone line.they also argue that the prosecution history of the patent mandates such an interpretation because defined its invention as establishing a direct connection between the local and remote sites over a telephone line and argued that its claims require a connection from the communications system through the telephone line to a receiving communications system at the other end of the line.finally,microsoft and maintain that the prosecution history of the patent is relevant to an understanding of the other two patents,which stem from the same parent application and share a common specification.
thus,the parties dispute over the sending,transmitting,and receiving limitations reduces to a single issue whether those limitations are restricted to communications over a telephone line or whether they may encompass communications over a network such as the internet.for the reasons enumerated below,we agree with microsoft and that the district court properly construed the sending,transmitting,and receiving limitations in the,and patents as being limited to communications over a telephone line and excluding the use of a network.
claim interpretation begins with the claims themselves,the written description,and,if in evidence,the prosecution history.ccs fitness,brunswick.claim language generally carries the ordinary meaning of the words in their normal usage in the field of invention.invitrogen biocrest.although it is improper to read a limitation from the specification into the claims,comark communications,harris,c laims must be read in view of the specification,of which they are a part,markman,at see also united states adams,d c laims are to be construed in the light of the specifications and both are to be read with a view to ascertaining the invention.slimfold kinkead,claims are not interpreted in a vacuum,but are part of and are read in light of the specification.indeed,o ne purpose for examining the specification is to determine if the patentee has limited the scope of the claims.watts xl.when the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature,that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of the claims of the patent,even though the language of the claims,read without reference to the specification,might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question.scimed life,advanced cardiovascular.a patentee may also limit the scope of the claims by disclaiming a particular interpretation during prosecution.biodex loredan.
we thus begin our analysis with the claim language itself.claim of the patent recites a modem connected to a telephone line for receiving incoming packets from a remote site and for sending the outgoing packets to the remote site in full duplex communication mode.patent,ll.claim of the patent requires sending the outgoing packets to a remote site over a telephone line using a modem and receiving incoming packets through the modem from the remote site.id.at,ll.similarly,claim of the patent recites transmitting the compressed outgoing digital voice packets on a communication line using a modem and receiving the compressed incoming digital voice data packets from the communication line.id.at,ll.claim of the patent and claim of the patent recite transmitting the outgoing packet stream and receiving multiplexed incoming data.patent,ll.patent,ll.
from the plain language of those claims,only claim of the patent explicitly states that the transmission of data packets between the local site and the remote site must occur over a telephone line.claim of the patent similarly refers to a telephone line,but is more ambiguous in that it refers to the modem connection rather than the data transmission.and the language of claim of the patent,claim of the patent,and claim of the patent is even more broad.it makes no reference to a telephone line and standing alone does not exclude data transmission over a network 
nonetheless,the claims must be interpreted in light of the specification,which is identical for all three patents and which repeatedly and consistently describes the local and remote systems of the claimed inventions as communicating directly over a telephone line.the summary of the invention portion of the specification states that the claimed personal communications system includes hardware to enable voice,fax and data communications with a remote site connected through a standard telephone line,patent,ll.as well as circuitry to transfer data over the telephone lines to a remote site,id.at,ll.the specification further discloses that the hardware components of the local system communicate over a standard telephone line to one of a variety of remote sites.id.at,ll.it then describes various preferred embodiments of the invention,in all of which the hardware components of the local system communicat e over a standard telephone line to the disclosed hardware components,a facsimile machine,a modem,or a standard telephone at the remote site.id.at,to,id.at.the specification also discloses that the system allows the user to connect to remote locations equipped with a similar system or with modems,facsimile machines or standard telephones over a single analog telephone line.id.at,ll.
those statements,some of which are found in the summary of the invention portion of the specification,are not limited to describing a preferred embodiment,but more broadly describe the overall inventions of all three patents.indeed,they characterize the entire personal communications system as enabling communications between a local site and a remote site over a telephone line.moreover,those descriptions of the claimed inventions are by no means limited to just the ends of the communications system as argues.on the contrary,they explain that data packets from a local site are transferred over or through a telephone line to a remote site,making clear that the communications link between the local and remote systems is a telephone line.in fact,the specification refers to data transmission over or through a telephone line roughly two dozen times.nowhere does it even suggest the use of a network.in light of those clear statements in the specification that the invention the present system is directed to communications over a standard telephone line,we can not read the claims of the patent,the patent,or the patent to encompass data transmission over a network such as the internet.instead,the specification shared by all three patents leads to the inescapable conclusion that the communications between the local and remote sites of the claimed inventions must occur directly over a telephone line.see scimed life,at concluding that the common specification of three patents led to the inescapable conclusion that their claims required coaxial lumens,even though the claim language itself was not so limited see also alloc,int l trade comm n,concluding that,read as whole,the common specification of three patents led to the inescapable conclusion that the claimed inventions must include play in every embodiment,even though the claim language was not so limited.accordingly,we construe the sending,transmitting,and receiving limitations of the,and patents to require that the claimed data packets travel directly from a local site to a remote site and vice versa over a telephone line and not a network.
furthermore,an examination of the patent prosecution history confirms that viewed its inventions as being limited to communications over a telephone line.in response to the examiner first office action,took the opportunity to provide a summary of the invention before addressing the rejection.it stated 
in their specification,applicants disclose a communications system which operates over a standard telephone line.such a telephone line is commonly referred to in the art as a plain old telephone service pots line and establishes a connection between telephone equipment on each end of the line.applicants invention transmits the packets across a pots line to a remote site 
citations omitted.that statement,which expressly related to the specification shared by all three patents and the communications system disclosed in all three patents,makes clear that viewed the local and remote sites of its inventions as communicating directly over a telephone line.again,it does not describe just the connection at the ends of the claimed communications system,but explicitly states that the data packets travel across a telephone line to a remote site and further describes that path as being a connection between each end.that statement unambiguously reflects own understanding of its inventions in the,and patents as being limited to the transmission of data packets over a telephone line.we can not construe the claims to cover subject matter broader than that which the patentee itself regarded as comprising its inventions and represented to the pto 
moreover,although made the statement during prosecution of the patent,it is also applicable to both the and the patents.in the past,we have held that the prosecution history of one patent is relevant to an understanding of the scope of a common term in a second patent stemming from the same parent application,jonsson stanley works,see also laitram morehouse,applying the prosecution histories of two sibling patents,which shared a common written description,to one another.we likewise believe that statement made during prosecution of the patent is relevant to an understanding of the common disclosure in the sibling and patents.statement was expressly directed to the communications system disclosed i n the specification.that communications system encompasses the inventions of all three patents,see patent,ll.stating that the communications system contains multiple inventions,and as noted above,the specification is identical for all three patents.statement to the pto was thus not limited to the invention disclosed in the patent,but was a representation of its own understanding of the inventions disclosed in all three patents.we therefore conclude that that statement from the patent prosecution history is pertinent to an interpretation of the later issued patent.see elkay ebco,applying the prosecution history of one patent to a related,subsequently issued patent.
furthermore,even though the patent had already issued,we think that it is not unsound to apply the same interpretation to that patent.we take the patentee at its word and will not construe the scope of the patent claims more broadly than the patentee itself clearly envisioned.we also reject argument,based on united states gypsum,that the statements made during prosecution of the patent should not be applied to the patent because the examiner could not have relied on those statements in allowing the claims of the patent.we have stated on numerous occasions that a patentee statements during prosecution,whether relied on by the examiner or not,are relevant to claim interpretation.laitram,at the fact that an examiner placed no reliance on an applicant statement distinguishing prior art does not mean that the statement is inconsequential for purposes of claim construction.du pont de nemours phillips petroleum,regardless of the examiner motives,arguments made during prosecution shed light on what the applicant meant by its various terms.is not to the contrary.in that case,we rejected the argument that the patentee was bound by statements made by the applicant in connection with a later application after the patent in suit had already issued,at.the accused infringer argued that the patentee was foreclosed by the later statement from arguing in favor of a broader construction of the earlier patent,even though intrinsic evidence supported that broader construction.we rejected the argument that the patentee was bound,or estopped,by a statement made in connection with a later application on which the examiner of the first application could not have relied.we did not suggest,however,that such a statement of the patentee as to the scope of the disclosed invention would be irrelevant.any statement of the patentee in the prosecution of a related application as to the scope of the invention would be relevant to claim construction,and the relevance of the statement made in this instance is enhanced by the fact that it was made in an official proceeding in which the patentee had every incentive to exercise care in characterizing the scope of its invention.accordingly,we conclude that statements made during the prosecution of the patent with regard to the scope of its inventions as disclosed in the common specification are relevant not only to the and patents,but also to the earlier issued patent.
in sum,based on our analysis of the claim language,the specification,and the prosecution history,we conclude that the district court properly interpreted the sending,transmitting,and receiving limitations of the,and patents as requiring the direct transmission of data packets between the local and remote sites over a telephone line and excluding the use of a network such as the internet.this conclusion in and of itself leads to our affirmance of the district court decisions.however,inasmuch as other issues of claim construction were decided by the district court and argued before us,we consider it to be in the interest of judicial efficiency,as well as in the interest of any future litigation concerning these patents,to review the other contested claim limitations 
multiplexing 
next challenges the district court construction of the claim term multiplexing in claim of the patent and claim of the patent.argues that the court improperly imported limitations from the specification into the claims by requiring that voice data have priority over computer data and that computer data be substituted for detected and discarded silence packets.
microsoft responds by pointing out that the parties agreed that acted as its own lexicographer in defining the term multiplexing.therefore,microsoft argues,the specification definition of the term multiplexing to include the prioritization of voice packets,the detection and discarding of silence packets,and the transmission of computer data during periods of silence is the proper one.
we again begin our analysis with the claim language.claim of the patent simply requires multiplexing outgoing voice and computer data packets and demultiplexing incoming voice and computer data packets.patent,ll.claim of the patent similarly requires multiplexing and demultiplexing voice and video data packets.patent,ll.at the very least then,the plain language of the claims defines the term multiplexing as the combining of voice and computer data packets.the parties also agree that acted as its own lexicographer in defining the term multiplexing to mean dynamic multiplexing,or the combining of voice and computer data packets for transmission through the same channel by dynamically changing the time allocations for transmission of each type of data.that interpretation is supported by the specification.see,patent,id.at,ll.
the parties disagree,however,as to the propriety of the district court inclusion of two additional limitations in its interpretation of the term multiplexing.first,we agree with microsoft that the court properly interpreted the term multiplexing to require the prioritization of voice data over computer data.in its discussion of multiplexing,the specification provides that voice data have higher priority than computer data to ensure the integrity of the voice transmission.id.at,ll.because maintaining the integrity of the voice data is central to the functioning of the claimed inventions,we read as having defined the term multiplexing to require the prioritization of voice data over computer data.
however,we agree with that the court improperly construed the term multiplexing to require the detection and discarding of silence packets and the transmission of computer data packets during periods of silence.the specification references to those limitations are nothing more than disclosures of a preferred embodiment.although those features may be desirable,nowhere does the specification indicate that they are necessary for the multiplexing function.moreover,the method of detecting and discarding silence packets and transmitting only computer data packets during periods of silence is separately claimed in the dependent claims.patent,ll.patent,ll.see comark communications,at recognizing that the doctrine of claim differentiation,although not a hard and fast rule of claim construction,creates a presumption that each claim in a patent has a different scope.we therefore conclude that the term multiplexing does not include the limitations of detecting and discarding silence packets and transmitting computer data packets during periods of silence.
also argues that the district court erred in its construction of the term headers in claim of the patent and claims,and of the patent.maintains that the term headers should be given its ordinary meaning of information structures that precede units of data,such as packets.thus asserts that the headers attached to computer data packets need not identify packet type or packet length and that the headers attached to voice data packets need not identify whether the packets contain speech or silence.according to,the district court improperly imported those additional limitations from the specification preferred embodiments into the claims,despite the broader claim language.
microsoft responds that the term headers has several ordinary meanings and that proposed definition is inconsistent with the specification preferred embodiment and various dictionary definitions.microsoft also argues that the specification requires both that the computer data packet headers identify packet type and packet length and that voice data packet headers indicate whether the packets contain speech or silence.
we agree with that the district court interpretation of the term headers was overly narrow.claim of the patent refers to placing headers on the voice data packets as well as placing headers on the computer data packets.patent,ll.claims and of the patent simply refer to voice data packets having headers,patent,ll.id.at,while claim recites placing headers on outgoing voice data packets,id.at.we therefore start from the presumption that the term headers carries its ordinary meaning of information structure s that precede and identif y the information that follows.microsoft computer dictionary ed.
considering both the claim language and the specification,we next conclude that the claimed headers,at least in the patent,must identify whether the packets are voice or computer data packets to begin with,the claim language of the patent separately refers to placing headers on voice data packets and placing headers on computer data packets.moreover,the specification states that t he voice data packet information uses a different header format than does the computer data packet information so the receiving site recognizes the difference between a data packet and a voice packet.patent,ll.such differentiation is necessary to enable the prioritization of voice data packets over computer data packets that,as discussed above,must occur when the two types of packets are multiplexed together.we therefore read the claim language,in light of the specification,as requiring that the headers of the patent identify whether the following packets contain voice or computer data.
we further conclude,however,that the claimed headers need not identify the computer data packets type and length or whether the voice data packets contain speech or silence.to be sure,the specification does disclose a preferred embodiment in which the computer data packets begin with an id byte specifying the type and length of the packet,id.at,ll.tbls,and the voice data packets have a sign byte specifying whether the packet contains silent sound or speech information,id.at,to,tbl.the district court determined that such additional limitations must be read into the claims because they are necessary f or the preferred embodiment to function as specified.markman order,slip op.at however,those statements are limited to descriptions of the packet protocol used in the preferred embodiments,see patent,id.at,and are merely illustrative of how the headers can be configured.we therefore conclude that the claimed headers need not identify the computer data packets type and length or whether the voice data packets contain speech or silence.
d.the speaker phone limitations 
next argues that the district court erred in its interpretation of the terms speaker phone,speaker phone,and speaker phone in claims,and of the patent.maintains that the court erred in limiting the speaker phone limitations to traditional speaker phones because the claim language discloses a speaker phone that is simply a microphone and a speaker,regardless of its physical housing.further argues that the court improperly construed the speaker phone limitations to require echo cancellation,an optional feature disclosed in the specification.
microsoft responds that,according to its ordinary meaning,the term speaker phone must include structure beyond just a microphone and a speaker in order to be a telephone.microsoft also argues that the term speaker phone must include echo cancellation because the specification states that the use of a microphone and a speaker necessitates the use of an acoustical echo cancellation algorithm to prevent feedback from destroying the voice signals.
we agree with that the district court construed the speaker phone limitations too narrowly.neither the claims nor the specification describes any physical housing that must comprise the speaker phone.claim of the patent simply recites a speaker phone with a microphone and a speaker.patent,ll.dependent claims and further require that the speaker phone include,respectively,a deskset microphone and a deskset speaker,id.at,ll,or a headset microphone and a headset speaker,id.at,to.claim recites a speaker phone,id.at,and claim recites a speaker phone,id.at,ll.moreover,the specification repeatedly refers to three alternative telephone interfaces a handset,a headset,and a microphone and speaker,patent,ll.it consistently describes the interface as simply a microphone and a speaker.to require more structure would impermissibly exclude a preferred embodiment from the claim limitation.vitronics conceptronic,stating that it is rarely,if ever,correct to interpret a claim to exclude a preferred embodiment.we therefore conclude that the term speaker phone requires no physical structure beyond a microphone and a speaker.
we agree with microsoft,however,that the district court properly construed the speaker phone limitations to require the use of echo cancellation.although the language of the independent claims does not expressly refer to echo cancellation,the specification provides that the use of the speaker and microphone necessitates the use of an acoustical echo cancellation algorithm to prevent feedback from destroying the voice signals and that a line echo cancellation algorithm is needed no matter which telephone interface is used.patent,to,emphases added.those statements clearly mandate the use of acoustical and line echo cancellation.we therefore conclude that the speaker phone limitations require the use of echo cancellation.
digitizing 
finally argues that the district court improperly construed the term digitizing,found in claim of the patent,as necessarily being performed by the codec circuit that is disclosed in the specification preferred embodiment.microsoft responds that the court did not interpret the term digitizing as necessarily being performed by the codec circuit.thus,there is no dispute regarding this term,and we affirm the district court construction of the term digitizing as meaning simply converting analog signals into digital signals.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the district court properly construed the asserted claims of the,and patents to be limited to communications over a telephone line and to exclude communications over a network such as the internet.however,we revise the court constructions of the limitations relating to headers,multiplexing,and speaker phone s.nonetheless,because stipulations of noninfringement under the affirmed claim construction are unaffected by our changes to other aspects of the district court claim construction,the final judgments of the district court are 
this court today concludes that the invention claimed in any patent sharing the specification of the,and patents can not encompass the use of a communications network like the internet.as all parties agree,the claim language in no way rules out the use of a network.the specification also does not foreclose use of the internet.the prosecution history of the patent falls far short of a clear and unambiguous disclaimer of internet coverage as the majority finds,but rather suggests the contrary conclusion.finally,this court today dismisses the rule in united states gypsum,and applies the prosecution history of a later patent to limit the narrower claims of a patent issuing before such statements were made.for these reasons,i must respectfully dissent.
this court today asserts that the language in the specification regarding over and through a telephone line somehow requires the claims to cover only those communication networks where nothing but a telephone line lies between the two end sites.to my eyes,that leap in logic is akin to evel knievel jumping the snake river gorge on a motorcycle.like knievel,this court conclusion falls short.in the first place,this limitation does not appear anywhere in the claims.in addition,nothing in this record indicates that a person of skill in this art would find that limitation in the specification.
when i connect to the internet a network at home using my modem,i do it over a telephone line.when i send email to my colleagues from home,i do it through a telephone line as well as across the internet.if i travel over the river and through the woods to grandmother house,this court would apparently conclude that i have traveled through nothing but rivers and woods.the terms over and through do not denote the sole medium of transmission or travel.if a person asks me to send them a file over the internet,that request certainly would not preclude the use of a telephone line connected to a modem connected to the internet.in sending the file,i would be sending data over my telephone line as well as over the internet.the record contains no evidence to support the leap that over a telephone line must mean exclusively over a telephone line.
most of the claims at issue never refer to the communication network between the end sites of the system.the claims focus on the ends of the communication system.the middle portion is essentially irrelevant to the invention.claim of the patent is a method claim directed to multiplexing,transmitting,receiving,and demultiplexing voice and video data.claim of the patent identifies a method that places headers on outgoing voice and computer data packets,and then multiplexes,transmits,receives,and demultiplexes the data packets.these claims address what happens at each end of the communication system,not the travel routes for the packets between the ends.
this court today,however,goes beyond merely importing a limitation from the specification into the claims.first the court manufactures an unreasonable limitation out of vague specification references to over and through.then the court imports that unstated limitation into the claims.at most,the specification can be read to require that all of the claims require the use of a telephone line in the transmitting,sending,or receiving elements.to my eyes,this court leaps into thin air when it says that the claims require the exclusive use of telephone line transmission.
to bolster the absence of limitation in the claims or specification,the court stretches to find a clear and unambiguous disclaimer in the prosecution history of the patent.to the contrary,the examiner,who actually participated in that history,considered the applicant statements regarding the patent and found that the claims do not limit themselves to a standard telephone line.in fact,because the claims encompassed more than a mere telephone connection,the examiner renewed a rejection.in response to the examiner rejection in light of the lewen reference,the applicant stated that lewen operates using a local area network lan requiring the data packets to circulate around the lan until reaching either the gateway or the node where they can be sent to a remote site.the applicant explained that the patent claims a system that does n
