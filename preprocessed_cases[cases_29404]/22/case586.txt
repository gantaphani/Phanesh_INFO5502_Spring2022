the term lolita conjures up images ranging from the literary depiction of the adolescent seduced by her stepfather in vladimir nabokov novel to erotic displays of young girls and child pornography.this case requires us to consider probable cause to search a computer for child pornography in the context of an internet website,known as,that admittedly displayed child pornography.
micah gourde appeals from the district court denial of his motion to suppress more than images of child pornography seized from his home computer.gourde claims that the affidavit in support of the search lacked sufficient indicia of probable cause because it contained no evidence that gourde actually downloaded or possessed child pornography.we disagree.based on the totality of the circumstances,the magistrate judge who issued the warrant made a practical,decision that there was a fair probability that child pornography would be found on gourde computer.illinois gates,d the fourth amendment requires no more.
background 
i.the affidavit 
in may,the fbi requested a warrant to search the residence of micah gourde for the purpose of seizing computer equipment and other materials containing evidence that he probably caused the uploading,downloading and transmission of child pornography over the internet in violation of and,which criminalize the possession,receipt and transmission of child pornography.the following facts come from special agent david moriguchi affidavit in support of the search warrant.see united states anderson,cir a ll data necessary to show probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant must be contained within the four corners of a written affidavit given under oath.
in august,an undercover fbi agent discovered a website called.the first page of the site contained images of nude and girls,some prepubescent,along with this text 
offers hard to find pics with weekly updates and high quality pix inside,you cant go wrong if you like young girls size high quality pictures inside join access here this site updated weekly with new lolita pics this site is in full compliance with united states code title part i chapter section.
the first page directed the user to a second page with more images of nude girls,some prepubescent,including three images displaying the genital areas of minors,and a caption reading lolitas age.the second page contained this text 
welcome to lolitagurls.over one thousand pictures of girls age naked lolita girls with weekly updates what you will find here at is a complete collection of young girl pics.bonus you can get at our partners site after you join if you wish.
the second page also had testimonials from website members,such as this lolita site has everything with young girls and i never seen in my life the pics of so cute girls.this page offered the viewer three ways to see other pages on the website take a free tour of the site,become a new member of the site,or log in as a returning member.
as part of his investigation,the undercover agent joined the website and was a member from august to december.the membership fee was per month,deducted automatically from the member credit card.lancelot security handled credit card processing and access control for.members received unlimited access to the website and were allowed to download images directly from the website.browsing the entire website,whose primary feature was the images section,the undercover agent captured hundreds of images that included adult pornography,child pornography,and child erotica.these images included the lascivious display of the breasts and genitalia of girls under the age of eighteen.
the fbi eventually identified the owner and operator of and,in january,executed a search warrant.among the seized items was his computer,which contained child pornography images that had been posted to the website.the owner admitted that was a child pornography website he operated as a source of income.
in response to a subpoena,lancelot security provided the fbi with information on subscribers.lancelot records listed gourde as a member and provided his home address,date of birth,email address,and the fact that he had been a subscriber from november until january.gourde never cancelled his fbi shut down the site at the end of january,while he was still a member.
the affidavit contained extensive background information on computers and the characteristics of child pornography collectors.one section set out legal and computer terms relevant to understanding how downloading and possessing child pornography would violate.citing fbi computer experts,the affidavit explained that if a computer had ever received or downloaded illegal images,the images would remain on the computer for an extended period.that is,even if the user sent the images to recycle and then deleted the files in the recycling bin,the files were not actually erased but were kept in the computer slack space until randomly overwritten,making even deleted files retrievable by computer forensic experts.any evidence of a violation of would almost certainly remain on a computer long after the file had been viewed or downloaded and even after it had been deleted.
the affidavit also described the use of computers for child pornography activities.based on his experience and that of other fbi experts,moriguchi wrote that p aid subscription websites are a forum through which persons with similar interests can view and download images in relative privacy.he described how collectors and distributors of child pornography use the free email and online storage services of internet portals such as and hotmail,among others,to operate anonymously because these websites require little identifying information.communications through these portals result in both the intentional and unintentional storage of digital information,and a user internet activities generally leave traces or footprints in the web cache drawing on the expertise of the fbi behavioral analysis unit,the affidavit listed certain traits and characteristics generally found to exist and be true in individuals who collect child pornography.according to the affidavit,the majority of collectors are sexually attracted to children,collect sexually explicit materials including digital images for their own sexual gratification,also collect child erotica images that are not themselves child pornography but still fuel their sexual fantasies involving children,rarely,if ever,dispose of their sexually explicit materials,and seek out individuals,either in person or on the internet.
the affidavit concluded by identifying facts about gourde that made it fairly probable that he was a child pornography collector and maintained a collection of child pornography and related evidence gourde took steps to affirmatively join the website the website advertised pictures of young girls the website offered images of young girls engaged in sexually explicit conduct gourde remained a member for over two months,although he could have cancelled at any time gourde had access to hundreds of images,including historical postings to the website and any time gourde visited the website,he had to have seen images of naked prepubescent females with a caption that described them as twelve to girls.
ii.procedural background 
on the strength of moriguchi affidavit,the magistrate judge issued a warrant to search gourde residence and computers.the fbi searched gourde house and seized his computer,which contained over images of child pornography and erotica.
gourde filed a motion to suppress the images found on his computer.at the suppression hearing,the district court heard testimony from two fbi agents,including moriguchi.the district court restricted its ruling to the face of the affidavit,and denied gourde motion to suppress.the district court determined that the recitations in the affidavit supported a fair probability that evidence of a crime would be found on gourde computer.the judge applied a common sense approach to conclude that evidence of a subscription to even a mixed that offered both legal adult pornography and illegal child the necessary fair probability to look further.
shortly after,gourde pleaded guilty to one count of possession of visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct in violation of a b,b and.in the plea agreement,he admitted to having hundreds of such images on his computer.gourde conditioned his guilty plea on his right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
discussion 
our starting point is the fourth amendment,which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures,and its warrants clause,which requires that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.the contours of probable cause were laid out by the supreme court in its landmark decision,illinois gates,d.in contrast to the more exacting,technical approach to probable cause in cases before gates,see id.at,gates itself marked a return to the totality of the circumstances test and emphasized that probable cause means fair probability,not certainty or even a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.in short,a magistrate judge is only required to answer the commonsense,practical question whether there is probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place before issuing a search warrant.id.at.
the supreme court also used gates as a vehicle to elaborate on our role as a reviewing court.we are not in a position to flyspeck the affidavit through de novo review.id.at.a scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of the affidavit should not take the form of de novo review.rather,the magistrate judge determination should be paid great deference.id.quoting spinelli united states,d.this deferential approach is the antithesis of a grudging or negative attitude toward search warrants and a hypertechnical rather than a commonsense analysis.united states ventresca,d accord united states seybold,cir holding that our limited scope to review simply means determining whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding there was a fair probability that evidence would be found.
we conclude that the affidavit contained sufficient facts to support the magistrate judge finding that there was a fair probability that gourde computer contained evidence that he violated or 
turning first to the website itself,the evidence is unequivocal that was a child pornography site whose primary content was in the form of images.indeed,the owner admitted that it was a child pornography website that he operated as a source of income.the owner confession to the fbi established that actually contained illegal content,the possession,receipt or transfer of which would be a violation of.thus,the magistrate judge had no reason to question whether the images described constituted child pornography because the owner himself acknowledged he purveyed illegal images.this fact alone renders futile gourde piecemeal attempts to chip away at the affidavit by identifying shortcomings in the description of,that the fbi failed to describe images meeting the definition of child pornography,that the agent had no basis for determining how old the girls were,and that the website also contained legal content,adult pornography and child erotica.in the face of the owner admission that he was operating a child pornography website,the prophylactic disclaimer that t his site is in full compliance with united states code,title part i chapter section is mere window dressing that absolves the owner or users of nothing.
the affidavit then moves from one certainty,that child pornography was on the website,to gourde had access and wanted access to these illegal images.gourde subscribed to for over two months,from november to january.as a paying member,gourde had unlimited access to hundreds of illegal images.he clearly had the means to receive and possess images in violation of.but more importantly,gourde status as a member manifested his intention and desire to obtain illegal images.
membership is both a small step and a giant leap.to become a member requires what are at first glance little,easy steps.it was easy for gourde to submit his home address,email address and credit card data,and he consented to have deducted from his credit card every month.but these steps,however easy,only could have been intentional and were not insignificant.gourde could not have become a member by accident or by a mere click of a button this reality is perhaps easier to see by comparing gourde to other archetypical visitors to the site.gourde was not an accidental browser,such as a student who came across the site after googling the term lolita while researching the internet for a term paper on nabokov book.nor was gourde someone who took advantage of the free tour but,after viewing the site,balked at taking the active steps necessary to become a member and gain unlimited access to images of child pornography.gourde is different still from a person who actually mustered the money and nerve to become a member but,the next morning,suffered buyer remorse or a belated fear of prosecution and cancelled his subscription.instead,gourde became a member and never looked membership ended because the fbi shut down the site.the affidavit left little doubt that gourde had paid to obtain unlimited access to images of child pornography knowingly and willingly,and not involuntary,unwittingly,or even passively.with evidence from lancelot security,the fbi linked the email a known subscriber to gourde and to his home address in castle rock,washington.
having paid for access to a child pornography site,gourde was also stuck with the near certainty that his computer would contain evidence of a crime had he received or downloaded images in violation of.thanks to the long memory of computers,any evidence of a crime was almost certainly still on his computer,even if he had tried to delete the images.fbi computer experts,cited in the affidavit,stated that even if graphic image files have been deleted these files can easily be restored.in other words,his computer would contain at least the digital footprint of the images.it was unlikely that evidence of a crime would have been stale or missing,as less than four months had elapsed between the closing of the website and the execution of the search warrant.see united states lacy,cir holding that the nature of the crime involving child pornography,as set forth in the affidavit,provided good reason to believe the computerized visual depictions downloaded by lacy would be present in his apartment when the search was conducted ten months later.
given this triad of solid site had illegal images,gourde intended to have and wanted access to these images,and these images were almost certainly retrievable from his computer if he had ever received or downloaded only inference the magistrate judge needed to make to find probable cause was that there was a fair probability gourde had,in fact,received or downloaded images.gates supports the principle that a probable cause determination may be based in part on reasonable inferences.see at.noting that a magistrate judge may draw such reasonable inferences as he will from the material supplied to him by applicants for a warrant.
here,the reasonable inference that gourde had received or downloaded images easily meets the fair probability test.it neither strains logic nor defies common sense to conclude,based on the totality of these circumstances,that someone who paid for access for two months to a website that actually purveyed child pornography probably had viewed or downloaded such images onto his computer.see gates,at.together these facts form the basis of the analysis that informs the probable cause determination.employing the principles of,common sense,a fluid and nontechnical conception of probable cause,and deference to the magistrate conclude that the search warrant was supported by probable cause.
other circuits,facing nearly identical facts,have reached the same result for the same reason.see united states martin,cir it is common sense that an individual who joins such a site would more than likely download and possess such material.united states froman,cir i t is common sense that a person who voluntarily joins a group such as candyman,remains a member of the group for approximately a month without cancelling his subscription,and uses screen names that reflect his interest in child pornography,would download such pornography from the website and have it in his possession.
the details provided on the use of computers by child pornographers and the collector profile strengthen this inference and help provide context for the fair probability that gourde received or downloaded images.see united states hay,cir reasoning that the collector profile form ed the basis upon which the magistrate judge could plausibly conclude that those files were still on the premises.the fbi agent concluded that gourde fit the collector profile because he joined a paid subscription website dedicated to child pornography,where persons with similar interests can view and download images in relative privacy.most collectors are persons who have a sexual attraction to children,and gourde membership was a manifestation of that attraction.collectors act like pack rats because they have difficulty obtaining images of child pornography.as such,they are inclined to download and keep such images for a long period of time,and they rarely,if ever,dispose of their sexually explicit materials.this profile tracks the collector profiles that supported a finding of probable cause in other cases in this circuit and others.see,lacy,at t he affiant explained that collectors and distributors of child pornography value their sexually explicit materials highly,rarely if ever dispose of such material,and store it for long periods in a secure place,typically in their homes.martin,at.
the second circuit recent decision in martin is instructive.martin stemmed from a widespread investigation of several pornographic websites candyman,and.id.at.like the affidavit here,in addition to details about the specific website and target of the search,the affidavit in martin contained an extensive background discussion of the modus operandi of those who use computers for collecting and distributing child pornography,including their reliance on,bulletin boards,file transfers,and online storage.id.at.the affidavit also spelled out the characteristics and proclivities of collectors,specifically how they tend to collect such material,store it,and rarely destroy or discard it.id.the second circuit,in line with other circuits,had no difficulty concluding that such an affidavit rose to the level of fair probability and established probable cause.id.at see also united states riccardi,cir holding that affidavit statement that possessors of child pornography often obtain and retain images of child pornography on their computers,along with other facts,was more than enough to support probable cause united states chrobak,cir holding that affidavit supported probable cause,in part,based on professional experience that child pornographers generally retain their pornography for extended periods.
gourde seeks to sidestep the fair probability standard and elevate probable cause to a test of near certainty.in the face of the clear teaching of gates,gourde argues that probable cause was lacking because the government could have determined with certainty whether he had actually downloaded illegal images.according to gourde,the fbi could have found any records of his downloads from from the owner computer,which the fbi seized before conducting the search of gourde residence.gourde posits that absent such concrete evidence,the profile data and other facts are insufficient to support a warrant.
whether the fbi could or would have found such data on the owner computer is not clear from the record,nor is this inquiry the one demanded by precedent.to be sure,this additional data would have transformed a fair probability to a near certainty that gourde had received or possessed illegal images.better yet,had the fbi caught him at his computer downloading the images,the certainty would have been percent.gates,however,does not compel the government to provide more facts than necessary to show a fair probability that gourde had committed a crime gourde approach imposes a standard explicitly rejected by gates.he confuses the relaxed standard of fair probability with the higher standards imposed at trial.gates,at.standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence,useful in formal trials,have no place in the magistrate decision.the supreme court requires neither a prima facie showing nor an affidavit containing facts that make it more likely true than false that gourde possessed child pornography.texas brown,d.
gourde also argues that reversal is dictated by united states weber,cir.weber illustrates why the supreme court has emphasized that probable cause is a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual readily,or even usefully reduced to a neat set of legal rules.gates,at.
the circumstances in weber,which did not even involve the internet,were hardly comparable to gourde situation.two years before the search warrant was sought,weber was targeted for investigation after failing to pick up a parcel addressed to him that apparently depict ed the sexual exploitation of children.see weber,at.nothing came of that incident.id.then,two years later,the customs service sent weber a fictitious solicitation from which he ordered,sight unseen,four pictures advertised as child pornography.the affidavit recited these details,along with a general description of the proclivities of pedophiles and child pornography collectors,without showing the connection between weber and these profiles and without addressing the two year lag between the first incident and the new solicitation.id.at.
agents executed the warrant and seized not only the four photographs ordered but a host of other images of child pornography that weber later moved to suppress.weber did not challenge the seizure of the four photographs,only the other images.we reversed the denial of the suppression motion because the warrant would justify virtually any search of the home of a person who has once placed an order for child if he never receives the materials ordered.id.at.the affidavit also was deficient because it did not lay a foundation which shows that the person subject to the search is a member of the class of collectors.id.at.
weber involved child pornography but otherwise bears little resemblance to gourde situation.gourde continuous,affirmative steps to access a child pornography website can hardly be compared to the single controlled buy in weber two years after his initial,and unconsummated,foray into child pornography.nor is the deficiency in the weber affidavit present moriguchi affidavit specifically identified the circumstances linking the collector profile to gourde.
we view weber as distinguished by its facts,and we are not persuaded by gourde argument that it dictates the outcome of his case.weber can not be read to support gourde a search warrant for child pornography may issue only if the government provides concrete evidence,without relying on any inferences,that a suspect actually receives or possesses images of child running afoul of gates.
we conclude where the dissents begin.given the current environment of increasing government surveillance and the long memories of computers,we must not let the nature of the alleged crime,child pornography,skew our analysis or make us lax in our duty to guard the privacy protected by the fourth amendment.we are acutely aware that the digital universe poses particular challenges with respect to the fourth amendment.but the result in this case,which hews to supreme court precedent,is hardly a step down the path of laxity and into the arms of big brother.the district court did not err in its denial of gourde motion to suppress the more than images on his computer containing child pornography.
affirmed as to the conviction remanded to the panel to consider gourde request for a limited remand under united states ameline,cir en banc.
in this age of increasing government surveillance,lawful and unlawful,and of the retention of all our deeds and thoughts on computers long after we may believe they have been removed,it is important that courts not grow lax in their duty to protect our right to privacy and that they remain vigilant against efforts to weaken our fourth amendment protections.it is easy for courts to lose sight of these objectives when the government seeks to obtain evidence of child pornography or narcotics violations.here,i believe,our court is making an unfortunate error.let me be one is suggesting this case.what is needed instead is a sensitivity to constitutional principles.
the government purports to apply the totality of the circumstances test when assessing whether there was a fair probability that gourde possessed illegal images on his computer at the time the warrant was issued.in reaching its conclusion that a fair probability did exist,the majority ignores a critical circumstance at the time the government sought the warrant,it possessed direct evidence that established whether gourde in fact had or had not downloaded illegal images to his computer and thus had them in his possession,yet the government chose not to avail itself of that information.it offered no excuse for its failure to do so,despite the critical nature of the evidence it possessed.the government actions might fairly be said,at the least,to have constituted conscious avoidance.
had the government not had the critical,indeed dispositive,evidence in its possession,the evidence that is set forth in the affidavit might have been sufficient to support a finding of probable cause however,when the government failure to examine the critical evidence is considered along with the limited information proffered in the affidavit,it can not be said that,all things considered,there was a fair probability that evidence that gourde violated or would be found on his computer 
possessing a computer that would reveal whether the defendant had downloaded child pornography and declining to examine it is similar to possessing pictures of a murder in progress and failing to look at them before seeking an arrest warrant for someone thought to be a suspect.in such circumstance,unless probable cause was irrefutably established without the dispositive evidence,an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances,both affirmative and negative,would require a finding of lack of probable cause.the lack could be resolved quickly by an examination of the evidence in the government possession.until then,however,the evidence would simply be too problematic given the government unexplained behavior it would fall short of meeting the fair probability test.certainly,a analysis would tell the magistrate,if he knew of the government omission,that something was wrong.had the magistrate been advised of all the relevant facts,i doubt that he would have issued the warrant rather,i would expect he would have told the government to go away and come back after it had looked at the website owner computer and determined whether there was indeed probable cause.
the majority improperly brushes aside the importance of the government ability to determine whether gourde had downloaded or received illegal images.it argues that it did not need to prove that gourde definitely downloaded or received illegal images in order to show that there was a fair probability that he possessed such images on his computer.ante at.that is certainly it is not the issue in the present case.in concluding that the government ability to determine gourde download history is immaterial to the probable cause analysis,the majority confuses two different types of information evidence that the government could have obtained but that it did not possess at the time it applied for a warrant,and evidence that the government had in its possession at the time it applied for the warrant but did not that would have answered the question whether there was probable cause.this case involves the latter type.although the government certainly need not provide definitive proof that an individual downloaded or otherwise received illegal images on his computer to establish probable cause,when it has critical evidence in its possession but decides to avoid becoming aware of the content,it creates a circumstance which casts substantial doubt on the probability that the individual does in fact possess illegal images.
when this circumstance is properly weighed along with the others relied upon by the majority,it can no longer be said that the record before the magistrate judge showed a fair probability that gourde downloaded or otherwise received illegal images.the record makes three things clear first,gourde paid for a membership in a website that contained both legal and illegal images in unknown proportions,a mixed website second,the government had the ability to any significant expenditure of time or the evidence it possessed whether gourde had ever downloaded any images from and,if so,whether any of those images were illegal third,the affidavit that the government offered in support of the warrant provided no evidence that gourde had ever downloaded any images,legal or illegal,from the website.the totality of the se circumstances gives rise to one of two conclusions.at best,the totality of the circumstances indicates that the government engaged in conscious avoidance and deliberately chose not to avail itself of the information in its possession that would have established whether gourde downloaded or possessed illegal images before seeking the warrant.at worst,the totality of the circumstances suggests that the government did access that information and found that gourde had not downloaded any illegal images,but sought the warrant anyway neither logic nor common sense to use the guideposts the majority identifies as central to the analysis,ante at an answer to the government irregular behavior.in the absence of some explanation of its failure to provide the magistrate with the evidence in its possession,i do not believe that it can properly establish probable cause.
perhaps if no evidence as to whether an individual had in fact downloaded or otherwise received illegal images was in the government possession,membership in a mixed website alone would be sufficient to establish a fair probability that the individual possessed such images on his computer.perhaps not.that case is not before us.here,the government admitted that,at the time it applied for the warrant,it possessed evidence that could have determined conclusively whether gourde had downloaded or received illegal images as a result of his membership in the mixed website.yet,it failed to provide the court with this dispositive evidence.regrettably,the majority ignores this critical fact.in doing so,it fails to consider the totality of the circumstances.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
i respectfully dissent.the careful decision by the panel was correct and should be left alone.there was no probable cause because there was no evidence that gourde had downloaded any child pornography.
is the holding of the majority opinion that if a person has subscribed to a site that has legal and illegal material,that suffices as probable cause for a search warrant that if a person has paid money to look at material that is illegal to possess,he probably possesses it if the holding is narrower than these formulations,everyone computer would be safer were the narrowing restrictions made clear.if it is not,the majority opinion is dangerous to everyone privacy.in my view,the majority errs in concluding that there was probable cause for a search because its inferences depend on unarticulated assumptions that do not make sense.the majority implicitly assumes that a person who likes something probably possesses it,even if possession is against the law.
the importance of this case is considerable because,for most people,their computers are their most private spaces.people commonly talk about the bedroom as a very private space,yet when they have parties,all the perfect invited to toss their coats on the bed.but if one of those guests is caught exploring the host computer,that will be his last invitation.
there are just too many secrets on people computers,most legal,some embarrassing,and some potentially tragic in their implications,for loose liberality in allowing search warrants.emails and history links may show that someone is ordering medication for a disease being kept secret even from family members.or they may show that someone child is being counseled by parents for a serious problem that is none of anyone else business.or a married mother of three may be carrying on a steamy email correspondence with an old high school boyfriend.or an otherwise respectable,gentleman may be looking at dirty pictures.just as a conscientious public official may be hounded out of office because a party guest found a homosexual magazine when she went to the bathroom at his house,people lives may be ruined because of legal but embarrassing materials found on their computers.and,in all but the largest metropolitan areas,it really does not matter whether any formal charges the police or other visitors find the material,it will be all over town and hinted at in the newspaper within a few days.
nor are secrets the only problem.warrants ordinarily direct seizure,not just search,and computers are often shared by family members.seizure of a shared family computer may,though unrelated to the law enforcement purpose,effectively confiscate a professor book,a student almost completed thesis,or a business accounts payable and receivable.people can not get their legitimate work done if their computer is at the police station because of someone else suspected child pornography downloads.sex with children is so disgusting to most of us that we may be too liberal in allowing searches when the government investigates child pornography cases.the privacy of people computers is too important to let it be eroded by sexual disgust.
the question an issuing magistrate should ask of a search warrant is fairly stated by the majority considering the totality of the circumstances,is there a fair probability that what is being looked for will be found at the location to be searched this is a common sense,practical question that the magistrate is supposed to ask before issuing a search warrant 
the answer has to come from the statute defining the crimes at issue and the search warrant application.common sense questions for the issuing magistrate to ask are what are the police looking for and why do they think they will find evidence of it there the application for the search warrant says that the fbi wanted to search gourde home for evidence of possession,receipt and transmission of child pornography in violation of and.so the what are you looking for question is answered precisely and satisfactorily.
the serious,unavoidable next question that an issuing magistrate is obligated to ask is why do you think there is a fair probability of finding such evidence on gourde computer here is where the affidavit fails to make out the case.it establishes only that a website,had criminal child pornography on with much legally permissible that gourde had paid to subscribe to it.that is not enough,as a common sense matter,because gourde might have been using the website to look at the legal rather than the illegal material,and even if gourde subscribed just because he liked to look at illegal child pornography,common sense suggests that he also liked to stay out of jail,so he would look but avoid possessing.
i generally agree with the careful analysis in the panel opinion about the mixed nature of the site in this dissent,i focus mostly on the additional point that evidence of an attraction to child pornography does not support an inference that a person possesses it.the affidavit sets out ample probable cause to infer,at least if one knows of vladmir nabakov novel,that was a purveyor of child pornography its name,its claim to have over pictures of girls age,its reference to naked lolita girls,and the pictures of nude and partially dressed young girls,some prepubescent on the free tour pages promoting subscriptions,and the images posted in the subscriber section of which some depicted the lascivious display of the breast and genitalia of girls under the age of.
on the other hand,there were indications that supported the inference that some or most subscribers would want the site for access to legal pornography the promotional language said this site is in full compliance with united states code title part i chapter section the reference to pictures of naked lolita girls was in a different sentence from girls age the price,a month,was not extraordinarily high as one might expect of contraband much of the material on the site the affidavit does not say whether it is a small portion,a large portion,or almost all was what the fbi agent affidavit said was legal pornography,consisting of adult pornography and child erotica.thus a person might well subscribe to the site to look at and download legal material.the subscriber might well the proclivity of merchants for puffing their goods and of the ability of models to make themselves look younger than they he would have the pleasure of looking at the sort of pornography that appealed to him without the legal risk of looking at anything that involved violation of federal law.
nevertheless,for purposes of argument,let us assume that the subscriber would think that the assurance of lawfulness and all the legal material were mere window dressing.let us further assume that as a matter of common sense,subscription to suffices in the totality of circumstances to establish that there is a fair probability that a subscriber has a perverted interest in looking at criminal child pornography.though satisfied from the affidavit that gourde probably had this perverted sexual desire,an issuing magistrate should still have rejected the warrant because it still did not establish a fair probability that evidence of a child pornography crime would be found on gourde computer.
the reason he could not be assumed to possess child pornography is that possession of child pornography is a very serious crime and the affidavit did not say he had downloaded any.he could use the site to look at child pornography without downloading it,a reasonable assumption in the absence of evidence that he had downloaded images.common sense suggests that everyone,pervert or not,has the desire to stay out of jail.the ordinary desire to stay out of jail is a factor that must be considered in the totality of circumstances.it would be irrational to assume that an individual is indifferent between subjecting himself to criminal sanctions and avoiding them,when he can attain his object while avoiding them.to commit the crime for which the warrant sought evidence,one has to do something more than look he must ship,produce,or at the least knowingly possess.the two child pornography statutes at issue do not say that viewing child pornography is a crime.congress could perhaps make it a crime to pay to view such images,but it did not.
section provides penalties for one who knowingly transports or ships,knowingly receives,knowingly reproduces for distribution,knowingly sells,or knowingly possesses with intent to sell.section provides penalties for one who knowingly mails,or transports or ships,knowingly receives or distributes,knowingly reproduces for distribution,and so forth there is nothing in either text continued on page statute that criminalizes looking.though the spirit and purpose of the law is doubtless to stamp out the child pornography industry,criminal laws have no penumbras or emanations.there is no principle more essential to liberty,or more deeply imbued in our law,than that what is not prohibited,is permitted.that principle,and due process concerns,are why criminal statutes are strictly construed that is,a criminal law is not to be read expansively to include what is not plainly embraced within the language of the statute.
about the closest the statutes get to mere looking is the phrase knowingly receives.though precedent does not settle the question,it does not square with common sense to treat looking as knowingly receiving.true,electrons have to turn a lot of bits into ones and zeroes on the looker computer to enable him to look,and he has received the electronic signals that do this.but that is not much different from light waves from a picture stimulating rods and cones on the retina.one would not say that a person who had looked at the mona lisa at the louvre had received it,even though the reflected light waves had altered electronic signals to the optic nerve from the retina,and a recollection was stored in the brain.the government tries to make something of the computer browser cache,but that can not be the same thing as receiving because the cache is an area of memory and disk space available to the browser software,not to the computer user.if the computer user accesses the same page on the internet again before the cache is overwritten,the browser software will display the page from the cache to save download time and web traffic,but the user ordinarily can not display the picture offline from the cache.to view the picture without accessing the site,the computer user usually has to take the additional affirmative step of downloading and saving it as a jpeg,pdf,or in some other form.the concept of receiving implies possession.possession requires dominion and control,a concept well understood from drug and firearms cases 
the affidavit does focus on the tendency of a collector of child pornography to preserve the images collected.that squares with common sense,because collectors,whether of legal or illegal items,are by virtue of being collectors unlikely to throw items in their collections away.the portions of the affidavit speaking to the habits of collectors support the inference that if gourde had downloaded images he probably still had them,even though his subscription ended when the site was terminated four months before the search.
but was gourde a collector the search warrant affidavit has one paragraph stating that there was probable cause to believe gourde was a collector.all it says is that gourde joined the website,he could have easily downloaded images,he did not cancel his subscription,and he would have to have viewed images of naked prepubescent females with descriptive language saying they were to years old that is not enough for probable cause that gourde was a collector.
the affidavit does not claim that subscribers to publicly available websites like this tend to be collectors and were such a claim made the foundation for it would need examination,or that collectors acquire their collections from public websites like as opposed to private emails.the question might be raised,why would they the answer is that possession was and is a serious crime,while simple viewing is not.the statutes quoted earlier set out penalties ranging from five to forty years with mandatory minimums as high as fifteen years for the various child pornography offenses and offenders denoted in them these penalties impose a high price on collecting,likely to deter many people even if they might like to collect.
the search warrant affidavit also contains one screaming silence it does not say that the server showed any downloads to gourde computer.the affidavit,signed in may,establishes that the fbi took the smut merchant computer in january.there was plenty of time in these several months to go through it to determine what addresses downloaded images,yet there is no mention that gourde address received any.to an experienced lawyer or judge,for whom silences are loud where information would ordinarily be provided,that is like an absence of skid marks at an accident scene or a personal injury complaint alleging grievous physical injury but no medical expenses or wage loss.the stronger inference from this silence in the affidavit,is not that gourde did download,but that the fbi looked and found that gourde computer did not receive downloads.
this negative inference is supported by the testimony at the suppression hearing,where the fbi agent acknowledged that it fair to say that a record of the operations of this website,the images it contained,when and if they were sent out,transmitted,emailed,that information could have been traced from the iowa server.he also conceded that the information available from the server would include information that would inform the about whether somebody downloaded images from the site,when they downloaded them,or other information indicating exactly what was sent from iowa.there was nothing in the affidavit establishing that gourde ever downloaded anything from,and the silence suggested that the fbi had checked the download history and found that he had not.
a careful issuing magistrate would have to ask himself the question,why should i believe gourde has such images,that is,that he is a collector and the common sense answer would have to be,particularly in the absence of evidence of downloads,not unless he is a fool,since he can look without criminal risk,and would likely be deterred from collecting by the heavy sanctions applied to it.part of the totality of circumstances is the legal environment in which the individual lives.common sense suggests that a lot of people would do a lot of things that they might like to on an empty freeway,paying less taxes than are owed,crossing an intersection on a red light when there is no traffic,downloading pirated music on the it not for the legal trouble they would generate for themselves by doing them.
ordinarily the criminal law takes seriously the effectiveness of deterrence.a sentencing court is commanded by congress to assure that the sentence afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.all of the people are not deterred all of the time,but most people are deterred most of the time.not everybody is deterred from buying cars by the high prices either,but most people are,so it would not be reasonable to assume that a multimillionaire car lover probably has a ferrari.applying common sense to the totality of circumstances,the issuing magistrate would have to suppose that while gourde might well have a perverted sexual interest in little girls,he would also have the normal desire to stay out of prison.he could satisfy both desires by looking but not possessing.if he had a fast internet connection,he could look online about as fast as he could look at images on his hard drive.considering the legal risk if he downloaded images,it would take something more,such as a statement in the affidavit that the smut purveyor computer showed that gourde computer had received downloads,to establish probable cause that gourde collected the images.why would he collect images on his hard drive when,as a subscriber,he could look whenever he wanted without the legal risk the affidavit provides experienced judgment though not scientific in the sense that and kumho require that collectors horde their collectibles,but no probable cause to suggest that gourde was a collector.
the cases the majority cites generally have factors in addition to site membership to support an inference of collecting illegal is the crime for which the warrant sought opposed to looking.in those cases,the inferences were based on individualized facts,not mere profiling.in united states froman,the defendant not only joined the child pornography candyman,but also identified himself with aliases announcing his perverted sexual interest in little girls the internet group in united states martin was determined to be primarily for effecting illegal activity,but was,as explained above,more ambiguous.in our own precedent,we used the collector profile when the defendant had a personal website that demonstrated an extreme interest in young children.unlike each of these cases,there is no evidence particular to gourde to suggest that he is a collector of illegal images 
the majority concludes that the affidavit made out probable cause by assuming that anyone who subscribes to an internet site with both legal and illegal material must collect illegal material from the site.this assumption stacks inference upon inference until the conclusion is too weak to support the invasion of privacy entailed by a search warrant.w ith each succeeding inference,the last reached is less and less likely to be true.the privacy of a person with a sexual perversion that might mak
