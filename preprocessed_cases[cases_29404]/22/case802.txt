xerox corporation xerox appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york granting corporation,robotics corporation,robotics access corporation,and palm computing,collectively summary judgment of of united states patent patent directed to unistrokes for computerized interpretation of handwriting,and denying xerox motion for summary judgment of infringement of the patent.xerox,f,xerox.we,and remand.
background 
xerox is the owner of the patent,invented by david goldberg,a xerox employee.the patent claims a system of single stroke symbols,called unistrokes,for computer recognition of handwritten text that results in fewer errors than the prior art systems because the computer can easily interpret the symbols immediately upon pen lift.
xerox brought suit against claiming that its palmpilot line of computers used the unistrokes technology in its graffiti software.asserted affirmative defenses of invalidity,unenforceability,and.after the court found the patent not invalid for prior public use on summary judgment,filed a request for reexamination of the patent with the united states patent and trademark office pto.the pto ultimately confirmed all sixteen claims of the patent.the district court granted summary judgment of while dismissing xerox motion for summary judgment of infringement because graffiti does not employ spatial independence,its symbols are not sufficiently graphically separated from each other to be unistroke symbols,and it does not allow for definitive recognition of symbols immediately upon pen lift by the user.this appeal followed.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.vanmoor stores,citing petrolite baker hughes.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.summary judgment is improper if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.when ruling on a motion for summary judgment,all of the nonmovant evidence is to be credited,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the nonmovant favor.id.at.
an infringement analysis entails two steps.the first step is determining the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.the second step is comparing the properly construed claims to the device accused of infringing.markman westview instruments,en banc.claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.cybor fas,en banc.infringement,both literal and under the doctrine of equivalents,is a question of fact which we review for clear error.insituform,cat contracting.
the claim limitations at issue read as follows 
a system for interpreting handwritten text comprising 
a a user interface including a manually manipulatable pointer for writing mutually independent unistroke symbols in sequential time order and a user controlled signaling mechanism for performing a predetermined,symbol independent,delimiting operation between successive unistroke symbols in said sequential order,some of said unistroke symbols being linear and others being arcuate,each of said unistroke symbols representing a predefined textual component said delimiting operation distinguishing said unistroke symbols from each other totally independent of without reference to their spatial relationship with respect to each other 
patent,ll.subdivision and emphasis added.
a machine implemented method for interpreting handwritten text comprising 
a writing said text in sequential time order using an alphabet of mutually independent unistroke symbols to spell out said text at an atomic level,each of said unistroke symbols conforming to a respective graphical specification that includes a stroke direction parameter,some of said unistroke symbols having graphical specifications that differ from each other essentially only on the basis of their respective stroke direction parameters,some of said unistroke symbols being linear and others being arcuate 
b entering a predetermined,symbol independent delimiter between successive ones of said unistroke symbols in said time order,said delimiter distinguishing successive unistroke symbols from each other without reference to and totally independently of their spatial relationship with respect to each other 
ll.subdivisions and emphasis added.
a handwriting recognition process for pen computers,said process comprising the steps of 
a correlating unistroke symbols with natural language alphanumeric symbols,each of said unistroke symbols being fully defined by a single continuous stroke that conforms geometrically and directionally to a predetermined graphical specification,some of said unistroke symbols being linear and others being arcuate 
b entering user written unistroke symbols into buffer memory in sequential time order,successive ones of said unistroke symbols being delimited from each other by a predetermined,symbol independent delimiting operation,said delimiting operation distinguishing successive unistroke symbols from each other without reference to and totally independently of their spatial relationship with respect to each other 
subdivisions and emphasis added.
a machine implemented handwriting recognition process comprising the steps of 
a correlating natural language symbols with unistroke symbols,where each of said unistroke symbols is fully defined by a single continuous stroke that conforms geometrically and directionally to a predetermined graphical specification,at least certain of said unistroke symbols being arcuate 
b writing user selected unistroke symbols in sequential time order while performing a predetermined,symbol independent delimiting operation for delimiting successive ones of said unistroke symbols from each other,said delimiting operation distinguishing successive unistroke symbols from each other without reference to and totally independently of the spatial relationship of said unistroke symbols with respect to each other

argues that the four independent claims,and each include the same four limitations despite slightly different wording in each claim.these are entirely single stroke symbols,graphical separation of symbols,definitive recognition of symbols,and spatial independence.xerox counters that proposed construction is overly narrow and that only unistroke symbols,and symbol independent delimiting,pen lift,are required for infringement.
in considering the definition of unistrokes,the trial court properly looked to the plain meaning of the claims,the specification,and the prosecution history of the patent.vitronics conceptronic.the specification defines the term unistroke as a single,unbroken stroke.patent.in addition,only claims and require an entire alphabet.we therefore agree with the district court that the definition of unistrokes itself does not require an entire alphabet.
the only reference to graphical separation in the independent claims is found in claim,which states some of said unistroke symbols hav e graphical specifications that differ from each other essentially only on the basis of their respective stroke direction parameters.patent,ll.during reexamination,xerox clarified that unistroke symbols are single stroke symbols representing alphanumeric characters or specified functions that are sufficiently well separated from each other graphically so that definitive recognition can occur after each such symbol is written,immediately upon,without requiring the system to wait for possible additional strokes.xerox additionally distinguished united states patent sklarew patent on the basis that it was designed to accommodate symbols as well as single stroke symbols,and,therefore,did not implement the patent claimed combination of unistroke symbols and symbol independent delimiting.the term unistroke symbols therefore requires sufficient graphical separation for the computer to definitively recognize a symbol immediately upon delimitation or pen lift.
the district court noted that the patent discloses that the performance of interpreted text entry systems could be i
