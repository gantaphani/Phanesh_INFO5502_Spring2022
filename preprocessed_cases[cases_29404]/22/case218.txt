christopher hawes,doing business as cjh color and design group hawes,commenced this action against network solutions,and,a french corporation,under the lanham act as amended by the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,for a declaratory judgment that network solutions transfer of his domain name to was improper and that his registration and use of was not unlawful.he also seeks an injunction ordering the return of the domain name.the district court dismissed hawes complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,under federal rule of civil procedure b.
for reasons that differ from those given by the district court,we affirm dismissal of hawes complaint against network solutions.we reverse the district court order dismissing hawes complaint against and remand that portion of the case for further proceedings.
in april,hawes registered the domain name with network solutions,in herndon,virginia,and,in connection with that registration,entered into a domain name registration agreement.hawes alleges that he registered the domain name to develop a forum in which to communicate with concerning problems with its products because his efforts to communicate with had been unsuccessful and its representatives were unable to properly answer hawes inquiries.
a little over a year after hawes registered,filed suit against hawes in a french court,alleging infringement of french trademarks.upon learning of this french litigation,network solutions transmitted a registrar certificate for the domain name to counsel for in paris,tendering control and authority over the registration of the domain name to the french court,in accordance with network solutions standard service agreement with its registrants and the dispute policy incorporated therein.on hawes failure to appear before the french court,the court entered judgment in favor of and ordered the domain name to be transferred to.hawes has challenged the french court jurisdiction through appellate review.after hawes received notice of the french court order,he wrote network solutions a letter stating that if network solutions transferred the domain name pursuant to its dispute resolution policy and the ensuing french court order,then he would file suit in a federal court in the united states to establish that his registration and use of was not unlawful.notwithstanding this letter,network solutions transferred the name to on october.
in april,hawes commenced this action by filing a complaint against network solutions and.in count i,hawes alleged that network solutions breached the domain name registration agreement when it transferred to the french court.in count ii,hawes alleged that even though owned the mark,hawes registration and use of the domain name was not unlawful under the lanham act.for relief,hawes sought a declaratory judgment that network solutions transfer of control over the domain name to french counsel for deposit with the french court was not permitted and that his registration and use of that domain name was not unlawful.he also requested that the court reactivate the domain name transfer said domain name to hawes.each of the two counts are grounded on ii although no statutory section with that number exists.
on network solutions motion to dismiss,filed under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,district judge gerald lee dismissed the complaint against network solutions under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on motion to dismiss under rule b,which was assigned to district judge claude hilton,judge hilton denied the motion without prejudice to ability to resurrect the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at the conclusion of discovery.filed an answer and counterclaims for trademark infringement and trademark dilution.
after discovery proceeded for about four months,renewed its motion under rule b,arguing to judge hilton that judge lee prior dismissal of the complaint against network dictated dismissal of the complaint against because,if the district court were not to dismiss the case,we would be left in the terribly awkward position of having this court rule inherently on the propriety of network solutions actions,namely the transfer of the certificate of registration pursuant to a french court order,in the absence of network solutions.judge hilton responded 
i believe that hawes has the right to come in,if this domain name has been improperly transferred,whether it has or not is another question,but if it has been improperly transferred,he has the right to come in and ask for that domain name back.but now i find myself in a posture where my colleague has dismissed out of the case the very person who has to be here in order to get that accomplished.
judge hilton then referred the matter back to judge lee.a few days later judge lee granted motion to dismiss under rule b.because the complaint against it had been dismissed,voluntarily dismissed its counterclaims.
from the final judgment dismissing the claims against both network solutions and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,hawes filed this appeal.
in dismissing count i of the complaint,which alleged that network solutions improperly transferred the domain name,the district court construed the claim as one under d i ii bb and then gave its reason for dismissing it as follows 
hawes never alleges that any underlying acpa action was in existence when network solutions allegedly transferred the domain name.without the existence of an underlying action,network solutions,as a domain name registry,could not be in violation of.
the district court concluded that t herefore,this court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over hawes claim against network solutions pursuant to federal question jurisdiction.
in dismissing count ii of the complaint,which was asserted against to obtain the declaration that hawes registration and use of the domain name was not unlawful under title,united states code,ii sic,the district court concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction for three reasons.first,it found that there was no justiciable case or controversy,explaining that a mere desire to use a trademark in connection with a product does not constitute a course of conduct placing a party in a legally adversarial conflict with another party.second,construing count ii as a claim under d v,the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear a claim under that section because the domain name was transferred to pursuant to an order of a french court and therefore is exempt from jurisdictional grant because liability under d v for transfer of a domain name depends on the implementation of a reasonable policy effecting that transfer.the court explained,receipt of the domain name was pursuant to a court order,and not pursuant to the implementation of network solutions reasonable policy.finally,based on its first two reasons,the court indicated an unwillingness to exercise discretion to grant declaratory relief based on the discretionary language of.
in reaching these conclusions,the district court was required to interpret the complaint with scant help from hawes counsel,who based both counts of the complaint on ii,a statutory provision that does not exist.nonetheless,the district court conclusions that count i against network solutions was based on d i ii bb and that count ii against was based on d v are not only eminently reasonable but also undoubtedly correct in light of the allegations made and relief sought with respect to each count.see.f all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice anderson foundation for advancement,educ.employment of am.indians,cir federal notice pleading standards require that the complaint be read liberally in favor of the plaintiff.
count i,which hawes denominated improper transfer of domain name,alleges that network solutions has transferred,suspended,or otherwise modified the domain name.com contrary to title of the united states code,ii and hawes is thereby entitled to injunctive relief.this language mirrors the language of d i ii bb,which describes one of the three circumstances in which a domain name registrar such as network solutions may be subject to suit for injunctive relief.specifically,d i provides 
i a domain name registrar that takes any action described under clause ii refusing to register,removing from registration,transferring,temporarily disabling,or permanently canceling a domain name affecting a domain name shall not be liable for monetary relief or,except as provided in subclause ii,for injunctive relief,to any person for such action,regardless of whether the domain name is finally determined to infringe or dilute the mark.
ii a domain name registrar may be subject to injunctive relief only if such registrar has 
aa not expeditiously deposited with a court,in which an action has been filed regarding the disposition of the domain name,documents sufficient for the court to establish the court control and authority regarding the disposition of the registration and use of the domain name 
bb transferred,suspended,or otherwise modified the domain name during the pendency of the action,except upon order of the court or cc willfully failed to comply with any such court order.
it is therefore apparent that hawes brought count i under for injunctive relief based on subpart d i ii bb.
count ii,which hawes denominated an action under the anticybersquatting consumer protection act,alleges that the mark owner of has received notice that hawes intended to file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of by hawes is not unlawful.in this count,hawes 
asks that this honorable court hold that the registration use of the domain name by plaintiff is not unlawful under title,united states code,ii and that this honorable court reactivate the domain name transfer said domain name to hawes.
this language mirrors precisely the language of d v,which provides 
a domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended,disabled,or transferred under a policy described under clause ii ii may,upon notice to the mark owner,file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.the court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant,including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.
it is therefore apparent that hawes brought count ii under subpart d v of.
agreeing with the district court identification of the statutory provisions on which counts i and ii rest,we now address whether the district court properly dismissed them for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.
count i,brought under d i ii bb against network solutions,describes one of the limited circumstances in which a domain name registrar,who is otherwise exempt from trademark liability,may be subject to suit for injunctive relief.in our recent case of,excelentisimo ayuntamiento de barcelona,cir,we reviewed the provisions of that were added by congress in through the passage of the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa,et,stat.codified in scattered sections of.we explained that the acpa,in creating trademark liability for cybersquatters,also provide s limited liability for trademark infringement by registrars who participate in the administration of the registration,transfer,and cancellation of domain names pursuant to a reasonable policy that is consistent with the purposes of the trademark laws.id.at.a complaint under the acpa against a registrar is thus a claim under the trademark laws for which federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction under.section provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to trademarks.section was therefore sufficient to confer federal question subject matter jurisdiction on the district court.see bell hood.holding that federal question jurisdiction existed because the right of the petitioners to recover under their complaint will be sustained if the constitution and laws of the united states are given one construction and will be defeated if they are given another the fair kohler die specialty.i f the plaintiff really makes a substantial claim under an act of congress there is jurisdiction whether the claim ultimately be held good or bad.
for this reason,the district court erred in dismissing count i under federal rule of civil procedure b.the court,instead,should have considered hawes claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,on which network solutions also relied in its motion to dismiss,because resolution of the motion inherently requires an assessment of whether hawes has alleged all the elements necessary to state a claim under d i ii bb.see utils.northwestern pub.serv.as frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter,the question whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with the question whether the complaint states a cause of action fogel chestnutt,cir friendly,explaining the occasionally elusive distinction between lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.
considering the complaint against the standards applicable to a rule b motion,hawes failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and therefore count i must be dismissed on that basis.the statutory provision upon which count i rests exposes a registrar to liability under the lanham providing an exception to a registrar general exemption from liability under the the registrar,without court permission,transfers a domain name during the pendency of an action.d i ii bb.
hawes did allege that network solutions tendered control over the domain name to the french court after commenced an action in france against hawes for infringing french trademarks,but the pendency of a foreign action is irrelevant to the question of whether a registrar is exposed to liability under the lanham act.this conclusion that the french proceedings are irrelevant to a registrar liability under d i is compelled by the language of the lanham act as amended by the acpa,as well as its scope and structure.
the acpa creates a cause of action for cybersquatting against anyone who registers,traffics in,or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark with the badfaith intent to profit from the good will associated with the trademark.see d.it also creates a cause of action for reverse domain name hijacking against trademark owners who misuse or abuse their rights in bringing a cybersquatting action.see d v barcelona,at.the acpa thus protects both trademark owners and domain name registrants.in creating these causes of action,congress intended expressly to limit the liability of domain name registrars under the act as long as the domain name registrars comply with the conditions stated in d i.as congressional reports explain,the acpa provides a limitation of liability for registrars to encourage domain name registrars and registries to work with trademark owners to prevent cybersquatting through the suspen sion,cancel ation,or transfer of domain names pursuant to a court order or in the implementation of a reasonable policy prohibiting cybersquatting,at,at.without such limitation of liability,all registrars would potentially have been exposed to the offense of cybersquatting because they register and traffic in domain names that could be infringing or diluting trademarks protected by the lanham act.see d.thus,of the acpa,which contains the language codified at d i and is captioned limitation on liability,generally exempts domain name registrars from the liability imposed by the act for cybersquatting or reverse domain name hijacking.because the provisions conditioning the limitation of liability in d i relate to liability imposed by the lanham act as amended by the acpa,cooperating conduct by registrars with respect to foreign courts under foreign law is given no relevance in interpreting d i ii bb insofar as it requires the pendency of an action.
in this case,there was no anticybersquatting action or reverse anticybersquatting action under the acpa pending in any court at the time network solutions transferred the domain name.because there was no action adjudicating lanham act liability,there could be
