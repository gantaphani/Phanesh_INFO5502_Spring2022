background 
konrad is the owner of the,and patents,all directed to systems that allow a computer user to access and search a database residing on a remote computer.he began working as a staff scientist for the lawrence berkeley laboratory in,where he studied how an individual computer workstation user could obtain services from a remote computer.on september,while working with cynthia hertzer,a lawrence berkeley laboratory staff assistant,konrad successfully tested the remote database object system.the first prototype of this system was configured to access lawrence berkeley laboratory staff database from a remote workstation.the lawrence berkeley laboratory staff database resided on an ibm mainframe computer on the berkeley campus of the university of california.a local starter portion of the remote database object system prototype was created for installation on users personal computers to allow the display of an icon by which the user could access the remote database.in,konrad and hertzer adapted the lawrence berkeley laboratory staff remote database object system prototype for the high energy physics database,maintained at the stanford linear accelerator center,which is a national laboratory operated by stanford university.the high energy physics database was a compilation of abstracts and technical papers used as a research tool for physicists worldwide.
the patent,konrad first issued patent,is a continuation of an application filed on january.the patent is a continuation of the patent application,which is a continuation of the patent application.thus,the earliest filing date that konrad is entitled to is january,making the critical date for the public use and inquiry january.
on february,konrad filed a patent infringement suit in the district court for the eastern district of texas,alleging that commercial entities,all customers of netscape,had infringed the,and patents.citing threatened customer relationships,netscape filed a declaratory judgment action against konrad in the district court for the northern district of california,seeking a judgment of invalidity,noninfringement,and unenforceability.netscape moved for partial summary judgment that prototypes of the invention were in public use or under b based on konrad activities prior to january.the california district court entered partial summary judgment for netscape concluding that konrad demonstration of the claimed invention to shuli roth and dick peters,university of california computing personnel,without any obligation of confidentiality was a public use his demonstration of the high energy physics remote database object to the stanford linear accelerator center in conjunction with the use of the remote database object by university research association superconducting super collider laboratory employees was a public use and his offer to create the high energy physics remote database object system for the university research association superconducting super collider laboratory in exchange for four months employment or no more than,and his stipulation that the reduction to practice of the invention occurred prior to that event,satisfied the bar.konrad stipulated that all of the claims of the patents in suit would be invalid if the court were to find that his activities qualified as prior art.in view of this stipulation,on june,the district court entered the parties joint stipulation for final judgment on invalidity.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

konrad argues that the district court erred in determining that his demonstration of the lawrence berkeley laboratory staff remote database object to university of california computing personnel was an invalidating public use.he maintains that the invention disclosure he submitted to the lawrence berkeley laboratory patent department in october of,established an expectation of confidentiality from roth and peters.netscape responds that the district court correctly determined that konrad failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the demonstrated prototype was not in public use,and was prior art for the purpose of evaluating the validity of the patents in suit.
we agree with netscape.konrad did not show that roth or peters were ever made aware of any requirement of confidentiality or even apprised o
