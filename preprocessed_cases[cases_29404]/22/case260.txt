this case involves the regulation of unsolicited,commercial mass electronic messages emails a species belonging to the larger communication genus often referred to as spam plaintiff white buffalo ventures,llc white buffalo,operates several online dating services,including,which targets students at the university of texas at austin ut.pursuant to its internal policy ut blocked white buffalo attempts to send unsolicited bulk commercial email.
white buffalo sought to enjoin ut from excluding its incoming email.the district court denied the injunction.on for summary judgment,the court granted ut motion and denied white buffalo.white buffalo appeals,challenging the ruling on the grounds that federal law preempts ut internal policy the regents rules and that the policy violates the first amendment.mindful that this case presents several novel issues,the significance of which will grow proportionally with heightened cultural and economic reliance on the internet,we affirm.
we make two determinations.first,we decide that the act does not preempt ut policy.second,we determine that the policy is permissible under our first amendment commercial speech jurisprudence,but we reserve judgment on whether state university email servers constitute public or private fora.
the parties do not dispute the facts.ut provides,free of charge,internet access and email addresses to faculty,staff,and students at the domain.owners of electronic mail accounts can access those accounts either by means of wireless connections or of wired,authenticated clusters or remotely by means of some other internet access provider.an owner of a ut user account may,for example,log on from any or broadband service provider and check for email residing on one of ut email servers.
ut has a policy of blocking many types of incoming spam,irrespective of commercial content or source authenticity.under the regents rules,the technology department the itc implements procedures to block incoming unsolicited,commercial emails and to stop the transmission of such emails 
white buffalo operates several online dating services,including one,called,that targets ut students.in february,white buffalo submitted a public information act request seeking all,email addresses held by ut,which responded by disclosing all qualifying email addresses.in april,white buffalo began sending legal commercial spam to targeted members of the ut community 
ut received several complaints regarding unsolicited email blasts from white buffalo.ut investigated and determined that white buffalo had indeed sent unsolicited emails to tens of thousands of ut email,at which point ut issued a cease and desist letter.white buffalo refused to comply with that letter,so ut blocked all email ingress from the ip address that was the source address for the unsolicited white buffalo spam.the filter blocked all email sent from that ip address to addresses containing the.edu string.
white buffalo obtained a temporary restraining order tro in state court.ut removed the cause to federal court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction there the tro was continued pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction.after a hearing in may,the district court denied the injunction.the parties conducted discovery,and both moved for summary judgment.the district court granted ut summary judgment motion and denied white buffalo.
this court reviews a summary judgment grant de novo,in accordance with the fed civ.proc.analysis that guides the district court.ford motor.dep t of,cir.the district court entered judgment for ut on for summary judgment.on review,the motions are reviewed independently,with evidence and inferences taken in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see id.we review a district court preemption determinations de novo.see baker farmers,cir.
the doctrine of preemption stems from the supremacy clause which gives federal law precedence over a conflicting state law.see cipollone liggett group,d.preemption of state law derives from an express provision in the act.see b.
although a court should begin with the expression provided by congress,it must also identify the domain expressly.the fact that congress has expressly preempted certain activity is plain,but the scope of that express preemption is not.the power to supplant state law is an extraordinary power in a federalist system.gregory ashcroft,d.preemption radically alters the balance of state and federal authority,so the supreme court has historically refused to impose that alteration interstitially.see id.the court has expressed this principle as a presumption against preemption of state law supremacy clause analysis is classic tie goes to the state jurisprudence,and the existence of an express preemption provision does not always plainly demarcate what the federal law expressly preempts.
the district court granted summary judgment to ut on white buffalo claim that the act preempts itc regulations.the court premised its holding on four propositions that the purposes of,as determined by reference to the statute and the accompanying senate report,suggest that congress did not mean to preempt technological approaches to combating spam that c specifically exempts ut from the scope of express preemption that b,which states that s tate laws not specific to electronic mail,including state trespass,contract,or tort law are not preempted,exempts ut policy because that policy is part of a larger set of rules and that ut its policy is not a statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state and is therefore not preempted by b.we do not organize our discussion around these four propositions because the appellate briefing renders an alternate organization more desirable,but we discuss each in its appropriate context.
to our knowledge,no fifth circuit panel has scrutinized any portion of,and no court in this country has considered the legislation preemption clause.this is therefore an issue of very,very first impression.
in part,prohibits fraudulent,abusive and deceptive commercial email,provides for enforcement of the act by federal agencies,states,and internet service providers isps,id.and provides for the issuance of regulations to implement the purposes of the act,id.the parties have agreed,in the district court and on appeal,that white buffalo complied with the requirements of the act.its email blasts were not unlawful.
most relevant to white buffalo claim is preemption clause 
this chapter supersedes any statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state that expressly regulates the use of electronic mail to send commercial messages,except to the extent that any such statute,regulation,or rule prohibits falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.
white buffalo argues that this preemption clause prevents ut from promulgating regulations to impede the ingress of emails to users.according to white buffalo,because ut is a state actor and has conceded that white buffalo spam is not false or fraudulent,preempts the regents rules authorizing the email filters.white buffalo provides no authority beyond b in support of this position.
matters become more complicated because,in addition to setting forth the preemption clause,carves out a set of entities to be exempt from any possible preemptive effect.it states that n othing in this chapter shall be construed to have any effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the adoption,implementation,or enforcement by a provider of internet access service of a policy of declining to transmit,route,relay,handle,or store certain types of electronic mail messages.c.
the district court held that does not preempt ut policy.it noted that c permits internet service providers to employ protection measures,and it held that ut belongs to that set of service providers.the court also relied on congress acknowledgment of the problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse of unsolicited commercial email that can not be solved by federal legislation alone but that will also require the development and adoption of technological approaches to serve the goals of the act.see a.the court found that t he act does not preclude a state entity like ut from using technological devices such as to conserve server space and safeguard the time and resources of its employees,students,and faculty.white buffalo ventures,llc of at austin,no,wl,at.
there are two competing interpretations,both rooted firmly in the text of the act,of the degree of authority state actors may wield in response to commercial spam.under the first,state entities may not regulate commercial speech except where that regulation relates to the authenticity of the speech source and content.under the second,state entities may implement a variety of related commercial speech restrictions,provided the state entity implementing them is an internet access provider.
as a result of congress apparent failure to contemplate this question,we must not infer preemption.the textual ambiguity triggers the strong presumption against such a finding,and we can not be sure whether ut regulations fall within the ambit of the express preemption clause.ut may therefore implement the regents rules without violating the supremacy clause.
ut argues that does not preempt the itc policy because the act does not displace the state ability to supplement federal law and because preempts state rules that relate to the sending,rather than the receipt,of unsolicited commercial emails.section b carefully specifies state political subdivisions as falling within the scope of its preemption,and ut is a public school 
in a vacuum,the provision is explicit about the types of policies preempts.in layman terms,state entities may not regulate the use of electronic mail to send commercial spam except where those rules relate to source and content authenticity.ut emphasizes congress choice to use the word send in the statute.as a result,ut argues,does not preempt its regulation of received emails.we decline to imbue the word send with the particular significance ut urges 
does not preempt the regents rules,because b is in tension with plain text found elsewhere in the act,and that tension triggers the presumption against preemption.the district court properly sought to interpret c,which reads,nothing in this act shall be construed to have any effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the adoption,implementation,or enforcement by a provider of internet access service of a policy of declining to transmit,route,relay,handle,or store certain types of electronic mail messages.in finding no express preemption,the court both averred that the itc policy may not constitute a statute,regulation,or rule of a state or political subdivision of a state,b,and noted that ut is a provider of internet access.any suggestion along the lines of that an itc policy does not constitute a policy of a state incorrect and requires little explanation.itc implements the directives of,and operates pursuant to the authority of,the board of regents its policies therefore constitute rules of a state subdivision 
we therefore confine ourselves primarily to the discussion of.the district court stated that ut is certainly a provider of internet access service to its students,if not to its employees and faculty,so it is expressly authorized under the statute to implement policies declining to transmit,route,relay,handle or store spam.
the district court says certainly without any reference to the definition provided in the statute.congress,in fact,imports that definition wholesale from a statutory predecessor,the internet tax freedom act a service that enables users to access content,information,electronic mail,or other services offered over the internet,and may also include access to proprietary content,information,and other services as a part of a package of services offered to consumers.
we doubt that those legislators responsible for passing the internet tax freedom act gave serious consideration to the situation the instant facts present.ut indeed provides internet access time somebody sits down at a computer terminal on users need not check their ut email from ut network computers,because they can access the email server remotely.nonetheless,status as an internet access provider does not appear to turn on the fraction of access conducted remotely,and we are to find that providing email accounts and email access does not bring ut within the statutory definition borrowed from the internet tax freedom act we therefore decide that ut falls within the ambit of c.
we analyze this issue using a venn diagram the intersecting area of which congress did not the state entity is itself the provider of internet access.in that area resides activity that congress has both expressly preempted and expressly excepted from preemption analysis.such tension,created by the text of the statute,leaves us unwilling to overrule the strong presumption against preemption.the regents rules are valid under the supremacy clause.
white buffalo contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its first amendment claim.whether ut has violated white buffalo first amendment rights turns on the resolution of the commercial speech test in central hudson gas electric public service commission,d.we review first amendment determinations under the commercial speech doctrine de novo.see moore morales,cir.resolving this issue in favor of ut,we decline to reach the issue of whether ut email servers constitute public fora 
commercial speech is expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.central hudson,at.no one seriously disputes the commercial character of the speech at issue here.
in central hudson,the court invalidated portions of state regulations banning commercial advertising that promoted the use of electricity.see id.at.the court determined that the government action was more extensive than necessary to promote the state substantial interest in energy conservation.id.at.in so doing,the court announced a test to evaluate the legality of commercial speech regulation whether the speech is unlawful or misleading whether the government expressed interest is substantial whether the state action directly promotes that interest and whether the state action is more extensive than necessary to promote that interest.see id.at.
under the first central hudson prong,we must determine whether the speech is unlawful or misleading.see id.both parties agree that white buffalo commercial solicitations are legal and that they contain factually accurate information.
under the second central hudson prong we must assess the substantiality of the government proffered interests.see id.ut advances two primary interests safeguarding the time and interests of those with ut email accounts user efficiency and protecting the efficiency of its networks and servers server efficiency.we distinguish between the two interests for reasons that are important under the fourth prong of the central hudson analysis.
for purposes of evaluating the summary judgment,we acknowledge as substantial the government gatekeeping interest in protecting users of its email network from the hassle associated with unwanted spam.also substantial is the server efficiency interest,but it must independently satisfy a goodness of fit inquiry under the fourth prong of central hudson.suffer the servers is among the most chronically and interests asserted by parties both government and private ones involved in internet litigation,and rules imposed pursuant to such interests require more than a judicial,for reasons we explain in part.b,infra.
pursuant to the third central hudson prong,we must next determine whether the ut policy directly advances both proffered substantial interests ut interest in sanitizing the network for its email user efficiency and its interest in preserving the operating efficiency of its servers server efficiency.see id.at.again,there can be no serious dispute that ut policy,which blocks specific incoming commercial spam after have complained about it,directly advances both interests.one can hardly imagine a more direct means of preventing commercial spam from appearing in inboxes and occupying server space than promulgating a policy that excludes such material from the email network 
having resolved the first three central hudson questions in ut favor,we must finally conduct the most difficult the itc policy is no more extensive than necessary to achieve at least one of the two substantial state interests.see id.at.white buffalo contends that ut policy fails to meet this final requirement,although white buffalo precise objection is hard to discern.it appears to protest the of the policy on the ground that it is impossible to articulate precisely what the ut regulation is.
to the contrary,ut relying on the district court disposition of the issue reasons that the policy is narrowly and specifically drawn to protect the system and users from only those unsolicited,commercial emails that have been identified as problematic by complaint,system monitors,or other means.the restriction is tailored by blocking only those emails from specifically identified isp addresses.although we may not agree with all of ut characterizations of its policy,we are aware of what that policy is.white buffalo objection in this regard is without merit.
with respect to the first proffered substantial state interest,which is promoting user efficiency the itc policy is no more extensive than necessary.we have little problem affirming the proposition that,to keep community members from wasting time identifying,deleting,and blocking unwanted spam,ut may block otherwise lawful commercial spam as long as the blocks are content and 
we reject,however,the proposition that the itc policy is no more extensive than necessary to secure the state second substantial interest,which is the efficiency of its servers one might persuasively present evidence that spam,taken in its entirety,affects the efficiency of email servers indeed,that appears to be what ut has proffered it submits a list of between and blocked ip addresses updegrove testified at the may preliminary injunction hearing that ut system would not be able to function without these blocks.such testimony is common where server efficiency is offered as a state or private interest in internet litigation.
we must nonetheless consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.see ford motor,at.moreover,the challenged regulation should indicate that its proponent carefully calculated the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition.cincinnati discovery network,d internal citations and quotations omitted.
there is record testimony that white buffalo can send a restricted volume of email at times,so as not to impede server efficiency.moreover,ut list of blocked ip addresses does not make any of the types of distinctions that congress obviously thought between,say,truthful commercial messages and obscene images,commercial messages with an unsubscribe feature and commercial messages without one,emails sent during peak traffic times and those that are not,and email that originates from an authentic source and email that does not.the rub is that although the record demonstrates that unblocking all spam might compromise network efficiency,it says nothing about the effects of allowing lawful time and commercial spam to enter ut email network.
an exchange at the preliminary injunction hearing between ut attorney and updegrove most vividly illustrates the poor fit between ut restrictions and the substantial interest in server efficiency 
q well,white buffalo attorney is saying,well,hey,i can send this at night when the employees are there.i wo send too many at one time.it wo affect your system that much because of that.now,is there a reason why that not an acceptable proposition.
a well,if something is wrong,just because there a little bit of it does make it right.if a university makes resources available,misusing a little bit of those resources is correct.
for the server efficiency rationale to pass muster under the fourth prong of central hudson,spam filters must block a set of spam that poses a legitimate threat to server efficiency.
this is not to say that ut need draw granular distinctions between types of spam where drawing them renders filtering economically infeasible it,however,is to say that where ut may easily use certain types of,time of day and volume should use them rather than categorically exclude all unsolicited commercial bulk email.if those types of filters are economically infeasible,that evidence should be in the summary judgment record.the current record reflects only that ut does not employ such filters because legal spammers are subjectively misusing the system,not because they are overburdening it.
our conclusion that,for summary judgment purposes,there is an insufficient fit between the itc policy and the asserted interest in server efficiency is of little moment in the spam context.the server efficiency interest is almost always coextensive with the user efficiency interest,and the fit is sufficient for the latter but declaring server integrity to be a substantial interest without evidentiary substantiation might have unforeseen and undesirable ramifications in other online contexts 
a governmental entity may assert that a statute serves multiple interests,and only one of those need be substantial.see bolger youngs drug prods,d.the itc policy survives first amendment scrutiny despite its failure to justify that policy in relationship to the server efficiency interest.we therefore decide that ut policy is constitutionally permissible under central hudson.because we so decide,we need not address what type of first amendment forum a public university email network constitutes.
the summary judgment is affirmed.
because the term spam is often thought of pejoratively,it is important to note that although that term necessarily implies that the email was unsolicited,the more general meaning does not imply anything about the veracity of the information contained in the email require that the entity sending it be properly identified or authenticated or require that the email,even if true,be commercial in character.there nonetheless appears to be no consensus as to the precise meaning of the term spam,which is sometimes used synonymously with unsolicited bulk email.a set of spam messages sent out together is called an email blast.the term spam derives from a monty python flying circus sketch in which a waitress recites a menu containing egg and spam egg bacon and spam egg bacon sausage and spam spam bacon sausage and spam spam egg spam spam bacon and spam spam sausage spam spam bacon spam tomato and spam see roger allen ford,comment,preemption of state spam laws by the federal act,chi,citing david crystal,language and the internet cambridge.
ut has a general policy against solicitation,which it articulates in the rules and regulations of the board of regents of the university of texas system the regents.pursuant to that policy,ut,with limited exceptions,prohibits solicitation at and on its facilities and has promulgated specific procedures dealing with unsolicited email communications,including commercial solicitations.under these procedures,when unsolicited email communications come to the attention of university network administrators by way of complaints,system monitors,or other means,ut takes steps to block or otherwise stop the transmission of such emails,with or without notice to the sender,as circumstances permit or warrant.
specifically,white buffalo contends that ut regulations are preempted by the controlling the assault of pornography and marketings act of the act or the act,stat.
these procedures may or may not provide notice to the sender,depending on the circumstances.
we presume the legality of these emails based on this record,the parties agreement,and the absence of any challenge.
an internet protocol ip address is a unique numeric address,written as numerals separated by periods,identifying each sender or receiver of information traveling across the internet.an ip address has two parts the identifier of a particular network on the internet say,the first bits and an identifier of the particular device which can be a server or a workstation within that network.in
