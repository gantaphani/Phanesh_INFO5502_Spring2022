on this appeal,we consider for the first time whether a plaintiff claim against a website operator arising out of allegedly defamatory comments posted to the website is barred by the communications decency act cda,codified as usc.we conclude that it is,and that the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was properly granted.
as stated in the complaint,plaintiff christakis shiamili is the founder and ceo of ardor realty ardor,a new york apartment rental and sales company.in march,shiamili filed this action for defamation and unfair competition by disparagement against defendants the real estate group of new york,tregny,daniel baum,and ryan mccann.tregny is a competitor of ardor,also engaged in selling and renting new york city apartments baum is tregny principal and chief operating officer and mccann is baum assistant.
these defendants allegedly administer and choose content for a publicly accessible website a blog dedicated to the new york city real estate industry in february,defendants allegedly published defamatory statements about shiamili on the website.specifically,a lengthy comment was added to a discussion thread by a user operating under the pseudonym ardor realty sucks.the comment made several allegedly defamatory statements suggesting that shiamili mistreated his employees and was racist and,referring to one of the company agents as his token jew.mccann,in his role as website administrator,moved the comment to a post,prefacing it with the statement that,the following story came to us as a comment,and we promoted it to a post.the post was given the heading,ardor realty and those people,and the,and now it time for your weekly dose of hate,brought to you unedited,once again,by ardor realty sucks.and for the record,we are so.not.afraid.the post was accompanied by a traditional image of jesus christ with shiamili face and the words,chris shiamili king of the token jews.
several of the comments posted by anonymous users in the ensuing discussion thread contained further allegedly defamatory statements,including suggestions that ardor was in financial trouble and that shiamili abused and cheated on his wife.one of the commentators ended by saying call me a liar and i come back here and get really specific.the complaint alleges that mccann,under a pseudonym,responded,liar in an attempt to encourage the user to say more,but that commentator did not post further.shiamili responded by drafting a lengthy comment,which was added to the discussion thread.shiamili also contacted mccann and requested that he remove the defamatory statements,but mccann refused to do so.
shiamili brought this action,alleging in his complaint that the defamatory statements were made with the intent to injure his reputation,and that defendants either made or published the statements.in addition to damages,the complaint requests injunctive relief requiring defendants to stop publication of any and all defamatory statements concerning shiamili and ardor and any further disparagement.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action cplr a.in support of the motion,mccann submitted an affidavit acknowledging that he was the administrator and moderator of the website,which functioned as a virtual bulletin board,or open discussion forum to which anyone could add content in the form of a comment on an existing post.only mccann,in his role as moderator,could create posts capable of generating their own discussion threads.
supreme court denied the motion to dismiss.as relevant here,it found that section c of the cda usc c,did not require dismissal of plaintiff claims,since information as to defendants role,if any,in authoring or developing the content of the website is exclusively within their possession and discovery had not yet occurred.
the appellate division unanimously reversed,granted the motion to dismiss,and dismissed the complaint.the court explained that the cda protects website operators from liability derived from the exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions see shiamili v real estate group of new york,dept.because the complaint here does not allege that defendants authored the defamatory content,but only that they published and edited it,the court concluded that the cda bars shiamili claim and that further discovery is unnecessary see id.we granted shiamili leave to appeal and now affirm.
although a publisher of defamatory material authored by a is generally subject to tort liability,congress has carved out an exception for internet publication by enacting section of the cda,passed as part of the telecommunications act of pub l,stat cong,sess.section establishes that,n o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider usc c,and it preempts any state law including imposition of tort liability inconsistent with its protections see usc e.a defendant is therefore immune from state law liability if it is a provider or user of an interactive computer service the complaint seeks to hold the defendant liable as a publisher or speaker and the action is based on information provided by another information content provider usc c see also fed.trade commn.accusearch,barnes,universal communications,v lycos.the statute defines an information content provider as any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service usc f 
in passing section,congress acknowledged that,t he internet offer s a forum for a true diversity of political discourse,unique opportunities for cultural development,and myriad avenues for intellectual activity usc a,and that it has flourished,to the benefit of all americans,with a minimum of government regulation usc a.further,it is the policy of the united states to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the internet and other interactive computer services,unfettered by federal or state regulation usc b.as the fourth circuit explained in the seminal case of zeran am.online,
congress recognized the threat that lawsuits pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning internet medium.the imposition of tort liability on service providers for the communications of others represented,for congress,simply another form of intrusive government regulation of speech.section was enacted,in part,to maintain the robust nature of internet communication and,accordingly,to keep government interference in the medium to a minimum.
additionally,section was designed to encourage service providers to the dissemination of offensive material over their services id.at.in this respect,the statute was a response to cases such as stratton oakmont,prodigy servs.wl sup ct county,in which an internet service provider was found liable for defamatory statements posted by third parties because it had voluntarily screened and edited some offensive content,and so was considered a publisher see stratton oakmont,wl at hr rep,cong,sess,at.section c was meant to undo the perverse incentives created by this reasoning,which effectively penalized providers for monitoring content see zeran,at.thus,section has two parallel goals.the statute is designed at once to promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material barnes,at,quoting carafano.
both state and federal courts around the country have generally interpreted section immunity broadly,so as to effectuate congress policy choice not to deter harmful online speech through the route of imposing tort liability on companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties potentially injurious messages universal communications,at,quoting zeran,at see also johnson arden,the majority of federal circuits have interpreted the cda to establish broad federal immunity to any cause of action that would make service providers liable for information originating with a user of the service internal quotation marks omitted doe myspace,courts have construed the immunity provisions in broadly in all cases arising from the publication of content barrett rosenthal,cal,noting that a broad reading of section c immunity has been accepted,in both federal and state courts doe am.online,fla l weekly,adopting the reasoning in zeran.new york trial courts have also taken this view see reit yelp,sup ct,county kuersteiner schrader,sup ct,county,october,shafer,index.
we have not yet had occasion to address the scope of section protections.in lunney prodigy servs,we took note of the fourth circuit opinion in zeran and its robust understanding of cda immunity as encompassing both publisher and distributor liability,but we left the decision whether to adopt that interpretation for another day id.at.today,we follow what may fairly be called the national consensus see barrett,cal at,at n citing cases and read section as generally immunizing internet service providers from liability for content wherever such liability depends on characterizing the provider as a publisher or speaker of objectionable material.
consistent with this view,we read section to bar lawsuits seeking to hold a service provider liable for its exercise of a publisher traditional editorial functions such as deciding whether to publish,withdraw,postpone or alter content zeran,at see also barnes,at publication involves reviewing,editing,and deciding whether to publish or to withdraw from publication content.notably,the statute does not differentiate between neutral and selective publishers see batzel smith,the exclusion of publisher liability necessarily precludes liability for exercising the usual prerogative of publishers to choose among proffered material and to edit the material published while retaining its basic form and message blumenthal drudge,f supp,ddc congress has made a policy choice by providing immunity even where the interactive service provider has an active,even aggressive role in making available content prepared by others.
service providers are only entitled to this broad immunity,however,where the content at issue is provided by another information content provider usc c.it follows that if a defendant service provider is itself the content provider,it is not shielded from liability see nemet chevrolet,v,fair housing council of san fernando valley v,llc,universal communications,at.since a content provider is any party responsible in part for the creation or development of information usc f,any piece of content can have multiple providers.
it may be difficult in certain cases to determine whether a service provider is also a content provider,particularly since the definition of content provider is so elastic,and no consensus has emerged concerning what conduct constitutes development 
t he broadest sense of the term develop could include the functions of an ordinary search engine indeed,just about any function performed by a website.but to read the term so broadly would defeat the purposes of section by swallowing up every bit of the immunity that the section otherwise provides.at the same time,reading the exception for as applying only to content that originates entirely with the website ignores the words development in part in the statutory passage,at.
the ninth circuit approach,which shiamili asks us to adopt,is to interpret the term development as referring not merely to augmenting the content generally,but to materially contributing to its alleged unlawfulness id.at.this view,which has been cited with approval by the tenth circuit see accusearch,at,considers a website a content provider if it contributes materially to the alleged illegality of the conduct,at.
in the case before us,we need not decide whether to apply the ninth circuit relatively broad view of development since,even under that court analysis,shiamili claim fails.although the statements at issue are unquestionably offensive and obnoxious,defendants are nonetheless shielded from liability by section.shiamili does not dispute that defendants,as alleged website operators,are providers of an interactive computer service under section see,at n the most common interactive computer services are websites universal communication,at web site operators are providers of interactive computer services within the meaning of section.further,the claims here defamation and unfair competition by disparagement clearly seek to hold the defendants liable as publishers and speakers.the remaining question is whether,taking the facts alleged in the complaint as true,the defamatory statements were provided by another information content provider usc c.
as an initial matter,the complaint alleges that the defamatory statements were first posted by anonymous users there is no allegation that defendants actually authored the statements.a website is generally not a content provider with respect to comments posted by users see dimeo max,fed appx.we reject shiamili contention that defendants should be deemed content providers because they created and ran a website which implicitly encouraged users to post negative comments about the new york city real estate industry.creating an open forum for to post content including negative commentary is at the core of what section protects see accusearch,at noting that online message boards are t he prototypical service qualifying for section immunity.
moreover,there is no allegation that the defamatory comments were posted in response to any specific invitation for users to bash shiamili or ardor doctor,qip holder llc,wl d conn.evidence submitted by shiamili in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss indicates that the website had been operating for over a year before any of the comments that are the subject of this lawsuit were posted,and that the posted commentary spanned a range of topics.even assuming that solicitation can constitute development,this is plainly not a case where the website can be charged with soliciting the defamatory content at issue.nor can it be said that mccann attempt at provoking further commentary in the shiamili discussion thread is actionable,since none followed.
the defendants did not become content providers by virtue of moving one of the comments to its own post.reposting content created and initially posted by a third party is a publisher traditional editorial functions zeran,at.indeed,this case is analogous to others in which service providers have been protected by section after reposting or otherwise disseminating false information supplied by a third party.to cite only a few examples,in ben ezra,weinstein,and,v am.online the defendant service provider would publish updated securities information supplied by third parties and derived from a variety of stock exchanges and markets.plaintiff sued the provider for publishing inaccurate information concerning the price and share volume of plaintiff stock.the tenth circuit found that the inaccurate information was created by third parties,and the web provider was not responsible,in whole or in part,for its creation and development id.at.the ninth circuit reached the same result in batzel at,cited with approval in at.there,the editor of an email newsletter received a tip and incorporated it into the newsletter,adding a headnote.the tip proved false,but the ninth circuit found that section protected the editor from being sued for libel because he had been merely editing portions of an and selecting material for publication batzel,at.similarly,in dimeo fed appx at a case quite like this one the plaintiff sued for defamation based on comments left by anonymous users on defendant website,where defendant could select which posts to publish and edit ed their content dimeo max,f supp,ed pa.the third circuit found that the website posts constitute information furnished by third party information content providers fed appx at.
shiamili argues that this case fits within a line of federal decisions in which courts have found that even if the data are supplied by third parties,a website operator may still contribute to the content illegality and thus be liable as a developer of the content,at see also accusearch,at.those cases,however,are easily distinguishable.in,the p
