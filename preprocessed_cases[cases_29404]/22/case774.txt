background 
this case involves two datamize patents,patent patent and patent.datamize principal kevin burns is the named inventor of the patents,which were continuations of his patent patent.the patents are entitled authoring system for information delivery system and share a common specification.
the patented invention is a computer program that is used to create other computer programs an authoring tool.the invention encompasses both the method of creating the computer program and the software for creating the computer program.the patent contains method claims,and the patent is asserted to contain both method and apparatus claims.the authoring tool may be used to create customized kiosks.as an example,the patents explain the authoring tool might be used to create electronic kiosks used at ski resorts to provide information to customers about ski conditions,local hotels,and restaurants through a touch screen or key pad.the patented invention is not the kiosk itself,but is the software for,and the method of,creating the kiosk 
plumtree is a computer software company that produces corporate portal software.the corporate portal is software that brings together various applications and information into a customized desktop screen that employees of an organization can separately access.plumtree primarily markets its corporate portal software to companies that want to organize their corporate intranet sites.
this declaratory judgment action brought by plumtree concerning the and patents is not the first lawsuit between datamize and plumtree.on may,datamize filed an infringement suit against plumtree in the united states district court for the district of montana alleging infringement of the parent patent montana action.on the same day,datamize sent a letter to plumtree stating 
datamize believes that plumtree is infringing the patent by,among other things,providing software enabling the operation of portals and kiosks employing customization and personalization features.we also believe that plumtree will infringe the claims in the continuation patent application when it issues as a patent.from the prior communications,it does not appear that plumtree has appreciated the implication of datamize patent rights.plumtree software,datamize,llc,slip op.at,emphasis added.the underscored language referred to a pending patent application that later issued as the patent.datamize attached the patent application claims to the letter,and the letter stated that the application claims had been allowed.the letter stated further that b ecause a direct assertion of patent infringement could subject datamize to a declaratory judgment action by plumtree in an inconvenient forum,datamize has proceeded to preserve its rights by filing the attached complaint charging infringement of the patent.id.at.the complaint could not and did not include infringement claims with respect to the patent.that patent issued on october.
on november,pursuant to plumtree motion to dismiss,a magistrate judge recommended dismissing the montana action as to the patent for lack of personal jurisdiction over plumtree.on december,before the magistrate recommendation was adopted by the district court,plumtree filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california seeking a judgment that it did not infringe the patent first california action.datamize then counterclaimed for infringement on july,the district of montana judge adopted the magistrate recommendation and dismissed the montana action for lack of personal jurisdiction.
on september,datamize filed a third lawsuit alleging infringement of the patent against nine defendants not including plumtree in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas texas action.after the patent issued on december,datamize moved to add infringement claims under the patent to the texas action.in briefing the motion to add the patent claims,datamize argued that,in light of the similarity of the and patents,it would be highly surprising if defendants counsel had not specifically considered the possibility that datamize would add the patent to this case.at.an interrogatory was served in the texas action asking datamize to list each product made,used,offered for sale,or sold by persons other than the defendants that datamize contends incorporates or embodies a claimed invention of the patent s.in its response,datamize listed plumtree corporate portal and enterprise web suite.
on july,in the first california action,the district court granted plumtree summary judgment motion and held that the asserted claims of the patent were invalid for indefiniteness under,because the term aesthetically pleasing rendered the claims too subjective.this court eventually affirmed the grant of summary judgment.datamize,llc plumtree software.
on the same day,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plumtree on the patent,plumtree filed the present declaratory judgment action with respect to the and patents second california action.those patents are similar to the patent but do not include the aesthetically pleasing language.on october,plumtree filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the and patents were invalid under the on sale bar because the methods of the patent claims had been on sale or offered for sale before the critical date one year before the application date.three days later,datamize filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the theory that plumtree had not established a reasonable apprehension that datamize would sue it for infringement of the and patents.
plumtree summary judgment motion established the following undisputed facts.
in early emmett and kevin burns formed multimedia adventures ma which later assigned its patents to datamize.by december kevin burns had completed development of the authoring tool which could be used to create an interactive kiosk system.on january,representatives from ma gave a presentation to representatives from the ski industry of america sia,sponsors of a ski industry trade show,offering to create a kiosk for the trade show.on january,sia sent a letter to ma confirming that ma would provide a kiosk at the trade show in exchange for sia waiving the sponsorship fee associated with participation in the electronic information center.at.the trade show was held on march,in las vegas,nv,shortly after the february,critical date,and the kiosk was displayed when it was completed near the end of the first day of the show.the record establishes that the skipath kiosk was created with the authoring system and that the authoring system embodied all the claims of all three of datamize patents.at.
the district court first considered datamize motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the court concluded that declaratory judgment jurisdiction was proper because a case or controversy existed as to both the and patents.as to the patent,the court stated that datamize may,letter represented an explicit threat or other action that would cause reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit.plumtree,slip.op.at.although the letter was sent two years before plumtree filed the declaratory judgment action,the court found that there was no evidence indicating that datamize intention to pursue litigation over alleged infringement of the patent had changed.id.at.the court noted that the may,letter did not refer to the patent.however,under the totality of the circumstances,the court concluded that plumtree had a reasonable apprehension of suit regarding the patent because datamize had already sued plumtree on the parent patent,sued other defendants in the texas action on the and patents,and identified plumtree as infringing both patents.accordingly,the court stated that the amalgamation of the may,letter,the infringement suit and the tx action represents an explicit threat or other action that would cause plumtree to have a reasonable apprehension of suit.id.at internal quotations omitted.
next the district court considered plumtree motion for summary judgment.the court held both the and patents invalid under the on sale bar rule.the court concluded that the bar was triggered by the facts of this case because there was an agreement to perform a method claim before the critical date.id.at.the basis for this holding was the fact that a t the january,meeting,ma offered to provide its interactive electronic kiosk system during the march trade show.id.at internal quotations omitted.the court found that ma received consideration because ma was granted a prime location and its fee was waived in exchange for the display of ma kiosk.id.the court noted that ma meeting with sia on january,and the subsequent agreement both occurred before the february,critical date.the court then stated that the agreement with sia embodied all of the claims of the and patents because the kiosk at the trade show embodied all of the claims.id.at.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in favor of plumtree.
datamize timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the determination of whether article iii jurisdiction exists is a question of law that we review without deference.arrowhead indus.water,ecolochem.we review the underlying factual findings for clear error.vysis.
a declaratory judgment action may be brought where there is an actual controversy between interested parties.see aetna life ins.haworth.bp chems.union carbide.this court has developed a test for determining whether an actual controversy exists.there must be both an explicit threat or other action by the patentee,which creates a reasonable apprehension on the part of the declaratory plaintiff that it will face an infringement suit,and present activity which could constitute infringement or concrete steps taken with the intent to conduct such activity.sierra applied,advanced energy,quoting bp,at here the parties do not dispute that the second prong is met.accordingly,we need only determine,under the first prong,whether plumtree had a reasonable apprehension that it would face an infringement suit on the and patents.
this court looks to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the conduct meets the first prong of the test.arrowhead indus.water,at.
our decision in goodyear tire rubber releasomers,is directly on point.in that case,releasesomers sued goodyear in state court for misappropriation of trade secrets.while the trade secret litigation was pending,patents were issued to releasomers that were directed to essentially the same technology involved in the state trade secret litigation.id.at.we noted that the situation here indicates that these parties are themselves currently embroiled in a protracted dispute in state court over the commercial technology generally covered by the patents.id.at.we found that b y suing goodyear in state court for the same technology as is now covered by the patents,releasomers has engaged in a course of conduct that shows a willingness to protect that technology,and a reasonable apprehension of suit.id.at see also vanguard research,peat,finding reasonable apprehension where peat sued vanguard for misappropriation of trade secrets regarding the same technology and stating that f iling a lawsuit for patent infringement would be just another logical step in peat quest to protect its technology.
here,before plumtree commenced this declaratory judgment action,datamize had sued plumtree on the parent patent.although the and patents do not share the same aesthetically pleasing language as the patent,the three patents all describe a similar technology and share a common specification.here,as in goodyear and vanguard,b y suing earlier for the same technology as is now covered by the patents in suit,the patent holder has engaged in a course of conduct that shows a willingness to protect that technology,goodyear,at,and has created a reasonable apprehension of suit.
datamize argues that,even if there were a reasonable apprehension of suit in when the suit on the patent was filed,the declaratory judgment action on the and patents was not filed until july,and the passage of time had dissipated any reasonable apprehension.where the defendant does not sign a covenant not to sue,a reasonable apprehension may only be eliminated in narrow circumstances because otherwise a patent holder could attempt patent enforcement with tactics that the declaratory judgment act was intended to forestall.fina research,baroid,internal quotation marks omitted.here datamize did not meet this burden because,between the two lawsuits,datamize continued to engage in a course of conduct that show ed a willingness to protect its technology.goodyear,at.on september,datamize sued nine other defendants in the texas action on the and patents.see arrowhead indus.water,at noting that a patentee infringement suit against a third party evidenced not only an intent but a willingness and capacity to employ litigation in pursuit of its patent rights.moreover,on may,in the texas action,datamize directly stated in response to an interrogatory that it believed plumtree was infringing these patents.plumtree was aware of the texas action,and whether or not the interrogatory response was actually communicated to plumtree,the response is probative of datamize intentions.this suit was filed only two months after the interrogatory response on july.
accordingly,datamize actions clearly created a reasonable apprehension of suit on the and patents,and this apprehension was not dissipated by datamize subsequent actions.
as we have jurisdiction over this action,we next consider whether the and patents are invalid under the on sale bar,b.
the determination of whether an invention was on sale within the meaning of b is a question of law that we review without deference.scaltech,llc.we also review a grant of summary judgment without deference.see crater lucent.
a claimed invention is considered to be on sale under b if the invention is sold or offered for sale more than one year before the filing date of the patent application.here the and patents claim priority to a provisional application that was filed on february.thus,for purposes of the on sale bar,the critical date is february.
the facts pertinent to the on sale bar issue are as follows.by december kevin burns,the inventor of the and patents,had completed development of the authoring tool ultimately reflected in the patent claims.in the winter of his company,ma,learned that the sia was going to hold a trade show in las vegas,nevada in march.as part of the show,sia planned to include an example of a ski store of the future called the mountain visions store.
on january,representatives from ma gave a presentation to the representatives from sia at sia headquarters in virginia.at the time of the presentation,the authoring tool had been reduced to practice,but ma had not yet used the authoring tool to create a kiosk product.the slides used during ma presentation refer to proprietary authoring tools that allow rapid updating and support new technologies as they appear.however,emmett burns later testified that he could not recall telling sia any of the particulars of the authoring tool at the sia meeting.at.he stated that he did not explain how the authoring tool allowed for rapid updating because even if h e explained any of it,t hese people are not technology people and they go into a different space if you start to get into that.at.rather,emmett burns testified that the purpose of the presentation was to show sia what the ultimate kiosk product,entitled skipath,would be like.
on january,sia sent a letter to ma confirming the agreement that ma would participat e as a sponsor of the interactive portion of the electronic information cen
