jeffrey grob,who was sentenced to months imprisonment following his conviction of one count of cyberstalking in violation of b,appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court criminal history calculation improperly included a prior misdemeanor conviction for criminal mischief.because grob prior montana criminal mischief conviction should not have been counted under the applicable sentencing guideline,c,the district court committed procedural error.see united states carty,cir en banc it would be procedural error for a district court to fail to to calculate guidelines range.citing gall united states.we therefore vacate grob sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
background 
jeffrey grob girlfriend broke up with him during the summer of after she suffered a miscarriage.to put it mildly,grob did not take the end of either the pregnancy or the relationship well.beginning in october of,grob sent his threatening and fifty threatening text messages.illustrative of the content of these threats is an excerpt from the text message grob sent on november,with the subject heading i going to slit your throat 
if you ever come back to montana again i am going to slit your throat.i am not even kidding.it would make be fill sic so good to see you bleed as you gasp for air.i hope your are sic ready for retribution,because it is coming.you are going down bitch.
photographs of dead and dismembered women accompanied some messages.grob went so far as to attach a photograph of a dead infant to an entitled omg our baby.in an entitled i ca believe you killed our baby,sent on november,grob wrote that he was not going away and was not going to forget about the horrible shit you did to me.vengeance,he added,will be mine.i will get you even if it is the last thing i do.
having reason to fear for her life,grob contacted law enforcement.when officers interviewed grob,he initially denied sending the messages,but eventually admitted he sent them to scare his.grob was indicted for cyberstalking in violation of b,and was granted pretrial release.grob pretrial release was revoked,however,on october,due to his arrest for public intoxication and carrying a concealed weapon.grob subsequent conduct was far from exemplary while in federal custody,for example,he was caught in possession of a knife fashioned out of a razor blade.
grob ultimately pled guilty to one count of cyberstalking.in the presentence investigation report psr,the united states probation office recommended a base offense level of nineteen and a criminal history score of four,resulting in a criminal history category of iii.one of the counted convictions was for vandalizing a house grob had rented in flathead county,montana.in that case,grob admitted that he intentionally trashed the house in retaliation against his landlord,who had contacted police to break up a party grob was giving and who later turned off grob power and water.grob was convicted of criminal mischief in violation of montana code annotated,fined,and ordered to pay a court fee of and restitution of.
over grob objections,the district court adopted the psr calculation of the criminal history score,which included the criminal mischief conviction,and determined an advisory sentencing range of to months.without inclusion of the criminal mischief conviction,the guideline range would have been to months.the court imposed a sentence of incarceration of months,and grob timely appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court inclusion of a prior conviction in the sentencing guidelines criminal history calculation.united states bays,cir.
as a general rule,sentences for prior misdemeanor or petty convictions are counted in assigning criminal history points.c.under c,however,in order to screen out past conduct which is of such minor significance that it is not relevant to the goals of sentencing,united states hardeman,cir see also sentencing guidelines manual supp.to app.c at,certain enumerated prior offenses and offenses similar to those enumerated offenses,by whatever name they are known,are not counted unless a the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days,or b the prior offense was similar to an instant offense,c see also united states,cir united states,cir.
grob was convicted in montana of committing criminal mischief in.see ann.criminal mischief is not an enumerated offense under c.if,however,criminal mischief under montana law is similar to the offense of disorderly conduct,which is enumerated in c,then grob sentence for criminal mischief should not be counted unless either of the two exceptions in c applies.
similarity of the prior offense to the enumerated offense 
the common sense approach to determining similarity 
we first address the test for determining similarity as used in c.before,there was disagreement among the circuits and even within our own circuit about what test courts should apply in this context.see generally,at nn.one of the two broad tests articulated by the ninth circuit,which was similar to the common sense test used by the second,fifth,and seventh circuits,i n essence defined similar to on the basis of the underlying seriousness of the offense.id.at.the other test,which was similar to the elements test used in the first,third,fourth,and eleventh circuits,defined similar to with reference only to whether the activity underlying the prior offense is similar to the activities underlying the listed offenses.id.at quoting united states martinez,cir.in,the united states sentencing commission responded by promulgating application note to,in which the commission explicitly adopted the common sense test employed by the second,fifth,and seventh circuits.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.sentencing guidelines manual supp.to app.c at united states,cir united states booker,cir hardeman,at.application note provides 
in determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an enumerated offense the court should use a common sense approach that includes consideration of relevant factors such as i a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses ii the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment iii the elements of the offense iv the level of culpability involved and v the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.
sentencing guidelines manual cmt.a.although the guidelines themselves are advisory only,the applicable guidelines sentence must be calculated correctly.see,carty,at.commentary in the application notes interpreting or explaining a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states,bays,at.in determining the similarity of prior and enumerated offenses,we are therefore guided by application note to c,and so apply the common sense approach.
both the fifth and seventh circuits have employed this approach in addressing whether the crime of criminal mischief or,in the case of the seventh circuit,criminal damage to property is similar to disorderly conduct.in united states,cir,the fifth circuit,applying texas law,began by noting that a comparison of the authorized statutory punishments demonstrated that the offense of criminal mischief can be more serious than the offense of disorderly conduct,but that m ore important than the statutory range of punishments is the actual punishment given.the fifth circuit also observed that a comparison of the statutory elements of the two crimes shows both similarity and difference,but that t he fact that the elements are somewhat different is not dispositive,because the different elements do not necessarily make criminal mischief a more serious offense than disorderly conduct.id.at.citing hardeman,at.ultimately,the fifth circuit concluded that,given the similarity in punishments between appellant criminal mischief conviction and disorderly conduct and the small fine appellant received suggest ing low culpability and low predictiveness of future criminal conduct,criminal
