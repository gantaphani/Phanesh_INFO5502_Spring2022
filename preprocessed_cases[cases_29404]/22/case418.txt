after his employment as a technology transfer coordinator at the university of nebraska at lincoln was terminated,gerald biby sued its board of regents and several university officials.the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendants on all claims,and biby appeals its adverse ruling on two of them.he claims that his constitutional rights were violated by the search of his office computer and the university failure to honor its technology licensing agreement tla with a third party,thus depriving him of royalty income.we affirm.
biby worked at the university industrial agricultural products center iapc,which seeks to increase industrial and other nonfood uses of agricultural commodities.as a technology transfer coordinator for iapc,biby worked with private sector companies to identify research and marketing opportunities for new technologies.when negotiations for a project were successful,the agreement was formalized by the university office of technology transfer ott.that office also managed the university policy on patentable discoveries resulting from work done for the university by its employees or developed with the use of university property or facilities.the policy provided that such discoveries were to be offered to the university in writing,and the institution would assume the costs of applying for a patent if it accepted the offer within six months.royalties accrued from the use of the invention were to be divided between the inventor and the university,with the inventor receiving at least fifteen percent of the net revenues.
while he was employed at the iapc,biby worked with the director,milford hanna,and qi fang to develop horticultural applications for polylactic acid pla.bill brown,owner of corn card international,expressed an interest in using pla to manufacture biodegradable plastic phone cards.biby,hanna,and fang modified the technology to suit that purpose and called it soft touch ii.in march they offered the invention to the university,and a provisional patent application was subsequently filed.donald helmuth,the associate vice chancellor for research,filed a verified statement claiming nonprofit organization status with the patent and trademark office and declaring that the rights under contract or law have been conveyed to and remain with the university with regard to soft touch ii.the record before us does not contain either a formal acceptance or rejection by the university of the offer of invention made by biby and the others.
in july the university entered into a licensing agreement or tla with corn card.the tla identified the university as the owner of the soft touch ii technology and gave corn card the exclusive right to develop,market,and sell printable plastic phone cards incorporating the technology in the united states,mexico,and canada.biby reports that he worked diligently with brown to market the project successfully.in brown began discussions with gemplus,a card manufacturer interested in marketing cards using soft touch ii technology in europe.brown and gemplus hoped that the university would allow an assignment to gemplus of corn card rights under the tla and that the marketing territory could be expanded worldwide.biby was involved in making these plans with gemplus and corn card,and he claims that he kept people at iapc and ott informed about them and that he was told that the assignment and market expansion would be approved.biby further claims that no one at the university expressed opposition to the plans until after both corn card and gemplus had made extensive financial investments in reliance on the initial approval of the project.
in february corn card threatened to take legal action against the university if it did not approve the gemplus assignment,alleging that it would be in breach of the tla.the dispute apparently centered on a claim made by cargill,that it had an agreement with the university which accorded it ownership rights to the marketing of the pla technology.associate vice chancellor helmuth directed iapc to give him all the information it had regarding corn card,and on march it furnished him pages of documents with an attached memo from director hanna.hanna wrote that these documents represented all the information regarding corn card,gemplus sic and card related work which iapc had located but that they did not cover a joint meeting held with helmuth or phone conversations with him.helmuth and darrell nelson,dean and director of the agricultural research division at the university,instructed biby several times in early not to contact corn card directly and told him that any communication with corn card must go through legal counsel.biby reports that his relationship with helmuth and nelson became strained,and he acknowledges that he openly accused them of lying about the corn card and gemplus project and of breaching the tla.on april,biby and the other inventors of soft touch ii executed an assignment transferring their rights in the invention to the university.
in compliance with the terms of the tla,the dispute between corn card and the university was submitted to arbitration.on may,the parties executed a document called terms of reference in which they agreed to provide each other all relevant nonprivileged documents by june.helmuth told biby in a telephone conversation on june that the university needed to go through his computer files to make sure that it had all of the documents it was required to turn over.helmuth added that pursuant to university policy biby would have to sign a consent to search form and that a member of the university police department would need to witness the signing.biby said that he would be uncomfortable having a police officer involved and asked helmuth to fax him a copy of the university policy establishing this procedure.helmuth faxed biby a memo from ken cauble,who was the chief of the university police department,and a copy of the university policy on technology and networks.the memo from chief cauble stated that the internal policy on the use of consent to search forms is that the rights of the individual can only be waived to a commissioned member of the university police department.the university computer policy which helmuth also faxed has a section on privacy.that section states that the university will only search files if a legitimate reason exists,such as needed repair or maintenance of equipment,investigation of improper or illegal use of resources,and response to a public records request,administrative or judicial order or request for discovery in the course of litigation.consent to search forms are not mentioned,but the policy explicitly states that its terms are applicable to 
when the university attempted to review biby paper and computer files on june,he videotaped the encounter.the first person to arrive at his office was an operations analyst,micha uher,who intended to go through his paper files.biby said that he did not want any files leaving his office because he was concerned that their integrity would be compromised.he claimed that ott was making iapc the scapegoat in the dispute with corn card and said he would not participate in the destruction of evidence.biby informed uher that the pages which iapc had turned over to helmuth had not included his personal notes and records or anything about gemplus.he told uher that he had not tried to withhold material,but that he was never asked for anything on gemplus.
computer specialist anthony spulak then arrived at biby office with a plainclothes officer.spulak intended to search biby computer files after the officer first went over the consent form with him,but biby refused to sign the consent form.he referred to the computer policy helmuth had faxed and said that he assumed the search related to an investigation of improper or illegal use since there was no repair or maintenance issue.he said that he had been threatened,intimidated,and coerced by university officials and reiterated his concern about the integrity of his documents being compromised.spulak replied that he would not conduct a search without the signed consent,and he and the others departed.
