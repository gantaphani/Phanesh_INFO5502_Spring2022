these appeals arise out of a summary judgment granted to defendant,in plaintiff megan kelly action for wrongful termination and nonpayment of wages.in,plaintiff appeals from that judgment,while in defendant appeals from a postjudgment order denying its motion for attorney fees.
on plaintiff appeal,we conclude that summary judgment should not have been granted,except with respect to two causes of action.we reverse the judgment and remand for entry of a limited summary adjudication order.on defendant appeal,we affirm the order denying attorney fees,as defendant is no longer the prevailing party entitled to claim them.
the summary judgment 
plaintiff first amended complaint fac alleged at its outset claims for violation of the fair employment and housing act,et feha and of public policy,to the effect that defendant on february,had discharged plaintiff from her employment as its of marketing,because she was seven months pregnant and was planning on taking her promised paid maternity leave in connection with the birth of her child in april of.a third cause of action,for breach of contract,alleged that following a large reduction in workforce in october,defendant had promised plaintiff a substantial retention bonus percent of her annual salary,to be paid in two installments,the second one on april.this promise allegedly created an implied contract that plaintiff employment would continue until at least april,which defendant breached by terminating her sooner.plaintiff also alleged this breach,in a fourth cause of action,as one of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in a fifth cause,the fac alleged that defendant failure to pay plaintiff remaining bonus upon her termination constituted a breach of contract and a violation of labor code sections and.a sixth cause alleged that,in violation of public policy,defendant had terminated plaintiff in order to avoid paying her wages due,including her bonus 
defendant moved for summary judgment,or alternatively for summary adjudication of each cause of action.defendant asserted that plaintiff primary claims,for unlawful discharge on account of pregnancy,were unmeritorious because plaintiff had been terminated as part of a reorganization of defendant,with a further reduction of workforce,and she could not establish a triable issue that this reason was a pretext for pregnancy discrimination against her.with respect to the other four causes of action,defendant asserted that plaintiff employment had been at will,and she had been terminated for good cause.defendant supported its contentions with the following facts and evidence,derived from documents and from declarations by kenneth mcbride and kathleen kathy brush 
defendant sells postage and related services on the internet.defendant hired plaintiff as its of direct marketing on october,at a base salary of a year,later increased to.plaintiff title at some point changed to simply of marketing.upon hiring,plaintiff executed an employment agreement and a confidentiality agreement,both of which provided that her employment was,terminable by either party with or without reason.plaintiff performed marketing activities for defendant small business unit,headed by doug walner,her immediate superior.according to mcbride,chief financial officer at the time and later also chief executive officer ceo,plaintiff was hired and responsible primarily for direct marketing,to both existing and potential customers.
in the same year that plaintiff was hired,defendant suffered a precipitous decline in stock value over percent,and a continual loss of capital,stemming from excess expenditures over revenues.to reduce expenses,in october defendant laid off about of its then approximately employees,according to the fac,had made it known the previous month that she was pregnant and would be taking maternity leave in april not among those so terminated.moreover,as part of a program to retain remaining employees,plaintiff in october received stock options and was awarded a cash retention bonus of percent of her salary or,to be paid in days,and in days april,provided she remained employed by defendant at those times.
also in october,defendant hired a new ceo,coleman,who brought in as a contracting consultant kathy brush,a marketing expert and turnaround specialist.brush was charged with recommending ways to cut defendant costs and streamline its marketing efforts.according to both her and cfo mcbride,upper management had become generally dissatisfied with the performance of the marketing group in the small business unit.
early in,defendant management decided that the company cash flow required another reduction in workforce,by approximately employees,which would be implemented in early february.concurrently,defendant would consolidate its three separate business units,including the small business unit,into one.the sales and marketing functions of these units likewise would be combined in one group.coleman directed brush to evaluate defendant marketing employees,and inform him who should be retained for the new sales and marketing group.brush declared that she evaluated plaintiff on the merits and without regard to her pregnancy.at least once in december or january,however,coleman told mcbride he believed plaintiff attendance was poor,and he used the term checked out to refer,according to mcbride,to her poor attendance and attitude.
on february,brush submitted to mcbride a list of marketing employees to be retained.it did not include plaintiff.mcbride consolidated the list with those he had received from other managers,and presented the combined list to coleman,who approved brush recommendations.plaintiff was terminated on february,the same day as the rest of those laid off.she received days severance pay,or.
brush declaration attached a written evaluation of plaintiff,of a type brush was asked to prepare,p rior to the announcement of the february layoffs,regarding each employee she reviewed.in it,brush stated that plaintiff was not responsible for products and partners,but for direct marketing programs,which had been reduced and were scheduled for further reduction along with the personnel layoffs.mcbride testified that defendant marketing budget had decreased from million for the third quarter of to million for the first quarter of.brush evaluation also stated she had not considered plaintiff for of marketing after the restructuring,because that position will be assumed by a generalist that will oversee direct marketing,sales,product marketing and business development for both the postage and shipping groups.these are qualifications that plaintiff does not have.nor,brush opined,was plaintiff appropriate for the position of director of a general team that would perform limited direct marketing,because of her inflexibility with projects apparently in terms of size or expense and ineffectiveness as a leader.brush appraised plaintiff as of limited motivation,often arriving late.her attendance had improved in january,when the ceo noted to doug walner that plaintiff attendance was not good.
upon consolidation,brush assumed supervision of the sales and marketing group.although still engaged as a contractor,she took the same title as plaintiff had had,of marketing.nonetheless,brush declared that plaintiff position as vice president of marketing was eliminated entirely in the february restructuring and she was not replaced.
in her opposition to the motion for summary judgment,plaintiff agreed that in february defendant had implemented a restructuring and reduction in force to reduce costs.plaintiff undertook to show,however,a triable issue that this tendered justification for her termination was a pretext for discharge on a discriminatory basis.to this end,plaintiff presented a declaration by her former supervisor walner,and excerpts of the depositions of mcbride,ian siegel,and plaintiff herself.
walner,formerly manager of the small business unit,gave an appraisal of plaintiff responsibilities and performance at odds with brush.he declared that plaintiff duties had included overseeing not only direct marketing,but also online marketing,television,print,and general marketing,as well as brand marketing.the latter pervade d everything defendant did with partners and sales in these matters,plaintiff was an excellent employee,very good at all aspects,with a like understanding of brand marketing and its goals.she was also a very committed employee and never did i see a change in plaintiff commitment to defendant.
walner attached a formal assessment of plaintiff,which he had prepared in october.on a scale,from outstanding to below expectations,he had rated her above expectations,the level,in five categories,and a one notch further down meets expectations for leadership skills.he also had answered affirmatively the question whether plaintiff was indispensable to defendant business needs,and had given as reasons plaintiff run ning significant portion of acquisition,her management of key branded marketing programs,and that she had the respect of her department as a leader.
with regard to plaintiff nonretention,walner declared that ceo coleman had asked him to prepare a list of employees within the unit who should be retained after the impending force reduction.walner had included plaintiff on the list,because her involvement in and knowledge of marketing would perfectly fit the need for an overseer of a reduced group.
walner gave this list to coleman,and they later discussed it.coleman asked why walner had included plaintiff,and walner replied he felt she was the only person capable of managing the group,particularly as walner would not be staying.coleman repeated the question,and commented that plaintiff had mentally checked out.according to walner,coleman then made intonations about plaintiff being pregnant,saying she had mentally checked out,and questioning whether she was really doing her job.walner responded,you know that is not true,and defended plaintiff commitment,hard work,and singular ability to take that group forward without me there.
a similar account was provided by ian siegel,defendant for web development until april,and a member of defendant senior management team.he testified that almost all of defendant marketing programs proceeded using technology his department developed.siegel worked with plaintiff almost daily,as she was head of marketing and was involved in not only direct marketing but also partnering with other companies,as well as brand development and other functions.according to siegel,plaintiff worked in the small business unit only after a substantial period as the operational head of marketing for defendant,reporting to five different nominal superiors.he considered plaintiff extremely competent,and a tremendous asset to defendant.
siegel further testified that before plaintiff layoff,coleman called him in and asked his he worked with the marketing group who in that group were strongest and should be kept on.siegel replied,you absolutely have to start with plaintiff,she is the heart and soul of that team,and he could imagine it functioning without her.coleman replied,megan has checked out.siegel said it would be a mistake to assume that.coleman repeated that plaintiff had checked out,saying it in a definitive,type of way.he and siegel then proceeded to discuss other marketing employees.
over defendant objections,siegel specifically and diametrically disagreed with each statement that brush had made regarding plaintiff in her written evaluation.he also recounted that after plaintiff departure,brush had taken over plaintiff position as operational head of marketing,assuming management of the partner program,messaging,and design of the web site,all of the things that megan had done prior to kathy taking over.
in her own deposition,plaintiff described commendations she had received from numerous members of defendant management during her tenure,and she testified none had ever commented negatively on her performance.
regarding her discharge,plaintiff stated she had been concerned just before february,because she had not been informed of her impending status,or asked for her input,as had other.moreover,walner and siegel had told her how coleman had referred to her having checked out.plaintiff accordingly met with mike zuercher,a house counsel for defendant,on the afternoon of february.she expressed her fear that she would be included in the reduction in force,notwithstanding her group had been performing well.referring to coleman,plaintiff told zuercher,i do know what he means by checked out.i ca help to think that he thinks i am checked out because i pregnant and i am going to go off on maternity leave 
plaintiff also told zuercher she was concerned that perhaps mcbride wanted her gone.she related that she had heard mcbride had made vulgar,derogatory remarks about her,which led her to believe he might now want to get rid of her zuercher told plaintiff he would share her concerns with coleman.later that day,zuercher told her,i talked to bruce coleman.
after her discharge,plaintiff testified,she requested a meeting with coleman.it was held on february,with zuercher also in attendance.plaintiff told coleman of her beliefs about her discharge,and asked him to explain,in light of her having been at the top of walner list.coleman replied that she had been on walner list.this heightened plaintiff confusion.coleman told plaintiff he had never discriminated against anyone,and offered to list people whom she could ask about it.he also told plaintiff that defendant had eliminated her position.she stated that she did not so understand,because many of her functions were then still ongoing.
mcbride testified that brush report was in plaintiff personnel file.it also had been sent to him by brush,as an attachment,on february.finally,plaintiff testified she had been informed that maternity leave benefits included insured disability leave at of salary for six weeks,followed by company paid leave for six more weeks.
at the hearing of the motion for summary judgment,the trial court initially indicated its tentative view that although defendant had made a showing of legitimate reasons for plaintiff layoff,plaintiff had presented substantial evidence that these reasons were a pretext.the court stated that the case was triable,observing that her firing,if it was not done for discriminatory purposes,was very inartfully executed.the court also remarked,it does lead one to believe that a company in financial trouble was looking to get rid of an employee for whom they were going to have to keep on the books because they promised her maternity leave 
at a further session the following day,the court announced it was inclined to change its tentative ruling,it expressed the view that if brush assumed,or subsumed,plaintiff duties together with others,then the reason for plaintiff discharge was not pretextual.
following the hearing,the court granted the motion for summary judgment,and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in explanation of its ruling.civ,subd.g.with respect to the discrimination claims,the court ruled that plaintiff had shown a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge,but ultimately had not established that defendant proffered reason,the corporate restructuring and consolidation of her position with others,had been pretextual.the court found the remaining four causes of action lacked merit because plaintiff had been terminated for good cause 
discussion 
the discrimination claims.
we consider first the trial court summary adjudication of plaintiff first two causes of action,for discriminatory discharge on the basis of pregnancy,in violation of feha and of public policy.see badih myers th,d.on this as on plaintiff other causes of action,we review the court decision de novo.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.the scope of each party substantive burden in this type of case was delineated in guz bechtel national cal th,d,guz.
ordinarily,a plaintiff employee who claims discrimination must first make a prima facie case,consisting of evidence that she was within the class protected from discrimination and was performing her job competently,but was some other circumstance suggesting discriminatory motive.guz,supra,cal th at,d.this showing raises a presumption of discrimination,shifting to the defendant employer the burden of producing evidence to establish a genuine issue that the termination was made for a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason.id.at,d.if the employer does so,the presumption disappears,but the employee,who retains the overall burden of persuasion,may then yet seek to show discriminatory motive,by evidence that the employer proffered reason was false and a pretext,and any other evidence of discriminatory motive.id.at,d.
a defendant employer motion for summary judgment slightly modifies the order of these showings.if,as here,the motion for summary judgment relies in whole or in part on a showing of nondiscriminatory reasons for the discharge,the employer satisfies its burden as moving party if it presents evidence of such nondiscriminatory reasons that would permit a trier of fact to find,more likely than not,that they were the basis for the termination.see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,guz,supra,cal th at,d.to defeat the motion,the employee then must adduce or point to evidence raising a triable issue,that would permit a trier of fact to find by a preponderance that intentional discrimination occurred.aguilar,at,d,guz,at,d.in determining whether these burdens were met,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff,as the nonmoving party,liberally construing her evidence while strictly scrutinizing defendant.aguilar,at,d.
the basis for defendant motion was that plaintiff was terminated for legitimate,nondiscriminatory business reasons,namely defendant economically induced restructuring and reduction in force in february.from the evidence defendant initially presented,this explanation may be deemed a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason,sufficient to shift to plaintiff the burden of showing a triable issue of its falsity,with respect to her,and ultimately of discriminatory motive instead.whether plaintiff satisfied this burden remains the principal issue.
defendant makes a preemptive argument that lacks merit.in her separate statement of facts,plaintiff admitted that defendant underwent the restructuring and layoffs in february.but she did not admit,there or ever,that this had been the actual,motivating reason for her discharge.defendant contention that plaintiff admission precluded her from claiming that defendant adduced neutral reason was untrue is therefore meritless.as explained in guz,supra,cal th at page,d,d ownsizing alone is not necessarily a sufficient explanation,under the feha,for the consequent dismissal of a protected worker.an employer freedom to consolidate or reduce its work force,and to eliminate positions in the process,does not mean it may use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of protected workers.citations.invocation of a right to downsize does not resolve whether the employer had a discriminatory motive for cutting back its work force,or engaged in intentional discrimination when deciding which individual workers to retain and release.italics added.
defendant also argues that any possibility of discriminatory motive in plaintiff discharge was lacking because defendant did not discharge plaintiff,and in fact awarded her a retention bonus,during the initial,october layoffs,even though,as plaintiff alleged,she had made known to defendant in september her pregnancy and intent to take maternity leave at the end of april.this contention fails,however,because neither coleman nor brush,the alleged in plaintiff firing,was involved with the october layoffs and bonuses.
plaintiff did adduce evidence of a number of circumstances that cast doubt on the genuineness of defendant explanation for her discharge.first,plaintiff was let go despite a record of excellence in her executive responsibilities,as attested to by both her superior walner and another high executive with whom she worked continually siegel.second,when these executives were asked by coleman who should be retained in marketing,they both proffered plaintiff,and attested to her abilities to manage marketing efforts in a period of downsizing and transition.third,however,coleman dismissed this advice,with the peremptory expression that plaintiff had checked out.as discussed below,this reaction and terminology are not,as the trial court suggested,unamenable to signifying a discriminatory animus.indeed,in at least one instance when he used the phrase concerning plaintiff,coleman also referred in some fashion to her pregnancy.moreover,even if the language be deemed nondiscriminatory in isolation,there is no doubt that coleman manifest attitude toward plaintiff retention was bluntly negative,in vivid contrast to the views and assessments of those executives who worked with her 
furthermore,there was evidence that coleman lied to plaintiff when she asked him to explain her termination,on february.coleman denied that plaintiff had been on walner list of persons suggested for retention.but according to walner,not only had plaintiff been on his list,she had been the first one he had mentioned and commended when coleman later asked him about his preferences.as is the case with evidence of false reasons,a finding that coleman was knowingly untruthful here could give rise to an inference that the employer wa s dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.reeves sanderson plumbing products,d reeves.
in the same meeting,coleman also told plaintiff that she had been discharged because her position had been eliminated.defendant presently repeats this reason for plaintiff discharge,together with and as a refinement of the more general reason of reorganization and layoffs.but the evidence reflects a triable issue whether the claim that defendant eliminated plaintiff position was true or untrue.
first,a new and not pregnant individual,brush,assumed plaintiff title of of marketing after plaintiff left.second,plaintiff and siegel effectively testified that brush thereafter performed plaintiff former functions,and served,as had plaintiff,as the operational head of marketing.although defendant stresses that this testimony did not establish that brush was performing all of the functions and programs plaintiff had run,even evidence that one or more programs were discontinued at one point or another would not establish that plaintiff position was eliminated,as opposed to her having been replaced.see barnes gencorp cir,barnes.
defendant further argument that plaintiff did not negate brush having performed duties additional to plaintiff also does not validate the claim of position elimination.defendant evidence did not establish that brush performed such additional duties,and it was defendant burden to show that plaintiff position was eliminated,the essence of defendant espoused legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for dismissing her.moreover,brush was not another employee assigned to perform the plaintiff duties in addition to other duties,as referred to in barnes,supra,at page.rather,brush was an independent consultant,who was not assigned to perform marketing duties for defendant until plaintiff was fired.in sum,there is a triable issue whether the claim plaintiff position was offered in explanation by coleman in and by defendant valid.
the content and circumstances of brush written evaluation of plaintiff also lend support to plaintiff claims,both of false reasons and of discriminatory purpose.first,brush negative opinions conflicted with those of defendant managers who were more familiar with plaintiff and her performance.second,plaintiff presented evidence indicating that brush evaluation may have been prepared or utilized as a pretext.mcbride testified that the evaluation had been attached to an brush sent him.dated february,at,the stated that brush was including two files regarding employee evaluations,one about elimination of positions and the second with notes on performance.brush stated that the first document was h opefully all that will be needed if anything is needed.
this was sent just hours after plaintiff had complained,to zuercher,that coleman might be contemplating letting her go because of her pregnancy.and a copy of brush evaluation ended up in plaintiff personnel file.in short,within a day,plaintiff complained of possible discrim
