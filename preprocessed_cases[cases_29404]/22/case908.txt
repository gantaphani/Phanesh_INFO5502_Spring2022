we rejected cochran arguments relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the aggravated assault and forcible lewd conduct offenses and affirmed the judgment to that extent.we reversed the section,subdivision b count on the basis there was insufficient evidence to support a finding cochran had a commercial purpose and then,upon denial of a motion for a rehearing,modified the opinion so as to reduce cochran conviction of section,subdivision b to a conviction of section,subdivision c,which did not require proof of a commercial purpose.
the supreme court granted the attorney general petition for review of our holding as to section,subdivision b.the supreme court issued an opinion holding the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that cochran had a commercial purpose and therefore was sufficient to support his conviction of section,subdivision b.people cochran cal th,d.the supreme court reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.consistent with the supreme court opinion,we affirm the superior court judgment in toto.
the fbi,after receiving information that someone had posted child pornography on an internet newsgroup,obtained the address of the individual who posted the pornography and traced the address to cochran.a search of cochran home was conducted.in the home police found a videotape cochran had made of his daughter and himself,and from which the photographs on the internet were taken.the videotape shows cochran directing his daughter to engage in various sexual acts such as displaying her vaginal area to the camera,digitally penetrating herself,and penetrating herself with a dildo and a vibrator.the videotape also shows cochran engaging in various sexual acts with his daughter,including penetrating her vagina with his finger,a dildo,a vibrator,his penis,and sodomizing her.this videotape constituted the primary evidence against cochran.
the fbi also seized a packet of printouts from the same newsgroups to which cochran had posted photographs of his daughter.these printouts included photographs of child pornography and subject lines stating,inter alia,i did my part now it everyone else turn sic no nudies,and i did my part.d o complain if you do post one contained a message stating hi there.i have tons of preeteens sic animals pics.if you wana trade big time please me here is some samples of the things i have these printouts were evidently posted by individuals other than cochran and do not contain photographs of his daughter 
after he was arrested,cochran said something to the effect of when you caught,you caught.cochran admitted posting the photographs,stating he had made the stills in the past two months prior to the search in early february and had posted the photographs on the internet one time.he also admitted having had a sexual relationship with his daughter for the past four months.
the daughter testified the sexual relationship with her father began in the summer before the search,when she started the fourth grade.he filmed her with the video camera only one time.she was not afraid of him.sometimes he would hurt her j ust a little bit,but not that much,and when she told him it hurt,he would stop.afterwards,cochran would give her money,things for school or candy.he told her not to tell anybody because he would get into trouble and would go to jail.she was sometimes sad and sometimes mad about the things cochran was doing to her.

isufficiency of or duress 
when an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction,the appellate court reviews the entire record to see whether it contains substantial,evidence that is credible and of solid which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people jennings cal d.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences in its support.people kelly cal th,d,people pensinger cal d.we do not reweigh the evidence,resolve conflicts in the evidence,or reevaluate the credibility of witnesses.see people ochoa cal th,d,people jones cal d.the test on appeal is not whether we believe the evidence established the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,but whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.people kelly cal d,people rich cal d.
the offenses of aggravated sexual assault and forcible lewd acts on a child under the age of years require proof that force,violence,duress,menace,or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person was used,subds.a,subd.b.
force as used in this context means physical force substantially different from or substantially greater than that necessary to accomplish the lewd act itself.people cicero d.a number of cases have held that if the defendant grabs or holds a victim who is trying to pull away,that is the use of physical force above and beyond that needed to accomplish the act.see people babcock th,d,and cases cited therein but see people schulz th,d force not found when defendant grabbed victim arm and held her while fondling her people senior th,d force not found when defendant pulled the victim back when she tried to pull away from oral copulations.
duress as used in this context means a direct or implied threat of force,violence,danger,hardship or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed or,acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted.people pitmon d.people wilkerson th,d.the total circumstances,including the age of the victim,and her relationship to defendant are factors to be considered in appraising the existence of duress.people pitmon,supra,at.other relevant factors include threats to harm the victim,physically controlling the victim when the victim attempts to resist,and warnings to the victim that revealing the molestation would result in jeopardizing the family.people senior,supra,th,d people schulz,supra,th,d.
the fact that the victim testifies the defendant did not use force or threats does not require a finding of no duress the victim testimony must be considered in light of her age and her relationship to the defendant.thus,in people pitmon,supra,d,the court found sufficient evidence of duress despite the victim testimony the defendant did not use force or violence and never threatened to hurt her.the court stated that at the time of the offenses,the victim was eight years old,an age at which adults are commonly viewed as authority figures.the disparity in physical size between an and an adult also contributes to a youngster sense of her relative physical vulnerability.id.at.see also people sanchez d.duress found where defendant molested granddaughter repeatedly over a period and victim viewed defendant as a father figure people superior court kneip d.where the defendant is a family member and the victim is young,the position of dominance and authority of the defendant and his continuous exploitation of the victim is relevant to determining duress.
cochran relies on people hecker d,a decision by this court.in hecker the defendant molested his stepdaughter.she testified she was never consciously afraid the defendant would harm her and that,with the exception of one incident where he held her head down during oral copulation,he never used physical force.she did not report the incidents because she felt guilty and did not want to be responsible for breaking up her mother marriage.id.at.she testified
