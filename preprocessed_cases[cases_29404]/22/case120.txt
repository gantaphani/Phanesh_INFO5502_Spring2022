this case calls upon us to determine whether venue for andrew auernheimer prosecution for conspiracy to violate the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa,and identity fraud under a was proper in the district of new jersey.venue in criminal cases is more than a technicality it involves matters that touch closely the fair administration of criminal justice and public confidence in it.united states johnson.this is especially true of computer crimes in the era of mass interconnectivity.because we conclude that venue did not lie in new jersey,we will reverse the district court venue determination and vacate auernheimer conviction.
the relevant facts are fairly simple and not in dispute.apple,introduced the first ipad,a tablet computer,in.customers who purchased the version that had the capability to send and receive data over cellular networks commonly referred to as had to purchase a data contract from at t,at t,which at the time was the exclusive provider of data services for this version of the ipad.customers registered their accounts with at t over the internet on a website that at t controlled.in the registration process,customers were assigned a user identifier user id and created a password login credentials that they would need in order to access their accounts through at t website in the future.the user id assigned to each customer was that customer email address.
at t decided to make it easier for customers to log into their accounts by prepopulating the user id field on the login screen with their email addresses.to do this,at t programmed its servers to search for an ipad user integrated circuit card identifier icc id when a user directed her browser to at t general login webpage at t url.an icc id is the unique nineteen or number that identifies an ipad subscriber identity module,commonly known as a sim card.the sim card is the computer chip that allows ipads to connect to cellular data networks.
if at t servers recognized the icc id as associated with a customer who had registered her account with at t,then at t servers would automatically redirect the customer browser away from the general login url to a different,specific url.that new specific url was unique for every customer and contained the customer icc id in the url itself.redirecting the customer browser to the new specific url told at t servers which email address to populate in the user id field on the login page.this shortcut reduced the amount of time it took a customer to log into her account because,with her user id already populated,she had to enter only her password 
daniel spitler,auernheimer,discovered this feature of at t login process.although he did not own an ipad,he purchased an ipad sim card,hoping to install it on another computing device and then take advantage of the unlimited cellular data plan that at t offered for per month.at first,he did not know how to register his sim card,so he downloaded the ipad operating system onto his computer,decrypted it,and browsed through the operating system code to try to find a way to register it.in the course of doing so,he came across at t registration url.he noticed that one of the variables in the registration url was a field requiring an icc id.
spitler then directed his computer web browser to the registration url and inserted his ipad icc id in the requisite place.at t servers were programmed only to permit browsers that as ipad browsers to access the registration url.this required him to change his browser user agent.a user agent tells a website what kind of browser and operating system a user is running,so servers that someone is attempting to access can format their responses appropriately.app.
after changing his browser user agent to appear as an ipad,spitler was able to access the at t login page.he noticed that his email address was already populated in the login field and surmised that at t servers had tied his email address to his icc id.he tested this theory by changing the icc id in the url by one digit and discovered that doing so returned a different email address.he changed the icc id in the url manually a few more times,and each time the server returned other email addresses in the login field.
spitler concluded that this was potentially a noteworthy security flaw.he began to write a program that he called an account slurper that would automate this process.the account slurper would repeatedly access the at t website,each time changing the icc id in the url by one digit.if an email address appeared in the login box,the program would save that email address to a file under spitler control.
spitler shared this discovery with auernheimer,whom he knew through chat rooms but had never met in person.auernheimer helped him to refine his account slurper program,and the program ultimately collected email addresses between june and june.its method guessing at random is called a brute force attack,a term of art in the computer industry referring to an inefficient method of simply checking all possible numbers.
while spitler program was still collecting email addresses,auernheimer emailed various members of the media in order to publicize the pair exploits.some of those media members emailed at t,which immediately fixed the breach.one of the media members contacted by auernheimer was ryan tate,a reporter at gawker,a news website.tate expressed interest in publishing auernheimer story.to lend credibility to it,auernheimer shared the list of email addresses with him.tate published a story on june,describing at t security flaw,entitled apple worst security breach ipad owners exposed.the article mentioned some of the names of those whose email addresses were obtained,but published only redacted images of a few email addresses and icc ids.
evidence at trial showed that at all times relevant to this case,spitler was in san francisco,california and auernheimer was in fayetteville,arkansas.the servers that they accessed were physically located in dallas,texas and atlanta,georgia.although no evidence was presented regarding the location of the gawker reporter,it is undisputed that he was not in new jersey.
despite the absence of any apparent connection to new jersey,a grand jury sitting in newark returned a superseding indictment charging auernheimer with conspiracy to violate the cfaa,a c and c b ii,in violation of count one,and fraud in connection with personal information in violation of a count two,commonly referred to as identity fraud.to enhance the potential punishment from a misdemeanor to a felony,the government alleged that auernheimer cfaa violation occurred in furtherance of a violation of new jersey computer crime statute,stat.ann.a.see c b ii.
auernheimer moved to dismiss the superseding indictment shortly after it was returned by the grand jury.in addition to asserting several challenges concerning the cfaa violation,he argued that venue was not proper in the district of new jersey.the district court acknowledged that neither he nor spitler was ever in new jersey while allegedly committing the crime,and that the servers accessed were not in new jersey,but denied his motion nonetheless.it held that venue was proper for the cfaa conspiracy charge because auernheimer disclosure of the email addresses of about new jersey residents affected them in new jersey and violated new jersey law.it further held that because venue was proper for the cfaa count,it was also proper for the identity fraud count because proving the cfaa violation was a necessary predicate to proving the identity fraud violation.
auernheimer trial lasted five days and resulted in a guilty verdict on both counts.initially,both parties requested a jury instruction on venue.app.venue is a question for the jury and the court must specifically instruct the jury on venue if the defendant objects to venue prior to or at the close of the prosecution,there is a genuine issue of material fact with regard to proper venue,and the defendant timely requests a jury instruction.united states perez,cir.although auernheimer objected to venue and requested an instruction,the district court held that there was no genuine issue of material fact.it concluded that the government had established that venue was proper in new jersey as a matter of law and declined to instruct the jury on venue.app.
after denying auernheimer motions,the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment.auernheimer timely appealed.

although this appeal raises a number of complex and novel issues that are of great public importance in our increasingly interconnected age,we find it necessary to reach only one that has been fundamental since our country founding venue.the proper place of colonial trials was so important to the founding generation that it was listed as a grievance in the declaration of independence.see the declaration of independence para.objecting to transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences.it was of such concern that the constitution of the united states twice safeguards the defendant venue right.united states cabrales.article iii requires that the trial of all crimes shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed.const.art.iii,cl.the sixth amendment further provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.id.amend vi.this guarantee is codified in the federal rules of criminal procedure,which require that the g overnment must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed.
congress may prescribe specific venue requirements for particular crimes.pendleton,at.where it has not,as is the case here,we must determine the crime locus delicti.see also black law dictionary ed defining locus delicti as the place where an offense was committed.t he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.united states anderson,accord united states rodriguez moreno,cabrales,at.to perform this inquiry,we must initially identify the conduct constituting the offense and then discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts.rodriguez moreno,at.venue should be narrowly construed.johnson,at.
continuing offenses,such as conspiracy,that are begun in one district and completed in another,or committed in more than one district,may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun,continued,or completed.a.in the context of a conspiracy charge,venue can be established wherever a has committed an act in furtherance of the conspiracy.perez,at accord hyde united states.the government must prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence.united states root,cir.
in performing our venue inquiry,we must be careful to separate essential conduct elements from circumstance element s.rodriguez moreno,at.for example,in cabrales the supreme court considered whether venue for money laundering activities was proper in missouri.at.the laundered proceeds were generated by illegal narcotics sales in missouri,but all acts constituting the money laundering offense took place in florida.id.the court held that venue was improper in missouri.id.at.the supreme court,later reflecting on cabrales,observed that the existence of criminally generated proceeds was only a circumstance element of money laundering.rodriguez moreno,at.although it was an element of the crime that the government had to prove to the jury,it was a circumstance element because it was simply a fact that existed at the time that the defendant performed her laundering acts.only essential conduct elements can provide the basis for venue circumstance elements can not.united states bowens,cir.
count one charged auernheimer with conspiracy to violate cfaa a c and c b ii.in the indictment and at trial,the government identified the nature of the conduct constituting the offense as the agreement to commit a violation of the cfaa in furtherance of a violation of new jersey computer crime statute,n.stat.ann.a.venue would be proper in any district where the cfaa violation occurred,or wherever any of the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy took place.see perez,at see also rodriguez moreno,at citing hyde,at.
the charged portion of the cfaa provides that w hoever intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,and thereby obtains information from any protected computer shall be punished as provided in subsection c of this section.a c.to be found guilty,the government must prove that the defendant intentionally accessed without authorization or exceeded authorized access to a protected computer and thereby obtained information.see united states willis,cir delineating the elements in a similar manner.the statute plain language reveals two essential conduct elements accessing without authorization and obtaining information 
new jersey was not the site of either essential conduct element.the evidence at trial demonstrated that the accessed at t servers were located in dallas,texas,and atlanta,georgia.app.in addition,during the time that the conspiracy began,continued,and ended,spitler was obtaining information in san francisco,california app,and auernheimer was assisting him from fayetteville,arkansas app.no protected computer was accessed and no data was obtained in new jersey.
this is not the end of our analysis,however,because the government did not just charge auernheimer with conspiracy to commit an ordinary violation of the cfaa,but also with conspiring to violate the cfaa in furtherance of a state crime.the government can increase the statutory maximum punishment for a subsection a violation from one year to five years if it proves one of the enhancements contained in c b.the enhancement relevant here provides for such increased punishment if the offense was committed in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the laws of any state.id.c b ii.a ny facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which the criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime that must be proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt alleyne united states,quoting apprendi new jersey.this is true even if they are explicitly termed sentence enhancement s in the statute.apprendi,at quotation marks omitted.
the new jersey statute allows for criminal liability if the person purposely or knowingly and without authorization,or in excess of authorization,accesses any computer or computer system and knowingly or recklessly discloses,or causes to be disclosed any data or personal identifying information.n.stat.ann.a.its essential conduct elements are accessing without authorization or in excess of authorization and disclosing data or personal identifying information.
here,none of the essential conduct elements of a violation of the new jersey statute occurred in new jersey.as discussed,neither auernheimer nor spitler accessed a computer in new jersey the disclosure did not occur there either.the sole disclosure of the data obtained was to the gawker reporter.there was no allegation or evidence that the gawker reporter was in new jersey.further,there was no evidence that any email addresses of any new jersey residents were ever disclosed publicly in the gawker article.the alleged violation of the new jersey statute thus can not confer venue for count one.
just as none of the conduct constituting the cfaa violation or its enhancement occurred in new jersey,none of the overt acts that the government alleged in the superseding indictment occurred in new jersey either.the indictment listed four overt acts writing the account slurper program,deploying the account slurper program against at t servers,emailing victims to inform them of the breach,and disclosing the emails addresses obtained to gawker.the collaborated on the account slurper program from california and arkansas and deployed it against servers located in texas and georgia.the government offered no evidence whatsoever that any of the victims that auernheimer emailed were located in new jersey,or that the gawker reporter to whom the list of email addresses was disclosed was in the garden state.
because neither auernheimer nor his spitler performed any essential conduct element of the underlying cfaa violation or any overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy in new jersey,venue was improper on count one.
we now turn to count two of the indictment because venue must be analyzed independently for each count.see root,at.count two charged auernheimer with violating a,which punishes anyone who knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit,or to aid or abet,or in connection with,any federal crime,or state or local felony.the statute plain language indicates that the statute punishes someone who knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses without lawful authority a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit,or in connection with,any violation of federal law or any state felony.see united states abdelshafi,cir delineating the elements of a violation of aggravated identity fraud in a l,which are virtually identical,in a similar fashion united states step hens,cir same.
the two essential conduct elements under a are transfer,possession,or use,and doing so in connection with a federal crime or state felony.rodriguez moreno,at noting that during and in relation to any crime of violence was an essential conduct element of a firearms statute.starting with the latter essential conduct element,the government charged auernheimer with committing identity fraud in connection with the ordinary violation of cfaa a c.as should be clear by now,no conduct related to the ordinary cfaa violation occurred in new jersey.
there was also no evidence that auernheimer transfer,possession,or use occurred in new jersey.the government advances two theories of how he could have satisfied this essential conduct element.first,it contends that he violated a by knowingly using the icc ids of other people ipads to access at t servers.see gov t br.venue fails under this theory because there was no allegation or evidence that he used the icc ids in new jersey.the alleged conspirators used the icc ids in their account slurper program,which was programmed from california and arkansas,and did not access any computer or obtain any information in new jersey.
the government also argues that auernheimer violated the statute by transferring the list of email addresses that he obtained to gawker with the intent to violate the new jersey computer crime statute.see gov t br.but there was no allegation in the indictment or evidence at trial that the gawker reporter to whom he transferred the email addresses was in new jersey and no essential conduct element of the alleged violation of new jersey law occurred in new jersey either 
because auernheimer did not commit any essential conduct of the identity fraud charge in new jersey,venue was also improper on count two.
the government does not dispute the locations of auernheimer,spitler,and at t servers during the period of time that auernheimer was committing the alleged crimes.instead,it advances a series of other reasons why there was no defect in venue that warrants vacating his conviction.none of them are availing.
the government argues that we need not rely on the essential conduct elements test mandated by cabrales and rodriguez moreno because we have adopted,gov t br,a substantial contacts test.under this approach,frequently employed by the court of appeals for the second circuit,a number of factors help to determine whether venue was proper,including the site of the defendant acts,the elements and nature of the crime,the locus of the effect of the criminal conduct,and the suitability of each district for accurate factfinding.united states reed,cir.the government contends that venue is proper in new jersey because about four percent approximately of of the email addresses obtained from at t website belonged to new jersey residents,thereby satisfying the locus of the effect s consideration.see id.
it is far from clear that this court has ever adopted this test.we have mentioned it only once.see united states goldberg,cir.the test was cited in a long block quote to reed,and then analyzed in a single sentence.id.the goldberg panel did not need to rely on the locus of the effects of the defendant conduct in that case because all of his acts took place in the district in which he was tried.id.no panel of this court has ever cited goldberg,or any other case,for this test since either before,or especially after,the supreme court clarified the venue inquiry in cabrales and rodriguez moreno.
even if it could be said that we perhaps tacitly endorsed this test once almost thirty years ago,the test operates to limit venue,not to expand it.cases from the court of appeals for the second circuit make this clear.the test does not represent a formal constitutional test,but rather is merely helpful in determining whether a chosen venue is unfair or prejudicial to a defendant.united states saavedra,cir.to satisfy this test,there must be more than some activity in the situs district instead,there must be substantial contacts.united states davis,cir quoting reed,at.there must be some sense of venue having been freely chosen by the defendant.id alteration and quotation marks omitted.if a defendant argues that the chosen venue is constitutionally infirm but that it did not result in any hardship to him,the court only determines the locus delicti and does not then analyze whether there were substantial contacts.see united states magassouba,cir.this test thus serves to limit venue in instances where the locus delicti constitutionally allows for a given venue,but trying the case there is somehow prejudicial or unfair to the defendant.
even assuming that the substantial contacts test is viable within our circuit,it can not serve as a sufficient basis for conferring venue.the government argues only that it has minimally satisfied one of the four prongs of the test the locus of the effect of the criminal conduct.there was no evidence at trial that auernheimer actions evinced any contact with new jersey,much less contact that was substantial.the government has not cited,and we have not found,any case where the locus of the effects,standing by itself,was sufficient to confer constitutionally sound venue.
undoubtedly there are some instances where the location in which a crime effects are felt is relevant to determining whether venue is proper.see rodriguez moreno,at reserving the issue of whether venue may also be permissibly based on the location where a crime effects are felt.but those cases are reserved for situations in which an essential conduct element is itself defined in terms of its effects.bowens,at.for example,in a prosecution for hobbs act robbery,venue may be proper in any district where commerce is affected because the terms of the act themselves forbid affecting commerce.see u.a accord united states smith,cir.this is consistent with congress prerogative to provide that the locality of a crime shall extend over the whole area through which force propelled by an offender operates.johnson,at.
sections of the cfaa other than a c do speak in terms of their effects.for example,a b criminalizes intentionally accessing a computer without authorization and recklessly causing damage.because that crime is defined in terms of its effects the damage caused venue could be proper wherever that occurred 
congress,however,did not define a violation of a c in terms of its effects.the statute simply criminalizes accessing a computer without authorization and obtaining information.it punishes only the actions that the defendant takes to access and obtain.it does not speak in terms of the effects on those whose information is obtained.the crime is complete even if the offender never looks at the information and immediately destroys it,or the victim has no idea that information was ever taken.
the government also argues that venue was proper in new jersey because auernheimer failed to obtain authorization from approximately new jersey residents to use their icc id
