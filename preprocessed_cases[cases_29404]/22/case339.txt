matthew eric mann entered a conditional guilty plea to one count of possessing child pornography in violation of a b.the district court sentenced mann to months imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release.police discovered evidence supporting the child pornography charges while executing a warrant to search mann computers and hard drives for the unrelated crime of voyeurism.mann preserved the right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress the child pornography on the grounds that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant.although we are troubled by some aspects of the search,we ultimately conclude that,with one immaterial exception,the officer executing the search did not exceed the scope of the original warrant.
while working as a life guard instructor in may for the red cross in tippecanoe county,indiana,mann covertly installed a video camera in the women locker room to capture footage of women changing their clothes.unfortunately for mann,he also captured footage of himself installing the camera in an open locker.one of the female students in his class later discovered the camera.she recognized mann in the video when she rewound and viewed the tape.she and two other women in mann class contacted the lafayette police department and turned over the video camera and the videotape.
three days later,an indiana state prosecutor sought and received a search warrant for officers to search mann residence for video tapes,cd or other digital media,computers,and the contents of said computers,tapes,or other electronic media,to search for images of women in locker rooms or other private areas.as relevant here,officers executing the warrant seized a dell desktop computer with a samsung hard drive,a dell laptop,an,and a western digital external hard drive.the following day officers arrested mann and charged him with voyeurism in violation of the indiana code.see ann.a b defining voyeurism and making it a class d felony when committed by means of any type of video recording device.
nearly two months later,at the end of july,detective paul huff of the lafayette police department began his search of mann computers.at the suppression hearing,detective huff testified that he searched the computers by first using a write blocker to protect the hard drives from being altered and then created an exact match of each hard drive.he then used software known as forensic tool kit ftk to catalogue the images on the computer into a viewable format.detective huff explained that once this indexing process using ftk is completed,an overview screen is generated that lets him know how many images,videos,and documents are on the computer and whether there are encrypted documents or files that may be ignored such as program files.the overview screen also lists files flagged by the software as kff known file filter alert and kff ignorable files.the kff alert flags those files identifiable from a library of known files previously submitted by law of which are images of child pornography.
on the first computer,detective huff discovered evidence that mann had visited a web site called perverts are us,where he had read and possibly downloaded stories about child molestation.on the dell laptop,detective huff uncovered still images taken in the jefferson high school locker room,child pornography,and evidence that the western digital external hard drive had been connected to the laptop.detective huff then searched the final computer,where he again found child pornography,along with a disturbing story presumably written by mann about a swim coach masturbating while watching young girls swim.
it was not until nearly another two months later,on september,that detective huff first searched the western digital external hard drive.as with the other computers,detective huff used ftk to index the contents of the hard drive.the ftk software identified four kff alert files and flagged thumbnails.detective huff proceeded to open the files on the computer and discovered many,many images of child pornography as well as two videos from the jefferson high school locker room.
mann moved in the district court to suppress all of the evidence seized from his home and computers as a result of the may warrant,arguing that the warrant lacked probable cause and that the executing officers exceeded the scope of the warrant authorization.the district court denied mann motion,concluding that the magistrate judge had probable cause to issue the warrant based on the evidence of mann voyeurism at jefferson high school and the probability that mann possessed evidence of his crime at his residence.the district court also rejected mann claim that the executing officers had exceeded the scope of the warrant when they opened the files containing child pornography.specifically,the district court found as a factual matter that detective huff believed the search warrant authorized him to examine any digital file located on the computer hard drives or storage devices and that he never abandoned his search for evidence of voyeurism and began looking for child pornography.the court ultimately concluded that with limited exceptions the search was within the scope of the warrant,and that any images uncovered outside the scope of the warrant were discovered in plain view.mann then entered a conditional guilty plea to the one count of possession of child pornography in the indictment,reserving his right to challenge on appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
on appeal,mann maintains that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress.in particular,mann claims that the searches that uncovered the child pornography on his computer exceeded the scope of the original warrant and that the plain view doctrine does not apply on these facts.the government insists that the searches did not exceed the scope of the original warrant,and that the incriminating child pornography was in any event discovered in plain view.when reviewing a motion to suppress,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error,united states marrocco,cir.
we begin with mann contention that detective huff search of the computers exceeded the scope of the warrant.the fourth amendment requires that a warrant describe the things to be seized with sufficient particularity to prevent a general exploratory rummaging through one belongings.see,marron united states.the requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another.as to what is to be taken,nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.the description of items to be seized limits the scope of the search to areas where those items are likely to be discovered.platteville area ap ass.city of platteville,cir.thus,our question is whether,in light of the limitations in the warrant,the execution of the search was touchstone for all fourth amendment inquiries.see also mcarthur,d.
mann maintains that given the warrant directive to search in those places likely to contain images of women in locker rooms and other private places,it was unreasonable for detective huff to employ the ftk software and its accompanying kff alert system,which ordinarily identifies files containing child pornography.undoubtedly the warrant description serves as a limitation on what files may reasonably be searched.the problem with applying this principle to computer searches lies in the fact that such images could be nearly anywhere on the computers.unlike a physical object that can be immediately identified as responsive to the warrant or not,computer files may be manipulated to hide their true contents.see united states hill,cir images can be hidden in all manner of files,even word processing documents and spreadsheets.criminals will do all they can to conceal contraband,including the simple expedient of changing the names and extensions of files to disguise their content from the casual observer.
so although the officers were limited by the warrant to a searc
