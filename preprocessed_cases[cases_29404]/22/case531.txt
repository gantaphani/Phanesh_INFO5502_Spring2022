we must decide whether a distributor of internet security software is entitled to immunity under the safe harbor provision of the communications decency act of,from a suit claiming that its software interfered with the use of downloadable programs by customers of an online media company.
zango,zango is an internet company that provides access to a catalog of online videos,games,music,tools,and utilities to consumers who agree to view advertisements while they browse the internet.it brought this action against kaspersky lab,kaspersky which distributes software that helps filter and block potentially malicious software,for improperly blocking zango software.kaspersky invoked the protection of c b for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material.the district court granted summary judgment in kaspersky favor,holding that it is a provider of an interactive computer service entitled to immunity for actions taken to make available to others the technical means to restrict access to objectionable material.we agree,and affirm.
zango has four downloadable software programs zango,seekmo,hotbar,and spam blocker utility.zango provides free access to its catalog if customers agree to download and install one of these programs,and to receive online ads that are displayed as they browse the internet.it also offers a premium version of hotbar and spam blocker utility for which customers may pay if they wish to access zango catalog without having to view advertisements.
kaspersky is the distributor of internet security software developed by kaspersky lab zao,which is based in russia.among kaspersky products are kaspersky internet security kis and kaspersky kav.its software helps filter and block unwanted malicious software,known as malware,that can compromise the security and functionality of a computer.malware works by,for example,compromising a user privacy,damaging computer files,stealing identities,or spontaneously opening internet links to unwanted websites,including pornography sites.
the kaspersky software classifies zango programs as adware,a type of malware.once installed on a user computer,adware monitors a user internet browsing habits and causes ads to appear on a computer screen while the user browses the internet.adware can also open links to websites and computer servers that host malware and expose users computers to infection,and can swamp a computer memory and slow down computer speed and performance.for these reasons,ads and adware are unpopular among computer users,and consumers often install security software specifically to block adware.
the kaspersky software detects malware that may be present in an,web page,or software program that a computer user is about to download.if the kaspersky software determines that the download has characteristics that are consistent with malware,the software warns the user that the download contains possible malware.theoretically though this is contested,the user of the kaspersky software then has the option whether to allow or reject the download of the potential program.
the kaspersky software is designed to communicate via the internet with online databases and update services that kaspersky russian affiliate operates in moscow.the security software is designed to be updated regularly in order to keep malware definitions current,because new forms of malware are constantly being developed.a kaspersky customer may configure the software to communicate automatically with these online update servers.customers may also manually instruct their kaspersky software to communicate with the online update server.
zango alleges that kis interferes with zango customers concurrent use of the zango software in two ways.first,kis disables the toolbar feature of zango software,which provides a bar positioned at the top of the user internet browser page that displays links to relevant advertisers websites to users searching for data on a specific subject.furthermore,zango asserts,kis does not actually permit zango customers to consent to a zango program ongoing operation.zango avers that each time the zango program attempts to access the internet,kis displays a warning that gives the computer user the option either to block the zango program or skip the warning.however,while kis warning includes an apply to all checkbox that presumably is meant to stop the repeated warnings if the user opts to skip and selects apply to all,zango claims that the checkbox does not work.consequently,a zango user running kis is forced to deal with constant warnings.according to zango,the inevitable result is that a person using zango and kis concurrently gives up,thus permitting the kaspersky software to block the zango software.
zango adds that individuals who were already running kis and who sought to download zango software were prevented from doing so by kis.when a user attempted to download zango software,kis displayed a web warning that advised the user to block the zango download.the web warning permitted the user to click allow to override the warning and download the zango program however,once the user clicked allow,a new file warning appeared,stating that the zango software could not be disinfected and that write access is denied.zango maintains that installation of zango software was made impossible as a consequence.
zango states that it has not experienced similar problems with market leaders in the industry such as mcafee,norton symantec,and webroot.rather,zango contends,these companies advise users of the presence of zango programs and offer zango customers the choice to ignore the advisory.zango attributes the decline in the number of its customers between march and june to interference with zango software by kaspersky software and by other software that similarly blocks the operation of zango programs 
the degree of threat posed to users by zango software is in dispute.kaspersky contends that zango software is adware,and possibly spyware.spyware,which is often installed on a computer without the user knowledge or consent,covertly monitors the user activities and exposes the user to the risk that his or her passwords and confidential information may be stolen.zango maintains that it installs its software only upon receiving user consent,and that it provides easy means of uninstalling zango software from a user computer.for users of microsoft windows operating systems,these include a zango icon in the system tray in the bottom right corner of a user computer screen,which leads to a link where users are informed how to uninstall zango software,as well as uninstall zango instructions available in the menu 
zango initially brought this action in washington state court,advancing claims for injunctive relief,tortious interference with contractual rights,violation of the washington consumer protection act,trade libel,and unjust enrichment.kaspersky removed the case to federal court.the district court denied zango request for a temporary restraining order,and kaspersky subsequently filed a motion to dismiss under.b,which the parties and the court treated as a motion summary judgment under.summary judgment was granted on the ground that kaspersky is entitled to immunity under c b.
zango has timely appealed 
the heart of zango appeal is that congress intended statutory immunity under c to apply to internet content providers,not to companies that provide filtering tools.we think the statute plainly immunizes from suit a provider of interactive computer services that makes available software that filters or screens material that the user or the provider deems objectionable.
section,which provides protection for private blocking and screening of offensive material,is part of the communications decency act of cda.the cda was enacted to control the exposure of minors to indecent material on the internet.batzel smith,cir.
section c b provides 
c protection for good samaritan blocking and screening of offensive material 
civil liability 
no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of 
b any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to the material described in paragraph.
the material that can be blocked under the exemption includes material that the provider or user considers to be obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,excessively violent,harassing,or otherwise objectionable,whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.c a 
the statute defines interactive computer service as any information service,system,or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server,including specifically a service or system that provides access to the internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or educational institutions.f emphasis added.
access software provider is defined in part as a provider of software including client or server software,or enabling tools that do any one or more of the following a filter,screen,allow,or disallow content b pick,choose,analyze,or digest content.f a,b.
thus,a provider of software or enabling tools that filter,screen,allow,or disallow content that the provider or user considers obscene,lewd,lascivious,filthy,excessively violent,harassing,or otherwise objectionable may not be held liable for any action taken to make available the technical means to restrict access to that material,so long as the provider enables access by multiple users to a computer server.
going beyond the statute plain language,zango relies on legislative history to show that congress intended to grant immunity only to content providers.in particular,zango points to the house conference report statement that o ne of the specific purposes of is to overrule prodigy and any other similar decisions which have treated internet service providers and users as publishers or speakers of content that is not their own because they have restricted access to objectionable material,at.stratton oakmont prodigy services held that prodigy,an internet service provider that provided online bulletin boards,could be held responsible for libelous statements posted by others.wl.may.from this,zango infers that the good samaritan provision was intended only to protect information providers from liability they might otherwise have for defamatory or obscene content prepared by others.while certainly this was one of the specific purposes of c and one of the protections it extended,the conference report goes on to make clear that good samaritan protections apply to all access software providers,as defined in section e subsequently renumbered as section f,at.and the definition of access software provider includes any provider of software or enabling tools that filter,screen,allow,or disallow content.therefore,our reading of the text comports with the conferees expectations 
according protection to providers of programs that filter adware and malware is also consistent with the congressional goals for immunity articulated in itself.five policy objectives are identified.of these,two read on the issues in this case to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals,families,and schools who use the internet and other interactive computer services and to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children access to objectionable or inappropriate online material.b.as more software is developed to block malware,users will be able to exercise more control over the content that is transmitted to their computers.thus,affording the safe harbor to providers of software aligns with the congressional policy stated in b.malware may also expose users to objectionable content,including links to pornographic websites,or to software that can compromise the user privacy,computer security,or identity.thus,the policy stated in b,of removing disincentives for the development of software that filters out objectionable or inappropriate material,is served by a safe harbor for providers of software who otherwise fall within the terms of the statute.
this is the first time we have considered this particular application of,although we have previously addressed immunity under c see barnes,cir fair housing council,llc,cir en banc carafano,cir batzel,at.section c is directly aimed at the problem created by the stratton decision.section c b,on the other hand,covers actions taken to enable or make available to others the technical means to restrict access to objectionable material.as we have discussed,the drafters purpose and the plainly articulated policies of the statute are served by applying c b to immunize the providers of blocking software.in sum,this case presents a different problem,and a statutory provision with a different aim,from ones we have encountered before.
nevertheless,zango reads batzel to imply that the immunity in c was intended to reach website operators and internet service providers who provide people with access to content,but not to companies that provide access to tools or mechanisms for filtering content.for this it relies on our remark in batzel that c insulates service providers from claims premised on the taking down of a customer posting such as breach of contract or unfair business practices.at.zango contends that kaspersky does not maintain a service on which objectionable material may appear and so can not take down a customer posting from its service put differently,as zango sees it,kaspersky,which sells filtering software but does not provide access to content,was not an intended beneficiary of statutory immunity.we disagree that we meant to imply this in batzel.as we recognized,c was not relevant to batzel,and when we described how c further encourages good samaritans we obviously had in mind the circumstances at issue in that case.id.batzel involved a website and listserv,and potential immunity under c.id.at.in that context,our comment about the taking down of a customer posting made sense.by contrast,this case involves providing the technical means for others to restrict access to material kaspersky finds objectionable,which is a different problem with different potential immunity.
kaspersky will receive protection under c b for civil liability so long as it is a provider or a user of an interactive computer service.no one has argued that kaspersky is a user.in zango view,kaspersky is not a provider,either.
we agree with the district court that kaspersky is a provider of an interactive computer service under the plain terms of c.kaspersky provides an interactive computer service because it is an access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server.f.kaspersky is an access software provider because,by providing software,it provide s software or enabling tools that filter,screen,allow,or disallow content.f,f a.and,under the literal provisions of f,kaspersky provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server by providing its customers with online access to its update servers.
zango argues that merely providing an online update feature does not satisfy f requirement that the interactive computer service provide or enable computer access by multiple users to a computer server because nearly every commercial software application has the capacity to be updated via the internet.for this reason,it posits,updating capacity does not signify that the application itself is a service that enables access by multiple users to a server.instead,zango proposes a gloss on interactive computer service that would construe a computer service as interactive only if it enables people to access the internet or access content found on the internet.we decline to read the statute so narrowly.as written,does not limit the definition of interactive computer service to services that provide access to the internet rather,its singular requirement is for access by multiple users to a computer server.f.
zango further maintains that f requires kaspersky to provide users whom zango would define as persons who volitionally seek access with access to content that resides on a server.this argument is
