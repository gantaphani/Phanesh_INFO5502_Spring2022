introduction 
ray andrus was indicted on one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a b.agents of the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice found pornographic images of children on andrus home computer after andrus father,bailey andrus,consented to a search of the andrus home and andrus computer.andrus moved to suppress the inculpatory evidence found on his computer during the search,arguing andrus consent was not voluntary and that andrus lacked both actual and apparent authority to consent to a search of the computer.the district court determined andrus consent was voluntary and that andrus had apparent authority to consent to the search.the district court,accordingly,denied andrus motion to suppress.
after the district court denial of his motion,andrus pleaded guilty to the charge against him but retained the right to appeal the district court denial of his suppression motion.he was sentenced to seventy months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release.in this appeal,andrus challenges the district court denial of his suppression motion.exercising jurisdiction under,this court concludes andrus had apparent authority to consent to a search of ray andrus computer.we therefore affirm the district court denial of andrus motion to suppress.
ii.background 
federal authorities first became interested in ray andrus during an investigation of regpay,a billing and credit card aggregating company that provided subscribers with access to websites containing child pornography.the investigation of regpay led to an investigation of regpay subscribers.one of the subscribers providing personal information and a credit card number to regpay was an individual identifying himself as ray andrus at,leawood,ks.the andrus regpay subscription was used to access a pornographic website called www.sunshineboys.com.record checks with the drivers license bureau and post office indicated ray andrus,bailey andrus,and a third man,richard andrus,all used the west terrace address.the credit card number provided to regpay was determined to belong to ray andrus.the email address provided to regpay,was determined to be associated with bailey andrus.
the federal investigation into the andrus household began in january and focused primarily on ray andrus.at least one agent conducted surveillance on the andrus residence and knew ray andrus worked at the shawnee mission school.eight months into the investigation,agents believed they did not have enough information to obtain a search warrant for the andrus residence.they,therefore,attempted to gather more information by doing a knock and talk interview with the hope of being able to conduct a consent search.ice special agent cheatham and leawood police detective woollen arrived at the andrus house at approximately on august.ice special agent kanatzar,a forensic computer expert,accompanied cheatham and woollen to the residence,but waited outside in his car for cheatham authorization to enter the premises.
andrus,age,answered the door in his pajamas.andrus invited the officers into the residence and,according to the testimony of cheatham and woollen,the three sat in andrus living room,where the officers learned that ray andrus lived in the center bedroom in the residence.in response to the officers questions,andrus indicated ray andrus did not pay rent and lived in the home to help care for his aging parents.cheatham testified he could see the door to ray andrus bedroom was open and asked andrus whether he had access to the bedroom.andrus testified he answered yes and told the officers he felt free to enter the room when the door was open,but always knocked if the door was closed.
cheatham asked andrus for consent to search the house and any computers in it.andrus signed a written consent form indicating his willingness to consent to a premises and computer search.he led cheatham into ray andrus bedroom to show him where the computer was located.after andrus signed the consent form,cheatham went outside to summon kanatzar into the residence.kanatzar went straight into andrus bedroom and began assembling his forensic equipment.kanatzar removed the cover from andrus computer and hooked his laptop and other equipment to it.andrus testified he was present at the beginning of the search but left the bedroom shortly thereafter.kanatzar testified it took about ten to fifteen minutes to connect his equipment before he started analyzing the computer.kanatzar used encase forensic software to examine the contents of the computer hard drive.the software allowed him direct access to the hard drive without first determining whether a user name or password were needed.he,therefore,did not determine whether the computer was protected by a user name or password prior to previewing the computer contents.only later,when he took the computer back to his office for further analysis,did he see ray andrus user profile 
kanatzar testified he used encase to search for.jpg picture files he explained that clicking on the images he retrieved allowed him to see the pathname for the image,tracing it to particular folders on the computer hard drive.this process revealed folder and file names suggestive of child pornography.kanatzar estimated it took five minutes to see depictions of child pornography.at that point,however,cheatham came back into the room,told kanatzar that ray andrus was on his way home,and asked kanatzar to stop the search.kanatzar testified he shut down his laptop computer and waited in ray andrus bedroom with the computer until cheatham came back into the room to tell him andrus had personally consented to the search and kanatzar could continue.
cheatham testified he asked kanatzar to stop the computer search because of information revealed through his continuing conversation with andrus.cheatham explained he asked andrus if there were other computers in the house and andrus replied the computer in ray andrus room was the only one.cheatham then asked andrus about the internet service and andrus indicated it was part of the cable package.at that point,ray andrus was telephoned at his workplace.there is conflicting evidence concerning whether andrus or cheatham suggested calling andrus.andrus dialed andrus work number,spoke briefly with his son,and handed the phone to cheatham at the conclusion of his conversation with cheatham,ray andrus agreed to return to the andrus residence.he arrived ten to twenty minutes later.he parked his car in the garage and was met by cheatham,woollen,and ice agent smith,who arrived on the scene after the agents initial entry into the andrus residence.cheatham testified he told andrus that officers had already been inside the residence and had looked through his room.cheatham written report also indicates he told andrus he had a computer technician at the residence and that andrus had consented to a search of the house and the computer in andrus bedroom.cheatham said he then verbally asked andrus for consent to search his room and his computer.after obtaining andrus consent,cheatham went back inside to authorize kanatzar to continue his search.
ray andrus was indicted on one count of knowingly and intentionally possessing pornographic images of minors in violation of a b claiming a fourth amendment violation,andrus moved to suppress the evidence gathered from his residence and his computer.in the memorandum supporting his motion to suppress,andrus argued andrus consent was not voluntary andrus lacked actual authority to consent to a search of the computer,even if he had authority to consent to a search of ray andrus room and andrus could not reasonably be seen as having authority to consent to a search of the computer and,thus,lacked apparent authority.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing at which detective woollen,agent cheatham,agent kanatzar,agent smith,andrus,and ray andrus testified.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court determined andrus consent was voluntary,but concluded andrus lacked actual authority to consent to a computer search.the court based its actual authority ruling on its findings that andrus did not know how to use the computer,had never used the computer,and did not know the user name that would have allowed him to access the computer.
the district court then proceeded to consider apparent authority.it indicated the resolution of the apparent authority claim in favor of the government was a close call.the court concluded the agents belief that andrus had authority to consent to a search of the computer was reasonable up until the time they learned there was only one computer in the house.because cheatham instructed kanatzar to suspend the search at that point,there was no fourth amendment violation.the court based its conclusion that andrus had apparent authority on the following factual findings the email address an address associated with bailey andrus,was used to register with regpay and procure child pornography andrus told the agents he paid the household internet access bill the agents knew several individuals lived in the household ray andrus bedroom door was not locked,leading a reasonable officer to believe other members of the household could have had access to it and the computer itself was in plain view of anyone who entered the room and it appeared available for anyone use.implicit in the district court analysis was the assumption that the officers could reasonably have believed andrus accessed the internet through the computer in ray andrus bedroom,thereby giving andrus the authority to consent to a search of the computer.
lastly,the court concluded ray andrus later consent to search his computer and his admissions regarding additional evidence were knowing and voluntary.it found the agents had explained they were investigating violations of federal law regarding child pornography,advised andrus of the circumstances facing him,and told him he was not under arrest and was free to go at any time.the court further found that andrus told the agents he wanted to clear up the matter and gave consent to search his computer.based on these factual findings,the court concluded andrus consent was given knowingly and voluntarily.the district court denied andrus motion to suppress.
on appeal,andrus contests the district court apparent authority ruling.he contends that ambiguities in the situation facing the officers at the andrus residence required the officers to ask further questions concerning andrus authority to consent to a computer search prior to commencing the search.see united states kimoana,cir.andrus also argues on appeal that his own consent,given after the allegedly illegal computer search yielded inculpatory evidence,did not cure the alleged illegality because the earlier search and his later consent were not sufficiently attenuated.see united states,cir.
for the reasons explained below,this court concludes andrus had apparent authority to consent to the computer search.because there was,therefore,no constitutional taint associated with the initial search and because ray andrus does not draw a distinction between evidence seized during the initial search and evidence seized after he arrived home,the validity of andrus subsequent consent need not be addressed.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,this court considers the totality of the circumstances and views the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.kimoana,at.we accept the district court factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.id.consideration of witness credibility,the weight given to evidence,and reasonable inferences drawn from evidence are within the district court province as the.id.issues of law,however,such as determinations of reasonableness under the fourth amendment and the validity of consent,are reviewed de novo.united states mitchell,cir united states rith,cir.
consent searches under the fourth amendment 
subject to limited exceptions,the fourth amendment prohibits warrantless searches of an individual home or possessions.illinois rodriguez,d.voluntary consent to a police search,given by the individual under investigation or by a third party with authority over the subject property,is a exception to the warrant requirement.rith,at.valid third party consent can arise either through the third party actual authority or the third party apparent authority.a third party has actual authority to consent to a search if that third party has either mutual use of the property by virtue of joint access,or control for most purposes.id.at see also united states matlock,d holding common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected may give rise to a third party valid consent to search.even where actual authority is lacking,however,a third party has apparent authority to consent to a search when an officer reasonably,even if erroneously,believes the third party possesses authority to consent.see georgia randolph,d.
whether apparent authority exists is an objective,inquiry into whether the facts available to the officers at the time they commenced the search would lead a reasonable officer to believe the third party had authority to consent to the search.see rodriguez,at.kimoana,at w here an officer is presented with ambiguous facts related to authority,he or she has a duty to investigate further before relying on the consent.when the property to be searched is an object or container,the relevant inquiry must address the third party relationship to the object.matlock,at.the supreme court most recent pronouncement on third party consent searches underscores that reasonableness calculations must be made in the context of social expectations about the particular item to be searched.randolph.at.in randolph,the court explained,the constant element in assessing fourth amendment reasonableness in consent cases is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations.id.for example,the court said,w hen it comes to searching through bureau drawers,there will be instances in which even a person clearly belonging on the premises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to consent.id.at.
objects typically associated with high expectations of privacy include mankind valises,suitcases,footlockers,and strong boxes.united states block,cir see united states,cir contrasting a suitcase,in which defendant had a high expectation of privacy,with a cardboard box,cassette tape,or plastic bucket,with which lesser expectations of privacy are associated.it may be unreasonable for law enforcement to believe a third party has authority to consent to the search of an object typically associated with a high expectation of privacy,especially when the officers know or should know the owner has indicated the intent to exclude the third party from using or exerting control over the object.see,at determining officers belief in apartment owners authority to consent to search of defendant suitcase to be unreasonable where police failed to inquire into apartment owner use of or control over the suitcase.
this court has not previously considered expectations of privacy associated with a home computer in a third party consent situation.tenth circuit precedent thus far has dealt only with computer searches where police have a warrant or other justification for searching the computer,or when the defendant computer owner himself has consented to the search.see,united states brooks,cir concluding defendant consent to search of his computer authorized law enforcement search united states tucker,cir concluding parole search of defendant computer was permitted by the plain language of defendant parole agreement united states carey,cir determining officer exceeded scope of warrant authorizing computer search for evidence of drug crimes when officer found and continued to search for child pornography on defendant computer.other courts have,however,analyzed third party authority to consent to the search of a home computer,focusing on the application of fourth amendment principles in this special case where it is unclear from a visual inspection of the outside of the computer whether the computer owner has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the computer or its data.
analogizing computers to other types of containers 
courts considering the issue have attempted to analogize computers to other items more commonly seen in fourth amendment jurisprudence.individuals expectations of privacy in computers have been likened to their expectations of privacy in a suitcase or briefcase.united states aaron,cir unpublished.files have been compared to a locked footlocker inside the bedroom.trulock freeh,cir.
given the pervasiveness of computers in american homes,this court must reach some,at least tentative,conclusion about the category into which personal computers fall.a personal computer is often a repository for private information the computer owner does not intend to share with others.
f or most people,their computers are their most private spaces.people commonly talk about the bedroom as a very private space,yet when they have parties,all the perfect invited to toss their coats on the bed.but if one of those guests is caught exploring the host computer,that will be his last invitation.

manifestations of expectations of privacy in computer data 
the inquiry into whether the owner of a highly personal object has indicated a subjective expectation of privacy traditionally focuses on whether the subject suitcase,footlocker,or other container is physically locked.see,block,at holding mother lacked authority to consent to search of son footlocker where t he trunk was fastened shut by some means that indicated to the officers that it was locked and that a key was required to open it.determining whether a computer is locked,or whether a reasonable officer should know a computer may be locked,presents a challenge distinct from that associated with other types of closed containers.unlike footlockers or suitcases,where the presence of a locking device is generally apparent by looking at the item,a lock on the data within a computer is not apparent from a visual inspection of the outside of the computer,especially when the computer is in the off position prior to the search.data on an entire computer may be protected by a password,with the password functioning as a lock,or there may be multiple users of a computer,each of whom has an individual and personalized user profile.see oxford english dictionary online,last visited,entry for password,definition.defining password in the computing context as a sequence of characters,known only to authorized persons,which must be keyed in to gain access to a particular computer,network,file,function.the presence of a password that limits access to the computer contents may only be discovered by starting up the machine or attempting to access particular files on the computer as a normal user would 
courts addressing the issue of third party consent in the context of computers,therefore,have examined officers knowledge about password protection as an indication of whether a computer is locked in the way a footlocker would be.for example,in trulock,the fourth circuit held a girlfriend lacked actual authority to consent to a search of her boyfriend computer files where the girlfriend told police she and her boyfriend shared the household computer but had separate files that were inaccessible to the other.at.the court in that case explained,although conrad had authority to consent to a general search of the computer,her authority did not extend to trulock files.id.at.in united states morgan,the sixth circuit viewed a wife statement to police that she and her husband did not have individual usernames or passwords as a factor weighing in favor of the wife apparent authority to consent to a search of the husband computer,cir.accord aaron.at determining girlfriend could give valid consent for search of defendant computer because defendant had not forbidden her from using computer or restricted her access with password protections.a critical issue in assessing a third party apparent authority to consent to the search of a home computer,therefore,is whether law enforcement knows or should reasonably suspect because of surrounding circumstances that the computer is password protected.
additional factors bearing on third party consent for computer search 
in addition to password protection,courts also consider the location of the computer within the house and other indicia of household members access to the computer in assessing third party authority.third party apparent authority to consent to a search has generally been upheld when the computer is located in a common area of the home that is accessible to other family members under circumstances indicating the other family members were not excluded from using the computer.see united states buckner,cir determining wife consent was valid where wife leased computer in her name,wife occasionally used computer,computer was found in living room,and fraudulent activity had been conducted from that computer using accounts opened in wife name morgan,at concluding wife had apparent authority because she initiated contact with police,computer was located in common area of the house,and wife told police she had used computer,she and husband did not have usernames or passwords,and she had installed software on the computer united states smith,d,concluding girlfriend had actual and apparent authority to consent to search of defendant computer because girlfriend gave police permission to enter house and search computer and computer and desk were in common area and surrounded by children toys.in contrast,where the third party has affirmatively disclaimed access to or control over the computer or a portion of the computer files,even when the computer is located in a common area of the house,courts have been unwilling to find third party authority.trulock,at.
andrus apparent authority to consent to a search of ray andrus computer 
andrus case presents facts that differ somewhat from those in other cases.andrus computer was located in a bedroom occupied by the homeowner year old son rather than in a true common area.morgan,at computer in basement smith,d at computer in joint bedroom of girlfriend and defendant,surrounded by children toys.andrus,however,had unlimited access to the room.law enforcement officers did not ask specific questions about andrus use of the computer,but andrus said nothing indicating the need for such questions.trulock,at when law enforcement questioned third party girlfriend about computer,she indicated she and boyfriend had separate files.the resolution of this appeal turns on whether the officers belief in andrus authority was reasonable,despite the lack of any affirmative assertion by andrus that he used the computer and despite the existence of a user profile indicating ray andrus intent to exclude other household members from using the computer for the reasons articulated below,this court concludes the officers belief in andrus authority was reasonable.
the critical issue in our analysis is whether,under the totality of the circumstances known to cheatham,woollen,and kanatzar,these officers could reasonably have believed andrus had authority to consent to a search of the computer.see kimoana,at.phrased in the negative,we must ask whether the surrounding circumstances could conceivably be such that a reasonable person would doubt andrus consent and not act upon it without further inquiry.rodriguez,at.if the circumstances reasonably indicated andrus had mutual use of or control over the computer,the officers were under no obligation to ask clarifying questions,kimoana,at,even if,as the dissent notes,the burden would have been minimal in this particular case.
this court must accept the factual findings of the district court unless those findings are clearly erroneous.id.at.we,therefore,accept the following facts as true first,the officers knew andrus owned the house and lived there with family members.second,the officers knew andrus house had internet access and that andrus paid the time warner internet and cable bill.third,the officers knew the email address had been activated and used to register on a website that provided access to child pornography.fourth,although the officers knew ray andrus lived in the center bedroom,they also knew that andrus had access to the room at will.fifth,the officers saw the computer in plain view on the desk in andrus room and it appeared available for use by other household members.furthermore,the record indicates andrus did not say or do anything to indicate his lack of ownership or control over the computer when cheatham asked for his consent to conduct a computer search it is uncontested that andrus led the officers to the bedroom in which the computer was located,and,even after he saw kanatzar begin to work on the computer,andrus remained silent about any lack of authority he had over the computer.even if ray andrus computer was protected with a user name and password,there is no indication in the record that the officers knew or had reason to believe such protections were in place.
andrus argues his computer password protection indicated his computer was locked to third parties,a fact the officers would have known had they asked questions of andrus prior to searching the computer.under our case law,however,officers are not obligated to ask questions unless the circumstances are ambiguous.kimoana,at.in essence,by suggesting the onus was on the officers to ask about password protection prior to searching the computer,despite the absence of any indication that andrus access to the computer was limited by a password,andrus necessarily submits there is inherent ambiguity whenever police want to search a household computer and a third party has not affirmatively provided information about his own use of the computer or about password protection.andrus argument presupposes,however,that password protection of home computers is so common that a reasonable officer ought to know password protection is likely.andrus has neither made this argument directly nor proffered any evidence to demonstrate a high incidence of password protection among home computer users.the dissent,however,is critical of this court because it neither makes the argument for andrus nor supplies the evidence to support the argument.the key aspect of the dissent is its criticism of the majority for refusing to take judicial notice that password protection is a standard feature of operating systems.post at.a judicially noticed fact is one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either generally known or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.b.although judicial notice may be taken sua sponte.c,it would be particularly inappropriate for the court to wander undirected in search of evidence irrefutably establishing the facts necessary to support the dissent conclusion regarding the absence of apparent authority namely,that a password protection is a standard feature of most operating systems b most users activate the standard feature and c these are matters of such common knowledge that a reasonable officer would make further inquiry.in rejecting this challenge,the court notes the dissent itself did not take up the search for facts that would meet the requirements of rule b.without a factual basis on which to proceed,we are unable to address the possibility that passwords create inherent ambiguities 
viewed under the requisite analysis,the facts known to the officers at the time the computer search commenced created an objectively reasonable perception that andrus was,at least,one user of the computer.that objectively reasonable belief would have been enough to give andrus apparent authority to consent to a search.see kimoana,at united states durham,wl,at,unpublished holding mother lacked actual and apparent authority to consent to search of computer in son room where officers knew room was locked and mother could not produce the correct key.even if andrus had no actual ability to use the computer and the computer was password protected,these mistakes of fact do not negate a determination of andrus apparent authority.see rodriguez,at,at.any factual knowledge that might undermine the initial reasonable conclusion of apparent authority is generally immaterial.morgan,at.in this case,the district court found agent cheatham properly halted the search when further conversation with andrus revealed he did not use the computer and that andrus computer was the only computer in the house.these later revelations,however,have no bearing on the reasonableness of the officers belief in andrus authority at the outset of the computer search.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,this court concludes andrus had apparent authority to consent to a search of the computer in ray andrus bedroom.andrus arguments related to the validity of his subsequent consent,therefore,need not be addressed.we accordingly affirm the district court denial of andrus motion to suppress.
this case concerns the reasonable expectation of privacy associated with computers.in examining the contours of a third party apparent authority to consent to the search of a home computer,the majority correctly indicates that the extent to which law enforcement knows or should reasonably suspect that password protection is enabled is critical.we differ,however,over the extent to which the burden of inquiry should rest with law enforcement personnel.more specifically,i take issue with the majority implicit holding that law enforcement may use software deliberately designed to automatically bypass computer password protection based on consent without the need to make a reasonable inquiry regarding the presence of password protection and the third party access to that password.
given the majority correct decision to categorize computers as containers,with all the attendant protections afforded under the case law,whether a computer search is objectively reasonable depends upon determinations in individual cases with no rules.the few cases confronting this issue pay particular attention to the presence or absence of password protection see ante at collecting cases.
the presence of security on defendant computer is undisputed suppression hr g tr.at.yet,the majority curiously argues that defendant use of password protection is inconsequential because defendant failed to argue that computer password protection is commonplace.ante at.of course,the decision provides no guidance on what would constitute sufficient proof of the prevalence of password protection,nor does it explain why the court could not take judicial notice that password protection is a standard feature of operating systems.despite recognizing the pervasiveness of computers in american homes,ante at,and the fact that the personal computer is often a repository for private information the computer owner does not intend to share with others,the majority requires the invocation of magical language in order to give effect to defendant subjective intent to exclude others from accessing the computer.
the development of computer password technology no doubt presents a challenge distinct from that associated with other types of locked containers.ante at.but this difficulty does not and can not negate fourth amendment protection to computer storage nor render an expectation of computer privacy unreasonable.united states,cir considering,in assessing appeal of suppression motion,the precautions taken by the owner to manifest his subjective expectation of privacy,for example locking the container see also georgia randolph,d roberts,dissenting to the extent a person wants to ensure that his possessions will be subject to a co
