defendant jay martin schene was convicted by a jury of five counts of knowingly possessing material that contained an image of child pornography that was produced using materials that had been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate commerce,in violation of a b.schene contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that the images of child pornography were produced using materials that had been mailed,shipped,or transported in interstate commerce the evidence was insufficient to show that schene committed the crime the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence certain testimony regarding gender and homosexuality and the district court abused its discretion by admitting into evidence images of child pornography,and related exhibits.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
in february,the federal bureau of investigation fbi in allentown,pennsylvania,searched the computer of an individual suspected of having child pornography.in the process,they discovered emails from a second individual,whose screen name with america online aol was.the fbi served a subpoena on aol,and aol disclosed that was donald black,of duncansville,pennsylvania.in april,the fbi executed a search warrant on black residence and seized four computers.black admitted trading child pornography with a number of individuals online,although he could not remember any of their names or screen names.
the fbi performed a search of black computer,and one of the screen names that they uncovered was.the fbi served another subpoena on aol,and aol disclosed that the screen name corresponded to the account of defendant schene,who lived in edmond,oklahoma.several other screen names were associated with schene account,including,myebayshades,ebayshades,and okseecat.the fbi referred this information to its oklahoma city office.
in oklahoma city,fbi special agent william weaver performed a search of public records and determined that schene home address was in edmond,oklahoma.agent weaver stopped by schene home several times to investigate,and eventually,near the end of may,a woman answered the door.agent weaver left his business card with her,and he requested that schene contact him.later that morning,schene called agent weaver,who asked schene to come to the fbi office for an interview.schene agreed.
at the interview,schene stated that he had never used,or heard of,outdoorguy.schene admitted,however,that he used two of the other screen names and okseecat.he stated that he worked as a financial advisor for chase bank,and that he was married to cathy carlin,whose email address was.when asked,schene consented to a search of his home computer,and fbi agents accompanied him to his house to perform the search.during the search,schene told the agents that there were no children in the house,and only he and his wife used the computer.
the fbi agents searched schene computer using a software tool called presearch,which finds all of the images on the computer hard drive and shows them.at first,the agents only saw images of homes and other generic images from the internet,but eventually,images of child pornography began to appear.schene denied that the images were his,and he stated that he had no idea how the images had come to be on his computer.the agents seized the computer.
at the fbi office,bryan carter,a computer forensics expert,examined the computer in detail.carter focused on the hard drive because everything on the computer was stored there,and any visual images came from information on the hard drive.he used several software tools to look for images,and these tools enabled him to search for specific file as images and to uncover a lot of information about each file.the tools even enabled him to find files that the user had attempted to delete.
carter discovered two operating systems on schene computer windows xp professional and windows xp home edition.the user had to choose between the two operating systems immediately after starting the computer.within each operating system were two user for jay schene and another for cathy none of the user names required a password.the email service on the computer was aol,and carter found all of the screen names that aol had listed in its response to the fbi subpoena.he also found the email address book that aol automatically created for outdoorguy.included within the address book was the screen name,which the fbi had previously determined to be the aol screen name for donald black of duncansville,pennsylvania,who had admitted trading child pornography with a number of individuals online.
during his search of the computer,moreover,carter found over images of child pornography,about half of which the user had attempted to delete.he discovered most of the images in emails associated with outdoorguy and.he also found pornographic movies involving children,as well as a history of movies that had been created and viewed on the computer.some legitimate,emails not containing child been sent from with jay schene signature at the bottom.there was also a program on the computer scheduled to run daily on cathy carlin user profile but accessible from either of the user profiles.
at schene trial,the government presented the evidence described above,including the images of child pornography that pertained to each of the five counts in the indictment.in addition,the government read into evidence a stipulation to which all parties had agreed,which stated 
the parties to this case stipulate and agree that the following fact may be accepted as proven 
the hard drive from the defendant computer is a seagate gigabyte hard drive.this hard drive was manufactured in the country of singapore.
roa,vol.i,at tr.at.
the government then called as a witness jeffrey elliott,a captain with the oklahoma highway patrol who had been assigned to the fbi cyber crimes task force to investigate crimes involving computers and the sexual exploitation of children.officer elliott testified,without contemporaneous objection from schene,about the content of the images 
a i would say probably to percent of the images that were child pornography were images of young boys.they may be nude by themselves in a sexually provocative position,they may be engaged in a homosexual act with another young boy or an adult male.
q and in your experience in working with cyber crimes and these types of investigations,have you ever seen a woman who trafficked in child pornography showing homosexual acts between males 
a i have not.
tr.at.officer elliott also described an exchange of emails between outdoorguy and an individual using the screen names butwhoishe and handsomehorn.the emails contained images of child pornography,and outdoorguy sent and received several such emails within an period on the evening of april.officer elliott explained further that outdoorguy had sent an email to himself,with images of child pornography attached,which would have enabled outdoorguy to access these images on other computers.finally,on redirect examination,officer elliott testified 
q now,on the internet history,were there instances you could find where websites with homosexual themes had been visited 
a yes,sir.i saw repeatedly,i saw the user under the jay martin schene account visit www.menforsexnow.com,www.menforrentnow.com,www.cruisingforsex.com.and there was an address at that was visited very frequently.
q and did you look at a few of these websites 
a i did.i visited each of those.each of them are gay oriented for males.they all offered child pornography to view.they are kind of a social networking site where you can post your profile or post an ad requesting to meet with someone and that kind of thing.
as his defense,schene tried to show that the government had not proven that it was he who had knowingly possessed the pornography.on cross examination,agent weaver admitted that he did not know the identity of the woman who first answered the door at schene address.he admitted that he never attempted to interview schene wife he never searched her business computer he never searched schene work computer and he never put together a of schene computer usage.further,agent weaver agreed that schene contacted him very quickly after agent weaver left his business card at the residence,and schene cooperated fully with the all questions and granting the fbi access to his computer.agent weaver agreed that families commonly share an aol screen name and email account,and that neither jay schene nor cathy carlin user name required a password.schene also questioned agent weaver about whether the fbi had unduly focused on than his schene was a man 
a i believe we asked if he had any children in the home and he said no.and then it was asked whether he had any nephews or nieces that would have access.
q you would agree,though,that in your report there nothing that mentions nieces 
q your report only mentions there were no nephews in the teenage years 
q you never considered the possibility of a woman viewing these images,did you 
a we tried to consider all people in the house.in this case,the images were of young boys,young mostly males,and generally you can consider men,but we try to consider both parties.
tr.at.shortly thereafter,agent weaver testified 
a you just assumed that a man looked at these images 
tr.at.on redirect examination,the following exchange occurred 
q has your training with the fbi taught you about the frequency with which women traffic in child pornography 
wyatt your honor,i going to object.calls for speculation,and there no foundation for this,and it beyond daubert and kumho tire.
the court overruled.
q by sengel you may answer the question.
a yes.it usually men.
q it very rarely found to be women who traffic in child pornography 
q so in this instance,that one of the reasons you were focusing on jay schene as you go out there 
a right.another reason was when we did the search,the computer was kind was an account for the wife and an account for the husband.when the images came up the first images that i saw i could see the path where they were stored,and it was in the wife account and they were pictures of real estate and different things that she was interested in.there were family,i think,trips to a river rafting trip.and i could see on the path it was still in her account.and soon as that switched to show jay account,that when the images of child pornography started popping up.
likewise,on cross examination,bryan carter admitted that neither jay schene nor cathy carlin user name required a password.a person could have accessed the outdoorguy screen name from either of the user names,and there was no way to determine that schene was the individual sitting at the computer,viewing the images of child pornography.in addition,officer elliott admitted that law enforcement had not conducted a sting to catch schene in the act of looking at child pornography,and only through the use of a camera could he prove that schene was the person sitting at the computer looking at the images of child pornography.officer elliott further admitted that he never interviewed cathy carlin because she refused to talk with him,and he never examined schene work computer.
schene moved for a mistrial at several points.the first time,he argued 
your honor,also the government has advised the court that it is to show homosexual activity but they have no evidence of homosexual acts or homosexual nature of the defendant.in absence of that i suggest to the court that it is unduly unfairly discriminatory and an improper suggestion,and even based on previous testimony,i would state that i did not object,but i going to now and move for a mistrial on the grounds that you ca assume that someone is homosexual because of information that involves homosexuality or bisexuality that a man looked at it.
tr.at.the court denied the motion.later,after officer elliott testified about the images recovered from schene computer,the following exchange occurred 
wyatt i ask the court for a limiting instruction.there no evidence to be presented of any homosexual activity by my client of jay martin schene,no evidence from anyone of any evidence they have provided to me,no discovery that he is homosexual,gay,bisexual,and i ask the jury be instructed on that.
the court what would be the basis for me instructing them what the evidence has shown 
wyatt well,i objected to the fact that they have attempted to introduce this without any daubert showing and without any,it just opinions of lay people once you get to that point.for a witness to stand up here and say that we never seen a woman look at pictures of homosexual men,that is totally beyond the scope of the expertise of these people,whether he has seen that or not.it does establish whether it does or does not exist or who might have been looking at any of the images.
the court insofar as the daubert related objection,there was a sufficient showing made.beyond that i do have any basis to give a limiting instruction on what you asking for.you can inquire into it on cross and put on your evidence,but at any rate,your request will be denied.
wyatt for the record i move for mistrial.
the court be overruled.
schene called several witnesses to testify on his behalf.first,jay penrod,a computer forensics specialist,testified that all of the aol screen,okseecat,and originally set up under cathy carlin user profile he also testified that it was impossible to identify who was sitting at the keyboard looking at the images of child pornography that outdoorguy was not necessarily a man and that family members commonly share one aol account and often view inappropriate material without other family members knowing.schene then called three character witnesses,who testified to their opinion of schene high character as an honest and individual.
pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,schene moved for a judgment of the district court the close of the government case,at the close of schene case,and at the close of the government rebuttal evidence.ultimately,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all five counts.the district court sentenced schene to sixty months imprisonment,followed by two years of supervised release.
sufficiency of the evidence the interstate commerce element of a b 
schene appeals the sufficiency of the evidence as to the interstate commerce element of a b.he did not raise this issue in his rule motions for judgment of acquittal,so we review for plain error.see united states schaefer,cir see also united states goode,cir to obtain relief under this doctrine,schene must show an error,that is plain,which means clear or obvious under current law,and that affects substantial rights.goode,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.if he satisfies these criteria,this court may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the statute at issue,a b,prohibits a ny person from 
knowingly possess ing any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer,or that was produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means,including by computer.
a b.to meet the interstate commerce element here,the government has relied solely on the second prong of a b,that the images of child pornography were produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.
at trial,the government theory was that schene hard was mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce had produced the images of child pornography when it caused them to appear visually on schene computer monitor.the parties stipulated that t his hard drive was manufactured in the country of singapore,roa,vol.i,at tr.at.also,bryan carter testified to the following 
q in the forensic exam when you focusing on the hard drive,is that those that did grow up with computers,like me,that where everything is stored 
q and in the instance of like images to be seen on a computer,are those images going to be produced from the information that on that hard drive 
a yes.it is an exact copy of that information.
the government attempt to prove production of the images by their display on a computer monitor is foreclosed by our decision in united states wilson,cir.in wilson,the defendant had been convicted under a b and we reversed the conviction under the jurisdictional prong of that statute.we first explained that,contrary to the government extremely vague theory at trial,and even though the evidence was uncontroverted that the diskettes containing child pornography traveled in interstate commerce,there was an alarming lack of proof that the diskettes were used to actually produce the graphics files.wilson,at.the government witnesses 
did not support the conclusion that computer diskettes are used to actually produce graphics files.to the contrary,their testimony left unanswered the question of whether a computer graphics file is produced or created prior to being recorded on a particular storage media,or whether,instead,it only comes into being at or after the point it is recorded on the storage media.although we have no doubt this question has an answer and thus do not foreclose the possibility that a diskette is a material used to produce a graphics file contained thereon,we conclude the evidence produced by the government in this case was insufficient to allow a reasonable juror to answer the question.
id.at.we also declined to affirm the conviction under the government alternate theory that the act of converting a computer graphics file stored on a diskette into a visual image on a computer monitor could constitute production of a visual depiction for purposes of the statute.id.we explained 
without foreclosing application of this theory under different circumstances,we find it of no value here.as previously noted,the stipulated amended superseding indictment narrowly charged defendant with violating a b by possessing three or more computer diskettes that contained visual depictions,computer graphics files.under a b,a computer graphics file is considered a visual depiction as it resides on a computer diskette in binary form no act of viewing the file with software and a monitor is necessary.thus,the focal point of the statute jurisdictional element,as applied to the circumstances of this case,is whether the graphics files were produced using materials that traveled in interstate commerce.in other words,in determining whether the jurisdictional element is satisfied,the statute requires us to focus on the graphics files as they reside or are contained on the diskettes,and to determine what materials went into producing those files.it is irrelevant that defendant may have actually viewed the graphics files,using a computer,viewing software,and a monitor,because such viewing did not result in production of the graphics files instead,such production necessarily had to have occurred either at or prior to the time the graphics files were recorded on the diskettes.
id.citation omitted.
the government argument in the instant case mirrors the government alternate theory that we rejected in wilson,and despite the differences in the statutory texts at issue in the two cases,wilson still controls here.section a b requires that the image of child pornography was produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.although the statute does not define image,it defines child pornography to mean any visual depiction,including any photograph,film,video,picture,or computer or image or picture,whether made or produced by electronic,mechanical,or other means.the phrase visual depiction,in turn,includes undeveloped film and videotape,and data stored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual image.id.thus,under a b as under a b in wilson i t is irrelevant that defendant may have actually viewed the graphics files,because such viewing did not result in production of the graphics files instead,such production necessarily had to have occurred either at or prior to the time the graphics files were recorded on the diskette.wilson,at.
that is not the end of our analysis,however,because,as we have noted,schene did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence below and must therefore establish his entitlement to relief under the plain error standard of review.under that standard,schene must establish not only the existence of an error that is clear or obvious under current law,but also that such error affects his substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.for the reasons that follow,we are not persuaded that schene can make these latter two showings.
since our decision in wilson,both the seventh and ninth circuits have addressed the very question that we held was unanswered by the evidence presented in wilson,whether a computer graphics file is produced or created prior to being recorded on a particular storage media,or whether,instead,it only comes into being at or after the point it is recorded on the storage media.at.more specifically,both the seventh and ninth circuits have held,as a matter of law,that computerized images are produced for purposes of a b when computer equipment,including both hard drives and computer diskettes,are used to copy or download the images.united states anderson,cir united states guagliardo,cir united states angle,cir.as the ninth circuit explained in guagliardo,w hen the file containing the image is copied onto a disk or hard drive,the original is left intact and a new copy of the image is created,so the process produces an image.at.
armed with these more recent decisions clarifying how and when a downloaded or copied computer image is produced,we turn to the evidence presented in schene case.it was uncontroverted that all of the charged materials were found on schene hard drive.the government introduced the following testimony regarding the movie at issue in count of the indictment 
q now,the date here created where it viewed and so on,is that because someone took the file over to real player to look at it 
q and that different from the temporary directory 
q so it would take an intentional act of someone to move that movie over and play it 
tr.at.the real player history,moreover,stated that the movie was c reated on february.gov t ex.while some of this testimony appears to relate to the viewing of the movie,the testimony and government exhibit also support the creation or downloading of the movie onto the computer hard drive.the image charged in count was an active file that had been saved to the computer from coming in.tr.at.likewise,the images charged in counts and were all from recovered from jay schene computer and were all active on the computer.tr.at.the image charged in count was recovered from the defendant computer,from an email,and was an active file on the computer.tr.at.the government also showed that at least two of the charged images from exhibits and appeared on exhibit,the email that outdoorguy sent to himself,and an image sent in this fashion had to be stored on schene computer.tr.at.
it is obvious that the government evidence was sufficient,under the more recent seventh and ninth circuit decisions,to show that each image of child pornography had been copied or downloaded to schene hard drive in one capacity or another,and was therefore produced using materials that have been mailed,or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.a b see anderson,at guagliardo,at united states lacy,cir reviewing for plain error and affirming a conviction under a b because the images were created produced when lacy used his computer to download data,and under the statute,it does not matter that the depictions on lacy computer were copies rather than originals.in light of this conclusion,we would be to say that the claimed insufficiency of the evidence violated schene substantial rights or seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of his judicial proceedings.accordingly,we reject schene challenge to the interstate commerce element of a b.
sufficiency of the evidenc
