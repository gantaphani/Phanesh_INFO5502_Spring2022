andrew pickholtz appeals from the decisions of the united states district court for the northern district of california denying his motion for summary judgment of infringement and granting the defendants rainbow motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of pickholtz patent.pickholtz also appeals from the denial of his motion for attorney fees resulting from rainbow discovery misconduct.because the court erred in construing the claims of the patent,we reverse the court grant of summary judgment in favor of rainbow.because there exist genuine issues of material facts under the proper claim construction,we affirm the court denial of pickholtz motion for summary judgment.because the court abused its discretion in refusing to award attorney fees to pickholtz,we vacate that decision.we remand for further consideration of the infringement issue under the proper claim construction and the attorney fee issue under the court inherent power.
background 
a.the patent and its prosecution history 
pickholtz is the inventor and owner of the patent,which is directed to an apparatus for the prevention of piracy of computer software.the invention prevents computer software on an external memory device,a magnetic disc from executing on a computer unless the software is authorized to do so.patent,abstract.the authorization check involves two authorization codes recorded on the external memory device along with the protected software.id.the authorization codes are members of the same pseudorandom sequence,and the computer is equipped with a pseudorandom number prn generator that generates that sequence.id.at,ll.before the invention enables execution of the software from the external media device,the first authorization code is read from the external media device and used to initialize the prn generator.id.from that initial condition,the prn generator operates,thereby creating another prn.id.only if that prn matches the second authorization code on the external media device is the software allowed to execute.id.
the patent illustrates the invention in figure,which the patent describes as a block diagram representation of a computer system including software protection,in accordance with the present invention.id.at,ll.emphasis added.
as the patent describes that figure,a computer system comprises a central processing unit cpu in communication with a main memory.id.at,emphasis added.for additional details regarding possible embodiments of the cpu and the main memory,the patent references two general microprocessor textbooks.id.at,ll.the computer system also comprises a disc,on which is stored the protected software and the two authorization codes,as well as a prn generator,which is preferably a hardware module encased in plastic,epoxy,or radiation opaque material to prevent inspection and tampering.id.at,ll,ll.alternatively,the prn generator may be implemented in software.id.at,ll.
pickholtz originally submitted claims to the patent and trademark office pto defining the invention as a method and an apparatus for use with a data processing system.however,pickholtz changed his claims substantially before they were allowed.the examiner assigned to pickholtz patent application rejected all claims under as being unpatentable over patent,issued to david thomas.briefly,thomas disclosed software that,when loaded into a computer working memory,would generate a prn to be sent to an electronic security device esd on a circuit board for verification before enabling execution of the software.patent at.in response to the rejection,pickholtz replaced the pending claims with new claims,which were allowed essentially as submitted,and argued that thomas lacked a prn generator device located in the computer a sealed casing on the prn generator device and a second authorization code stored on an external memory.the examiner then allowed the claims,and the pto issued the patent.claim,the only independent claim in the patent,defines the invention as an apparatus for use with a computer and specifies that the prn generator device is located in the computer 
a software protection apparatus using first and second authorization codes and a pseudorandom number,said software protection apparatus for use with a computer,comprising 
an external memory device having computer software and a first authorization code and a second authorization code at selected data locations,wherein said second authorization code is part of a pseudorandom sequence

patent at,ll.emphasis added.
b.the district court proceedings 
pickholtz,who is an attorney,brought suit pro se against rainbow alleging that rainbow infringed the patent by its manufacture and sales of certain computer dongles,which are small devices that externally connect to a computer port.rainbow dongle,under the control of a driver program,acts as a hardware key,hindering any unauthorized use of computer software.the driver program detects the presence of the dongle and exchanges encrypted information with it,preventing execution of a protected software program unless the dongle is attached to a port of the computer.pickholtz alleged that the rainbow dongle contains a prn generator device as recited in claim,such that a computer with a rainbow dongle attached and with its driver program executing infringes claim.rainbow disputed the allegation that its dongle contains a prn generator and argued that,even accepting that allegation,the dongle prn generator would not be located in the computer,as the claim requires.thus,a critical issue before the district court was construction of the term computer and the phrase located in the computer in claim.
pickholtz proposed a broad construction of the term computer,one or more processing units and the memory,peripherals and other devices connected electronically to and communicating with the processing units.pickholtz rainbow,no.c,slip op.at,claim construction memorandum and order.pickholtz supported that construction with technical literature and expert testimony.rainbow proposed a narrower definition a cpu and main memory,sans peripherals.id.the district court adopted rainbow construction as the unambiguous meaning of the term on the basis of the patent intrinsic evidence.id.at construing the term computer as the cpu and main memory on the cpu circuit board,which taken together,form a part of a dedicated microprocessor system capable of executing instructions on data,and which exclude connected peripheral devices.in arriving at that construction,the district court focused on two aspects of the intrinsic evidence.first,when describing figure,the patent uses the term computer system to describe that collection of a cpu,main memory,a prn generator,and a disc peripheral,whereas the claim uses the term computer.from that distinction,the court concluded that a computer is different from a computer system.id.at.secondly,the phrase located in the computer would be surplusage if the term computer were construed as broadly as pickholtz proposed.id.at.the court also read pickholtz prosecution remarks traversing the thomas rejection as drawing a distinction between a computer and peripherals connected to a computer.id.at.because rainbow construction flowed unambiguously from the intrinsic evidence,the court gave no weight to pickholtz extrinsic evidence.id.at.as a consequence of its construction of the term computer,the court construed the phrase located in the computer to mean in the cpu,main memory or on the circuit board,but excluding connected peripherals,id.at,and consequently determined on summary judgment that rainbow dongles,being peripherals,do not infringe the patent.pickholtz rainbow,d.
during the course of the district court litigation,the parties had disagreements over discovery.pursuant to local rules,pickholtz was entitled to an electronic form of the source code utilized with rainbow dongles and supporting documentation.pickholtz rainbow,no.c,slip op.at,recommended order imposing sanctions.however,rainbow did not promptly produce those documents.id.on the ground of that tardiness,pickholtz moved for sanctions under.as well as the court inherent power.a magistrate found that n o substantial justification exists for the approximate year that it took defendants to produce the source code and supporting documentation in electronic format.id.however,aware of no authority that would permit him to award plaintiff,a pro se litigant,attorney fees,the magistrate limited pickholtz monetary recovery to expenses only.id.at.the district judge adopted the magistrate resolution of the discovery issue.pickholtz rainbow,no.c,slip op.at cal.june,order.
pickholtz appeals from the judgment of the district court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

the awarding of attorney fees under rule involves a procedural issue not unique to patent law,dh,synergystex int l,we therefore apply regional circuit law to that issue.midwest,karavan trailers,en banc in relevant part.because the ninth circuit reviews a refusal to impose sanctions under rule for an abuse of discretion,coleman quaker oats,cir,cert.denied,d,we will do the same.accordingly,we will not disturb the district court decision under rule unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.quoting payne exxon,cir applying the same standard in reviewing a district court imposition of sanctions,rather than a refusal to impose sanctions,under rule.to the extent that the district court decision not to impose sanctions rested on a legal interpretation of rule,we review that interpretation de novo.see foster tourtellotte,cir reviewing de novo a district court interpretation of the equal access to justice act as part of a decision not to award attorney fees pursuant to that act,where that decision was otherwise reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
pickholtz argues that the district court grant of summary judgment of noninfringement and denial of his own motion for summary judgment of infringement was based on a misconstruction of the term computer in the patent claims.additionally,pickholtz argues that the district court misinterpreted the law when it determined that it lacked authority to award a pro se litigant attorney fees under rule.
claim construction 
pickholtz argues that the district court erred when it construed the term computer to exclude peripherals.he urges that whether a computer includes peripherals is unanswered by the intrinsic evidence and that we should therefore turn to the extrinsic evidence that supports his broader construction.he argues that computer system and computer,as used in his patent,are synonymous.he further argues that the court construction is wrong because a computer without peripherals would be incapable of accepting input or yielding output and therefore would be useless.
pickholtz also contends that the court misconstrued the phrase located in the computer to mean in the cpu,main memory or on the cpu circuit board,but excluding connected peripherals.first,he argues that the court construction is inconsistent with the claims requirement that the prn generator device be in a sealed casing,with the specification teaching that the prn generator device is installable by the user,and with the depiction in figure of the prn generator device as being separate from the cpu and the main memory.secondly,he argues that the court construction of the phrase located in the computer is inconsistent with the court construction of the term computer because the latter does not include the cpu circuit board.thirdly,he urges that he did not distinguish his invention over thomas during prosecution on the basis of the location of the prn generator device.
rainbow responds that the court construction is the unambiguous result of the intrinsic evidence.rainbow draws attention to the fact that the patent claims refer to a computer,whereas the specification describes a computer system with reference to figure.thus,according to rainbow,a computer is something less than a computer system.rainbow also defends the court construction of the phrase located in the computer by arguing that it is consistent in part with the court definition of the term computer,that pickholtz broader construction would render the phrase superfluous,and that the prosecution history compels the court construction.
in interpreting claims,a court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record,the patent itself,including the claims,the specification and,if in evidence,the prosecution history.vitronics conceptronic.only if a disputed claim term remains ambiguous after analysis of the intrinsic evidence should the court rely on extrinsic evidence.id.at,at.
we agree with rainbow that the proper construction of the term computer follows without ambiguity from the intrinsic evidence however,that construction is not as rainbow contends.instead,we agree with pickholtz that the patent uses the terms computer and computer system as synonyms.although we would typically be inclined to give meaning to the word system,rather than regard it as surplusage,see elekta instrument,at,at,the patent in this case provides no indication that the two terms mean different things.instead,the patent uses the term computer system in the specification and the term computer in the claims nothing in the patent itself explicates their relationship or indicates any difference in meaning.
the remaining intrinsic evidence,the prosecution history,does not compel a different result.pickholtz originally submitted the claims in vastly different form,referring to the invention as part of a data processing system and reciting a pseudorandom number generator at the data processing system.pickholtz changed the claims into their allowed form after the pto rejected the claims as being obvious in light of the thomas patent.although thomas clearly uses the terms computer and computer system in a relationship,patent at,ll,pickholtz did not distinguish his invention over thomas on the basis of any difference between a computer and a computer system.despite pickholtz argument to the pto that thomas lacks a prn generator device located in the computer,thomas clearly discloses prn generating software,and that software is located in the core computer part of thomas computer system.patent at,ll.disclosing that the prn generator is software loaded into the working memory and executed by the cpu.pickholtz argument,although inaptly stated,can only be understood to mean that he considered thomas software to not contain a prn generator at all.thus,although pickholtz may have been casual and gratuitous in amending his claims and making arguments to distinguish over the thomas patent,nothing in the prosecution history convinces us that the terms computer and computer system in the patent have different meanings,even if they might have in the thomas patent.
accordingly,the district court erred when it concluded that the intrinsic evidence unambiguously imparted different meanings to the terms computer and computer system.on the contrary,they are used interchangeably in the patent.because the meaning of the term computer can be resolved from the intrinsic evidence alone,we need not rely on any extrinsic evidence,see vitronics,at,at,which in any event is not conclusive.while pickholtz advanced a number of technical dictionaries defining computer as inclusive of peripherals,as well as expert testimony to the same effect,rainbow disputed the meaning of those technical dictionaries and offered contrary expert testimony.
furthermore,as the patent specification includes one peripheral,a disc reading means,as part of the computer system,patent at,ll.disc,the synonymous term computer in the claims must include at least some peripherals.however,the term computer can not be so unbounded as to include all devices connected in any way to the cpu,or else the phrase located in the computer,and particularly the word in,would become meaningless.a peripheral distantly connected reasonably can not be in the computer.therefore,not everything somehow connected to a cpu can be a peripheral in the sense of being part of the computer.at the very least,however,the term computer encompasses peripherals that are within a reasonable proximity to the cpu and its main memory and directly connected to the cpu or the cpu circuit board.we need not,and indeed can not,attempt to precisely define which peripherals may be part of the computer as used in the patent for all cases.see emi group am.intel,i t is irrelevant whether the district court achieved a technologically perfect definition,because there is no dispute that the corresponding step of the intel process is within the literal scope of the claim limitation.thus we do not attempt to decide,de novo,the correct meaning of the claim limitation.the accused device in this case is certainly such a peripheral,as it indisputedly connects substantially directly to the cpu circuit board and is in close proximity to the cpu.
in summary,we construe the phrase located in the computer to mean located in the cpu,main memory,the cpu or main memory circuit boards,or qualifying peripherals as indicated above.in view of that construction,it necessarily follows that the rainbow dongle,when attached to a computer port,is such a peripheral and is therefore located in the computer.no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.
infringement 
because the district court granted summary judgment to rainbow on the basis of an improper claim construction,we reverse that judgment.however,the court did not abuse its discretion in denying pickholtz motion for summary judgment of infringement.besides arguing that its dongle is not located in the computer an argument that fails under the correct claim construction,rainbow argued below that its accused product fails to satisfy several other claim limitations,whether the accused device reads an authorization code prior to execution of the program,whether the accused device generate s an enable signal for enabling execution of the computer software,and whether the dongle generates pseudorandom numbers at all.the district court denied pickholtz motion for summary judgment of infringement on the ground that rainbow dongles are not located in the computer the court did not address the other distinctions raised by rainbow.because those potential distinctions could at least raise genuine issues of material fact,summary judgment of infringement would not be appropriate.we therefore affirm the court denial of pickholtz motion for summary judgment.
attorney fees for pro se litigants 
pickholtz contends that he is entitled under rule to recover the value of his own time as a pro se litigant because of rainbow discovery misconduct.pickholtz,who is both a lawyer and a computer consultant,calculated a lodestar figure by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours he spent working on the contentious discovery to arrive at as his opportunity cost.pickholtz argument is based on fairness and the furtherance of rule discovery abuse.pickholtz contends that the paltry the court awarded him for his expenses only encourages litigants to engage in improper discovery tactics against their pro se adversaries.pickholtz points to prewitt alexander,aff,cir affirmed without opinion,and several state court decisions that have awarded pro se litigants attorney fees under rule,rule,or their state court counterparts.pickholtz also argues that even if rule is not a basis for the district court to award him the value of his time,the court inherent powers enable it to do so.
besides disputing the accuracy of pickholtz lodestar figure,rainbow responds that the text of the rule is limited to expenses incurred including attorney fees and that pickholtz did not incur as an expense the value of his time that pickholtz proposal would unfairly reward pro se litigants for the value of their time when represented parties do not receive any compensation for their opportunity costs and that pickholtz grounded his request on rule only,not on the court inherent powers.
we agree with rainbow that the language of the rule does not allow a pro se lawyer to receive fees for his own time.our analysis is guided primarily by the plain language of the rule,the relevant portion of which reads 
t he court shall require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion of the party or attorney advising such conduct or both of them to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion,including attorney fees 
a a emphasis added.the rule requires that the expenses be incurred.we consider that term to be controlling on the issue,as the term means t o have liabilities cast upon one by act or operation of law,as distinguished from contract,where the party acts affirmatively t o become liable or subject to.black law dictionary abridged ed.see also webster third new international dictionary defining the term as to become liable or subject to to bring down upon oneself.thus,one can not incur fees payable to oneself,fees that one is not obliged to pay.see bank bailey,construing the same term in michigan equivalent to.moreover,the word attorney connotes an agency relationship between two parties client and attorney,such that fees a lawyer might charge himself are not attorney fees.massengale ray,cir concerning,the relevant language of which is essentially identical.nor are such fees a payable expense,as there is no direct financial cost or charge associated with the expenditure of one own time.see id.
notwithstanding the plain language of the rule,pickholtz argues that the objective of rule supports an award of attorney fees to pro se litigants.pickholtz correctly notes that the objective of rule distinguishes the award of attorney fees pursuant to rule from the award of attorney fees under other stat
