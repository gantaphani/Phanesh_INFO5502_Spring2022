after selling millions of dollars worth of stolen goods on ebay,laura and bruce wasz pleaded guilty to committing wire fraud in violation of.the district court ordered them to serve prison terms of and months,respectively.both defendants appeal their sentences,jointly contending that the district court overestimated the loss resulting from their criminal conduct and improperly characterized them as organizers or leaders of the offense.finding no clear error in either sentencing determination,we affirm the sentences.
laura wasz and her son bruce wasz owned three pawn shops in the chicago area.beginning in september and continuing until june,the waszes used those shops as a front for selling stolen goods on ebay,the popular internet auction site.the waszes obtained the stolen merchandise from peter giannopoulos,daniel bonaguidi,robert savino,spyros arvanitakis,jason wolber,george lukaszewski,and kim the parties aptly label the thieving.before they hooked up with the waszes,the thieving were stealing merchandise from home depot and similar retailers and then returning the items to the stores for cash refunds,as if they had been legitimately purchased.over time,changes in store policies made it increasingly difficult for the thieves to return the stolen goods in exchange for cash.a timely introduction to the waszes by a mutual acquaintance,however,provided the thieves with another outlet for the merchandise they were stealing.
the waszes and their thieving struck up a mutually profitable arrangement the thieves would obtain the merchandise,and the waszes would fence it.the thieves would steal items from home improvement and building supply stores including home depot,the great indoors,and expo design center,at locations not just in the chicago metropolitan area but also in colorado,kansas,maryland,michigan,minnesota,missouri,new jersey,ohio,tennessee,virginia,and wisconsin.the waszes often identified specific items that they wanted the thieves to steal,including kitchen appliances,garage door openers,tankless water heaters,sump pumps,snow blowers,chainsaws,pressure washers,mosquito exterminators,faucets,and household tools.on occasion,when the thieves embarked on road trips to victimize retailers,the waszes would advance them funds to cover their expenses.the thieves,in turn,would report by telephone on the progress of their trips.at the waszes instruction,the thieves would remove price tags and other identifying marks from the stolen merchandise so that the provenance of the goods would appear legitimate to buyers.the waszes also maintained a trail of falsified paperwork on the merchandise to make it appear as though they had obtained it legitimately,and in furtherance of that effort,they had the thieves complete fictitious invoices on the goods they stole.by standing agreement,the waszes paid the thieves cash for the stolen goods in amounts between and percent of their retail value.
on receipt of the contraband,laura and bruce wasz divided the items between themselves,stored the merchandise at their pawn shops and other locations,and then sold the items over the internet.under a number of different user names,the waszes offered the stolen goods for sale on ebay.both described themselves as honest sellers and concealed from prospective buyers the fact that the merchandise was stolen.goods were frequently described as new,brand new,and new in box.the items typically were offered for sale at prices substantially below their usual retail value the federal bureau of investigation fbi would later prepare an analysis indicating that the waszes sold their most popular lines of stolen goods at prices averaging percent of the goods retail value.needless to say,buyers snapped up the goods,unaware that they were purchasing stolen items.over the time span of this scheme,the waszes completed auctions of more than items at sale prices totaling more than million.
the government was tipped off to the scheme when a manufacturer of sump pumps complained to the fbi that its products were being offered for sale on ebay in new in box condition at less than their wholesale value and without the manufacturer permission.investigation led the government to some of the thieving,who agreed to cooperate and in some cases engaged in electronically monitored conversations with the waszes.
the waszes ultimately were charged in a indictment with engaging in both mail and wire fraud in violation of and,conspiring with their nine to transport stolen goods in and receive stolen goods from interstate commerce in violation of and,and possessing stolen goods that had moved in interstate commerce in violation of.both defendants pleaded guilty to count one,which charged them with wire fraud.the thrust of that count and the companion charges of mail and wire fraud was that the waszes had defrauded the ebay customers who had purchased stolen merchandise from them by misrepresenting themselves as honest sellers,affirmatively concealing the stolen nature of the goods they were offering for sale,and falsely representing and creating the false impression that they had legitimate possession of such merchandise and could lawfully transfer ownership of the goods to the buyers.like all ebay buyers and sellers,the waszes had accepted the terms of ebay user agreement,which in relevant part prohibits the sale of stolen merchandise the indictment identified various mail and wire communications executed in furtherance of this fraudulent scheme.the wire communication underlying count one was an sent from the chicago area to san jose,california where ebay has its headquarters establishing one of the waszes ebay accounts.at.
pursuant to the united states sentencing guidelines,the advisory sentencing ranges for both bruce and laura wasz turned in large measure on the loss attributable to their crime.section of the guidelines,which applies to offenses involving stolen property,specifies a base offense level of for the waszes offense,but it also mandates an increase to that offense level commensurate with the extent of the loss.see b in her report psrs for each of the waszes,the probation officer estimated that the loss in this case was between million and million dollars,an amount that called for a increase in the base offense level.see b i.the probation officer estimate of the loss tracked the estimate that the government had set forth in its version of the offense.although the proceeds of the waszes ebay sales exceeded million,the government conceded that not all of the goods sold by the waszes were stolen.however,the waszes had sold certain product lines on a frequent basis,and these corresponded with the types of items their thieving had regularly stolen from retailers.a preliminary government analysis had identified ten such product lines.the waszes had sold over items from these lines,and sales of products in these lines had yielded in gross proceeds to the waszes.the retail value of these items totaled an estimated,government official version of the offense at ex.the probation officer agreed with the government that this analysis was adequate to establish that the loss exceeded million.at at.
the defendants contended that the probation officer loss calculation was too high.with the support of a loss analysis prepared by a forensic accounting firm that they had engaged,the waszes argued that the actual loss fell between and million,an amount that would have called for a more modest increase of levels to the base offense level.see b h.the defendants suggested that the loss could be calculated from two different perspectives the gain realized by the waszes on the sale of the stolen goods or the actual loss suffered by the retailers from the theft of their merchandise.
looking at the loss in terms of what the waszes gained from their criminal conduct,the defendants proposed that the loss was equal to the net revenue that the waszes realized on the sales of the stolen merchandise.the waszes calculation of this amount began with an effort to cull from their total ebay sales during the relevant time period the revenue realized on items that were not available for sale at the stores targeted by the waszes thieving and thus presumably had not been stolen.these include items such as cars,used goods,jewelry,clothing,computers,office supplies,health and beauty items,and eyeglasses.removing those items yielded corrected sales figures of for laura wasz and for bruce wasz,hopewell report at.in the view of the defendants consultants,those figures then had to be reduced further to reflect the cost of generating that revenue 
t otal using the accounting revenue,is not gain,as the concept of gain includes not only revenue but the offset of revenue by expenses.the wasz are actually business owners.they operate legitimate pawn and second hand dealer businesses.as such,in determination of gain one must subtract from gross revenue the cost of generating that revenue.from the business records of the wasz,the consultants have determined that the cost for laura to generate the in total ebay transactions was or.the cost for bruce to generate the i n total transactions was or.applying those percentages to the and in corrected sales subject to the indictment,the cost of generating those sales was for laura and for bruce.
hopewell report at.subtracting those costs from the corrected sales figures for each defendant yielded net revenue figures of for laura wasz and for bruce wasz.id.combining the two produced a collective net gain of for both defendants.id.
looking at the loss from the perspective of the retailer victims,the defendants proposed that the loss should be measured not by the total retail value of the items stolen,but rather the profit the retailers lost as a result of their inability to sell the stolen items.that would be the gross profit the retailers would have realized on the sale of the goods,an amount equal to the retail price of the items less the retailers cost of acquiring the goods for sale.overhead and other fixed administrative costs would not be deducted,as the retailers would have incurred these costs regardless of the lost sales.id.at.looking to data on the gross profits of home improvement and building supply retailers,the waszes consultants had identified percent as a reasonable estimate of the percentage of gross profit that such retailers derive from the sale of their goods.using that percentage as the measure of the retailers loss,the defendants contended that the retailers had lost a total of.id.at 
at sentencing,the district court found that the loss was more than million but no greater than million.the court agreed with the government that the loss should be measured using the typical retail value of the stolen merchandise sold by the waszes.at.the court expressly rejected the defendants contention that the loss ought to be limited instead to the gross profit that the retailers would have realized on the stolen goods.a s i understand it,the store lost an item,so the store got nothing,so it a total loss to the store,both its profit and its cost.so it is whatever the retail value would be,i think.id.at see also id.at.the court added that the thefts likely imposed additional costs on the retailers that they would not have incurred otherwise.id.at.the court likewise rejected the waszes alternative contention that the loss should be measured using the proceeds realized on the defendants sales of the stolen items and then deducting from those proceeds the costs the waszes had incurred to generate the sales.the court noted that the waszes were selling the goods at prices well below their typical retail value.for that reason,an approach based on the proceeds of those illegitimate sales was not an appropriate way to calculate the retailers loss.id.at.ultimately,the court formally adopted the probation officer calculation of the loss.id.at.
the court also found that bruce and laura wasz both qualified as organizers or leaders of the offense and increased their offense levels by four levels based on their aggravating role.a.here,too,the court adopted the probation officer analysis.at.the probation officer reasoned that the waszes had played a leading role in that they owned the pawn shops used as fronts for the fencing operation,identified products they wished their to steal,advanced funds to their to cover the costs of their road trips,directed their to complete false invoices in order to hide the stolen nature of the merchandise,and benefitted financially from the scheme.at at.
these and other adjustments resulted in total adjusted offense levels of for each defendant.coupled with a criminal history category of i,that offense level produced an advisory sentencing range of to months for laura wasz.bruce wasz more extensive record of prior offenses placed him in a criminal history category of iv,which yielded a sentencing range of to months.the district court ordered laura wasz imprisoned for term at the bottom of the advisory range.the court ordered bruce wasz to serve months in term that was below the advisory range but,in the court view,more in line with the term it had imposed on his mother.at.
pursuant to the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,the district court was not obligated to impose a sentence within the range called for by the sentencing guidelines and,indeed,did not do so in bruce wasz case.nonetheless,the court was required to and did consult the advisory guidelines range in selecting an appropriate sentence,united states laufle,cir.for that purpose it was of course necessary for the court to accurately calculate the sentencing range called for by the guidelines,so that that calculation c ould serve as a meaningful guide in the district court imposition of a final sentence.united states baretz,cir.our task on appeal is to determine whether the district court calculations were correct,laufle,at.the waszes contend that the district court erred in holding them to account for a loss amount between million and million and in characterizing them as organizers or leaders in the scheme to steal goods from retailers and fence those goods on the internet.
we begin our review with the loss calculation,which had the most pronounced impact on the defendants sentencing level.to the extent that calculation turns on factual determinations,we review it for clear error,united states schaefer,cir.however,threshold questions concerning the meaning of loss and the methodology to be used in measuring that loss present questions of law that call for de novo review.united states sensmeier,cir united states walker,cir.
we should make one point clear at the outset the waszes each may be held to account for the total value of the merchandise stolen by their thieving and sold by either bruce or laura wasz on ebay.there is no dispute that the venture among the waszes and their thieving qualifies as a jointly undertaken criminal activity for purposes of the loss calculation.see a b.the thieves were stealing on the waszes behalf,customizing their thefts to the waszes preference for particular types of goods and receiving by standing arrangement percentages of the retail value of those goods.and although the waszes themselves maintained separate ebay accounts and to some degree auctioned off the merchandise independently of one another,there is no doubt that each was aware of the other sales activity.the record indicates that the waszes divided the stolen merchandise between themselves they sometimes instructed the thieves to divert goods from one wasz to the other they sold the same types of items on ebay,often under identical descriptions and laura wasz admitted that she and her employee,michael hockins,monitored bruce sales.without doubt,the aggregate value of the stolen merchandise that the waszes received and then sold on ebay was foreseeable to them both.what is disputed by the waszes is how to calculate the total worth of the stolen merchandise that they fenced.
we may quickly dispose of the waszes threshold suggestion that the district court did not make adequate findings to support its determination that the loss resulting from their offense was within the range of million to million.the district court was presented with a fully developed record as to the parties competing calculations of the loss amount.the district court remarks at sentencing make patently clear not only that the court rejected the defendants proposed loss calculation see at,but that the court expressly adopted the findings of the psr,which in relevant part tracked the government loss calculation see id.at.the court findings are more than adequate.see,united states sykes,cir.
echoing a point they made below,the defendants also suggest that the district court loss calculation may have been based on inaccurate data.as noted,the waszes auctioned more than items on ebay during the time frame covered by the indictment.it is common ground among the parties that not all of these sales are within the scope of the indictment.not all of the items the waszes sold were stolen,for example,and that fact no doubt helps to explain why a number of the items that the waszes auctioned off on ebay,cars,jewelry,clothing,and computers were not the types of goods offered for sale by the home improvement retailers victimized by the waszes thieving.
but any uncertainty as to the exact number and identity of the items that the waszes sold pursuant to the charged scheme turns out to be immaterial to the dispute over the loss calculation.as noted above,in an effort to make a reasonable estimate of the loss attributable to the scheme,the government in its version of the offense had identified ten of the most frequently sold product lines from the list of the defendants ebay sales that both laura and bruce admitted fencing during the time frame of the charged scheme and that corresponded with the types of items that the thieving acknowledged having stolen and sold to the waszes,government official version of the offense ex.prior to sentencing,the government updated and expanded this list to include a total of fourteen product lines.these lines included aquastar tankless water heaters genie garage door openers kohler,mico,and moen faucets basement watchdog sump pumps and insinkerator garbage disposals.sales of these product lines alone totaled over items roughly of the defendants total ebay auctions and generated some million in revenue to the waszes.using the typical prices at which the victimized retailers normally sold these items,the government put the total retail value of these goods at just over million,and it cited this figure as a conservative but reasonable estimate of the loss.at ex.the district judge explicitly agreed that this was a conservative estimate of the loss.at.notably,the defendants offered no reason why confining the loss estimate to these fourteen categories of stolen goods was not a reasonable approach to estimating the loss.for their part,as we discussed above,the defendants and their consultants parsed the list of total ebay auctions by the waszes and eliminated the types of items that they believed were not sold pursuant to the charged scheme.with those items eliminated,the total ebay sales by the waszes amounted to,hopewell report at.again we point out that this total reflects the prices actually charged by the waszes rather than the prices that would have been charged by the retailers.if this figure were adjusted to account for the fact that the waszes were selling the stolen merchandise at prices averaging percent of retail,the total retail value of the items stolen would amount to over million.what these varying calculations make clear is that the merit of the waszes appeal turns not on which particular items are included in the loss calculation,but rather on how those items are valued.
the material question insofar as the loss calculation in this case is concerned is whether the items admittedly sold by the waszes should be valued at their retail or a lesser value.loss is defined as either the actual or intended loss,whichever is greater,comment.a.the parties agree that actual loss is the appropriate benchmark in this case.actual loss is defined as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.id.comment.a i.the loss need not be quantified with exacting precision a reasonable estimate will suffice,comment.c see,united states spano,cir,cert.denied,d.where stolen goods are concerned,the fair market value of the property unlawfully taken is among the factors that the court should consider in placing a value on the loss,comment.c i.
the district court was on firm ground in using the retail value of the stolen merchandise fenced by the waszes as the benchmark in estimating the loss.other courts have recognized that when the stolen merchandise at issue has been taken from retailers,the price at which the retailers would have sold that merchandise serves as a reasonable estimate of the loss,united states carrington,cir united states lopez,cir united states williams,cir united states colletti,cir united states eyoum,cir approving use of retail value illegally imported wildlife for purposes of guidelines b a.contrast united states machado,cir appropriate valuation depends on context error to use retail value where goods were stolen from wholesalers and were to be resold wholesale united states hardy,cir same united states warshawsky,cir same.in this case,the merchandise stolen was ready for sale and,in fact,had been offered for sale by the retailers the waszes literally took the merchandise off the retailers shelves and out of the stores,bypassing the cashiers on their way out.the retailers would have already incurred virtually all of the costs associated with the sales of these items and were simply waiting to ring up the sales.in that regard,there is no dispute between the parties as to the prices at which the retailers would have sold the merchandise to willing customers.under these circumstances,it was entirely reasonable for the district court to use the total retail value of the stolen items as a reasonable estimate of the loss.if anything,the defendants may have benefitted from the fact that the government relied on a conservative list of which items sold on ebay by the defendants were within the scope of the scheme.
we reject the defendants suggestion that the loss instead be measured in terms of the gain that the waszes realized on the sales of the stolen goods.see,hopewell report at.this approach would begin with the prices at which the waszes actually sold the goods on ebay prices which,as we have noted,were substantially below the usual retail prices of the goods and deduct the costs of generating those sales costs that presumably would include the amounts that the waszes paid their for the goods.see id.although this approach might accurately measure the amount the waszes pocketed from their fraudulent activity,it does not constitute a reasonable estimate of the loss for a number of reasons.first,as the government correctly points out,the defendants gain does not serve as an accurate measure of the loss where the fair market value of the stolen goods can be determined,as it can be in this case.see guidelines,comment.b see also united states colello,cir proper inquiry focuses on victim loss rather than defendant personal gain.second,the waszes elected to sell the stolen items at substantially discounted prices the fact that the items were stolen may well have factored into that decision.third,the defendants were not operating a legitimate business but were dealing in stolen merchandise.the costs they incurred in obtaining and auctioning the goods,and the net amounts they realized on the sales,do not necessarily correspond with the harm inflicted on the retailers from whom the goods were stolen.see spano,at the objective in calculating the loss inflicted by a crime is to determine how much worse off the victim was made by a crime,and so the costs incurred by the criminal to commit the crime are irrelevant.citation omitted emphasis in original.
the defendants alternatively have proposed that the loss be measured by the gross profit that the retailer victims would have realized on the sale of the stolen items,but we reject this approach as well.the premise behind this theory is that the retailers would have incurred certain costs in selling the stolen items that they did not incur when the items were stolen.given the facts,we have some doubt as to the accurac
