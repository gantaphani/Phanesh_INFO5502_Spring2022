we must decide whether jeanne caldwell,who asserts an interest in being informed about how teachers teach the theory of evolution in biology classes,has standing to pursue an establishment clause claim arising out of her offense at the discussion of religious views on the understanding evolution website created and maintained by the university of california museum of paleontology and funded in part by the national science foundation.she avers that the website endorses beliefs which hold that religion is compatible with evolutionary theory and disapproves beliefs,such as her own,that are to the contrary,thereby exposing her to religious messages and making her feel like an outsider.in a published opinion,the district court concluded that caldwell allegations state only a generalized grievance insufficient for injury in fact,and dismissed the complaint.caldwell caldwell,d.we also conclude that the harm asserted by caldwell to her interest in being informed about the teaching of evolutionary theory is too generalized and remote to confer standing against the university of california faculty who administer the website and develop its content on behalf of the museum of paleontology.caldwell complaint against the director of the national science foundation has become moot since her appeal was taken.therefore,we affirm.
caldwell complaint pursuant to alleges that she is the parent of children in the california public schools,and is actively involved in elections and debates about the selection of instructional materials for science classes.she uses the website,understanding evolution,to participate as an informed citizen in these elections,debates,and processes.
roy caldwell,director of the university of california uc museum of paleontology,and david lindberg,chair of the integrative biology department at uc berkeley,developed the website content and administer it they applied for a grant from the national science foundation nsf to create a website to provide professional development opportunities to broaden and deepen the disciplinary knowledge and pedagogical skills of teachers,thus improving their ability to deliver rich and challenging science,mathematics and technology education to all students.nsf awarded the grant on may.
the website consists of some pages.its stated purpose is 
understanding evolution is a,education website,teaching the science and history of evolutionary biology.this site is here to help you understand what evolution is,how it works,how it factors into your life,how research in evolutionary biology is performed,and how ideas in this area have changed over time.
the website has a number of subsites,one of which is understanding evolution for teachers.this subsite in turn is organized into a number of sections,including one called misconceptions that addresses misconceptions about evolution and the mechanisms of evolution.caldwell complaint focuses on a page titled misconception evolution and religion are incompatible.beneath text elaborating the point is a cartoon that depicts a smiling scientist in a lab coat holding a fossil skull shaking hands with a smiling cleric in a collar holding a book marked with a small cross.
caldwell alleges that the site endorses the religious viewpoint that religious beliefs are limited to the spiritual world that the theory of evolution is not in conflict with properly understood christian religious beliefs that the misconception page links to a national center for science education ncse web page that includes statements by many religious organizations in support of the endorsed position that most christian and jewish religious groups have no conflict with the theory of evolution and that the site seeks to proselytize public school students and the public to adopt these viewpoints.the complaint avers that caldwell is offended by the government endorsement of religions and religious denominations when she visits the site that people such as she who believe that their religious belief is incompatible with evolutionary theory are made to feel like outsiders by the state of california and the united states and that she has been exposed to the religious messages to her harm because uc has opened the site to the general public.caldwell requests an injunction restraining publication of the website and a judgment declaring that inclusion of the religious and materials in the understanding evolution website is unconstitutional.
uc and nsf moved to dismiss for lack of standing.the district court held that caldwell failed to make out taxpayer standing with respect to both the federal and state parties,an issue that is not appealed.relying on valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,d,the court also found that caldwell allegations constitute no more than the generalized grievances of one who observes government conduct with which she disagrees.accordingly,it dismissed the complaint on the ground that caldwell has not shown injury in fact.
meanwhile,caldwell had moved at oral argument for leave to amend her complaint to include additional allegations that the understanding evolution website is aimed at the general public as well as at teachers,and that uc has expressly invited members of the general public to visit and use the website.asked to clarify its dismissal order in this respect,the court explained that it denied leave to amend because the additional allegations would have no bearing on whether caldwell adequately alleged cognizable injury in fact given that the court decision was based on the understanding that uc website was always open to the public.
caldwell timely appealed.
we first consider the status of caldwell action against nsf because mootness has been suggested.paragraph of the complaint alleges that the grant runs through october,and avers the grant started on april,and expires on october.the government represents that this is so,the grant in fact expired on october,and that no funding has occurred since then or is likely to occur in the future.see chandler miller,d.caldwell does not seriously contend otherwise.for these reasons,the appeal as to nsf is moot.
next we address caldwell contention that she could have added amendments to her complaint that would have sufficiently pleaded injury in fact,as well as meritorious establishment clause claims.there is no issue as to the latter because the merits were neither reached by the district court nor raised on appeal.as to standing,the proffered amendments would be meaningless because of the complaint already alleges that uc opened the understanding evolution website to the public.both the district court,and we,take it as true for purposes of whether dismissal is proper that,as pled,the website is public.
the heart of caldwell position is that valley forge,embraced as the controlling authority by uc and the district court,is inapposite and that the cross cases,exemplified by buono norton,cir,provide the more apt analogy.see also separation of church and state comm.city of eugene,cir scsc ellis city of la mesa,cir.caldwell submits that,like the plaintiffs in those cases,she also came into direct contact with a religious symbol on property owned by the government which she finds offensive and that,just as the inability of plaintiffs in those cases freely to use public land sufficed as injury in fact,so too should it suffice that she is inhibited from freely using a government resource without running into religious symbols and theological statements which offend her.
a party has article iii standing if she suffers an injury in fact,the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.buono,at see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.even so,the court has refrained from adjudicating abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances,pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.valley forge,at.quoting warth seldin,d.
