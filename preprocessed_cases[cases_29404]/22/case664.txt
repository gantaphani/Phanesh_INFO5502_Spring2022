in this appeal,we consider whether convictions for both receiving and possessing child pornography violate the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the constitution.because the indictment charged and the government proved at trial that edward curtis bobb had committed two distinct offenses,occurring on two different dates,in breach of two different statutes,we find no double jeopardy clause violation and,accordingly,affirm.
in september,the federal bureau of investigation fbi opened an investigation to find the person or persons responsible for posting numerous images of child pornography on a website operated by the great plains child care resource and referral center in oklahoma the center.as part of its investigation,the fbi extracted data from the center host computers that identified the ip internet provider addresses of computers that had recently been used to visit the center website.
with this information in hand,the fbi issued subpoenas to numerous internet service providers isps to require that they reveal the subscriber information for customers who had visited the center website during the time frame when the images appeared on the site after acquiring this information,the fbi identified the account holders who had visited the site and,more importantly,the account holders who had accessed the specific section of the website containing the child pornography.focusing attention on these individuals,the fbi discovered that,on november,an individual located somewhere in miami,florida,accessed the section of the center website containing the child pornography and had downloaded seven videos and numerous other picture files.the fbi soon traced the person to bobb residence 
on august,fbi agents executed a search warrant at bobb apartment the agents explained to bobb that they were looking for images of child pornography that someone,on november,had downloaded to a computer traced to his home.bobb told the agents that he was the only person living in the residence who used a computer to access the internet.
bobb apartment consisted of three rooms a main living room,a kitchen,and a bedroom.while searching the bedroom,the agents discovered two apple laptop computers one silver and the other black.in the living room,the agents found a beige desktop computer and two external hard drives.the agents removed the computers,the hard drives,and miscellaneous paperwork and correspondence related to bobb.
after seizing bobb computer equipment,the agents returned to the fbi office where special agent mary katherine koontz inventoried and reviewed the electronic contents in the computers.during this process,koontz discovered that the silver apple laptop contained images of child pornography.she also discovered seven zip files two of the zip files contained movies of child pornography that had been viewed on the computer.in addition,koontz found approximately images consisting of several images of child pornography layered on top of one another.that is,instead of one distinct image of child pornography,each image consisted of at least two images of child pornography merged together to create a single unique image on the other computers and hard drives,koontz found another images of child pornography.
koontz submitted fifty of the images found on the silver laptop to walter lambert,a pediatrician at the university of miami hospital,and asked that he determine the ages of the children depicted in the images.after examining the images,lambert was unable to determine the age of the person in one of the images,but he was able to discern that images depicted children,mainly girls,under the age of twelve,and that five images depicted children older than twelve,but under the age of eighteen.
over a year later,on august,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging bobb with one count of receiving child pornography on november,in violation of a b count i,and one count of knowingly possessing child pornography on august,in violation of a b count ii bobb pled not guilty to both counts.
before trial,bobb filed a motion for relief from joinder,arguing that,since t he alleged offenses occurred on two different dates and because t he same witnesses will be used to prove both counts,there was a substantial risk that the jury would conflate the evidence used to prove count i with the evidence used to prove count ii.specifically,bobb pointed out that the evidence the government planned to use to prove count i,the receiving count,was the seven zip files that bobb had allegedly downloaded from the center website on november,and the rest of the images would be used to prove count ii,the possessing count.according to bobb,he would be unduly prejudiced because the jury would likely consider the images regarding count ii when considering count i.the district court denied the motion,and the case proceeded to trial.
after a trial,a jury found bobb guilty on both counts.bobb conviction on count i for receiving child pornography carried a minimum mandatory sentence of five years imprisonment.b.the statutory sentencing range for his conviction on count ii,possessing child pornography,was set at zero to ten years imprisonment.b.because there were over images found on bobb computers,the government asked for a sentence on the highest end of the guidelines sentencing range,which was to months over the government objection the district court departed from the prescribed guideline range and sentenced bobb to concurrent sentences of months imprisonment and five years supervised release 
bobb now argues,for the first time on appeal,that his sentences for both receiving and possessing child pornography are impermissible because both counts of the indictment charged him with the same offense in violation of the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause.
while we usually review de novo claims of double jeopardy,united states harvey,cir,we review issues not properly raised before the district court,such as the instant one,for plain error.b united states evans,cir.under the plain error standard,we will affirm the district court unless there was an error in the district court proceedings the error was plain and the error affected the defendant substantial rights.id.if these conditions are met,we may exercise our discretion and vacate the conviction if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states cotton,d see also united states granville,cir per curiam to constitute plain error,the deficiency must be obvious and substantial,affecting the fairness or integrity of the trial,aff on rehearing,cir.
the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause guarantees that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v.this guarantees against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal,a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,and multiple punishments for the same offense.see jones thomas,d north carolina pearce,d,overruled on other grounds by,alabama smith,d.relevant to this case is the double jeopardy clause prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense.
as a general proposition,when a defendant has violated two different criminal statutes,the double jeopardy clause is implicated when both statutes prohibit the same act or transaction or when one act is a lesser included offense of the other.see rutledge united states,d.congress,of course,has the power to authorize multiple punishments arising out of a single act or transaction.see williams singletary,cir.the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy merely assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same offense.brown ohio,d accord missouri hunter,d t he double jeopardy clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.if it is not clear,though,that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the same conduct,a presumption arises that a conviction under multiple statutes for the same offense is contrary to legislative intent.see h
