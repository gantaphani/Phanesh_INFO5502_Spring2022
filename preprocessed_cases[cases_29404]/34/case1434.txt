opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on defendant terrance ross willaman appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered on january,in the district court the case originated on march,when maurice ferentino,an atf agent,and two other federal agents approached willaman at a hotel in erie,pennsylvania,where he was staying with his wife.ferentino,who had obtained information that willaman possessed a machine gun,at that time intended to serve a grand jury subpoena on him,apparently related to an ongoing investigation regarding weapons matters willaman admitted to ferentino at the hotel that he possessed a machine gun but told ferentino that he would turn it over to the agents.willaman and the agents subsequently left the hotel in separate cars to retrieve the weapon at willaman residence.once they arrived at the residence,he dug up the machine gun from the place where he had buried it,and the agents took possession of it.nevertheless,notwithstanding willaman apparent criminal conduct,ferentino twice informed him that he was free to go at any time.moreover,willaman has acknowledged that he was not coerced or treated badly in any way by the agents at his residence.
on may,a grand jury indicted willaman for knowingly and unlawfully possessing a firearm in violation of d,and,on september,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging willaman with knowingly and unlawfully possessing a machine gun in violation of o.following the original indictment,willaman appeared before a on may,at which time she set bail.nevertheless,willaman was not arraigned until may,at which time he pleaded not guilty.on may,eight days after his arraignment,willaman filed several motions a motion to dismiss the indictment under federal criminal rule b a motion to dismiss and a motion to suppress statements and evidence based on alleged violations of the first,second,fourth,and fifth amendments a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy and a motion seeking to have the court instruct the jury that it could nullify the effect of the law in this case.the district court denied these four motions on august.
the trial in this case commenced on october.immediately prior to the trial,willaman unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the indictment based on asserted speedy trial act,et,violations.at the trial conclusion the jury found willaman guilty on the superseding indictment.the court subsequently sentenced willaman to a custodial term of months to be followed by a period of supervised release.willaman timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
second amendment 
willaman first argues that section violates the second amendment,and that congress had no right to amend the second amendment merely by legislation,reply br.at.thus,in his view,the district court should have dismissed the indictment and allowed him to make a jury nullification argument.we review the district court order upholding the constitutionality of section and refusing to dismiss the indictment or allow a jury nullification argument on a plenary basis.see united states rybar,cir.we will not linger on this point inasmuch as a number of our cases,including rybar in which we held that this court has on several occasions emphasized that the second amendment furnishes no absolute right to firearms,at,foreclose willaman second amendment arguments.though willaman argues that rybar is simply bad law,reply br.at,plainly it is binding on this panel.see third circuit.
speedy trial act 
next,willaman argues that he was denied the right to a speedy trial under c section c,a section of the speedy trial act.willaman asserts that e ven excluding the time of filing and ruling on pretrial motions,more than days passed between his arraignment and the commencement of his trial,which exceeded the days allowed under section c.app.at.we exercise plenary review over the district court application of the speedy trial act.see united states hamilton,cir.
the speedy trial act provides that if a plea of not guilty is entered,the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment shall commence within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which the charge is pending,whichever date last occurs.section c gov t of virgin islands duberry,cir.however,delay during the time between the filing of a pretrial motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion is excluded from the computation of speedy trial act time.section h f see united states arbelaez,cir.
inasmuch as willaman did not appear before a judicial officer prior to his original indictment,his arraignment on may,at which time he pleaded not guilty,constituted his initial appearance for speedy trial act purposes,and thus that appearance triggered the running of the speedy trial act time period.our conclusion on this point is in harmony with our opinion in united states carrasquillo,cir,in which we said that w hen there is no appearance because an information or indictment is the first step in a criminal case,then postindictment arraignment will be the relevant last occurring date.emphasis added we recognize that willaman physically appeared before a magistrate judge on may,at which time she set bail,and we further recognize that section c indicates that the clock runs from the time the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer.nevertheless,inasmuch as willaman did not plead on may,the speedy trial clock did not begin to run until may,when he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty as carrasquillo indicated that an arraignment triggers the running of the period.see also united states zandi,cir since the appellants,in the instant case,appeared before a judicial officer after the date of the indictment,the dates of arraignment,and not the date of indictment,are relevant to our speedy trial inquiry.emphasis partially added united states haiges,cir when a defendant is indicted prior to his arrest,the pretrial period runs from the date of his arraignment.emphasis added.in this regard we point out that under federal rule of criminal procedure a an arraignment requires the court to ask the defendant to plead to the indictment or information,an event that occurred here on may.
we have not overlooked the arguable anomaly in the distinction between the effect of a defendant and appearance under section c.after all,under carrasquillo a defendant physical appearance before a will constitute a defendant appearance before a judicial officer,at,so that his subsequent indictment will trigger the running of the period even though he could not have pleaded before his indictment and thus could not have been arraigned at his appearance before his indictment yet under our result a physical appearance will not trigger the running of the clock until the defendant pleads,or at least is asked to do so,because in the absence of that request he will not have been arraigned.
nevertheless we are satisfied that the distinction is justified.as we indicated in carrasquillo,the courts are required to treat an indictment of a defendant as the triggering event for running the clock under section c when a defendant has appeared before a judicial officer prior to indictment because otherwise the date of an indictment could never be the date that last occurs under section c,at,so that the choice of triggering events between when the defendant has appeared or is indicted would be superfluous.on the other hand,if the defendant has not physically appeared before a judicial officer prior to indictment,as is the case here,then the indictment never can be the triggering event under section c.consequently,a court has flexibility in determining what congress meant when it used the words has appeared in a case in which a defendant first appearance is after his indictment that a court could not have when the defendant physically has appeared before a judicial officer prior to his indictment.
we think that it is logical to hold that congress intended when a defendant first appearance before a judicial officer is aft
