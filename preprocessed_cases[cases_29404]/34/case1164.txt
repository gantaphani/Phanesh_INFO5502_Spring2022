john gil appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york dearie,convicting him,after a jury trial,on a variety of mail fraud counts arising out of his submission of inflated invoices on a contract for heating,ventilation and air conditioning work at offices of the new york city betting corporation otb 
it was uncontested that gil procured from his subcontractors false and inflated invoices,submitted them to otb for payment,and received payment.the defense was that the inflated subcontractor invoices were authorized by a side at a meeting attended by gil and his lawyer,with otb general counsel,and two otb directors of that the overpayments were intended to compensate gil for work he performed outside of the contract,including gil drawing of plans that under the contract should have been prepared in advance by otb employees or consultants.
gil appeals chiefly on the ground that the government violated its duty under brady maryland,d,to timely deliver to the defense an internal otb memorandum.the internal otb memorandum reflects an agreement by otb officials to pay gil in a manner that deviated from the written contract terms confirms that gil was doing work for otb and references a meeting in the office of otb general counsel that may or may not be the one at which gil claims to have received authorization for the disputed billings.
we conclude that the internal otb memorandum constituted brady material that was suppressed by the government,and that gil suffered prejudice as a result.we therefore vacate the judgment on all counts of conviction and remand for a new trial,should the government decide to reprosecute.
background 
gil was president and sole shareholder of john gil construction,a company specializing in heating,ventilation and air conditioning hvac.in and,gil successfully bid on contracts with otb collectively,the contract to renovate and install hvac in approximately otb offices.because the scope of the work required at each otb office was for some reason not definitely known at the outset,the contract provided for payment on a time and material basis,gil was to be paid a percentage of profit above the actual cost of the labor and materials.pursuant to gil bid package,he was entitled to a on labor pursuant to the contract,gil was entitled to a on materials.the contract provided that gil would be given the specifications and design plans of the offices.
gil was authorized by the contract to hire subcontractors.gil paid the subcontractors directly and then submitted the subcontractor invoices to otb for reimbursement,along with a cover sheet attesting that the subcontractor invoices were accurate.the contract did not provide for a on subcontractor bills,but otb witnesses testified that gil was nevertheless authorized to collect on them a.
in,a broad investigation was begun into irregularities in the operations of otb as an agency.in the course of that investigation,it was found that gil had been submitting inflated subcontractor invoices for reimbursement.on february,a grand jury handed down an indictment charging gil with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of,and twelve counts of substantive mail fraud in violation of.by superseding indictment dated october,he was charged with the additional offenses of conspiring to engage in and engaging in monetary transactions in monies derived from mail fraud in violation of h and a,b 
trial began as scheduled on monday,january.one or two business days before trial,the government turned over two boxes of documents containing material.see.
among these papers was the memorandum at issue in this appeal.it is written by otb contract manager linda bradford to otb general counsel steven sloan,and recounts a conversation between bradford and gil on january,relating to payment for expediting services that gil had subcontracted hereinafter the bradford memo or the memo.such expediters are hired by contractors chiefly to obtain permits their service is purely labor,and requires no materials.as the memo reflected,gil was charging or passing through to otb a on the expediters services,which seemed wrong to bradford because no on subcontracting was authorized by contract,and in any event because expediters rendered services only no materials and the ordinarily applied to materials only.according to the memo,bradford challenged the as unauthorized,gil told her it was authorized by sloan,and stephen dorfman a facilities director at otb confirmed the authorization.
gil contends that the memo references the meeting,attended by gil,his lawyer taylor walker,sloan,and otb facilities directors dorfman and neftali tony lozano,at which the inflated billings were authorized as a means of compensating gil for the work of drawing the plans that per contract were to have been furnished in advance by otb.the prosecution theory was that no such meeting occurred.the prosecution argues that the memo reflects a meeting at which gil was authorized to collect from otb a premium on uninflated bills paid by him to his arrangement to which prosecution witnesses testified and as to which no criminal offense is that it does not reflect any authorization to inflate the subcontractors bills to which that premium was added.
considered without the spin of either party,the memo reflects that a meeting took place in sloan office and was attended by at least some of the people who according to gil attended the meeting at which the inflated billings were authorized that gil was authorized to charge a that bradford strangely thought that the was being passed through to the subcontractors themselves and that gil as he testified was doing engineering services although he lacked the requisite paper qualifications and was being compensated for those services by some kind of bill inflation,an irregular arrangement that deviated from the bid parameters and that for some reason was condoned by the general counsel.
the defense claims that the bradford memo was turned over on the friday before trial the government claims that it was turned over the thursday before trial.in any event,the defense did not discover the bradford memo until after the trial was over.
four subcontractors testified as gil conceded that at his request they submitted to him two sets of invoices one accurate set for which they received payment,and a second inflated set.an otb contract administrator named jason podob testified that gil was paid the amounts reflected in the inflated invoices plus the uncontested applied to subcontractors.
initially,otb facilities director dorfman categorically denied that he ever authorized gil to submit inflated subcontractor invoices,and said he was unaware that anyone else had done so.later,when asked whether he agreed to have gil costs included in the subcontractor bills,dorfman hedged i do recall agreeing to that.
otb facilities director lozano testified that the only work gil was asked to do that lozano considered was to hire an engineering firm to do drawings for one particular otb office.lozano instructed gil to include this sum approximately in his hours for his services at that location.
gil entire defense was that he was authorized to obtain payment for his work by submitting inflated subcontractor invoices on which he was then entitled to the materials,and therefore he did not deceive or defraud otb.he testified that a substantial amount of predicate work that per the contract should have been prepared in advance by otb employees or consultants including drawings and plans had not been done and when he raised the problem with lozano,who was directly in charge of the renovations,lozano told gil,listen,i do have any plans for when this place was built,but figure it out,get it done,and make it happen.
according to gil,he reached an agreement with otb officials to do the extra work,and accordingly prepared architectural or engineering drawings for many of the offices,did designs for fabrication and office layouts,took measurements and made the necessary load calculations and dunnage 
it is undisputed that gil submitted at least one invoice to otb accounting office for the work,labeled as such,but the invoice was rejected as unauthorized under the contract.gil claims that dorfman and lozano assured him that though he could not be paid for work under the contract,to make life easier we negotiate a flat amount or a lump sum for the extra costs,which should be included under subcontractors costs because it was easier for them to get processed and paid.
apparently uncomfortable with this billing arrangement,gil asked his lawyer to arrange a meeting with otb general counsel.gil testified that at that meeting,attended by gil,walker,sloan,dorfman and lozano,gil was instructed to pad the subcontractor invoices to obtain payment for his work.
walker testified that he attended a meeting at otb with gil,sloan,dorfman and lozano,at which gil was told to include his costs or soft costs in the subcontractor invoices.new york state assemblyman adam clayton powell iv,a friend of gil,testified about a conversation he had with gil and lozano about how gil would include his cost on the subcontractor cost.
the jury instruction on the defense of authorization was as follows 
i join counsel in suggesting to you that there is,indeed,one fundamental question before you.did,as the government alleges,the defendant john gil intend to defraud otb by submitting false or inflated invoices or was john gil authorized to do so,as he himself testified t he defendant does not have to prove he was authorized to submit the inflated invoices.it is the government burden to prove that he was not.
joint app.at hereinafter.
the jury deliberated for over a day before returning a verdict of guilty on all counts submitted to it.
more than five months after trial,the defense discovered the bradford memo among the material supplied just prior to trial.the defense had already filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal or for a new trial,which had been denied,but the defense moved to that motion on brady grounds.
the district court denied this motion,finding no brady violation because the bradford memo i had been turned over to the defense prior to trial and was not buried,ii was neither exculpatory nor favorable to the defense,and iii would not have altered the outcome of the trial.
discussion 
gil challenges his convictions on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion in denying gil motion for a new trial because the government suppressed material evidence favorable to the defense,in violation of brady the jury charge erroneously omitted gil defense of entrapment by estoppel,and mischaracterized the defense of authorization the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions the government made improper statements during summation a recent amendment expanding federal jurisdiction of the federal mail fraud statute over mails sent via private or commercial interstate carriers is unconstitutional and the court erred in enhancing gil offense level for obstruction of justice.
we first consider gil constitutional challenge to the federal mail fraud statute.
the current statute provides,in pertinent part 
whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do,places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter,any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the postal service,or deposits or causes to be deposited any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by any private or commercial interstate carrier,or takes or receives therefrom,any such matter or thing,or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail or such carrier according to the direction thereon,or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed,any such matter or thing,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
emphasis added.the highlighted passage was added by amendment in.violent crime control and law enforcement act of,pub,stat.gil contends that the amendment exceeded the scope of congress authority to legislate under the commerce clause,const.art.i,because it criminalizes conduct that takes place entirely intrastate and that has no substantial effect on interstate commerce.on that ground,he seeks reversal of his convictions on counts seven through eleven of the superseding indictment,which charge mail fraud effected by intrastate mailings via federal express.this circuit has not decided the question.
in united states lopez,d,the supreme court categorizes the activities that congress may regulate under the commerce clause 
first,congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.second,congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce,even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.finally,congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
id.at.internal citations omitted.a showing that a regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce as required for the third category is not needed when congress regulates activity in the first two categories.see united states king,cir.
we conclude that private and commercial interstate carriers,which carry mailings between and among states and countries,are instrumentalities of interstate commerce,notwithstanding the fact that they also deliver mailings intrastate.see lopez,at.houston shreveport united states.the fact that carriers are instruments of intrastate commerce,as well as of interstate commerce,does not derogate from the complete and paramount authority of congress over the latter,or preclude the federal power from being exerted to prevent the intrastate operations of such carriers from being made a means of injury to that which has been confided to federal care.perez united states,d noting that congress may regulate to protect the instrumentalities of commerce,as for example,the destruction of an aircraft.
this view is consistent with the fourth circuit opinion in united states photogrammetric data,cir,cert.denied,d upholding constitutionality of mail fraud statute as applied to intrastate mailing placed with private or commercial interstate carriers,and with decisions elsewhere upholding convictions arising out of intrastate use of a privately owned instrumentality of interstate commerce.united states marek,cir upholding conviction under the federal statute,based on intrastate wire payment to a hit man via western union,a quintessential facility in interstate commerce that congress may regulate under the second lopez category united states gilbert,cir telephone used to make bomb threat is an instrumentality of interstate commerce and this alone is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction based on interstate commerce united states wadena,cir depositing checks into institution was sufficient nexus with interstate commerce to uphold money laundering conviction under united states baker,cir upholding a conviction under the travel act,a,based on an extortion victim use of an automatic teller machine atm that triggered an entirely intrastate electronic transfer between two local banks,because interstate network of atms is a facility in interstate commerce kerbs fall river,cir a s long as the instrumentality itself is an integral part of an interstate system,congress has power,when necessary for the protection of interstate commerce,to include intrastate activities within its regulatory control.citations omitted,abrogated on other grounds,central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.
for the foregoing reasons,application of the mail fraud statute to intrastate mailings sent or delivered by private or commercial interstate carriers,is a permissible exercise of congress power under the second lopez category.
in a criminal prosecution,the government is constitutionally obliged to disclose evidence favorable to the accused when such evidence is material to guilt or punishment.brady maryland,d.the government duty under brady is fairly settled 
to the extent that a prosecutor knows of material evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal prosecution,the government has a due process obligation grounded in the amendment to disclose that evidence to the defendant.information coming within the scope of this principle includes not only evidence that is exculpatory,going to the heart of the defendant guilt or innocence,but also evidence that is useful for impeachment,having the potential to alter the jury assessment of the credibility of a significant prosecution witness.
leka portuondo,cir alterations in original quoting united states avellino,cir.
to establish a brady violation,t he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene,d see also in re united states coppa,cir.because gil brady claim was raised in a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,we review the denial of the motion for abuse of discretion.see united states monteleone,cir.
we first consider the contextually related issues of whether the bradford memo was favorable to gil and whether the defense was prejudiced by not using it last we consider whether it was suppressed.
favorable to the accused 
evidence is favorable to the accused if it either tends to show that the accused is not guilty or if it impeaches a government witness.strickler,at.coppa,at cir.such evidence is generally called brady material.see strickler,at.
the district court found that the bradford memo was not brady material because i t says not one word about authorizing gil to file phony invoices with betting corporation.at.the court later added it would not have occurred to me that this document is favorable to the defense.id.at.we respectfully disagree.
the bradford memo reads,in relevant part 
in my first conversation with john gil today,he asked how he was to be paid for subcontracting expediting services for filing park place.i learned that he was paying all his subcontractors a negotiated amount plus the rate applied to material.
when i told gil that the rate is not applied to labor,he replied,that the agreement we made with steve sloan.he went on to say that he brought up the matter of how to pay subcontractors at great length at the conference and in a meeting in your office,and you were the one who made the final decision.
this subcontractor agreement was later confirmed by steve dorfman.since we made such an agreement,why is it stated in the purchase orders why is it stated in the new time and material construction rfq for which we just received bids if nothing is mentioned in the most recent rfq about the method,when they bid,does that give an unfair advantage to the construction firms we have under current contract 
in my second conversation with john gil,i told him that all future expediting services will be handled by one of otb consultant engineers,and we get back to him on how he would get paid for the subcontracted services that have already been completed.gil mentioned that he has of completed expediting services for which he has yet to bill us.
i also concerned about whether gil has signed off on any of the hvac drawings he has completed for us since he told me he is the one who developed hvac drawings.i asked gil whether he was a licensed engineer.he told me that he had a masters degree in engineering but he had only taken part of the licensing exam.subsequently,i spoke to steve dorfman.he told me he was unaware that john gil was not a licensed engineer.
id.at emphasis added.
at trial,witness after witness testified that gil persuaded them to submit false invoices.the devastating impact of that testimony depended upon a background assumption,supported by the testimony of dorfman and lozano,that the invoices were being submitted to persons at otb who in the usual course expected to receive accurate statements reflecting work done per the contract.the bradford memo had the potential to subvert this background assumption radically 
the memo confirms the existence of a subcontractor agreement,and as such,is arguably exculpatory.the defense could have argued that this agreement was precisely the one that gil testified he negotiated with otb officials an agreement whereby gil would be paid a flat fee for the work he performed,he would incorporate that amount in subcontractor invoices,and he would be paid that amount plus the material.true,the memo goes on to say that any such arrangement should be reflected in the requests for bids,and it would be strange to reflect in an rfq that the contractor would do work that by contract should be done by otb,but the document and the record do not otherwise explain what the negotiated price would be.
the memo authorizes payments to gil,and thus supports the idea that certain otb officials were not averse to doing business on that basis.although dorfman and lozano conceded authorizing gil to add an to the subcontractors bills,bradford concern reflects that this arrangement was irregular,contrary to the bid process,and probably illegal.the jury could thus be made to appreciate that otb was not being run on a regular or businesslike basis.
the memo reflects awareness by dorfman that gil was performing the work of designing the hvac systems on various locations.indeed,bradford was worried that gil was doing engineering work for which he had insufficient qualifications.so the memo impeaches lozano testimony regarding the scope and amount of work gil performed.
for all of these reasons,the bradford memo is exculpatory and impeaching brady material.
materiality and prejudice 
the suppression of exculpatory or impeaching evidence does not constitute a constitutional violation unless the evidence is material.
a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant acquittal whether based on the presence of reasonable doubt or acceptance of an explanation for the crime that does not inculpate the defendant.the touchstone of materiality is a reasonable probability of a different result,and the adjective is important.the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.a reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the government evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of trial.
kyles whitley,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we assess materiality or prejudice in light of the trial evidence.where the evidence against the defendant is ample or overwhelming,the withheld brady material is less likely to be material than if the evidence of guilt is thin.united states orena,cir leka,at discussing materiality of evidence with respect to a petition for habeas relief.
the district court found no prejudice because,assuming the very best scenario for the defense,the memo would not have made a whit bit of difference to the jury in their review of the evidence.at.we owe deference to this ruling of a trial judge,but in the end we are not convinced.
we have already adduced the arguments and inferences that the memo could support or reinforce.they bear importantly on the central issue at trial gil defense of authorization.dorfman and lozano testified that gil was not authorized to submit inflated subcontractor invoices.gil,along with walker and assemblyman powell,testified to the contrary and gil and walker testimony referred to a meeting attended by various otb officials at which this agreement was reached.that meeting was therefore critical to the defense.the prosecutor in her closing characterized it as a very important meeting,but emphasized the prosecution view that it never happened 
this is the meeting where gil brings his attorn
