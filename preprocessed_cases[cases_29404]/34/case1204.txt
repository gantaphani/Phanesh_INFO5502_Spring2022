background 
figueroa joined the police force in camden,new jersey,in.in july,he was transferred to a new special operations unit created to target guns,drugs and violence in camden most crime ridden neighborhoods.figueroa was assigned to the fourth platoon with his regular partner,robert bayard,as well as sergeant dan morris,and officers jason stetser and kevin parry.on september,figueroa and bayard were charged in a six count superseding indictment with a series of civil rights violations.in addition to five substantive civil rights violations,they were charged with conspiring with stetser,parry,and morris to deprive others of their civil rights.a three week jury trial began on november.stetser,parry,and morris all testified at trial as cooperating witnesses with plea agreements.other law enforcement officers and citizens who were victims of or witnesses to the activities alleged in the indictment also testified.over the course of trial,the government presented evidence regarding twelve incidents in which figueroa allegedly deprived individuals of their civil rights.there are six specific incidents of misconduct described below that are relevant to figueroa arguments on appeal.
august,figueroa and stetser were conducting surveillance on an drug market and observed sell drugs to when they arrested the participants,stetser found a bundle of crack cocaine and figueroa found a bag filled with money.morris,figueroa,and stetser took some of this money for themselves.after the arrest,cooperated with the officers and gave them information about other activity,but did not.stetser and figueroa attributed to drugs and a gun that were not actually found on him.specifically,they attributed to him drugs that stetser had stashed in a nearby tree,a handgun located in a house that told them about,and the stash of drugs they found in a nearby garage.figueroa wrote the falsified police report about this incident.
september,figueroa,stetser,parry,and morris conducted illegal searches in the winslow court apartment complex based on information from an informant.the officers broke into apartment c,where they found between and,and then searched,without consent or a warrant,apartment g,where they found.when they found no drugs,they confronted their informant who pointed them to a mailbox in the complex,where they found a large stash of cocaine.figueroa wrote the police report,in which he falsely claimed that they had seen someone take drugs out of the mailbox,throw a bag in apartment g and flee through apartment c.the report stated that they had recovered only in cash.
september,figueroa and bayard arrested on the street who then told them that he had a gun at home.the officers then drove to his house,coerced his mother into signing a consent to search form,and found a firearm in a bedroom closet.figueroa police report falsely claimed that he found the firearm in plain view after chasing into the house and arresting him there.figueroa also underreported the amount of money that was seized during the events.
september,figueroa,bayard,stetser,and parry apprehended and angry that and had fought them,figueroa,bayard,stetser,and parry decided to plant drugs on and bayard wrote the false police report about this incident.
april,figueroa,stetser,and parry,based on information from an informant,found in a car and searched the car,expecting to find drugs.they found no drugs in car,but parry found crack cocaine in the gas cap of a vehicle that was parked on the opposite side of the street and several cars away.figueroa falsely stated in the police report that he had seen walking down the street carrying the drugs in his right hand.parry gave the drugs he found in the gas cap to figueroa,and figueroa turned the drugs in as evidence.
august,stetser conducted a warrantless search of a trailer based on a tip that was selling drugs out of it.he found bags of crack cocaine in a compartment on the door of the trailer.figueroa falsely claimed in his police report that he had observed engage in a drug transaction and that had bags of a substance in his right pocket.
on december,the jury returned a guilty verdict against figueroa on count of conspiracy to deprive others of civil rights and on counts and of substantive civil rights violations relating to incidents occurring between september and september.the jury acquitted figueroa of the remaining counts and acquitted bayard on all counts.figueroa filed motions for a judgment of acquittal,or in the alternative,a new trial under federal rules of criminal procedure and on december.the district court denied both motions.he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment on september.this appeal followed.
figueroa challenges both his conviction and sentence on appeal.because the most significant issue in this appeal is the application of the drug distribution sentencing guideline to figueroa civil rights violations,we will deal with that issue first.
application of the drug distribution guideline 
figueroa argues that the district court erred in applying the drug distribution sentencing guideline,to his civil rights violations in this case because he was not convicted of offenses involving the distribution of drugs 
figueroa was convicted of violations of and.the applicable sentencing guideline for these violations is.under a,the base offense level should be the greatest of the enumerated options,including the offense level from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense.a.application note explains that offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense refers to the offense guideline applicable to any conduct established by the conviction that constitutes an offense under federal,state,or local law,application note.where the conduct established by the conviction constitutes more than one underlying offense,the court should look to the underlying offense that carries the highest offense level,application note.additionally,under b,if the defendant was a public official or the offense was committed under color of law,the base offense level should be increased by levels.b.
here,the presentence report,in accordance with,presented an analysis of the conspiracy underlying offenses and offense levels.the presentence report concluded that applying,the drug distribution sentencing guideline,would produce the highest offense level in figueroa case an offense level of once increased by levels as provided in b,figueroa proposed offense level was.at sentencing,the district court adopted this base offense level over figueroa objection.
in using to determine figueroa base offense level,the district court relied heavily on a recent case,united states cortes caban,cir,in which the first circuit court of appeals held that police officers who conspired to plant drugs on individuals to fabricate criminal offenses were properly convicted of conspiracy to possess controlled substances with an intent to distribute in violation of a and the court reasoned that the plain language of a,which deems it unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance,encompassed the police officers conduct.cortes caban,at quoting.a.the court focused on the meaning of distribute in the statute,noting that the controlled substances act defines to distribute as to deliver other than by administering or dispensing a controlled substance or a listed chemical and defines deliver as the actual,constructive,or attempted transfer of a controlled substance or a listed chemical,whether or not there exists an agency relationship.id.at quoting,based on this definition of distribute,that court found that t he defendants acts of transferring drugs amongst each other and to the victims constitutes an intent to distribute the drugs under a,which results in a transfer of possession of a controlled substance,in other words a distribution,and upheld the police officers convictions under a and id.at.
in this case,the district court,upon identifying the distribution of narcotics as an underlying offense based on relevant paragraphs of the superseding indictment,which all allege trafficking in drugs,planting of drugs on individuals,reviewed the evidence from trial regarding four specific instances of drug distribution on august,september,april and august.applying the reasoning of cortes caban,the district court stated the cortes caban defendants act of transferring the drugs amongst each other and to the victims constitutes a distribution.and that what happened in some of these instances here.on that basis,the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that figueroa was involved in distribution of narcotics.because is the offense guideline applicable to the distribution of narcotics,the district court applied here and adopted the proposed offense level of 
we conclude that the district court correctly found that figueroa engaged in distribution of narcotics and therefore its application of was proper in this case.in so holding,we adopt the court interpretation in cortes caban of the meaning of distribute under a.this interpretation comports with the plain language of the statute and its legislative history.under the plain language of the statute,a distribution encompasses the transfer of a controlled substance from one person or place to another and thus the planting of controlled substances on individuals to facilitate false arrests.cortes caban,at.congress made a deliberate choice to use broad language in a,and courts have interpreted distribute broadly in the context of a.id.moreover,the statute carves out specific exceptions for legitimate activities,such as the distribution of drugs by certain registered persons and by law enforcement officers lawfully engaged in the enforcement of controlled substances laws,which supports the application of a to conduct outside those exceptions.id.at citing b,d.
in challenging his sentence,figueroa attempts to rely on judge torruella dissent in cortes caban figueroa reliance on this dissent is misplaced because judge torruella focused on the specific intent required to convict for possession of controlled substances with the intent to distribute.cortes caban,at torruella,dissenting.here,however,the district court did not find that figueroa possessed narcotics with the intent to distribute but rather found that he was involved in the distribution of narcotics,a general intent crime.the specific intent discussion in judge torruella dissent is irrelevant here 
figueroa also argues that,even under the cortes caban interpretation of distribution in,there was no distribution here.figueroa alleges that the only transfer of drugs was from figueroa to the police evidence room and that t he act of turning drugs into the police evidence room simply is not a criminal drug offense.this is an inaccurate characterization of the facts.at sentencing,figueroa counsel suggested that at least one of the incidents involved a planting drugs on an individual or on the scene.he stated t hat except for stetser testimony about the stash in a tree,i believe all of the other incidents are incidents where antonio figueroa or someone with him at the scene took contraband and turned it in.and so,i believe five out of six of the incidents listed in the presentence report do fit into that category.moreover,the district court stated in response,e ven if one does involve the planting of drugs,then figueroa is to be judged under the drug distribution guidelines 
because we conclude that figueroa engaged in the distribution of drugs in committing civil rights violations,the district court properly applied in sentencing him however,we urge that this application of the drug distribution sentencing guideline be strictly limited to civil rights violations in cases like this one where drug distribution constituted an active part of the civil rights violation,and where,as here,the district court specifically finds that the drug distribution was clearly established by the offense of conviction 
challenges to the conviction 
turning to figueroa challenge to his conviction,he raises four arguments the district court erred by admitting the statement of robert bayard,the district court erred by excluding,as cumulative,police reports that figueroa offered into evidence,the district court erred by allowing improper expert opinion testimony from a prosecution fact witness on issues of constitutional law,and the district court erred by refusing to give the jury figueroa requested instruction concerning specific intent.for the reasons that follow,these arguments are unavailing,and we will affirm his conviction.first,figueroa argues that the district court erred by admitting an statement by bayard figueroa challenges the admission of the following testimony by parry regarding bayard statement about figueroa 
q.did you have a conversation with bayard during one of these three nights about the search at spruce street 
q.what was said during that conversation 
bayard was complaining about the report that figueroa had written.he said the report was f up.and he tried talking to figs about the right way to write the report and he did want to listen.
the district court admitted this statement as a statement in furtherance of the conspiracy under federal rule of evidence d e which provides that a statement made by the party coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay.d e.for a statement to be admitted under this rule,the proponent must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the conspiracy existed both the defendant and the declarant were members of the conspiracy and the statement was made in the course of the conspiracy and in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states bobb,cir.the furtherance requirement is usually given a broad interpretation.duka,at 
figueroa argues that bayard statement was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy and therefore the third prong of this test was not met.in response to figueroa motion on this issue,the district court held that the statement was a comment on the inability to instruct a on how to write police reports so that no one got into trouble.we find ample evidence in the record to support the district court conclusion that the writing of false reports was part of the conspiracy and that bayard statement,expressing concern about figueroa inept,was in furtherance of the conspiracy 
second,figueroa argues that the district court erred by excluding,under federal rule of evidence,police reports that figueroa offered into evidence under rule,a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.here,the district court excluded the proffered police reports because the defendants failed to establish that the reports had any probative value beyond the fact that they were false,which the witness had already acknowledged in his testimony.on that basis,the district court concluded that giving these reports to the jury would just wast e time.we conclude that there was no error in the district court exclusion of these reports.
third,figueroa argues that the district court erred by allowing improper expert opinio
