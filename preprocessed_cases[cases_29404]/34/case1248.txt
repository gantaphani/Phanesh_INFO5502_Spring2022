opinion of the court 
the government appeals from the order of the district court dismissing the indictment against melissa huet huet with prejudice.huet was charged with aiding and abetting possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g and.the district court dismissed the indictment on the basis that it failed to state an offense for aiding and abetting under g and and even if it did state an offense,the charge violated huet rights under the second amendment of the constitution.for the reasons set forth below,we will reverse and remand.
on june,a federal grand jury sitting in the western district of pennsylvania returned a indictment against huet and her paramour,marvin hall hall.counts one and two,respectively,charged hall with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g,and transfer of unregistered firearms,in violation of e.count three count three or the indictment charged huet with knowingly aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g and a.on january,hall pled guilty to count one,and was sentenced to time served.on november,the district court issued an order dismissing count three with prejudice.the government filed a timely notice of appeal.
the allegations in the indictment stem from an undercover fbi investigation into the activities of morgan jones jones in clarion county,pennsylvania.the investigation focused on attempts to purchase illegal firearms and explosive devices for criminal activities,as well as the potential manufacturing and detonation of explosive devices.during their probe,fbi agents met hall and huet,who lived together.over the next nine months,agents gathered evidence allegedly connecting hall and huet to various criminal activities,and on june,a valid search warrant the search warrant was executed on the couple clarion county home.agents seized an sks,interordnance rifle sks rifle from an upstairs bedroom.
although huet is legally permitted to possess a firearm,hall was convicted in of possessing an unregistered firearm,in violation of d,and is therefore prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm.after being informed of the raid,huet allegedly told investigators that the guns in the house belonged to her and that it was not illegal for her to purchase weapons.despite huet assertions that she alone possessed the sks rifle,the government sought and obtained an indictment charging hall with illegal possession of the weapon,and huet with aiding and abetting hall possession.
huet moved to dismiss count three pursuant to rule b b of the federal rules of criminal on the basis that the indictment failed to state an offense under g and.count three states 
from on or about august,to on or about january,in the western district of pennsylvania,the defendant,melissa huet,knowingly and unlawfully aided and abetted the possession of a firearm,that is an sks assault rifle,in and affecting interstate commerce,by marvin hall,who had previously been convicted on or about march,in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania of the crime of possession of unregistered firearms,an offense which is punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year.in violation of title,united states code,sections g and.
in granting huet rule motion,the district court stated that notably absent from the indictment were any facts setting forth how defendant huet aided and abetted defendant hall in his unlawful possession of the sks rifle.united states huet,wl,at.the district court did not limit its inquiry to the four corners of the indictment,however,and examined additional information to discern the government theory of the case.the district court looked to materials produced pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,as well as record evidence from hall case.specifically,the court relied upon statements set forth in the affidavit of probable cause supporting the search warrant and remarks made by the prosecutor during hall guilty plea hearing concluding that this evidence failed to establish any connection between huet actions and hall possession,the district court granted huet rule motion to dismiss for failure to state an offense under g and.huet,wl,at.
the district court view of the government theory of the case similarly guided its approach to huet second amendment challenge.huet argued that even if count three did state an offense for aiding and abetting a felon in possession,under the factual scenario presented in this case,the charge violated her rights under the second amendment.the district court agreed,finding that to permit the indictment to go forward would be to countenanc e the total elimination of the right of a sane,citizen to possess a firearm,in her home,simply because her paramour is a felon.id.at.t o punish huet,who has not been convicted of a felony as a principal,violates the core of the second amendment right to keep arms,the court opined,because the conduct alleged to have aided and abetted was purely possessory.id.at see id.at characterizing government case as an attempt to compound an inchoate offense upon another inchoate offense.although the district court did not explicitly designate the second amendment violation as an alternative basis for dismissal,it clearly viewed it as such.accordingly,we must address both the sufficiency of the indictment and the second amendment challenge.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the district court order dismissing the indictment under.w hen reviewing a motion to dismiss an indictment,our standard of review is mixed.united states shenandoah,cir citations omitted.we exercise plenary review over the district court legal conclusions and review any challenges to its factual findings for clear error.id.here,the primary question is not whether the district court findings of fact were erroneous,but whether the district court was entitled to find and weigh facts at all.this is a legal question,over which we exercise plenary review.id.we also exercise plenary review over a constitutional challenge to the application of a statute.united states marzzarella,cir citing united states fullmer,cir.
we first address the government contention that the district court erred in concluding that,under federal rule of criminal procedure b b,count three failed to state an offense for aiding and abetting a felon in possession of a firearm under g and.
federal rule of criminal procedure c requires only that an indictment be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.t he federal rules were designed to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleadings and are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure.united states resendiz ponce,d quoting united states debrow.although detailed allegations may have been required under a common law pleading regime,they surely are not contemplated by the federal rules.id.
it is that a n indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.united states vitillo,cir quoting costello united states.we have held that an indictment is facially sufficient if it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged,sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,and allows the defendant to show with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution.id.at citation omitted.n o greater specificity than the statutory language is required so long as there is sufficient factual orientation to permit a defendant to prepare his defense and invoke double jeopardy.united states kemp,cir quoting united states rankin.cir.generally,an indictment will satisfy these requirements where it informs the defendant of the statute he is charged with violating,lists the elements of a violation under the statute,and specifies the time period during which the violations occurred.united states urban,cir see also united states mccarty,cir finding indictment under g sufficient where it tracked the statutory language,stated the date and place of the alleged possession,and specifically identified the type of firearm involved.in contrast,if an indictment fails to charge an essential element of the crime,it fails to state an offense.united states wander,cir.
in determining whether an indictment validly states the elements of the offense,we need not blindly accept a recitation in general terms of the elements of the offense.united states panarella,cir.federal rule of criminal procedure b b allows a district court to review the sufficiency of the government pleadings to ensur e that legally deficient charges do not go to a jury.united states bergrin,cir.although the government is not required to set forth its entire case in the indictment,if the specific facts that are alleged fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation,the indictment fails to state an offense.panarella,at see united states schiff,cir finding that indictment alleging failure to rectify misstatements of others did not,as a matter of statutory interpretation,state an offense under b and sec rule.however,the scope of a district court review at the rule stage is limited.a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment is not a permissible vehicle for addressing the sufficiency of the government evidence.united states delaurentis,cir citations omitted.the government is entitled to marshal and present its evidence at trial,and have its sufficiency tested by a motion for acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.id.at.there is no criminal corollary to the civil summary judgment mechanism.id.in evaluating a rule motion to dismiss,a district court must accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the indictment.united states sampson,d united states besmajian,cir.evidentiary questions such as credibility determinations and the weighing of proof should not be determined at this stage.bergrin,at internal marks and citation omitted.thus,a district court review of the facts set forth in the indictment is limited to determining whether,assuming all of those facts as true,a jury could find that the defendant committed the offense for which he was charged.panarella,at delaurentis,at.
to survive huet motion to dismiss,the government was required to adequately set forth the elements of aiding and abetting a felon in possession under g and.to establish a violation of,the government must prove that the substantive crime has been committed and that the defendant charged with aiding and abetting knew of the commission of the substantive offense and acted with intent to facilitate it.united states petersen,cir citation omitted.section g,the statute setting forth the substantive offense,requires proof that the defendant has been convicted of a crime of imprisonment for a term in excess of one year the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm and the firearm traveled in interstate commerce.united states higdon,cir.because g is not a specific intent statute,an individual can be convicted as an aider and abettor under g and if she knew or had reason to know that she was aiding and abetting possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.see united states xavier,cir.thus,a valid indictment under g based on an aiding and abetting theory must allege that the principal,who had been convicted of a crime carrying a term of imprisonment in excess of one year,knowingly possessed a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce,higdon,at,and the defendant knew or had reason to know that the principal was prohibited from possessing a firearm,xavier,at,and rendered actual aid or assistance to the principal in possessing the firearm,united states nolan,cir.
in this case,we conclude that the indictment adequately set forth the required elements under g and,with sufficient factual orientation to allow huet to prepare her defense and invoke double jeopardy.see kemp,at.count three lists all required elements of the offense.it alleges that hall,the principal,had previously been convicted for possession of unregistered firearms,an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment in excess of one year,and that he knowingly possessed a firearm the sks rifle which had traveled in interstate commerce,see higdon,at and huet knowingly aided and abetted hall possession of that firearm,see petersen,at xavier,at.count three also includes the required factual orientation it specifies the time period during which the violation occurred on or about august,to on or about january,see urban,at,and identifies the specific weapon involved,see mccarty,at.no more was required to allow huet to prepare her defense and invoke double jeopardy.see kemp,at.accordingly,we will reverse the order of the district court granting huet rule b b motion to dismiss for failure to state an offense 
we recognize that the district court may have adopted the novel procedure followed here to truncate what it perceived as an incurably weak government case.however,in doing so,the district court committed two errors it impermissibly expanded the scope of its review at the rule stage and evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence and it required the government to meet a heightened pleading standard.we will discuss each of these issues in turn.
first,although the district court purported to make a purely legal determination based on undisputed facts,huet,wl,at,the language of its memorandum opinion makes clear that it engaged in factfinding and determined that,based on those facts,the government would not be able to prove its case.the district court speculated as to the evidence the government would introduce at trial,and concluded that such evidence did nothing to advance the cause that defendant huet knew,or had reason to know that defendant hall was a felon in possession and that her owning a weapon somehow aided or abetted him in his unlawful possession of the sks rifle.id.at.by doing this,the district court failed to adhere to the fundamental principle that in reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment,a court must accept as true all of the facts alleged.panarella,at see united states gallagher,cir.evidentiary questions such as the weighing of proof should not be determined at the motion to dismiss stage.bergrin,at citation omitted.
unlike other cases in which we have affirmed a district court dismissal of an indictment as insufficient,huet case does not involve a question of whether the facts alleged in the indictment fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute as a matter of statutory interpretation.see panarella,at see also schiff,at,holding that failure to rectify the misstatements of others does not state an offense under federal securities laws and thus the government could not proceed on such a theory gov t of the virgin islands greenidge,cir finding indictment for assault with intent to commit rape under insufficient where the facts alleged showed that the person the defendant assaulted was not the same person he attempted to rape rather,the district court determination that the indictment failed to state an offense was based solely on its assessment of the strength of the government case.
moreover,although we have left open the possibility that,in limited circumstances,a district court may be able to address the sufficiency of the government evidence in a pretrial motion to dismiss,this case does not present such a scenario.see delaurentis,at acknowledging that district courts may be able to address sufficiency of the evidence if there is a stipulated record or if immunity issues are implicated the district court erred in concluding that the facts here are undisputed.the government maintains that it will introduce testimony to prove the elements of aiding and abetting.at no point during the proceedings before the district court did the government concede that the facts were undisputed or were complete.in its reply to huet motion to dismiss,the government explicitly stated that it was prepared to present testimony at trial that would establish that huet aided and abetted hall possession.the government maintains this position on appeal.thus,the district court finding that the government lacked evidence beyond mere possession was premature 
second,the district court erred to the extent that it imposed a heightened pleading standard for offenses under g and.the district court dismissed count three based on its determination that t he facts in the indictment fail ed to set forth any allegations to support the conclusion that huet aided and abetted hall in his unlawful possession of the sks rifle.huet,wl,at.the district court faulted the government for failing to include any specifics as to how huet aided hall,and determined that the government simply charge d its conclusion.id.at.although some offenses must be pled with greater specificity than the plain,concise,and definite written statement contemplated by rule c,we have never held aiding and abetting a felon in possession under g and to be such an offense,and we decline to do so now.
in arguing for a heightened pleading standard,huet attempts to distinguish the supreme court decision in united states resendiz ponce,d.in that case,the issue was whether an indictment alleging attempted illegal reentry into the united states under a had to allege a specific overt act.id.at.the court held that the government did not have to include such an allegation because the use of the word attempt,coupled with the specification of the time and place of the defendant attempted reentry,was sufficient to put the defendant on notice of the charges against him.id.at.the court distinguished the heightened pleading requirements under,which makes it illegal for a witness summoned before a congressional committee to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry.id.at.because the relevant hearing subject is frequently uncertain but invariably central to every prosecution under the statute,the court explained that an indictment under must go beyond the language of the statute and allege the subject of the congressional hearing in order to determine whether the defendant refusal was pertinent.id.citing russell united states,d.in contrast,because the term attempt,as used in common parlance,connotes action and intent,it was deemed unnecessary to specify an overt act in an indictment under a.id.at.huet argues that because a single affirmative act may establish an aider and abettor culpability,a concise statement as to the means manner the sic used to facilitate the offense is required.we find huet attempt to distinguish aid and abet from attempt unpersuasive.like the term attempt,the terms aid and abet,as used in common parlance,sufficiently connote action and intent.see resendiz ponce,at.thus,unlike,no more than the elements of the statute and the time and place of the alleged violation are required to inform the defendant of the charge against which she must defend and enable her to invoke double jeopardy.see kemp,at.
moreover,the district court suggestion that abuelhawa united states,d,altered the pleading requirements for offenses involving accomplice liability is a mischaracterization of the supreme court holding in that case.in abuelhawa,the court held that making a misdemeanor drug purchase over the telephone does not constitute facilitation of drug distribution under b.id.at.nowhere in the abuelhawa opinion did the court address the pleading requirements under federal rule of criminal procedure.nor did the decision modify the law of accomplice liability under.the elements of aiding and abetting under remain the same.the abuelhawa court simply addressed a narrow question regarding the scope of the term facilitate under b.at.we decline to extend its holding any further.
we turn now to huet second amendment challenge.the second amendment provides a well regulated militia,being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms,shall not be infringed.const.amend.ii.in district of columbia heller,d,the supreme court held for the first time that the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms the right,however,is not unlimited.id.the second amendment does not guarantee a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.id.at.the court cautioned that,nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.id.at.laws prohibiting the possession of dangerous and unusual weapons were left similarly intact.id.at.the court made clear that it was identify ing these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples the list was not intended to be exhaustive id.at.
applying these principles,the court invalidated a district of columbia law that completely banned handgun possession in the home and required any lawful firearm to be kept disassembled and bound by a trigger lock at all times,rendering it inoperable.id.at.the court explained that the inherent right of is central to the second amendment,and the challenged law impermissibly extended to the home,where the need for defense of self,family,and property is most acute.id.at.although the court did not decide on a level of scrutiny to be applied in cases involving second amendment challenges,it rejected rational basis review.id.at.the court explained that the second amendment elevates above all other interests the right of,responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.id.at.
in united states marzzarella,we articulated a analysis for second amendment claims under heller 
first,we ask whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the second amendment guarantee if it does not,our inquiry is complete.if it does,we evaluate the law under some form of scrutiny.if the law passes muster under that standard,it is constitutional.if it fails,it is invalid.
cir internal citations omitted.
under the marzzarella framework,the presumptively lawful regulatory measures identified by the supreme court in heller carry the presumption of validity because they regulate conduct falling outside the scope of the second amendment guarantee.united states barton,cir citing marzzarella,at explaining that this is a better reading of heller than one that would require presumptively lawful regulations to satisfy every level of constitutional scrutiny.in other words,the longstanding limitations mentioned by the court in heller are exceptions to the right to bear arms.marzzarella,at.
the constitutional question here is presented in an unusual way due to the procedural posture of the case.the district court characterization of huet challenge as an attack is somewhat misleading.in contrast to a facial attack,an challenge does not contend that a law is unconstitutional as written but that its application to a particular person under particular circumstances deprived that person of a constitutional right.united states marcavage,cir citation omitted.however,because we do not have the benefit of a fully developed evidentiary record,the particular circumstances of this case remain unclear.as in its analysis regarding the sufficiency of the indictment,the district court error on the constitutional issue stems from its failure to accept as true the allegations in the indictment.because,as we explained above,the charges against huet were properly brought under federal rules of criminal procedure and,in assessing huet constitutional challenge on appeal,we are limited to determining whether,based on the allegations in the indictment and only the allegations in the indictment her second amendment rights have been violated.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that a charge properly brought under g and does not violate the second amendment.
huet argues that based on the circumstances of her case,she can not constitutionally be charged with aiding and abetting a felon to possess a firearm.specifically,she contends that the government only evidence is that she possessed the sks rifle in her home while living with a convicted felon.
