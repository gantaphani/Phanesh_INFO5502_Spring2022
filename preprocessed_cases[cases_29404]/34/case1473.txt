opinion of the court 
appellant alfonzo coward was convicted for violating g,possession of a firearm by a felon.his appeal raises two issues whether the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the ground that the government failed to present at the suppression hearing essential evidence of reasonable suspicion to justify the stop of coward vehicle,and whether g is a constitutional exercise of congress commerce clause powers.this court recently decided the latter issue in united states singletary,cir,which is controlling on this panel.we concentrate on the first issue.
background 
at the pretrial suppression hearing,philadelphia police lieutenant michael chitwood testified that on the evening of september,he and his partner,terrence sweeney,were patrolling the area around and walnut streets.shortly before,a call was broadcast over the police radio requesting the stop of a green subaru with the license plate bms,driven by an male.the call did not state the reasons for the requested stop.
almost immediately after hearing this call,officers chitwood and sweeney saw the vehicle and pulled it over.chitwood testified that prior to approaching the vehicle,he saw the driver reach for the glove compartment and duck down under the passenger seat before returning to an upright position.when the officers approached the car,the driver,later identified as coward,stated,it not mine.app.at.chitwood then observed a weapon on the floor of the passenger side 
chitwood testimony was the only evidence offered by the government at the suppression hearing to support the legality of the stop.the government did not present the testimony of the officer who requested the stop by radio nor any evidence demonstrating the reason for the request to stop coward vehicle.
the defense argued that all evidence arising out of the stop of coward vehicle should be suppressed for lack of reasonable suspicion to justify the stop.in response,the government argued that it was a lawful stop b ased on the radio call.app.at.the government argued that the fellow officer rule kind of imputes the knowledge of the transmitting officer to the receiving officer,whether it is actually transmitted or not.app.at.the government advised the district court both in its memorandum and at the oral argument that there was authority in the ninth circuit decision in united states robinson,cir,that e ffective law enforcement can not be conducted unless police officers can act on directions and information transmitted by one officer to another and that officers who must often act swiftly,can not be expected to fellow officers about the foundation for the transmitted information.app.at quoting robinson,at 
following the arguments of the government and counsel for coward,the district court at the pretrial hearing on january,denied the motion to suppress,noting that it was sufficient that chitwood reasonably relied on the radio request.app.at stating that chitwood testimony demonstrated ample reasonable suspicion,indeed fear,on the part of chitwood that led to the search.in an amendment to the order to suppress filed the same day,the district court added that the burden was on the defendant to show that there was no reasonable suspicion behind the police radio request.the court stated 
the question then becomes who has the burden of showing that there was no reasonable suspicion behind the police radio request.it seems to us that the government,having prima facie shown the reasonableness of sergeant chitwood behavior,should not have to take on the added burden of looking behind the request from police radio.since the defendant has as much access to this proof as the government,it seems to us not excessive to place the burden of such proof upon the party claiming that the radio dispatch was illegitimate.as there is not a scintilla of evidence in this record regarding such illegitimacy,we will not infer it retrospectively absent some basis for doing so.
app.at.on february,the defense moved to reconsider that order and on march,the district court denied that motion reiterating the reasons given in the january,order.app.at.
thereafter,evidence derived from the stop of coward vehicle was admitted at the jury trial.on june,coward was found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce in violation of g and was sentenced to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.coward moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c on the commerce clause issue.the district court denied his motion.united states coward,d.this is the direct appeal of that judgment pursuant to.

proof of reasonable suspicion 
the government concedes,as it must,that it did not meet its burden of proof in establishing that the stop of coward car was based on reasonable suspicion.br.of government at.the government further acknowledges that the district court incorrectly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant on this issue.
under the applicable law,the government was required to present evidence at the suppression hearing of the requesting police officer reasonable suspicion.in whiteley warden,d,the supreme court held that although a police officer may rely on the representations of other officers when making an arrest,the officers requesting assistance must have sufficient information to show probable cause.id.at.a n otherwise illegal arrest can not be insulated from challenge by the decision of the instigating officer to rely on fellow officers to make the arrest.
the supreme court reached a similar result in united states hensley,d.in that case,the supreme court stated 
w hen evidence is uncovered during a search incident to an arrest in reliance merely on a flyer or bulletin,its admissibility turns on whether the officers who issued the flyer possessed probable cause to make the arrest.it does not turn on whether those relying on the flyer were themselves aware of the specific facts which led their colleagues to seek their assistance.
id.at.emphasis in original.hensley makes clear that if a flyer or bulletin was issued without reasonable suspicion,the stop made in the objective reliance upon it violates the fourth amendment.id.at.assuming the police made a terry ohio,d stop in objective reliance on a flyer or bulletin,we hold that the evidence uncovered in the course of the stop is admissible if the police who issued the flyer or bulletin possessed a reasonable suspicion justifying a stop.id.at.emphasis in original.our court reached the same conclusion in berg county of allegheny,cir,where we concluded that an arrest violated the fourth amendment because the government officials who issued the arrest warrant,which was later executed by another police officer,did not have probable cause.therefore,the law at the time of the suppression hearing on coward motion was clear that a finding of reasonable suspicion to justify the stop required the presentation of evidence by the government that the officer who issued the radio bulletin had reasonable suspicion,not simply that it was reasonable for the arresting officer to have relied on the bulletin.the government presented no such evidence.
in addition,the district court erred in holding the burden was on the defense to prove reasonable suspicion.once a defendant has challenged the admissibility of such evidence,the government must bear the burden of proving the existence of reasonable suspicion.see florida royer,d stating that government has burden of proving seizure was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure united states johnson,cir once the defendant has established a basis for his motion the burden shifts to the government to show that the search or seizure was reasonable.
the parties do not dispute that the evidence offered in the district court was insufficient or that the burden of proving reasonable suspicion should
