gabriel lemmerer appeals from his conviction for importation of cocaine and conspiracy to import cocaine.he argues,first,that the government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.second,he contends that the district court responded inadequately to a problem with one of the jurors,resulting in a violation of lemmerer rights under the sixth amendment and the federal rules of criminal procedure.finding no merit in his claims,we affirm.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,the jury could have found the following facts.see united states nguyen,cir.at approximately on march,lemmerer flew into logan airport on a charter flight from aruba.he carried with him two pieces of luggage,and had checked two others a small green bag,and a larger,black suitcase.an austrian citizen,lemmerer first proceeded through the immigration check point.he then retrieved his green bag and black suitcase from the baggage carousel and began to walk out of the airport.he quickly was stopped,however,by a united states customs service inspector who found lemmerer jacket and long pants suspicious amid the shorts and worn by his fellow passengers.
lemmerer gave the inspector his austrian passport and a customs declaration filled out in german,which indicated that he planned to spend three days at the hampton inn in lawrence,massachusetts.he then was taken to an inspection area.after searching his other bags,customs inspectors asked lemmerer for the combination to the black suitcase.the combination lemmerer provided did not work,but the inspectors were able to open the suitcase using the combination ooo.inside,they found women clothing and scattered pieces of carbon paper,and,hidden at the bottom,five packets containing almost five kilograms of cocaine.lemmerer was placed under arrest.
the black suitcase had no name tag or luggage claim ticket attached to it,and lemmerer denied that it was his.however,a search revealed that lemmerer had a claim ticket in his pants pocket indicating that he had checked two bags.the search of lemmerer luggage also revealed a hotel invoice for a previous reservation at the hampton inn,with the confirmation number.the inspectors also found a separate piece of paper with the name johannes trueber and the same confirmation number written on it.
subsequent investigation disclosed that lemmerer and trueber,both austrian citizens residing in the dominican republic,had been traveling together since late january.their journey began on january,when the two men flew together from the dominican republic to boston,massachusetts.a man named ramirez met them at the airport,and they stayed with him for the next five days in an attic apartment at crescent street in lawrence,massachusetts.lemmerer and trueber then took separate flights to aruba,where they spent the next three weeks in a shared hotel room.the two men returned to lawrence in late february,again flying separately.this time,instead of returning to the crescent street apartment,lemmerer booked a room at the hampton inn,and trueber joined him there the next day.shortly after their arrival,they made plans to return to aruba the following week.again,lemmerer and trueber flew on separate flights,but upon arrival stayed together in the same small hotel room.they remained in aruba until march,when they boarded separate flights back to boston.
trueber arrived at logan at approximately the same time as lemmerer on the evening of march,and checked into the tage inn in lawrence.from there,he placed several calls to the hampton inn,asking for lemmerer.employees at the hampton inn first informed him that lemmerer had not arrived yet,and the advice of customs forwarding trueber calls to a vacant room.rather than leave a message,however,trueber went to the hampton inn himself,where he learned that lemmerer had not,in fact,checked in.trueber left,returned with his luggage,and checked into a separate room.he later was arrested there.
in april,lemmerer and trueber were indicted on one count of conspiring to import cocaine into the united states in violation of,and one count of importation of cocaine in violation of and a.roughly three months later,a superceding indictment was returned adding a third defendant,fidencio jimenez,on the same two counts.the superceding indictment charged that the conspiracy began on an unknown date but at least by on or about january,and continuing to on or about march.
the district court severed lemmerer case from that of his codefendants,and lemmerer was tried first.his defense strategy was fairly simple.the prosecution evidence made clear that trueber was the driving force behind the drug smuggling scheme,which likely had been in place well before lemmerer became involved.while the government hoped to show that trueber had recruited lemmerer as a courier,lemmerer maintained that he had been tricked into acting as an unwitting pawn in trueber master plan.thus,his defense hinged on the theory that sophisticated,experienced drug taken advantage of the older lemmerer,who was years old when the two men met,and whose failing health,poor eyesight,and inability to speak either spanish or english made him an easy target.
lemmerer first trial ended in a hung jury,and he was retried in december.after an trial and roughly two days of deliberation,the jury found him guilty on both counts of the superceding indictment.the district court sentenced him to months in prison.this appeal followed.
as noted,lemmerer offers two grounds for vacating his conviction.he argues,first,that the government unduly delayed the disclosure of material evidence favorable to his defense and second,that the judge allegedly improper handling of a difficult juror rendered the verdict invalid.we address his claims in turn,explaining the facts relevant to each.
delayed disclosure of material evidence 
lemmerer claims that the government committed a brady violation by failing to disclose promptly certain western union records.the supreme court held in brady that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.lemmerer claim is based on the extension of that rule prohibiting unwarranted delays in the disclosure of material evidence.see,united states ingraldi,cir recognizing that delayed disclosure requires reversal where delay prejudiced defense.
factual background 
after its in lemmerer first trial,the prosecution sought to bolster the case against him with western union records showing a series of wire transfers between various individuals allegedly connected to the drug smuggling scheme.some of those records indicated that,during their first stay in aruba,both lemmerer and trueber had received money sent from men claiming to live at the crescent street address in lawrence.other records,though not tied directly to lemmerer,helped support the government theory that the money wired back and forth some of which lemmerer received was used to buy the cocaine.
prior to lemmerer second trial,his trial counsel attempted to exclude those western union records as irrelevant,but the district court concluded that they easily satisfied the minimal requirements of relevance.defense counsel then requested permission to introduce other western union documents of the same nature involving transactions that predated the alleged conspiracy between lemmerer and trueber.although the relevance of the earlier records was less clear,defense counsel argued that they should be admitted for the sake of completeness.the government did not argue to the contrary,and the district court granted defense counsel request.
consistent with those pretrial rulings,the government introduced on the third and fourth days of the trial western union transfer records showing that on february and,while trueber and lemmerer were in aruba on their first visit,trueber received money wired from lawrence,massachusetts.the senders identified themselves as luis sanchez and luis cancel,respectively,and each listed crescent street as his address.according to another batch of records,both trueber and lemmerer had been wired money on february lemmerer from the same luis sanchez,and trueber from a man in colombia named jose danilo rodriguez.a final record indicated that,on february,rodriguez also had wired money to lemmerer alleged fidencio jimenez,who then was in venezuela.
defense counsel introduced other records that showed trueber following a similar pattern in the year prior to the events involving lemmerer.those records indicated that luis cancel had wired money to trueber in aruba on october and.defense counsel also introduced an irs currency transaction report recording a transaction in november,between jimenez and trueber.according to that report,trueber address was crescent street,lawrence,massachusetts.
in addition to the wire transfer records,the government also introduced on the fourth day of trial two and signed western union transfer forms that it had obtained pursuant to the mutual legal assistance treaty between the united states and aruba.such forms must be completed by the recipient of a wire transfer,and these apparently had been filled out and endorsed by lemmerer and trueber in connection with the transfers they each received on february.as the government later explained,it had received the transfer forms after the trial had begun,and,therefore,they were not turned over to the defense prior to trial and were not addressed in the conference regarding the other western union records.
upon inspecting the forms,defense counsel noticed that both appeared to have been completed if not signed by the same person,presumably trueber.such a finding would support lemmerer claim that trueber had arranged for the money to be wired in lemmerer name,but that it was not truly intended for him.accordingly,counsel set about trying to obtain similar transfer forms for the other wire transactions in october,and february,hoping to get more examples of trueber handwriting.western union,however,refused to give her the forms,referring her instead to the government subpoena.convinced that the government already had the documents she sought,defense counsel filed a motion to compel discovery and for a continuance on the sixth day of trial.
the government denied having the transfer forms.indeed,the prosecutor stated unequivocally that every document that we received from western union we have turned over to defense counsel.in response to prodding from the district court,the prosecutor confirmed that the government had requested and disclosed to the defense all documents relating to trueber and lemmerer,without limit of time.satisfied that defense counsel had seen everything the government has,the court refused to grant a continuance,but nevertheless agreed to enter an order directed at western union compelling the production of the documents.
that evening,attorneys for the prosecution faxed defense counsel three new western union records involving wire transfers to and from trueber in.specifically,the records showed a wire transfer on september,from raphaela rosario in lawrence,massachusetts,to trueber in aruba a wire transfer on october,from juan albert rodriguez in lawrence,massachusetts,to trueber in aruba and a wire transfer on november,from trueber in boston,massachusetts,to karl brandstatter in aruba.
during a sidebar conference the next day the seventh,and,day of trial,the prosecutor explained that,after receiving the initial batch of documents which had been turned over to defense counsel,the government received another traunch sic of documents that related only to trueber,and those documents were not within the period of the conspiracy,but were from in fact,and we put those in a separate file an stashed them away for trueber trial.after the conference the previous day,he continued,government attorneys had their files to confirm that they had given defense counsel all the western union materials.on the suggestion of one of the customs agents,they checked the separate file for trueber trial,and there found the three additional records at issue.those records,the prosecutor pointed out,were not responsive to the motion to compel discovery,they relate to transactions and they do not include any handwritten receiver documents.
unsatisfied by that explanation,defense counsel argued that,in light of the previous trial,the prosecution was well aware of the defense in this case.accordingly,it was disingenuous for the government to stand before the court and say that they had a separate,independent parallel investigation going on into trueber in an effort to keep documents that potentially could exonerate lemmerer from the defense.defense counsel explained that the records 
show that trueber had a plan in effect years before lemmerer met trueber.therefore,to the extent lemmerer signature is on that western union form it clearly exonerates him because his signature is only on one form and trueber has been engaged in at least eight,now eight,which i did know prior to yesterday,transactions with western union.
therefore,she concluded,the government refusal to disclose the records to the defense was error under brady.as a remedy,defense counsel requested that all western union documents be excluded from the trial.given that both the defense and the prosecution already had introduced several such documents,defense counsel proposed remedy would have entailed striking evidence previously admitted and published to the jury.the district court denied the motion,explaining,i do think these are brady material.i think the government has made the disclosures which are required under the rules.
defense counsel introduced the three records into evidence the next day the last day of the trial in her closing argument,she incorporated the records into the general theme of lemmerer defense that he had been used by trueber,the experienced drug smuggler.lemmerer age and other physical limitations,defense counsel told the jury,make him vulnerable to being used by someone younger,more sophisticated,and definitely more versed in traveling from the dominican to the united states to aruba and having wire transfers sent back and forth.of the two men,she continued,it was trueber who had a preexisting connection to lawrence,as evidenced by the financial documents going back as far as.defense counsel also urged the jury to look at the documents concerning johannes trueber.look at the money he spends.finally,she used the records involving transfers to and from trueber to remove the sting from the february,wire transfer to lemmerer,explaining that johannes trueber needed lemmerer on this day because it the only day that there are two transactions.the only day.
on appeal,lemmerer argues that the government failure to disclose immediately the western union records violated his rights under brady.in analyzing that claim,we will assume,arguendo,that the western union records fall within the category of evidence to which brady applies.on that assumption,the government was obligated to disclose them promptly if they were both favorable to lemmerer defense,and material.at.evidence is material for brady purposes if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d quoting united states bagley,d blackmun.in determining whether the evidence at issue satisfies the materiality standard,t he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.strickler greene,d see also bagley,at.explaining that prosecutor is obligated to disclose evidence that,if suppressed,would deprive the defendant of a fair trial.
the same standard applies when the claim is one of delayed disclosure rather than complete suppression.however,in delayed disclosure cases,we need not reach the question whether the evidence at issue was material under brady unless the defendant first can show that defense counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant case.ingraldi,at.the principal concern in such cases is whether the failure to supply the information in a seasonable fashion caused the defense to change its trial strategy.united states josleyn,cir.thus,the defendant must show that learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy,and that,given timeous disclosure,a more effective strategy would likely have resulted.united states devin,cir.he can not rely on wholly conclusory assertions but must bear the burden of producing,at the very least,a prima facie showing of a plausible strategic option which the delay foreclosed.id.
lemmerer has not satisfied that threshold burden.indeed,he does not even attempt to explain how the government failure to disclose promptly the records altered his defense strategy.instead,he argues that defense counsel would have had documentary evidence that trueber had a drug smuggling operation in place years before he met lemmerer if the government had disclosed the evidence more promptly.given lemmerer innocent dupe defense,the argument goes,the more evidence admitted concerning the expertise,experience and success of johannes in smuggling drugs the more lemmerer chances for acquittal improve.
the difficulty with that argument is that the records were admitted into evidence,and defense counsel incorporated them ably into lemmerer existing defense.lemmerer counsel emphasized in her opening statement that lemmerer had been an unwitting pawn in trueber scheme.she pressed that defense theory as the trial progressed,supplementing it when possible with documentary evidence that trueber had engaged in similar activity in previous years.the records fit neatly into that strategy.accordingly,after introducing them on the last day of trial,defense counsel used the records in her closing argument to support the theory that trueber was a sophisticated and experienced drug smuggler who duped lemmerer into participating in his scheme.
in short,nothing in the record indicates that the government delay in disclosing the records foreclosed a plausible strategic option,devin,at,or prevented defense counsel from using them effectively,see ingraldi,at.therefore,even assuming that the western union records qualified as brady material,the government failure to disclose them promptly did not violate the strictures of brady.
jury issues 
lemmerer maintains that a new trial is required because the district court responded inadequately to a juror request to be excused from the ongoing deliberations.that error,he argues,resulted in a violation of his rights under the constitution and the federal rules of criminal procedure.
factual background 
the relevant facts are as follows.on the morning of the second day of,december jury sent out a note asking for a transcript of lemmerer testimony.the judge informed them that the transcript was not ready at that time,and likely would not be complete until early the next week.accordingly,he instructed them to continue their deliberations based on their own recollections and notes.
at approximately the same day,the judge received a second note,this time from juror.the note read 
i am asking to be excuse sic from this jury as soon as possible.juror signature.if not i am leaving.
the judge met promptly with lemmerer,his counsel,and the prosecutor,and proposed to tell the jury to suspend its deliberations for lunch so that he could meet with juror.he explained further what he planned to do 
i will start out by telling her that she is not to tell me anything at all,anything,about what is going on in that room.but in fairness i need to know whether something else is bothering her.and we see what she says.if i am satisfied that what is bothering her is from within that room and not something else entirely,then i conceive it my duty to tell her that she can not be excused,she is to go back into that room,and end on that.
after a brief colloquy with the prosecutor,the judge reiterated that if it appeared that juror simply was uncomfortable because she found herself disagreeing with the other jurors,he would require her to return and deliberate,but with no suggestion that she has to agree.defense counsel told him,w hat you propose is fine.
the judge then met with juror,with counsel present.as promised,he began by telling her that he did not want her to tell him what was going on in the jury room.he then asked whether something was making her uncomfortable,and,if so,whether it was related to the case.juror said that,i t has something to do with this case and it my service as a juror.the judge therefore instructed her to return to the jury room and continue her deliberations,repeating his earlier statement to counsel that he could not excuse a juror from service simply because she was uncomfortable about whatever is going on in the jury room.
juror refused,however,saying,no.no.no.i not going back.the judge admonished her 
well,that is your duty.you must go back.and you must continue to deliberate with the other jurors.i do not for a moment suggest that you surrender or alter any view or anything you may have said or thought about the case,that for you to decide,for you to consider,but you are chosen as a juror,as one of the judges in this case.
still,juror did not relent.instead,she stated that i f i go back i not going to say anything.i not even going to put forth a verdict or anything.i do want anything to do with this.the judge reminded her again of her duty as a juror,explaining,y ou chosen to be a juror in this case.and a verdict in a case must be unanimous.so i can not tell you how to deliberate or what to do.and i not.you do what you think is just and fair in this case,and what you decide is just and fair and fine.juror continued to insist that she would not go back,adding that if there was a penalty,she would be willing to pay the fine.there no fine,the judge told her.there no fine.it your duty.so you must go back.so,go back,have lunch,and then continue your deliberations.that the order of the court.
the clerk escorted juror back to the jury room,and the judge turned to counsel,seeking their reaction to the interchange.what do you think he asked them.any objections to anything i said to her lemmerer counsel responded,no.the prosecutor,however,stated that he had a concern,although not with the judge remarks.rather,he explained 
i have serious concerns based on her repeated,repeated refusals in saying to the court that even if i going back in there i not going to say anything and that she not following the court instruction if she not deliberating.and i would ask that the court excuse her.but i going to take an opportunity to look at the law if that beyond your power,but i do believe it within your power 
after prompting from the court,defense counsel agreed that she too would like to go and research it first before i make any determination.the judge then asked,h ow do you feel as a practical matter in this sense i f you both agree i can excuse her.and then i have two options.i can send in the alternate,or i can go down to eleven,and just have them continue deliberating.do you want to express yourself on that do you want to think about it defense counsel indicated that she would like to think about it and do some research.
after some further discussion,the judge,defense counsel,and the prosecutor agreed that the attorneys would go and think about it.when and if they came to an agreement as to any course of action,or if either party want ed to be heard to ask the judge to do something legally,counsel would so inform the court.in the meantime,the jurors would resume deliberations as soon as they finished lunch,without any further instructions.
the jurors began to deliberate again slightly before half an hour later,they sent out another note,reading we are at a standstill.we feel that we need the court transcripts of lemmerer testimony to help us move forward.by that time,the judge had learned that the transcript could be ready by the following monday,december.he determined that the best course was to adjourn for the christmas holiday a few hours early that thursday,with the jury to resume d
