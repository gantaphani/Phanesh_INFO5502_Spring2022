opinion of the court 
petitioner david robertson was convicted by a jury in pennsylvania state court of two counts of conspiracy to commit murder arising out of the deaths of edward and karen povlik,although he was acquitted of the murders by the same jury.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on each of the two counts,which were to run consecutively.after exhausting his direct and collateral appeals in the pennsylvania courts,robertson filed a petition for federal habeas relief,alleging as relevant here that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for two conspiracies.that is,robertson contends that the evidence produced at trial proved at most one conspiracy that encompassed the killings of both povliks.
the district court adopted the findings and recommendations of the magistrate judge and denied the petition.however,we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find that robertson participated in two conspiracies and that the pennsylvania courts contrary conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.therefore,we will reverse.
background 
a.the murders 
this case arises out of the murders of edward and karen povlik,both drug dealers,who were killed sometime during the late night of december,or early morning of january,at their home outside of connellsville,pennsylvania.after several years of investigation,robertson was charged with two counts of first and third degree murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide.the commonwealth theory of the case was that robertson obtained the murder weapon and provided it to gerald powell,who was the triggerman 
the evidence at trial established that the povliks illegally sold prescription drugs,such as morphine,out of their residence and that robertson was one of their customers.on december,robertson went to the povliks home with his friend john mongell to purchase morphine.according to mongell,when they arrived at the povliks home,robertson folded his knees down and sat like on the floor of my car,apparently hiding from the povliks.app.at.mongell purchased morphine and then left with robertson.
later that day,robertson,his girlfriend donna jo mathews,and her two children were at a new year eve party at the home of another friend,greg rosensteel.robertson asked to borrow a caliber,revolver from rosensteel,ostensibly in order to do some target practice.rosensteel lent him the gun.
subsequently,at about eight or nine that evening,robertson called mongell and stated that he was going to go down to the povliks and that he was going to do something that he did want to do and cause some trouble.app.at.robertson left rosensteel house between ten and eleven to take mathews son to the home of mathews mother.robertson returned to rosensteel house sometime before midnight and then left with mathews and her daughter at around one in the morning of january.when mathews woke up later on january,robertson was gone and did not return until about eleven or later that day or the next,robertson returned the revolver to rosensteel.they did not discuss whether robertson had used the gun,but robertson stated that he had cleaned it.
at trial,the commonwealth introduced testimony from several witnesses that robertson made inculpating statements in the months following the povliks murder.in either february or march,robertson was traveling with rosensteel and robertson cousin tina stockman.they happened to drive by a man working on a car alongside the road robertson stopped the car and got out and spoke to the man.according to rosensteel,when robertson the car,he made a statement about that that was the guy that pulled the trigger,and i asked him what he was talking about,and he made reference to the people that got killed in the trailer the povliks.app.at.robertson also stated at that time that he robertson got the gun,but that powell was the guy who pulled the trigger.app.at.
further,stockman testified that she heard robertson refer to the murders on another occasion.specifically,robertson stated that i might have got the gun,but i did pull the trigger and that powell was the shooter.app.at.stockman also testified that robertson was able to describe the position of the povliks bodies at the murder scene finally,another friend,mary ann kraynak,testified that she heard robertson state that he was with gerald powell,picked him up at a party in breakneck,went to the povliks and bad things happened.app.at.
the commonwealth also introduced forensic evidence demonstrating that the revolver that robertson borrowed from rosensteel was operable and that bullets recovered at the povliks home possessed class characteristics consistent with that revolver.app.at.however,the commonwealth expert could not specifically conclude that the bullets recovered at the crime scene were fired from rosensteel revolver due to extreme fragmentation and mutilation of the bullets.there was no other physical evidence to link robertson to the murders.
state court proceedings 
conviction and sentence 
robertson was not arrested until,at which time he was residing in florida he was extradited to pennsylvania for trial.he was charged with two counts of murder and two counts of conspiracy.based on the evidence described above,the jury convicted robertson of two counts of conspiracy to commit murder and acquitted him on the substantive murder counts.the court of common pleas for fayette county sentenced robertson to two consecutive terms of imprisonment on each conspiracy count.
we note that the jury instructions accurately stated the basic elements of a conspiracy under.ann,including the requirements of an agreement,a shared intent to bring about the underlying crime,and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.however,as argued by robertson,the jury instructions failed to address.ann.c,which provides that if a person conspires to commit a number of crimes,he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.
direct appeal 
following his conviction,robertson filed a motion for a new trial,arrest of judgment and judgment of acquittal with the court of common pleas.as relevant here,robertson argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on the conspiracy counts and that it was against the weight of the evidence.the court of common pleas rejected those contentions.it relied on the testimony recounted above that established that robertson had purchased drugs from the povliks,that robertson had borrowed a revolver that was consistent with the murder weapon,and that robertson had made several inculpatory statements.
on his direct appeal to the superior court,robertson renewed his contentions that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was against the weight of the evidence.the superior court rejected those claims,concluding that robertson statements and admissions allow for the reasonable inference that he and gerald powell had entered into an agreement to murder the povlic sic couple by means of the caliber revolver which robertson borrowed from rosensteel.app.at emphasis added.robertson also argued that the two counts of conspiracy should have merged for sentencing because the evidence did not establish two conspiracies.the superior court concluded that this claim was in essence a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence with regard to the existence of two conspiracies and that robertson had failed to preserve that specific issue for appeal because he wrongly framed the issue as a challenge to the legality of his sentences.
pcra proceedings 
after the pennsylvania supreme court declined to hear robertson direct appeal,robertson filed,with counsel,an application for relief pursuant to the pennsylvania relief act pcra.the court of common pleas rejected robertson claims for pcra relief.
robertson appealed,pro se,to the superior court,which affirmed.the superior court rejected robertson claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,on his direct appeal,and on his pcra claims before the court of common pleas.it also rejected robertson argument that he was entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.
finally,as most relevant here,the superior court rejected robertson claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of two conspiracies.the superior court noted that robertson had waived that issue on his direct appeal,but concluded that it could consider the merits of robertson claim because he alleged that his counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for failing to set forth the correct standard and in causing the issue to be waived and therefore robertson properly layered the issue.app.at.
on the merits,the superior court noted that pennsylvania courts consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies have been established.the superior court recognized that several factors supported robertson argument that the evidence was sufficient to prove only a single conspiracy,including that the povliks were killed at approximately the same time were killed with the same firearm and at the same location and that the same person or persons killed them.however,the superior court concluded that the central factor here is the number of victims and that the objective of the first conspiracy was the criminal homicide of edward james povlik and the objective of the second conspiracy was the criminal homicide of karen marie povlik.app.at.the court also noted that,under robertson position,one agreement to kill twenty people should be punished the same as one agreement to kill one person,because there was only a single overarching conspiracy.we reject that argument.app.at 
federal habeas proceedings 
robertson then filed a petition for federal habeas relief pursuant to.robertson presented two claims for relief that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel and that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate the existence of two conspiracies.
the district court referred the matter to the magistrate judge,who filed a report recommending denial of robertson petition and denial of a certificate of appealability.the district court accepted those recommendations.robertson then filed a notice of appeal of that decision we construed that notice as a request for a certificate of appealability and granted the request as to whether sufficient evidence in the trial record supports appellant multiple conspiracy convictions.app.at.we denied a certificate of appealability as to robertson ineffective assistance of counsel claim.because only the insufficiency of the evidence claim is before us,we will review the district court opinion adopting the magistrate judge report only as to that claim.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and.we have jurisdiction under and,and we review a district court denial of habeas relief de novo.vega united states,cir.
habeas relief is precluded on any claim that the state court adjudicated on the merits,unless the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.d.
iii.discussion 
robertson raises two related but distinct issues on his appeal.first,he argues that the superior court rejection of his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove two conspiracies beyond a reasonable doubt denied him due process and was an unreasonable application of in re winship,d.second,he contends that the trial court jury instructions were so deficient as to relieve the commonwealth of its obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of multiple conspiracies.we focus on robertson first issue.
the requirement that guilt of a criminal charge be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our early years as a nation.in re winship,at.indeed,t he standard plays a vital role in the american scheme of criminal procedure.it is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error.id.at.the reasonable doubt standard recognizes that the accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance,both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.id.further,i t is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned.id.at.thus,the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.id.
further,in jackson virginia,the supreme court held that u nder the winship decision,it is clear that a state prisoner who alleges that the evidence in support of his state conviction can not be fairly characterized as sufficient to have led a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt has stated a federal constitutional claim and that it follows that such a claim is cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding,d see also fiore white,d per curiam we have held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment forbids a state to convict a person of a crime without proving the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.when assessing such claims on a petition for habeas relief from a state conviction,the sufficiency of the evidence standard must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.jackson,at.
a pennsylvania statute provides that a person is guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime if with the intent of promoting or facilitating its commission he agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime.ann.a.significantly for the issue before us,it also states that i f a person conspires to commit a number of crimes,he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship.ann.c.thus,a single conspiracy can include multiple underlying crimes.stated another way,the commonwealth bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that robertson and powell the alleged killer entered into two agreements or two conspiratorial relationships,one to kill edward povlik and another to kill karen povlik.it did not do so.
the pennsylvania supreme court has adopted a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether a particular case involves one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies.under this test,pennsylvania courts consider the number of overt acts in common the overlap of personnel the time period during which the alleged acts took place the similarity in methods of operation the locations in which the alleged acts took place the extent to which the purported conspiracies share a common objective and the degree to which interdependence is needed for the overall operation to succeed.commonwealth andrews,quotation omitted.
robertson contends that the commonwealth failed to provide sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to find two agreements or two conspiratorial relationships under pennsylvania law.we agree.the commonwealth introduced evidence that robertson and powell were the only conspirators for both murders that robertson obtained a single revolver that was consistent with the weapon used to commit both murders and that edward and karen povlik were killed at the same time and in the same place.nothing in this evidence regarding the commission of the murders would allow a rational jury to conclude that the murders were the result of two separate conspiracies.
indeed,the commonwealth simply failed to introduce any direct or circumstantial evidence to suggest that the murders were the result of multiple conspiracies.to show motive,t
