opinion of the court 
a jury convicted jorge reyeros and his brother,juan reyeros,of offenses related to a conspiracy to import cocaine into the united states on appeal,each brother challenges his conviction and juan additionally challenges his sentence.although both raise a number of issues on appeal,we focus primarily on,first,jorge contention that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the purpose of the conspiracy was to import cocaine and,second,the brothers shared contention that they were improperly denied access to certain documents in the possession of the colombian government,in violation of brady maryland,d and the jencks act.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm.
background 
on august,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of new jersey returned a second superseding indictment the indictment against jorge,juan,hernan uribe,and rafael.during the time period charged in the indictment,jorge was employed as an inspector for the united states customs service customs in new jersey.counts through of the indictment named only jorge and charged him,in count,with conspiracy to import cocaine,in violation of,and,in counts through,with exceeding authorized access to a customs computer,in violation of a b,c b and.specifically,the indictment alleged that,in,jorge conspired with unnamed to import into the united states cocaine concealed in cargo containers.it also alleged that jorge had,on multiple occasions in,unlawfully accessed a customs computer database,obtained information identifying containers designated for inspection by customs,and provided that information to his in furtherance of the conspiracy.
count of the indictment charged jorge,juan,uribe,and with a separate conspiracy to import cocaine,in violation of,while count charged them with exceeding authorized access to a customs computer and aiding and abetting exceeding authorized access,in violation of a b,c b and the allegations of count are that,in,jorge,juan,uribe,and agreed to import cocaine into the united states from ecuador,concealed in cargo containers filled with produce bound for port elizabeth,new jersey.count describes how,in furtherance of that conspiracy,jorge unlawfully accessed a customs computer database in to research a company his had identified as a potential recipient of the smuggled cocaine.
the trial against jorge and juan began in october.at some point,juan moved for severance however,his request was denied by the district court.thus,at trial the government presented evidence of the conspiracy and associated charges set forth in counts through of the indictment,which named only jorge as a defendant,and it also presented evidence of the conspiracy and unauthorized access charges set forth in counts and of the indictment,which named both jorge and juan along with uribe and.
uribe testified at trial on behalf of the government.when the trial began,uribe was in a colombian prison,where he was serving a sentence for drug trafficking and conspiracy.he was,however,extradited to the united states during the trial and immediately entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which he agreed to cooperate with the government at trial,uribe testified that he became involved in the conspiracy when juan asked him for help identifying an american company through which to kilograms of cocaine could be imported into the united states.uribe stated that juan told him that jorge was a customs inspector and could use that position to ensure containers containing drugs could enter the united states without being inspected.
uribe described how he sought the help of to find an american company suitable to receive the smuggled cocaine,in turn,contacted an american acquaintance,james lagrotteria,for assistance.unbeknownst to the conspirators,however,lagrotteria was an informant for customs and the united states drug enforcement administration dea.
introduced uribe to lagrotteria in colombia in march and the three men met to discuss plans to import cocaine into the united states.at that meeting,lagrotteria was tasked with identifying an american company suitable for receiving the imported cocaine,particularly one with a warehouse in new york or new jersey and a history of importing produce.lagrotteria was told that the conspirators were working with a customs official and that the official planned to check a customs computer database to see if any company lagrotteria identified had been flagged by customs as having previously imported contraband.
in april,customs and dea agents fabricated records for a fictitious company they named tj import produce.they put the records in a customs database and,on april,at the behest of the government agents,lagrotteria informed that he had identified tj import produce as a potential recipient of the cocaine the conspirators hoped to import.a few days later,on april,jorge accessed the customs computer database and examined the mock importation and inspection records for tj import produce.subsequently,uribe informed lagrotteria that tj import produce had been investigated and was suitable.
later that april,lagrotteria traveled to colombia to meet juan and to discuss with uribe and juan the conspirators plans to import cocaine.at that meeting,uribe informed juan and lagrotteria that he was having trouble locating kilograms of cocaine.juan responded that,to make the conspiracy worth the risks involved,they needed to import at least kilograms of cocaine,and he suggested that the conspirators try to locate and pool together smaller quantities of cocaine in order to amass a large quantity.when asked at trial why juan required such a large amount of cocaine,uribe explained that juan told him many,many times that jorge needed that reyeros,his brother,needed that quantity.he would work with other quantities,two or three hundred,or a hundred,it was any good for him.supplemental appendix sa.when asked what he meant when he said that jorge would work with smaller quantities,uribe testified,it means that he would take little amounts of drugs to use his customs position,it would be too little of a deal.he needed big deals.big drug deals.id.
uribe also testified that,instead of shipping cocaine directly from colombia to the united states,the conspirators planned to ship the drugs through ecuador,concealed in a cargo container purportedly holding bananas.according to uribe,juan explained that the container of drugs should be shipped from ecuador instead of colombia because jorge had said it was impossible to take anything out of colombia.sa.uribe further testified that the conspirators planned to elude detection by shipping multiple containers at one time,only one of which would contain drugs.uribe stated that jorge was going to ensure that customs would inspect only the containers that did not contain drugs and would let the container with the drugs go by.sa.the conspirators never actually carried out their plan,however,because they were not able to acquire cocaine.
the jury found jorge and juan guilty of the charges alleged in counts and of the indictment.it also specifically found,through special interrogatories,that jorge and juan had conspired to import more than kilograms of cocaine and that jorge had unlawfully accessed the customs computer database in furtherance of the conspiracy.the jury acquitted jorge of the charges alleged in counts through.
after trial,jorge and juan each moved for a judgment of acquittal on counts and.in addition,each moved for a new trial on a number of grounds,including erroneous evidentiary rulings,violations of the disclosure obligations imposed by brady and prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.the district court denied the defendants motions,and,on january,sentenced jorge to months in prison and juan to months in prison.
on appeal,jorge and juan challenge their convictions and juan challenges his sentence.we have jurisdiction under and a.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
jorge argues that,because the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to permit the jury to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,the district court erroneously denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal on counts and.as noted earlier,count charged jorge,juan,uribe,and with conspiring to import cocaine,in violation of and count charged them with exceeding authorized access in furtherance of the conspiracy to import cocaine,and aiding and abetting exceeding authorized access,in violation of a b,c b and jorge challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is a narrow one he argues that his convictions must be vacated because the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish that he knew that the specific object of the conspiracy was to import cocaine we disagree.
in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we apply a particularly deferential standard of review.united states cothran,cir quoting united states dent,cir.we do not weigh the evidence or decide the credibility of the witnesses.id.instead,w e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and sustain the verdict if any rational juror could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
one of the requisite elements the government must show in a conspiracy case is that the alleged conspirators shared a unity of purpose,the intent to achieve a common goal,and an agreement to work together toward the goal.united states wexler,cir citing united states kates,cir.accordingly,i n order for us to sustain a defendant conviction for conspiracy,the government must have put forth evidence tending to prove that defendant entered into an agreement and knew that the agreement had the specific unlawful purpose charged in the indictment.united states idowu,cir quoting wexler,at.
jorge acknowledges that the evidence presented by the government is sufficient to support a finding that he accessed the customs computer database for an improper reason.it is a concession practically compelled by the evidence.jorge researched the importation and inspection records of the fictitious tj import produce within a few days of lagrotteria telling that he had identified that company as a potential vehicle for importing cocaine.after jorge accessed those records,uribe informed lagrotteria that tj import produce had been investigated by his contact in customs and was an acceptable recipient of the cocaine.the evidence is thus damning enough that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,it is more than sufficient to support a finding that jorge knew the purpose of the conspiracy was to import some form of contraband.united states iafelice,cir there is no requirement that the inference drawn by the jury be the only inference possible or that the government evidence foreclose every possible innocent explanation.that finding is further supported by uribe testimony that the conspirators planned to ship the container full of drugs from ecuador instead of colombia because juan relayed that jorge had said it was impossible to take anything out of colombia.sa.
perhaps recognizing that the evidence supports the conclusion that he knew he was involved in a conspiracy to bring something illegal into the country,jorge argues on appeal that the record fails to show he knew the specific purpose of the conspiracy was to import cocaine,rather than some other form of contraband.to support his argument,jorge cites a number of cases in which we reversed drug possession and distribution conspiracy convictions for lack of evidence that the defendant knew the purpose of the conspiracy involved drugs.see,united states cartwright,cir idowu,at united states thomas,cir united states salmon,cir wexler,at.for example,jorge relies on wexler,in which we held that evidence sufficient to support a finding that a defendant acted as a lookout for a drug transaction was nevertheless insufficient to support a finding that the defendant was aware that drugs were involved in the transaction.wexler,at.although we noted in that case that it was more likely than not that the defendant suspected,if not actually knew,that some form of contraband was involved in the transaction for which he acted as a lookout,we concluded that the record lacked any evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant knew that the contraband involved was drugs.id.at.there,we reasoned that the evidence was just as consistent with a conspiracy to transport stolen goods,an entirely different crime.see also idowu,at e ven in situations where the defendant knew that he was engaged in illicit activity,and knew that some form of contraband was involved in the scheme in which he was participating,the government is obliged to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the particular illegal objective contemplated by the conspiracy.
in this case,however,unlike in wexler and the other cases cited by jorge,there is no evidentiary deficiency.here,the government offered evidence showing that jorge knew full well that the purpose of the conspiracy was to import a massive amount of cocaine.uribe testified that,at an april meeting with lagrotteria and juan,he told them he was having trouble locating kilograms of cocaine.according to uribe,juan insisted that they needed to import at least that much because,as uribe elaborated,juan said many,many times that jorge needed that reyeros,his brother,needed that quantity.he would work with other quantities,two or three hundred,or a hundred,it was any good for him.sa.as earlier noted,when asked what was meant by saying that jorge would work with smaller quantities of cocaine,uribe testified,it means that he would take little amounts of drugs to use his customs position,it would be too little of a deal.he needed big deals.big drug deals.id.that testimony is sufficient to allow a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that jorge was aware that the purpose of the conspiracy was to import cocaine,as opposed to some other form of contraband we therefore reject jorge challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.
brady and jencks 
next,the defendants contend that the district court erred in failing to order the prosecution to turn over documents filed with colombian authorities by uribe as he opposed his extradition to the united states.the defendants acknowledge that,at the time of the trial,the documents they sought were not,and had never been,in the actual possession of the united states government.the district court held that,under the circumstances,the united states government was not obligated to obtain and produce documents that the government had never seen and that were in the possession of a foreign sovereign.we agree with that ruling.
uribe was first named as a defendant in this case in a superseding indictment returned by the grand jury on june,counts and of the first superseding indictment charged jorge,juan,uribe,and with conspiracy to import cocaine,attempting to exceed authorized access to a customs computer,and aiding and abetting the attempt to exceed authorized access.when the first superseding indictment was returned in,uribe was,as we have noted,in a colombian prison serving a sentence for drug trafficking and conspiracy.while investigating this case,the united states sought to question uribe.to that end,it sent to the government of colombia a document entitled,vienna convention mutual legal assistance request.sa.the request asked colombian authorities to interview uribe using questions provided by the united states and then to provide a written summary of uribe responses.but instead of questioning uribe and providing his answers to the united states,colombian authorities permitted united states customs investigators to personally interview uribe in colombia.
that interview took place over the course of two days on november and,and was memorialized by customs investigators in a written report the report indicates that,before the interview,maria cristina munoz,a colombian prosecutor,read to uribe and his attorney the questions contained in the united states mutual legal assistance request in the presence of the customs investigators and carmen colon,a united states department of justice judicial attache.after munoz finished reading the questions,munoz and colon left the room and the customs investigators interviewed uribe.
following the interview,the united states asked colombia to extradite uribe to face the charges in counts and of the first superseding indictment.uribe opposed extradition but failed to prevent it he arrived in the united states on december,after the grand jury returned the second superseding indictment,and after the trial of jorge and juan had begun.the same day uribe arrived,he entered into a plea agreement which provided that he cooperate with the united states government and plead guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine into the united states.the next day,he pled guilty in accordance with the agreement,and,two days after that,he testified on behalf of the government at the trial of jorge and juan.
when it became apparent that uribe was coming to the united states and would testify,the defendants asked the district court to compel the prosecution to obtain and produce,among other things,any documents uribe had filed with colombian authorities to oppose his extradition.the defendants contended that,even if the prosecution did not actually possess such documents,it had a duty under brady maryland,d,and the jencks act,to acquire them.the essence of the defendants argument was that the prosecution constructively possessed any documents possessed by the colombian authorities relating to uribe extradition because colombia had cooperated with the united states both by permitting united states officials to interview uribe and by acting upon the united states request to extradite him.
on december,during the trial,the district court held a hearing to consider the defendants discovery demands.at the hearing,the government took the position that it had no obligation to obtain and turn over the documents sought by the defense.nevertheless,the prosecutor represented that the united states was attempting to obtain documents from uribe attorney in colombia and that it would turn over whatever it obtained.as earlier noted,the district court denied the discovery demands.it ruled that the prosecution was not in actual or constructive possession of the documents sought by the defense and was therefore not required under brady or the jencks act to obtain and produce them the defendants wrongly say that was error.
brady stands for the proposition that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.brady,at.a brady violation has three components the evidence at issue must be favorable to the defendant it must be material and it must have been suppressed by the prosecution.united states pelullo,cir united states perdomo,cir.evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d.material evidence can include evidence that may be used to impeach a witness.id.at.giglio united states,d.
brady prohibits the prosecution from supress ing material,favorable evidence,at,but that does not mean that the prosecution duty to disclose is limited to evidence within the actual knowledge or possession of the prosecutor.it is that the prosecution has a duty to learn of and disclose information known to the others acting on the government behalf in the case kyles whitley,d.accordingly,it has been held that a state prosecutor has a duty to obtain and turn over to the defense favorable evidence known to a state police officer who investigated the case.id.at.similarly,a federal prosecutor is charged with knowledge of information possessed by other agents of the federal government when those agents are a part of a prosecution team,which includes federal personnel involved in the investigation as well as the prosecution of a case.pelullo,at see also united states antone,cir t his court has declined to draw a distinction between different agencies under the same government,focusing instead upon the prosecution team which includes both investigative and prosecutorial personnel.
in some cases,the government obligations under brady may extend even further.we have held that,under certain circumstances,evidence possessed by state agents may be constructively possessed by a federal prosecutor such that the prosecutor has a duty to obtain that evidence and disclose it to the defense.see united states risha,cir see also antone,at.in risha,we called this issue constructive knowledge.risha,at.we considered in that case whether it was proper to impute to a federal prosecutor the knowledge of state agents that a witness who had testified in a federal criminal case expected leniency with respect to unrelated state charges,in return for his cooperation in the federal case.id.although the federal prosecutor did not know that the witness expected leniency in state court in return for his testimony,we concluded that the federal prosecutor might,under certain circumstances,be deemed to have constructive knowledge of that information if it was known to the state agents.id.at.
we held that a analysis was appropriate when considering a federal prosecutor constructive knowledge,and we set forth three questions as relevant to the analysis whether the party with knowledge of the information is acting on the government behalf or is under its control the extent to which state and federal governments are part of a team,are participating in a joint investigation or are sharing resources and whether the entity charged with constructive possession has ready access to the evidence.id.at.the first question concerns the intermingling of the forces of the federal government with the forces of the state sovereign id.the second question is closely related to the first and asks whether the federal government and the state are part of a team or are engaged in a joint effort or whether they had a close working relationship.id.at.the last question considers whether the information the defense alleges should have been disclosed was available to the prosecution if it had sought to discover it.id.in risha,we opined that facts indicating that a state agent was heavily involved in the prosecution and knew of impeachment evidence would support a conclusion that federal prosecutors had constructive knowledge of that evidence.id.at.
our holding in risha relied,in part,on the opinion of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit in united states antone.in that case,the fifth circuit considered whether knowledge of state investigative agents should be imputed to federal prosecutors where there was a joint investigative task force composed of fbi agents and state agents.antone,at.the defendants argued that evidence that a witness attorney fees had been paid by the state was material because it could have been used to impeach the witness,and they argued further that the state agents knowledge of that evidence should be imputed to the federal prosecutors for purposes of determining whether the evidence had been suppressed in violation of brady.id.at.
the fifth circuit agreed that the state agent knowledge should be imputed to federal prosecutors.the court first noted that,if the investigators with knowledge of the evidence had worked for a federal agency,their knowledge would have been imputed to the prosecution for brady purposes.id.at.the court went on to consider whether evidence in the possession of the state investigators should be treated differently because those investigators represented a different sovereign.instead of imposing a rigid distinction between knowledge possessed by the federal and state agencies,the court endorsed a analysis of the extent of interaction and cooperation between the two governments.id.at.the fifth circuit ultimately concluded that the knowledge of the state investigators should be imputed to the federal prosecutors in that case because the federal and state investigative agencies had cooperated intimately from the outset of the investigation and the degree of cooperation was extensive.id.according to the court,the state investigators essentially functioned as agents of the federal government under the principles of agency law and were in a real sense members of the prosecutorial team.id.
the situation in the present case is markedly different.first,and most obviously,it involves a foreign sovereign,which implicates issues that may well make a showing of effective federal control of foreign evidence more sensitive and demanding than is suggested by the risha factors.but even if risha were the operative test,the defendants do not meet that less demanding standard the first risha the individuals with possession of the requested information were acting on the federal government behalf or were under its control does not support a determination of constructive possession in this case.risha,at.there is nothing of record to indicate that the nation of colombia was somehow under american control in the investigation of this case,or that any colombian authorities were members of a united states prosecution team.unlike the state agents in antone,colombian authorities did not function as agents of the united states government.it is true that the colombian government acted at the request of the prosecution in permitting the federal investigators to interview uribe however,beyond the initial recitation of the officially propounded questions,no colombian officials participated in that interview or any other part of the investigation.moreover,while colombian officials naturally participated in the colombian judicial proceeding that resulted in uribe extradition,those authorities did not function as agents of the united states government or act under its control.instead,they acted on behalf of their own government in responding to a request from the united states.the level of cooperation extended by the colombian government,while admirable,appears to have been nothing more than the comity called for by treaty and custom.we decline to adopt the defendants suggestion that a determination of constructive possession is appropriate whenever a foreign government responds to a request from the united states for investigative or judicial assistance.
nor does the second risha factor support a determination of constructive possession.there was no joint investigation by the united states and colombian governments regarding the events alleged in the indictment.indeed,there is no indication that the two governments shared any investigative resources whatsoever see moon head,cir refusing to impute to a georgia state prosecutor evidence possessed by tennessee law enforcement officials when there was no evidence that tennessee officials and georgia prosecutors had participated in a joint investigation.
finally,the third risha the federal government had ready access to the not support a determination of constructive possession.risha,at.the record suggests that the prosecution did not have access to the documents in uribe colombian court file,aside from those documents it was able to obtain from uribe attorney in colombia.united states hughes,cir holding that the prosecution was not required to produce crime scene photographs in the possession of the mexican government because the government has no duty to produce evidence outside of its control united states friedman,cir holding that brady did not require evidence seized by the chilean government to be produced when the federal government had no access to the evidence.more importantly,though,we could not conclude that the prosecution had constructive possession of the requested documents in this case even if it could have acquired them.the mere fact that documents may be obtainable is insufficient to establish constructive possession.without a showing that evidence is possessed by people engaged in the investigation or prosecution of the case,we have declined to hold that the evidence was constructively possessed by federal prosecutors,despite its being in the possession of another agent of the federal government and therefore presumably obtainable see,pelullo,at holding that information known to officials in the united states department of labor was not constructively known to federal prosecutors when there was no indication that the prosecution and the officials engaged in a joint investigation or that the prosecution had any control over the officials united states merlino,cir holding that there is no duty on the prosecutor office to learn of information possessed by other government agencies that have no involvement in the investigation or prosecution at issue quoting united states morris,cir.
in sum,after examining the factors set forth in risha,we conclude that the united states was not in constructive possession of evidence,if there were any,possessed by colombian authorities,and thus there was no violation of brady in this case.
we also reject the defendants argument that the prosecution was obligated by the jencks act to turn over documents filed by uribe in colombia in opposition to his extradition.jencks requires the prosecution to produce a witness statement in the possession of the united states which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.b.we have held that the phrase in the possession of the united states should be read to require production only of statements possessed by the prosecutorial arm of the federal government.merlino,at quoting united states dansker,cir see also united states weaver,cir t he jencks act only applies to evidence in the possession of the united states,and not state authorities friedman,at holding that the jencks act did not require the production of evidence that had been seized by the chilean government.in this case,the documents sought were allegedly located in uribe colombian court file.we reject any general assertion,and certainly any assertion on this record,that colombian courts serve as an arm of the united states government therefore,we also reject the defendants argument that the prosecution was required to obtain and turn over those documents under the jencks act 
c.other challenges to the convictions 
jorge and juan raise a number of other issues related to their convictions,none of which,either alone or in combination,warrant a new trial.first,juan challenges the district court decision to deny his motion for severance.we review under an standard a district court decision not to sever defendants.zafiro united states,d.even if a district court abuses its discretion,however,reversal is not required absent a demonstration of clear and substantial prejudice resulting in a manifestly unfair trial.united states hart,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
federal rule of criminal procedure b states that defendants may be charged together in an indictment if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction,or in the same series of acts or transactions,constituting an offense or offenses.b.it further provides that a ll defendants need not be charged in each count.id.rule a,in turn,permits a court to sever defendants trials if the joinder of defendants in an indictment appears to prejudice a defendant.a.w hen defendants properly have been joined under rule b,a district court should grant a severance under rule only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants,or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro,at.
juan does not contend that he and jorge were improperly charged together in the indictment.instead,he appears to argue that the district court abused its discretion in declining to sever his trial from jorge because evidence of the separate conspiracy alleged in counts through,counts which name only jorge as a defendant,had the potential to lead a jury to conclude juan was involved in that conspiracy and thus to unfairly lead the jury to find juan guilty on counts and juan further argues that the joint trial subjected him to actual prejudice,not only because the jury heard evidence that was only relevant to counts through,but also because the prosecutor confused jorge and juan names on multiple occasions.
in denying juan motion to sever,the district court concluded that any potential prejudice to juan resulting from the joint trial could be cured by limiting instructions,which the district court gave.we agree.the risk of unfair prejudice in this case was not such that the district court was bound to grant juan motion to sever.zafiro,at.e ven if there were some risk of prejudice,here it is of the type that can be cured with proper instructions,and juries are presumed to follow their instructions.quoting richardson marsh,d.
however,even if we agreed with juan that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to sever,he has failed to demonstrate clear and substantial prejudice resulting in a manifestly unfair trial.hart,at internal quotation marks omitted.there is no reason to believe that the jury failed to understand the district court instructions regarding how to use the evidence offered against jorge on counts through.moreover,although evidence of a codefendant wrongdoing in some circumstances erroneously could lead a jury to conclude that a defendant was guilty,zafiro,at,juan assertion that the jury so erred in this case has no force,given the jury acquittal of jorge on counts through.finally,although it appears that the prosecutor mixed up jorge and juan names on more than one occasion,the trial transcript indicates that,on each occasion,the prosecutor either corrected himself or was corrected by the court.after examining the record,we are unpersuaded that juan suffered any prejudice,let alone clear and substantial prejudice,by being tried with his brother,and we therefore reject his challenge to the district court denial of his motion to sever.
next,the defendants allege that many of the district court evidentiary rulings constituted abuses of discretion.these complaints truly warrant little comment.suffice it to say that,having examined the record,we see no abuse of discretion in the experienced district judge rulings on evidentiary questions we also reject juan assertion that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial after lagrotteria testified regarding an unrecorded phone conversation he had with juan,during which juan was clowning around and told lagrotteria that juan had a gun to uribe head.sa.the district court immediately struck that portion of lagrotteria testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it.assuming,without deciding,that the challenged testimony was inadmissible,we believe that the court instruction was more than sufficient to cure any unfair prejudice.
in addition,we reject the defendants argument that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial as a result of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.again,we are unpersuaded that the challenged comments,assuming they were improper,affected the jury ability to judge the evidence fairly.
finally,we decline the invitation to aggregate these alleged errors and then conclude the defendants were deprived of a fair trial.even when all of the defendants complaints are combined,the district court handing of this highly contentious case was admirable,not.
sentencing 
we turn last to juan challenge to his sentence.he argues that he should be because,prior to his sentencing,the district judge spoke with uribe off the record.the record in this regard is less than clear but it does appear that the district judge did speak with uribe before sentencing and that their discussion was outside of the presence of the parties and was not transcribed.we are nevertheless compelled to conclude that juan waived any objection he might otherwise have had regarding that discussion.
prior to sentencing,the defendants moved for downward departures under the advisory guidelines.the government opposed the motions and offered to put uribe on the stand at the sentencing hearing to provide a factual rebuttal to the defendants contentions.the government requested,however,that the district court limit the defendants regarding the identity of one of uribe cocaine suppliers because uribe believed he would be in mortal danger if he openly named the supplier.the defendants objected to any limitation being placed upon uribe,but juan counsel expressly affirmed he had no objection to the sensitive portion of uribe testimony being taken in camera.sa.
on the morning of the sentencing hearing,counsel for both sides spoke with the district judge in chambers prior to the hearing.that conference was not placed on the record.later,at the beginning of the sentencing hearing,the district judge noted that the defendants had agreed during the conference to withdraw their motions for downward departures and that,as a result,the government was no longer seeking to introduce uribe testimony at the sentencing hearing.the government still offered to have uribe testify,if the district judge believed such testimony would be relevant in determining the appropriate sentences to impose.the judge indicated,however,that he did not need to hear from uribe,that uribe testimony would only have been relevant to the defense motions for downward departure,which had been withdrawn.the court proceeded to sentencing without further discussion on that point.
after the court had imposed sentence,counsel for juan stated,i forgot earlier after the ex parte meeting with uribe to register my objection.sa.the following exchange then took place,in which the district court understandably displayed its consternation 
the court that very fine,but i do recall that ever being indicated to me before i engaged in this exercise.i did hear any objection from anybody.
what are you saying to me 
juan counsel that we did not have an opportunity on the record to object to the ex parte proceeding.
the court where have you been i came out here a number of times before i began the sentencing and i never heard anything about this.in fact,i kept uribe here in the event there would be a problem about my decision or your decision to not proceed with the motion to depart.
jorge counsel your honor advised us,me and advised another of juan counsel and myself and juan counsel had an opportunity to object had we so determined.so i absent myself from 
the court i appreciate that.i try to bend over backwards to make this a fair proceeding.i really do.
jorge counsel no question about that.
the court you juan counsel made the objection for the record.let me make something for the record.
you know,every time i do this i regret it.it only happened to me one time before 
every time,at counsel s request,judge can we see you in chambers before you come out i thought to myself well,you know,these are respected attorneys.i rely on what they say.i do have any problem discussing preliminarily something that of concern to them.so,i did have a court reporter in there which reflects my trust in counsel.and then to come out here now and have defense counsel tell me that they object to my ex parte proceeding.in fact 
jorge counsel not me.
the court i recognize it juan counsel.
in fact,in chambers off the record i think i originally said government counsel will conduct the sic examinaiton.then i said to myself well,that does make any sense.why should i have government counsel in here with defense counsel in here.so,i talk to the witness,uribe,myself with no counsel present.i never heard a single objection about that 
on appeal,juan alleges that the district judge may have improperly relied on information he obtained by uribe during their private discussion in deciding upon the sentence to impose.he requests that we vacate juan sentence and remand for before a different judge.although the precise basis for his assertion of error is not entirely clear,he appears to contend that the conversation between uribe and the district judge violated his right to due process because any comment uribe might have made was untested and unreliable.
after examining the transcript of the sentencing proceeding,we conclude that juan waived whatever argument he might have had because he agreed to have the district court speak with uribe off the record and alone prior to the sentencing hearing the transcript indicates that the cour
