jose vazquez castro was convicted by a jury of three counts conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking.he appeals the sufficiency of the evidence for the weapon charge in count three,and argues the district court erred by instructing the jury on the pinkerton theory of liability.for the following reasons,we affirm.
a.the undercover sting operation 
dea agents miguel melendez cruz,roberto cruz perez,and johnny melendez organized an undercover operation to buy cocaine.the targeted individuals included carlos rodriguez and israel ruiz.rodriguez had solicited marcos nunez retamar to be a runner,or an intermediary who earns commissions by matching suppliers of cocaine with buyers.nunez retamar became a confidential informant.
agent cruz perez instructed nunez retamar to call rodriguez and tell him that cruz perez was his brother and he wanted to buy ten kilograms of cocaine.cruz perez,melendez,and nunez retamar then met with rodriguez and ruiz.nunez retamar introduced cruz perez as his brother,and told rodriguez and ruiz that he wanted to buy ten kilograms of cocaine.after conversing about the specifics of the deal,they came to an agreement to purchase the cocaine.
the next day,rodriguez called to report that he had spoken with the supplier and they wanted to do the deal in front of a restaurant at a shopping mall that evening.rodriguez and ruiz arrived at the designated time,but stated that their supplier did not like the area because they saw suspicious vehicles and uniformed patrols.
cruz perez made several recorded calls to rodriguez and ruiz the following day.ruiz said that no one wants to release the tickets,which meant that the suppliers did not want to provide the drugs without first seeing the money.cruz perez asked rodriguez if he had iron,meaning firearms.rodriguez replied,i carry steel on my waist.
cruz perez,melendez,nunez retamar,and rodriguez agreed to meet at a restaurant for the exchange at on june.cruz perez placed agents around the premises to make arrests once the drugs arrived.they planned to call these agents after seeing the drugs and ask them to bring the money in,which was the code phrase ordering the arrests of the dealers.
cruz perez,melendez,and nunez retamar arrived first,and waited inside the restaurant.rodriguez called and said he could not attend the meeting because his car broke down.at,a mitsubishi automobile parked in front of the restaurant,with ruiz in the back seat and angel cruz perez angel driving.vazquez castro was also in the vehicle,sitting in the front passenger seat.ruiz exited the vehicle,and angel and vazquez castro left the area.ruiz entered the restaurant,told cruz perez that the kilos were there,and asked about the money.the agent replied that not a penny was going to be shown until he saw the kilos.ruiz responded that he needed to speak with the owners of the material.
ruiz left the restaurant,made a telephone call outside,and returned to again inquire about the money.the agents repeated that there would be no money until the drugs were shown,and ruiz left to make another telephone call.the mitsubishi returned with angel driving and vazquez castro in the front passenger seat.ruiz got into the back seat.cruz perez approached the mitsubishi,opened the rear passenger side door,and asked whether they were going to negotiate angel said yes,and instructed vazquez castro to go get that.
vazquez castro exited the vehicle,walked to an isuzu about six vehicles away,and got into the rear passenger side.a few minutes later,vazquez castro exited the vehicle,and returned with his hand tucked near the left side of his body and apparently carrying something inside his sweater.vazquez castro got back into the mitsubishi.ruiz opened the door and said,it is here.cruz perez instructed nunez retamar to check the drugs.nunez retamar looked in the passenger side for several seconds,then told cruz perez to b ring the money,there is a kilo.
angel and vazquez castro exited the vehicle and walked into the restaurant,where they were arrested.ruiz was arrested outside,as were the two individuals in the isuzu.when melendez arrested the driver of the isuzu,the driver said he was armed and t he weapon is under the carpet in the driver seat,on the floor.the agent then found a loaded caliber pistol folded in the floor mat on the driver side of the isuzu.the agents also retrieved a blue bag containing five kilograms of cocaine from the back seat of the isuzu and a kilogram of cocaine from the mitsubishi glove box.
b.the trial 
vazquez castro and his were indicted on three counts.count one charged vazquez castro and others with knowingly and unlawfully conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of a,b a,and.count two charged him with possessing with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of a and b a,and.count three charged,t he defendants herein,while aiding and abetting each other,did possess,use and carry a caliber ruger pistol in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a and c a i.
at trial,vazquez castro moved under rule a for a judgment of acquittal on count three.the district court denied the motion.it held that,even though the government had expressly charged vazquez castro under an aiding and abetting theory in count three,the jury may be instructed to consider the liability theory from pinkerton united states,as an alternative theory for conviction under c.the district court found that since both parties argued the foreseeability factor of the pinkerton theory during the rule a discussion,a factor which is not an element of the standard of proof of the aiding and abetting theory,the alternative pinkerton theory of liability is justified.the court later instructed the jury on both theories of liability.
vazquez castro was convicted and sentenced to months for counts one and two to be served concurrently,and months for count three to be served consecutively,for a total of months imprisonment.
on appeal,vazquez castro makes three related arguments.he argues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the weapon charge,and maintains that the district court therefore erred in denying his rule motion before the case was submitted to the jury.he also contends that,because the government expressly included an aiding and abetting theory of liability in the indictment,the court erred by instructing the jury on the pinkerton theory of liability 
we review the denial of a rule motion for acquittal de novo.see united states rosado perez,cir.we review the jury instructions for plain error because vazquez castro did not object to them at trial.see.b united states olano.in analyzing vazquez castro sufficiency claim,we must affirm the conviction if after de novo review of the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that a rational factfinder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.united states marin,cir.
a.the pinkerton instruction 
an aiding and abetting theory of liability requires a higher mens rea than a pinkerton theory of liability.united states shea,cir,abrogated on other grounds,united states mojica baez,cir.to show aider and abettor liability,the government must prove that the defendant knew to a practical certainty that the principal would use a weapon during the commission of the crime.united states spinney,cir.p ractical certainty is a rubric that calls for proof verging on actual knowledge.id.by contrast,under the pinkerton theory of liability,the jury must find that the defendant was a member of a conspiracy and the use or carrying of a firearm was reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy.shea,at.
notwithstanding this difference,a jury may be instructed to consider the liability theory established in pinkerton as an alternative ground for conviction under c in addition to an aiding and abetting theory.united states medina roman,cir internal citation omitted.the alternative instruction is justifi
