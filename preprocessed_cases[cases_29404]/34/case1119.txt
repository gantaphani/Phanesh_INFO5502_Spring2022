this case calls upon us to consider a conflict between two principles fundamental to our system of government the public right to know the policies by which it is governed,and the government right to obtain frank and confidential counsel as those policies are formulated.
a coalition of advocacy organizations,brought this lawsuit pursuant to the freedom of information act foia,seeking disclosure of an unpublished office of legal counsel memorandum the olc memorandum or memorandum.the olc memorandum,which was prepared for the department of justice in april,analyzes the question of whether state and local law enforcement may lawfully enforce certain provisions of federal immigration law.the district court kaplan,held that the department was required to produce the olc memorandum because,while the memorandum met the threshold requirements for nondisclosure under foia deliberative process exemption,b,the department had waived that protection by adopting the memorandum or incorporating it into official agency policy.
on appeal,the department argues that it did not expressly adopt or incorporate the olc memorandum and that,accordingly,the memorandum is shielded from disclosure under foia deliberative process exemption.in the alternative,the department argues that even if the deliberative process privilege does not protect the memorandum,the department is nonetheless entitled to withhold the memorandum on the grounds of privilege.we disagree on both counts and hold that the department incorporated the olc memorandum into agency policy through its repeated reference to,and reliance on,the memorandum and in this context,the privilege does not shield the memorandum from disclosure.
background 
the instant dispute arose out of a change in policy instituted by the department of justice.beginning in,the department took the position that state and local law enforcement lacked authority to enforce the civil,as opposed to criminal,provisions of federal immigration law this position was set forth in a memorandum written by the department office of legal counsel and published by the department,which concluded that state and local police lack legal authority to detain individuals based solely on a suspicion of civil deportability.
in,however,the department reversed course,taking the position that state and local law enforcement could,in fact,lawfully enforce the civil provisions of immigration law.the department change in policy was announced by general john ashcroft at a june,press conference unveiling the national security registration system nseers.as the attorney general explained,nseers is an initiative designed to expand substantially america scrutiny of those foreign visitors who may pose a national security concern and enter our country.in connection with this initiative,the attorney general announced that information concerning aliens who overstay their visas or attempt to evade registration immigration be entered into the national crime information center ncic database,a system that state and local police officers regularly check during traffic stops and other routine encounters.the attorney general explained that state and local law enforcement could then voluntarily arrest those individuals on the basis of their immigration violations and transfer them to the custody of federal immigration officials.
in support of this policy,and during that june,press conference,the attorney general made the first of a number of references to the olc memorandum that the plaintiffs here seek disclosed.specifically,the attorney general explained 
when federal,state and local law enforcement officers encounter an alien of national security concern who has been listed in the ncic federal law permits them to arrest the individual and transfer the individual to the custody of the ins.
the justice department office of legal counsel has concluded that this narrow,limited mission we are asking state and local police to undertake aliens who have violated criminal provisions of the immigration and national ity act,or civil provisions that render an alien deportable,those individuals who are listed on the narrow mission is within the inherent authority of the states.
in a similar vein,in response to a letter from one of the plaintiff organizations inquiring as to the authority of states and localities to enforce the civil provisions of immigration law,the attorney general,by letter dated march,wrote 
let me first state clearly the policy of the department on this issue.the department office of legal counsel olc previously opined that state and local law enforcement officials have inherent authority to make arrests for criminal immigration law violations generally.it has now additionally opined that they possess inherent authority to arrest individuals whose names have been entered into the ncic database because they have both violated civil provisions of the federal immigration laws that render them deportable and been determined by federal authorities to pose special risks,either because they present national security concerns or because they are absconders who have not complied with a final order of removal or deportation.thus,when state and local law enforcement officers encounter an alien who poses special risks and has been listed in the ncic database for violating the immigration and nationality act,they may arrest that individual and transfer him to the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins.the policy and the authority are no broader than this,and the narrow,limited mission that we are asking state and local police to undertake is a voluntary one.
emphases added.similar language appears in at least three other letters,one written by the attorney general,the other two written by the acting assistant attorney general and submitted to members of congress 
in june,kris kobach,counsel to the attorney general,gave what is perhaps the most detailed discussion of the olc memorandum during a presentation before the fbi criminal justice information services policy advisory presentation attended by,inter alia,representatives from state and local police departments.kobach began by stating that he would sort of summarize the memorandum and then explained 
so,the question was,it was crystal clear that any criminal violation of the immigration and nationality act could be a basis for an arrest by a state and local police officer.but what about a civil the act there was some ambiguity on this question.the last time the office of legal counsel had looked at it was back in.and since,congress had passed several acts all stating pretty clearly that there was no federal preemption.i do want to get too much into the legalese of this,but the olc determined that there was no federal preemption of state and local assistance for civil violations of the act versus criminal violations of the act.in addition,there were several circuit court opinions in the court of appeals,and that also raised the question rather,rather,crisply that perhaps we need to resolve this issue and just clear up the ambiguity.i n a nutshell the olc concluded that there is no federal preemption,there is no difference between civil and criminal with respect to whether state laws are the federal t he authority to make such arrest s is an inherent authority possessed by the states.
later in his remarks,kobach continued 
but as far as the assumption,there really is any legal fiber underneath it in the immigration law,at least.and so in the olc opinion it came out very clearly,and the attorney general did announce the summary of what that opinion is at this there are two things.one is that the olc opinion does say that immigration enforcement is an inherent authority of the states.it merely says,making an immigration arrest to assist the federal government lies within the inherent powers of the states.
plaintiffs subsequently filed the instant lawsuit seeking,inter alia,to compel the production of documents relating to the department new position regarding the authority of states and localities to enforce civil violations of immigration law,only one of olc relevant on appeal.on the department motion for summary judgment,the district court held,in relevant part,that the department was required to disclose the olc memorandum.the district court noted that while the memorandum fell within the deliberative process exception to foia disclosure requirements and would normally not be subject to disclosure,the department was nonetheless required to produce the memorandum because the department had,through the public statements of its representatives,incorporated the olc memorandum into department policy.see council of la raza dep t of justice,d.
the department sought reconsideration of the district court decision and urged the district court to review the olc memorandum in camera.on october,the district court granted the department motion in part,reaffirming its previous order that the bulk of the memorandum be disclosed,but ordering the redaction of several sections of the olc memorandum that were unrelated to the department policy.see council of la raza dep t of justice,civ,wl at,dist.lexis,at.this expedited appeal followed 
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment in a foia case.see halpern fbi,cir.we also review de novo a district court decision to require partial production of documents following in camera review,in keeping with the spirit and the text of the foia and its presumption in favor of disclosure.tigue united states dep t of justice,cir citation omitted.
foia was enacted in order to promote honest and open government and to assure the existence of an informed citizenry in order to hold the governors accountable to the governed.grand cent,cuomo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.foia strongly favors a policy of disclosure,see,halpern,at,and requires the government to disclose its records unless its documents fall within one of the specific,enumerated exemptions set forth in the act.see a,b tigue,at.consistent with foia purposes,these statutory exemptions are narrowly construed.see dep t of interior klamath water users protective ass n,d c onsistent with the act goal of broad disclosure,these exemptions have been consistently given a narrow compass.internal quotations and citations omitted local,int l of workers nlrb,cir exemptions are narrowly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of disclosure.the department bears the burden of demonstrating that any claimed exemption applies.see perlman united states doj,cir arthur andersen irs.
at issue in the present appeal is whether the olc memorandum is protected under foia fifth exemption exemption,which permits an agency to withhold or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.courts have interpreted exemption to encompass traditional privileges against disclosure,including the doctrine,and executive,deliberative process and privileges.see,grand cent,at.the department principally argues that the olc memorandum is protected by the deliberative process privilege,a of privilege that covers documents reflecting advisory opinions,recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.tigue,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the deliberative process privilege is designed to promote the quality of agency decisions by preserving and encouraging candid discussion between officials.it is based on the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news.klamath,at.an inter or document may be withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege if it is predecisional,prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision,and deliberative,actually related to the process by which policies are formulated.cuomo,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.see also tigue,at local,int l of workers,at 
just because a document satisfies these requirements,however,does not mean that the deliberative process privilege bars its disclosure.an agency may be required to disclose a document otherwise entitled to protection under the deliberative process privilege if the agency has chosen expressly to adopt or incorporate by reference a memorandum previously covered by exemption in what would otherwise be a final opinion.nlrb sears,roebuck,d.in such a circumstance,the document loses its predecisional and deliberative character,and accordingly,the deliberative process privilege no longer applies.see coastal states gas dep t of energy,e ven if the document is predecisional at the time it is prepared,it can lose that status if it is adopted,formally or informally,as the agency position on an issue or is used by the agency in its dealings with the public.as the supreme court wrote in sears,when a document is adopted as agency policy or incorporated therein by reference 
the probability that an agency employee will be inhibited from freely advising a decisionmaker for fear that his advice if adopted,will become public is slight.first,when adopted,the reasoning becomes that of the agency and becomes its responsibility to defend.second,agency employees will generally be encouraged rather than discouraged by public knowledge that their policy suggestions have been adopted by the agency.moreover,the public interest in knowing the reasons for a policy actually adopted by an agency supports disclosure.
in the instant case,the repeated references to the olc memorandum made by the attorney general and his advisors the substance of their comments,and the way in which their comments were is,to assure third parties as to the legality of the actions the third parties were being urged to sufficient to establish that the department incorporated the memorandum into its new policy regarding state and local immigration law enforcement authority.the references to the olc memorandum demonstrate that the department regarded the memorandum as the exclusive statement of,and justification for,its new policy on the authority of states to enforce the civil provisions of immigration law.for example,in his june press conference,the attorney general invoked the olc memorandum to justify the department policy change,noting expressly that the olc had contrast to the olc and the department previous that states possess the inherent authority to enforce the civil provisions of immigration law.in the attorney general march letter,the attorney general wrote that he wanted to state clearly the policy of the department on this issue and then immediately referred to the olc memorandum.he concluded by writing that t hus,when state and local law enforcement encounter an alien listed in the ncic,they have authority to make an arrest.other letters from the attorney general and his staff contained similar language.
finally,there are the comments of kris kobach,counsel to the attorney general,at a presentation before,inter alia,representatives from state and local law enforcement,that is,the very audience to whom the department new policy was aimed.kobach relied on one and only one source as a justification for the department policy the olc memorandum.and he did not merely refer to the memorandum conclusions he gave a overview of its contents.to wit,kobach stated 
so,the question was,it was crystal clear that any criminal violation of the immigration and nationality act could be a basis for an arrest by a state and local police officer.but what about a civil the act there was some ambiguity on this question.the last time the office of legal counsel had looked at it was back in.and since,congress had passed several acts all stating pretty clearly that there was no federal preemption.i do want to get too much into the legalese of this,but the olc determined that there was no federal preemption of state and local assistance for civil violations of the act versus criminal violations of the act.in addition,there were several circuit court opinions in the court of appeals,and that also raised the question rather,rather,crisply that perhaps we need to resolve this issue and just clear up the ambiguity.i n a nutshell the olc concluded that the
