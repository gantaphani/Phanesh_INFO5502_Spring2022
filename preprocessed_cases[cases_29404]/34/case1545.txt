defendant michael woods woods was convicted of numerous charges arising from a tax fraud scheme operated through his business of preparing income tax returns for private individuals.in this appeal,woods argues that his trial was prejudiced by three errors,namely,that the district court improperly restricted woods constitutional right to testify in his own defense that the prosecutor committed reversible error by making an improper statement during closing argument and that the district court instructions to the jury were improper.although we hold that two errors occurred during the trial,we conclude that neither constituted reversible error in the absence of any prejudice affecting the outcome of the trial.accordingly,we affirm woods convictions and sentence.
woods was charged in a count superseding indictment with willfully assisting the preparation and presentation of false and fraudulent tax returns to the internal revenue service irs,in violation of counts wire fraud,in violation of counts identity theft,in violation of a counts and aggravated identity theft,in violation of counts.during the course of the fraudulent scheme,woods,a veteran of the united states army,was employed on a basis as a data warehouse manager with the united states department of veterans affairs va in fayetteville,north carolina.to supplement the income he received from his work at the va,woods operated a tax preparation service,m r computer consulting and tax m r,out of his home.woods personally prepared clients income tax returns for a fee,which was deducted directly from the clients tax refunds.
according to the government theory of the case,woods added fraudulent information to clients tax returns in order to qualify the clients for substantial tax refunds.for example,the evidence showed that woods listed on the returns various educational,business,and travel expenses never incurred by his clients.also,woods falsely listed as dependents on several clients tax returns the names of individuals who were patients of the va,including their birth dates and social security numbers.the government witnesses testified that woods charged clients a premium for each false dependent included on a tax return.the government maintained that woods stole the names of the false dependents from the va computer system,to which he had access through his employment as data warehouse manager.
woods represented himself at trial,with the assistance of counsel,and testified in his own defense.woods denied that he had stolen any identities from the va and stated that the incorrect information he entered on his clients tax returns was provided by the clients themselves.
after a trial,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts the district court sentenced woods to a total of months imprisonment and a period of supervised release,and ordered woods to pay restitution to the irs in the amount of.woods filed a timely notice of appeal.
woods argues on appeal that the district court improperly restricted woods constitutional right to testify in his own defense by sustaining the government repeated objections to portions of his testimony that his substantial rights were affected by the prosecutor improper statement during closing argument that woods had lied under oath when testifying that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding evidence of woods good character and that the district court gave an erroneous instruction on the elements of the identity theft offenses.we address each argument in turn.
woods first argues that he effectively was denied his constitutional right to testify in his own defense because,during his testimony,the district court repeatedly sustained the government objections and otherwise limited his presentation of evidence.a defendant right to testify in his own defense is rooted in the constitution due process clause,compulsory process clause,and fifth amendment right against.rock arkansas,d.nevertheless,this right is not unlimited,united states midgett,cir citation omitted,and a defendant choosing to appear pro se still must comply with substantive and procedural courtroom rules,faretta california,d.see also chambers mississippi,d explaining that,in presenting witnesses in his defense,a defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.
a district court thus may impose reasonable restrictions on a defendant ability to present relevant evidence.united states scheffer,d.however,restrictions of a defendant right to testify may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.rock,at.
district courts generally enjoy broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence,see united states medford,cir,as well as in the realm of trial management,which is quintessentially the province of the district courts,united states smith,cir.see also saudi northrop grumman,cir.in the exercise of these responsibilities,district courts are charged with the duty of maintaining reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence in order to promote the function of the trial,to avoid wasting time,and to protect witnesses from harassment.a see also united states gravely,cir explaining that district courts have broad discretion to control the method of questioning witnesses and the presentation of evidence to ensure that witnesses are treated fairly,and that the search for truth is not impaired by presentation of extraneous,prejudicial or confusing material.
employing these principles,we consider whether the district court acted in an arbitrary fashion,or restricted woods testimony to a degree not warranted by the demands of evidentiary and trial management.during the course of woods direct testimony,the government lodged objections,some of which were overruled by the court.the majority of the government objections rested on the ground that woods was arguing to the jury rather than testifying about factual matters,was summarizing other witnesses testimony,or was testifying concerning facts about which he had no personal knowledge.
in response to these repeated objections,the district court advised woods to just relate the facts,and to confine his testimony to the facts about what happened.the court further explained to woods that we do want to argue about whether a previous witness said something or did say something.the court additionally informed woods that he would have an opportunity to make arguments to the jury at a later time.at various other points during woods testimony,the court responded to the prosecutor that woods should be allowed some leeway in presenting his testimony.
woods argues that,as a result of these rulings,the district court prevented him from developing certain themes of his defense during his testimony.these themes included that woods entered on the tax returns only information provided by his clients concerning their dependents that woods employees prepared certain fraudulent tax returns without his knowledge that woods holds the army and veterans in high regard and,therefore,would not have stolen the identities of disabled veterans that woods values his personal integrity and respects the law,and has cultivated a reputation for honesty and abiding the law and that certain checks woods received from clients did not represent payment for false dependent data,but were given in repayment of loans woods had made in anticipation of the clients tax refunds.
despite the government objections,woods was permitted to testify regarding a range of issues assisting his defense,including several of the subjects he claims on appeal he was not allowed to develop.for example,in his testimony,woods flatly denied that he had stolen personal data of va patients and had used that information on his clients tax returns.he further stated that the checks he received from clients were for loan repayments.
additionally,woods explained that his assistant,who was one of the government witnesses,had access to everything in his tax business.woods related that his assistant prepared certain tax returns without woods supervision,thereby implying that she was involved in the scheme.woods further testified that he had received from his clients all the information he entered on the tax returns,that the clients verified that they were the source of this information by signing the irs forms,and that he always personally reviewed the tax returns with his clients.finally,woods attested to his own good character and integrity.
after reviewing the entire record,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in its evidentiary rulings,did not act arbitrarily,and did not impose limitations on woods testimony that were disproportionate to legitimate concerns of evidentiary reliability or trial management.as an appellate body,we appreciate that the dynamic nature of jury trials requires special vigilance on the part of district courts to manage effectively the participation of parties,witnesses,jurors,and spectators.we also recognize the difficult role of the district court when a defendant chooses to represent himself,especially when such a defendant elects to testify in his own defense.
in light of these challenges,we decline to find reversible error in the absence of plainly arbitrary conduct by the district court.here,there is no such conduct,and the present record affirmatively demonstrates that the district court expressly granted woods considerable leeway in presenting evidence and allowed him to offer substantial exculpatory testimony.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not deprive woods of his constitutional right to testify in his own defense.
woods argues,nevertheless,that he is entitled to a new trial because he was prejudiced by an improper statement that the prosecutor made during closing argument.however,woods did not object to the prosecutor statement at trial and,therefore,we are confined to plain error review.see united states olano,d.under this standard,woods must show not only that the district court committed an error that was plain,but also that the error affected woods substantial rights thereby impacting the outcome of his trial.united states gonzales flores,cir citing olano,at.further,even when a defendant establishes the above elements of plain error,we may nevertheless decline to notice the error unless it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quotation marks and alteration omitted.
as discussed above,the government maintained that woods profited from his fraudulent scheme by charging clients a premium for the inclusion of false dependent information on those clients tax returns.woods,however,testified that the sums represented repayments of loans he had made to clients before they received their tax refunds.the part of the government closing argument at issue here occurred when the prosecutor stated 
so,woods was right in the middle of getting these payments for the fake dependents and he lied about it under oath when he testified this morning emphasis added.
according to woods,this statement was improper and constituted reversible error.in response,the government argues that the statement was neither improper nor prejudicial.
first,we disagree with the government contention that this statement was proper.we long have rebuked government counsel for making inflammatory statements of this nature.twenty years ago,in united states moore,cir,we strongly criticized a prosecutor statement during closing argument that the crime was compounded when the defendant comes into a federal court,takes the oath on the bible,and lies.at.we explained unequivocally that it is highly improper for the government to refer to a defense witness as a liar,and further noted that we had continually admonished the government not to engage in such conduct.id.at emphasis added.applying plain error review in moore,we held that the prosecutor statement was error that was plain,and we strongly admonished the government to clean up its act,issuing the warning hopefully for the last time.id.at see also united states weatherless,cir noting that government counsel multiple statements that the defendant was a liar and a loser fell well beneath the standard which a prosecutor should observe united states loayza,cir it is improper for a prosecutor to directly express his opinion as to the veracity of a witness.quoting moore,at.
our reasoning in moore applies with equal force in the present case,because any statement of personal belief jeopardizes the integrity of the trial process.loayza,at quoting united states harrison,cir.when a prosecutor comments on the veracity of a witness,the prosecutor statement presents two discrete risks of improperly suggesting to the jury that the prosecutor personal opinion has evidentiary weight and of improperly inviting the jury to infer that the prosecutor had access to information,not available to the jury.united states moore,cir.
the gravity of these risks is amplified in the case of a criminal defendant exercising his constitutional right to testify in his own defense.here,by stating that woods lied under oath,the prosecutor suggested to the jury that woods abused this constitutional right and attempted to manipulate the outcome of the trial to avoid being held responsible for his true actions.based on these grave concerns,we reiterate our holding in moore that error that is plain results when a prosecutor states that a defendant has lied under oath during trial,and we conclude that such an error occurred here 
in addition to establishing error,and that the error was plain,woods also must show that his substantial rights were affected by the error in order to obtain a new trial.olano,at.when the evidence of guilt is overwhelming and a perfect trial would reach the same result,a substantial right is not affected by a particular error.united states godwin,cir.
in conducting this prejudice inquiry,we apply a test.we consider 
the degree to which the prosecutor remarks have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused whether the remarks were isolated or extensive absent the remarks,the strength of competent proof introduced to establish the guilt of the accused and whether the comments were deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters.
harrison,at see also moore,at.
at the outset,we recognize that the prosecutor statement risked prejudicing the outcome of the trial due to the importance of woods credibility regarding the issues in the case.the government proof relied heavily on the testimony of woods former clients and employees who either were complicit in,or at least benefitted from,the fraudulent scheme.indeed,woods defense theory,that he merely transcribed the information provided by his clients,made woods credibility an important issue particularly because woods did not offer any other witnesses in his defense 
despite the government concession that the prosecutor remark was deliberate,we conclude that the three other elements of our prejudice inquiry demonstrate that the outcome of the trial was not affected by the improper statement.the comment was relatively isolated in nature and,most importantly,the statement did not prejudice woods given the strength of competent proof introduced against him that both overwhelmingly supported a finding of guilt and undermined his credibility.see harrison,at.
woods credibility was damaged significantly by documentary evidence presented by the government that was in outright conflict with his testimony.that documentary evidence included copies of numerous checks and money orders written by clients in the amount of and,which undermined woods contention that he charged only between and to prepare each return.the evidence of those checks and money orders also undermined woods flat denials that he had received any payments of for tax services 
some of these checks included the word taxes on their memo line.when confronted with the evidence of the payments on,woods testified that he was unable to recall specific transactions.upon being shown actual notations on some of the checks,bearing the word taxes on the memo lines,woods still denied that the payments related to preparation of the clients taxes.
woods also stated that he always reviewed completed returns with clients,whereas multiple clients testified that woods did not show them the returns once they had been completed.the jury obviously recognized that this body of evidence was irreconcilable,and that woods testimony was contrary to that of all the other evidence in the case.see moore,at.
additionally,the testimony of various government witnesses,including that of several clients and victims,strongly supported the jury finding of guilt.for example,one of woods clients,april holder,testified that she understood,before using m r services for the first time,that she could purchase dependents from woods for.after woods entered on holder tax return the name of a false dependent whom holder did not know,woods reviewed the return with holder line by line,including the false dependent information.after holder received her refund,she personally delivered in cash to woods for the dependent fee.the government also presented the testimony of twelve clients whose returns were falsified by woods,and of eight victims whose identity information was fraudulently included to show them as dependents on woods clients returns.
two of woods employees who participated in the fraudulent scheme also testified at the trial as government witnesses.one employee,larry williams,testified that woods directed him to collect payments from clients who had obtained additional dependents on their tax returns,which sums were charged in addition to the basic tax preparation fee deducted from the refunds.williams explained that when clients asked him during the intake process at woods home about purchasing dependents,williams referred such inquiries directly to woods.williams also testified that he had observed on woods desk a list of various names,dates of birth,and social security numbers,some of which had been crossed out,further implicating woods as a knowing participant in the scheme.
woods assistant,montina ladson,who prepared false tax returns under woods direction and testified pursuant to a grant of immunity,described a conversation with woods in which she told him that certain clients had asked her about purchasing dependents.woods responded that he had helped a couple of people out.following this conversation,when clients asked to obtain a false dependent,ladson referred the question to woods.in response,woods sometimes provided ladson the names,dates of birth,and social security numbers of purported dependents for her to include on the clients returns and,at other times,woods completed the falsified returns himself.ladson specified that she knew that the identities of these dependents supplied by woods were false.
ladson further testified that in march,when woods was travelling in connection with his work for the va,ladson processed m r pending tax returns.she explained that,during that time,woods instructed her to insert the names of false dependents on returns he had started,and sent ladson via email a list of the identifying information that should be included 
in light of this volume of evidence of woods guilt,we conclude that,even in the absence of the prosecutor improper statement,woods credibility would have been significantly weakened by the direct conflict between his testimony and that of the several government witnesses and the documentary evidence.moreover,a considerable portion of the government evidence directly contradicted woods theories of defense.accordingly,although we strongly criticize the prosecutor argument that woods had lied under oath,we conclude that woods substantial rights were not violated and that this trial error does not warrant reversal of woods convictions.
woods next contends that the district court erred when it declined to include in its jury charge the pattern jury instruction regarding the character of the accused.we review a district court decision whether to give a particular jury instruction for abuse of discretion.united states lighty,cir.a district court commits reversible error in refusing to provide a proffered jury instruction only when the instruction was correct was not substantially covered by the court charge to the jury and dealt with some point in the trial so important,that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to conduct his defense.id.citation omitted.however,an error in jury instructions will mandate reversal of a judgment only if the error is determined to have been prejudicial,based on a review of the record as a whole.wellington daniels,cir.
during the charging conference,woods requested that the jury be given the following instruction regarding his good character 
the defendant has offered evidence of his good general reputation for honesty and integrity.the jury should consider this evidence along with all the other evidence in the case in reaching a verdict.
evidence of a defendant reputation,inconsistent with those traits of character ordinarily involved in the commission of the crimes charged,may give rise to a reasonable doubt since the jury may think it improbable or unlikely that a person of good character for honesty or integrity and for being a citizen would commit such crimes.
a defendant may introduce affirmative testimony that the general estimate of his character is so favorable that the jury may infer that he would not be likely to commit the offense charged.michelson united states.see also.a a a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant pertinent character trait mannix united states,cir explaining proper character evidence instruction.in the present case,woods offered two sources of evidence regarding his good character his own testimony and the testimony of his supervisor at the va,milton harrison,whom the government called in its and woods questioned on.
woods testified that his integrity has never been in question about my service and my dedication to my work i worked hard.harrison agreed on that woods integrity was never called into question regarding his work at the.harrison also acknowledged in his testimony his previous statement that he would be surprised to learn that woods had been abusing his position at the.
on redirect examination,harrison responded to the government questions as follows 
q harrison,woods asked you if his integrity had been called into question at work.do you remember that 
q is it fair to say that the information that you been presented with here calls into question the defendant integrity 
the district court ultimately declined to give woods proffered instruction on character evidence,finding that harrison equivocated in his opinion of woods good character.
the government contends on appeal that,by his testimony on redirect examination,harrison retracted his opinion of the defendant character and,thus,that harrison testimony did not support woods request that a character instruction be given to the jury.we disagree with the government argument.
the prosecutor question,referenced above,effectively required that harrison assume woods guilt for purposes of influencing the content of the character testimony,a practice clearly prohibited under our precedent.we repeatedly have held that questions put to defense character witnesses that assume a defendant guilt of the crime for which he was charged are improper.united states mason,cir citing united states siers,cir.harrison response to the improper question therefore did not provide a valid basis on which to refuse the proffered character instruction.
even assuming that harrison overall testimony was equivocal in its endorsement of woods character,it nevertheless remained the province of the jury to determine the credibility of his testimony and the proper weight to afford that particular evidence,including consideration of any inconsistencies in harrison testimony.see united states dinkins,cir noting that it is the jury province to weigh the credibility of the witnesses,and to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.therefore,we hold that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to give the requested character evidence instruction
