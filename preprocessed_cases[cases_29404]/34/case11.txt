shortly after respondent cheever was charged with capital murder,the kansas supreme court found the state death penalty scheme unconstitutional.state prosecutors then dismissed their charges to allow federal authorities to prosecute him.when cheever filed notice that he intended to introduce expert evidence that methamphetamine intoxication negated his ability to form specific intent,the federal district court ordered cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.the federal case was eventually dismissed without prejudice.meanwhile,this court held the state death penalty scheme constitutional,see kansas marsh.the state then brought a second prosecution.at trial,cheever raised a voluntary intoxication defense,offering expert testimony regarding his methamphetamine use.in rebuttal,the state sought to present testimony from the expert who had examined cheever by the federal district court order.defense counsel objected,arguing that since cheever had not agreed to the examination,introduction of the testimony would violate the fifth amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself.the trial court allowed the testimony,and the jury found cheever guilty and voted to impose a death sentence.the kansas supreme court vacated the conviction and sentence,relying on estelle smith,in which this court held that a psychiatric examination violated a defendant fifth amendment rights when the defendant neither initiated the examination nor put his mental capacity in dispute.the court distinguished the holding of buchanan kentucky,that a state may introduce the results of such an examination for the limited purpose of rebutting a defense,on the basis that voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect under kansas law.
held the rule of buchanan,reaffirmed here,applies in this case to permit the prosecution to offer the rebuttal evidence at issue.
a in buchanan,the prosecution presented evidence from a evaluation to rebut the defendant affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.this court concluded that this rebuttal testimony did not offend the fifth amendment,holding that when a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense,the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.buchanan reasoning was not limited to the circumstance that the evaluation was requested jointly by the defense and the government.nor did the case turn on whether state law referred to extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense.
b the admission of rebuttal testimony under the rule of buchanan harmonizes with the principle that when a defendant chooses to testify in a criminal case,the fifth amendment does not allow him to refuse to answer related questions on.see fitzpatrick united states.here,the prosecution elicited testimony from its expert only after cheever offered expert testimony about his inability to form the requisite mens rea.excluding this testimony would have undermined buchanan and the core function of trial.
c this court is not persuaded by the kansas supreme court reasoning that cheever did not waive his fifth amendment privilege because voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect as a matter of state law.mental disease or defect is not the salient phrase under this court precedents,which use the much broader phrase mental status,buchanan,at.defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendant mens rea,mental capacity to commit the crime,or ability to premeditate.to the extent that the kansas supreme court declined to apply buchanan because cheever intoxication was temporary,this court precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed,as evidenced by the fact that the courts where buchanan was tried treated his extreme emotional disturbance as a temporary condition.
d this court declines to address in the first instance cheever contention that the prosecution use of the psychiatric examination exceeded the limit established by buchanan,see,at.
vacated and remanded.

kansas,petitioner scott cheever 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of kansas 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself the question here is whether the fifth amendment prohibits the government from introducing evidence from a mental evaluation of a criminal defendant to rebut that defendant presentation of expert testimony in support of a defense of voluntary intoxication.we hold that it does not.
on the morning of january,scott cheever shot and killed matthew samuels,a sheriff of greenwood county,kansas,and shot at other local law enforcement officers.in the hours before the shooting,cheever and his friends had cooked and smoked methamphetamine at a home near hilltop,kansas.samuels and multiple deputies drove there to arrest cheever on an unrelated outstanding warrant.
when one of cheever friends warned him that officers were en route,cheever rushed outside and tried to drive away,but his car had a flat tire.he returned inside and hid with a friend in an upstairs bedroom,holding a loaded caliber revolver.cheever then heard footsteps on the stairs leading up to the room,and he stepped out and shot samuels,who was climbing the stairs.after briefly returning to the bedroom,cheever walked back to the staircase and shot samuels again.he also shot at a deputy and a detective,as well as members of a local swat special weapons and tactics team that had since arrived.only samuels was hit.
the state charged cheever with capital murder.but shortly thereafter,in an unrelated case,the kansas supreme court found the state death penalty scheme unconstitutional.state marsh.rather than continuing to prosecute cheever without any chance of a death sentence,state prosecutors dismissed their charges and allowed federal authorities to prosecute cheever under the federal death penalty act of,et.
in the federal case,cheever filed notice that he intend ed to introduce expert evidence relating to his intoxication by methamphetamine at the time of the events on january,which negated his ability to form intent,malice aforethought,premeditation and deliberation.app.to pet.for cert.pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b,the district court ordered cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation by michael welner,a forensic psychiatrist,to assess how methamphetamine use had affected him when he shot samuels.welner interviewed cheever for roughly five and a half hours.
the federal case proceeded to trial.seven days into jury selection,however,defense counsel became unable to continue the court suspended the proceedings and later dismissed the case without prejudice.meanwhile,this court had reversed the kansas supreme court and held that the kansas death penalty statute was constitutional.kansas marsh.a second federal prosecution never commenced.
kansas then brought a second state prosecution.at the state trial,cheever presented a defense,arguing that his methamphetamine use had him incapable of premeditation.in support of this argument,cheever offered testimony from roswell lee evans,a specialist in psychiatric pharmacy and dean of the auburn university school of pharmacy.evans opined that cheever methamphetamine use had damaged his brain evans also testified that on the morning of the shooting,cheever was acutely intoxicated.according to evans,cheever actions were very much influenced by his use of methamphetamine.
after the defense rested,the state sought to present rebuttal testimony from welner,the expert who had examined cheever by order
