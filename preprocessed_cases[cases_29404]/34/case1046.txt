in the government charged gregg becker with one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,mail fraud,and wire fraud.see b.after a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york patterson,becker was convicted on both the substantive and the conspiracy counts.judge patterson sentenced him to months imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release becker appealed his conviction to this court,and we affirmed in an unpublished summary order filed october.we subsequently denied becker timely petition for rehearing on december.

background 
from to,becker was employed as a licensed securities broker at the melville,long island branch of investor associates ia.it was later revealed that several ia brokers had been engaged in a massive securities fraud during this period.the melville branch operated as a boiler room,where brokers were trained to cold call potential clients and pressure them into purchasing risky securities using a variety of deceptive sales tactics.in particular,brokers were instructed,and given incentives,to sell several highly speculative house stocks for which ia had participated in underwriting the initial public offerings.to generate interest from investors in the house stocks,ia brokers would follow sales scripts that contained false and misleading information about the stability of the securities and their potential for future growth.the brokers also lied to investors regarding their own backgrounds,level of experience in finance,and past performance.the demand created by these misrepresentations artificially inflated the share price of the house stocks,and the brokers collected large commissions.meanwhile,investors were discouraged from selling the stocks,even as share prices inevitably fell and they experienced substantial losses.
at trial,the government presented several recorded telephone conversations in which becker was heard lying to potential customers about his experience as a broker,his personal income and net worth,and the manner in which he was compensated for executing trades.on the recordings,becker was also heard making predictions regarding the growth potential of house stocks and encouraging investors to hold their shares despite falling prices.in addition,the government presented the live testimony of joseph mandaro and todd peterson,two cooperating witnesses who were former ia brokers,and of three of becker former customers who had sustained significant monetary losses.
on direct examination,mandaro testified to having told numerous lies to customers in connection with selling the house stocks.he further testified that he worked very close with gregg and that much of the information that becker gave to customers regarding his personal background and experience in the financial industry was false.mandaro testified that he made similar false statements regarding his own background to give customers the sense of a successful broker.about such statements,he testified i knew it was illegal.i knew it was a blatant lie.peterson testified similarly regarding lies he told customers regarding his personal background,as well as about his understanding that such lies were inconsistent with the training he had completed to become a licensed securities broker.both mandaro and peterson also testified that they lied to customers about the commissions they received on the sale of house stocks,about the length of time the customers could expect to hold the stocks before selling them,and about the likelihood that the house stocks would increase in value.
finally,the government read into evidence,over the defense objections,the transcripts of eleven plea allocutions by former ia brokers who described their intentional participation in the fraudulent scheme.these plea the government no doubt anticipated,at the time they were taken,would be powerful evidence but not subject to when introduced in a subsequent far beyond anything required by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.each allocuting defendant discussed in detail the specific practices used to carry out the fraud at the use of sales scripts to mislead customers into purchasing securities and the broker inflation of his own credentials to further deceive these details were largely identical among the allocutions.the allocutions also contained broad statements concerning the pervasiveness of the fraud.for example it was at investors associates that you could just let clients sell house stock.in addition,some defendants referred throughout their allocutions to actions we example,w e also used the high pressure sales tactics that was described in the charges potentially implying that all ia brokers were knowing participants in the conspiracy.
prior to admitting the plea allocutions,the court instructed the jury that it could consider them for proof that a conspiracy existed as charged in the indictment,but not to show that any defendant here was a member of that conspiracy.the court further instructed the jury to consider these allocutions only for the following two issues there was a conspiracy or a scheme to commit securities fraud,mail fraud,or wire fraud what,if anything,each of the persons testimonies you about to hear did to further the object of the conspiracy,if you do find that a conspiracy existed.the court reiterated these limiting instructions immediately after the transcripts were read,emphasizing that t here is no evidence in these statements that any of the defendants are.at the conclusion of the trial,the court again reminded the jury that it could consider evidence that other people pleaded guilty to these crimes as evidence that a conspiracy existed but could not consider the guilty pleas of others as evidence that any of the defendants were members of the alleged conspiracy.
the jury found becker guilty on both counts of the indictment.on direct appeal,we rejected becker arguments that the misrepresentations he made to investors regarding his background and experience were not material that the misrepresentations were not made in connection with the purchase or sale of the house stocks that the government failed to prove that becker had the necessary intent to support a securities fraud conviction and that the district court erred in admitting the plea allocutions as evidence of the charged conspiracy.as noted above,our summary order affirming the conviction was filed on october,and we denied becker petition for rehearing on december.although becker had until march,days after the supreme court decided file a timely petition for certiorari,see,he did not do so.
subsequently,becker petitioned for habeas relief,pressing several arguments including that the admission of the plea allocutions violated crawford.the district court denied the petition on all bases except the crawford claim.united states becker,cr.rpp,wl,at,becker i.the court rejected the government argument that crawford was inapplicable,reasoning that under teague lane,d,becker conviction did not become final until after crawford was decided and,as a result,crawford applied despite being.id.at see mungo duncan,cir.the court also determined that the admission of the plea allocutions violated crawford.becker i,at.in a later opinion,the court held that the crawford error was not harmless,and vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial.united states becker,cr.rpp,wl.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court decision to grant a habeas petition de novo and the court factual findings for clear error.hawkins costello,cir campusano united states,cir.
whether becker crawford claim is procedurally barred 
initially,the government contends that because becker challenged the admission of the plea allocutions on direct appeal and this court affirmed his conviction,law of the case precludes him from again raising the issue on collateral review.the law of the case ordinarily forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.united states quintieri,cir internal quotation marks omitted.applying this general principle,we have held that section may not be employed to relitigate questions which were raised and considered on direct appeal.cabrera united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,application of the doctrine remains a matter of discretion,not jurisdiction.see united states tenzer,cir observing that while law of the case informs the court discretion,it does not limit the tribunal power internal quotation marks omitted.we may find it appropriate to reconsider an earlier decision when we are confronted with an intervening change of controlling law,the availability of new evidence,or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states thorn,cir united states loschiavo,cir.
in our prior decision rejecting becker direct appeal,we relied on the principle that plea allocutions of unavailable are admissible at trial as statements against interest,and therefore fall within an exception to the hearsay rule.the supreme court uprooted that principle when it concluded that,w here testimonial statements are involved,we do not think the framers meant to leave the sixth amendment protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence.crawford,at.nevertheless,the government contends that crawford did not represent an intervening change of law because when it was decided,becker still had time to petition for certiorari 
we have never held that to establish an exception to the law of the case doctrine an intervening change of law must occur after a defendant time to petition the supreme court for certiorari has expired.while we have not squarely addressed the issue,supreme court precedent points us toward an opposite conclusion from the one the government urges.davis united states,d,held that law of the case did not preclude a petitioner from seeking relief based on a change in the law that occurred after his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.in davis,the change resulted from a decision of the ninth same court that had affirmed davis conviction on direct was issued while davis certiorari petition was pending.the supreme court denied certiorari in the first instance,but granted review after davis subsequent petition had been denied in the lower courts.id.at.in determining that davis habeas claim was not barred by the circuit court decision on direct appeal,the supreme court implied that the result would be different had the change in law occurred while the defendant still had time to appeal his conviction but failed to do so.id.at.discussing sunal large.the court did not,however,ascribe any significance to whether such a change occurred before or after the opportunity to petition for certiorari had expired.
the circumstances in davis are directly analogous to those here insofar as the change of law on which becker relies occurred after his direct appeal was decided but before his time to petition the supreme court for certiorari had expired.the fact that davis actually filed a petition for certiorari,whereas becker did not,is not dispositive.the rule the government advocates is that a change in law can not be considered intervening if it occurs before a defendant time to petition for certiorari expires,whether or not such a petition is filed.such a rule would contradict davis.
moreover,the fact that the supreme court initially denied certiorari on davis direct appeal,before granting it on collateral review,demonstrates why the mere possibility of supreme court review is inadequate to prevent the manifest injustice that might result if a defendant in davis position,or in becker,were precluded from raising a change of law in a habeas petition.although the government contends otherwise,we can not predict with any certainty whether the supreme court,in any individual case,will grant the purely discretionary writ of certiorari.pragmatism as well as precedent,therefore,supports our conclusion that an intervening change in law occurring after a defendant direct appeal has been exhausted,but before his time to petition for certiorari has expired,may give rise to an exception to the law of the case doctrine on collateral review.we further conclude that such an exception is justified in this case,where the application of crawford is necessary to prevent manifest injustice.tenzer,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the government maintains that even if crawford may be considered intervening,it does not apply retroactively to becker case.this argument is based on a misreading of teague lane,in which the supreme court held that u nless they fall within an exception to the general rule,new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.at.teague recognized two exceptions to the general rule of the first is for new rules that place certain kinds of primary,private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal authority to proscribe,and the second is for new watershed rules of criminal procedure.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.we have held that because the rule announced in crawford does not fall within either exception to teague,it should not be applied retroactively on collateral review.mungo,at.the supreme court recently confirmed this understanding.whorton bockting,d.
were this a straightforward issue of retroactivity,there is no question that becker claim would be barred.teague rule of,however,applies only to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.teague,at.in mungo,we noted that a conviction becomes final for the purposes of teague when the availability of direct appeal has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally decided.mungo,at quoting beard banks,d.timing was not an issue in mungo because crawford had been decided long after the date when petitioner conviction became final.id.at.here,becker still had time to petition the supreme court for certiorari when crawford was decided and,accordingly,his conviction had not become final for purposes of teague.is therefore beside the point,and we turn to the merits of the government appeal.
ii.crawford and harmless error analysis 
prior to crawford,we regularly approved the admission of an unavailable witness plea allocution to prove the existence and scope of a conspiracy,long as they were accompanied by particularized guarantees of rejected the argument that such statements violate the confrontation clause.see,united states dolah,cir united states petrillo,cir united states moskowitz,cir per curiam.our approval was generally conditioned on the district court excluding from the plea allocutions any statements before admitting them into evidence,as well as clearly limiting the jury consideration of the allocutions to the issues of whether a conspiracy existed and what,if anything,the declarant did to further the objects of the conspiracy.see petrillo,at moskowitz,at see also united states gallego,cir.
in crawford,the supreme court upended these precedents,and declared that the procedural safeguards we and other courts had relied on as guaranteeing the reliability of testimonial statements were inadequate to compensate for the defendant lack of an opportunity to the declarant.see crawford,at.where testimonial statements are at issue,the supreme court held,the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the constitution actually prescribes confrontation.id.at.we have since concluded that plea allocutions are testimonial,and are therefore subject to the requirements set forth in crawford.united states mcclain,cir.
whether or not the district court decision to admit the plea allocutions in becker case was consistent with the law of this circuit,there can be no doubt after crawford that their admission violated the confrontation clause.see id.at a plea allocution by a who does not testify at trial may not be introduced as substantive evidence against a defendant unless the is unavailable and there has been a prior opportunity for.thus,as the government essentially concedes,the district court admission of the plea allocutions was constitutional error 
not every such error,however,necessitates a new trial.after crawford,as before,we review confrontation clause violations under a harmless error standard.see united states gotti,cir united states reifler,cir.to establish harmlessness,it is the government burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.mcclain,at internal quotation marks omitted.the government argues that the admission of the plea allocutions was harmless a because the jury is presumed to have followed the district court limiting instructions,and b because there was overwhelming evidence of becker guilt.we disagree.
limiting instructions 
the district court instructed the jury that it could consider the plea allocutions only for the following two issues there was a conspiracy or a scheme to commit securities fraud,mail fraud,or wire fraud what,if anything,each of the persons testimonies you about to hear did to further the object of the conspiracy,if you do find that a conspiracy existed.the court added that t here is no evidence in these statements that any of the defendants are,and reiterated its instructions at the conclusion of trial.the government contends that these limiting instructions were sufficient to render any crawford error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
generally,we presume that juries follow limiting instructions.see,united states downing,cir united states salameh,cir.however,the presumption is overcome where there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court instructions and the evidence is devastating to the defense.united states jones,cir citing greer miller,d.stated another way,we have found it inappropriate to presume that a district court limiting instructions were obeyed when such instructions required jurors to perform mental acrobatics.see also united states mcdermott,cir although the district court here provided the jury with standard limiting instructions,we find that under the circumstances of the case,where the prejudicial spillover was so overwhelming,they can not be presumed to be effective.united states colombo,cir finding an overwhelming probability that,despite limiting instructions,the jury was unable to dispassionately consider evidence of rape and sodomy admitted as background in a trial for rico conspiracy and narcotics violations.
the government suggests that the present case is indistinguishable from united states snype,cir.on direct appeal from a conviction for conspiracy to commit bank robbery,the defendant in snype argued that the admission at trial of a plea allocution constituted reversible error under crawford which was decided after the guilty verdict but before sentencing.id.at.we observed that the district court carefully instructed the jury that it could consider the plea allocution only on two issues whether there was a conspiracy and what,if anything,the declarant did to further the objects of the conspiracy.id.at.the court also specifically instructed the jury that the allocution could not be used to determine snype membership in the charged conspiracy.id.the court went on to note that snype membership is an issue that you will have to decide based on other evidence,pointing out that the plea allocution did not name snype,and emphasized that the jury determination on this issue must not be based on statements in the allocution.id.
we held,in light of crawford,that it was error for the district court to admit the plea allocution,but concluded that such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.snype had essentially conceded the existence of the charged conspiracy.id.at.as to his assertion that the jurors could have used the allocution for a second,impermissible purpose by inferring,despite the court limiting instructions,that snype was the man referred to in the statements of his alleged found that it is snype who proposes mental acrobatics.id.at.accordingly,we saw no reason to deviate from our general presumption that the jury had followed the limiting instructions.id.at.
here,as in snype,becker essentially concedes the existence of the charged conspiracy he offered to stipulate to it at trial.however,ample grounds exist for distinguishing this case from snype.first,the sheer number of plea allocutions admitted to prove the conspiracy in this case is significant,and highlights the importance of such testimony to the government case.the number and repetitive nature of the allocutions also suggested that the conspiracy was it plausible for the jury to assume that becker was a participant simply by association with his.
moreover,the content of the plea allocutions was unusually and detailed,and touched directly on issues that were central to becker defense.to establish that becker committed a criminal securities fraud violation,as well as to establish his membership in the conspiracy,the government was required to prove that he acted willfully.united states cassese,cir see also united states aleskerova,cir to establish membership in a conspiracy,the government must prove that the defendant knowingly engaged in the conspiracy with the specific intent to commit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy.internal quotation marks omitted.we have defined willfulness in this context as a realization on the defendant part that he was doing a wrongful act under the securities laws.cassese,at quoting united states peltz,cir.
at trial,becker primary defense to both counts of the indictment was that he lacked mental culpability,and that his actions as a broker at ia were driven by credulity and inexperience rather than by greed.this theory was bolstered by the facts that becker was only nineteen years old when he began working at ia and that he left the firm within a year,purportedly upon realizing that his fellow brokers were engaged in illegal activity.
the plea allocutions significantly undermined this defense by suggesting that at least eleven other ia brokers had knowingly and willfully misled investors.the plea allocutions covered not only what each individual broker did to further the objects of the conspiracy,but also the knowledge and intent with which each engaged in fraudulent acts identical to those that becker allegedly committed.the brokers,for example,testified that they deliberately inflated their levels of experience when talking to customers,pressured customers into buying the house stocks then actively discouraged them from selling those stocks,and made baseless predictions regarding future performance.several brokers testified that they were in their early twenties and,like becker,had little or no experience in finance when they began working at ia.each admitted that he knew his acts were wrongful or illegal at the time he committed them.it would require no great leap in reasoning for a juror to assume that becker intent in misrepresenting to customers the value of the house stocks,as well as his own background and experience,matched that of the eleven other ia brokers who pled guilty to the same or similar conduct.
we do not have a great deal of difficulty concluding that,by introducing the allocutions,the government was inviting the jury to make precisely that improper assumption regar
