these consolidated appeals stem from a judgment rendered in ecuador against the chevron corporation.chevron has sought discovery in several american courts to obtain evidence that the ecuadorian plaintiffs and their lawyers fraudulently obtained that judgment.
in the actions before us,chevron sought documents from aaron and daria page,two attorneys who assisted steven donziger,the lead attorney representing the ecuadorian plaintiffs.when chevron subpoenaed documents relating to the ecuadorian judgment from the pages,they argued that some of those documents were privileged or protected from disclosure.the district court disagreed and ordered the pages to produce the requested documents.the pages,along with two of the original plaintiffs from the ecuadorian suit,now appeal.
for the reasons that follow,we dismiss appeal number and affirm the district court judgment in appeal number.
the story of the conflict between chevron and the residents of the lago agrio region of the ecuadorian amazon must be among the most extensively told in the history of the american federal judiciary.chevron naranjo,cir.we provide only small parts of that saga,which relate to matters in the two appeals now before us.
beginning in,a consortium including texaco petroleum company texpet and ecuador oil company now known as petroecuador managed operations in ecuador oriente region.texpet managed the consortium until,when it transferred operational control to petroecuador.texpet sold its interests two years later.
shortly after texpet withdrawal from ecuador,a group of ecuadorian plaintiffs sued texpet parent corporation,texaco,in the southern district of new york in.see aguinda texaco,cir.the aguinda plaintiffs alleged that texpet operations had polluted the rain forests and rivers in ecuador,by dump ing large quantities of toxic of the drilling process into the local rivers,burning them,dumping them directly into landfills,and spreading them on the local dirt roads,jota texaco,cir.
while aguinda was pending,texpet signed a settlement agreement with the government of ecuador and petroecuador the settlement agreement.under that agreement,texpet agreed to perform environmental remediation work in the oriente region.see in re chevron,cir.in exchange,the government of ecuador and petroecuador agreed to release texpet and texaco from claims relating to the consortium environmental impact.id.in,petroecuador and the government of ecuador executed a release stating that texpet had fulfilled its duty to remediate under the settlement agreement.
meanwhile,the new york court dismissed the aguinda case in on forum non conveniens grounds,and a group of largely the same ecuadorian plaintiffs refiled their suit against chevron in ecuador in this suit became known as the lago agrio litigation,while the plaintiffs in the suit are commonly termed the ecuadorian plaintiffs or,sometimes,the lago agrio plaintiffs.steven donziger,an american attorney who had earlier been involved in aguinda,assumed primary control as lead counsel in the lago agrio suit for the ecuadorian plaintiffs.
in,the ecuadorian plaintiffs obtained an billion judgment against chevron in the ecuadorian court the judgment recited that texpet had caused damage to the local environment,culture,and health it further held that chevron was responsible for that damage as texaco.chevron has since exhausted its appeals in ecuador,but the constitutional court of ecuador has agreed to consider an extraordinary action seeking further review of the judgment.
several years after the lago agrio litigation was filed,chevron initiated arbitration proceedings against the government of ecuador before the permanent court of arbitration at the hague,netherlands.see republic of ecuador hinchee,cir.chevron alleged that the ecuadorian government had violated the ecuador united states bilateral investment treaty in several ways relating to the lago agrio litigation.first,ecuador had not indemnified chevron as the settlement agreement required.id.second,ecuador had failed to notify the ecuadorian courts that chevron was released from liability in the lago agrio litigation under the settlement agreement.id.and third,the ecuadorian government had improperly interfered in the lago agrio proceedings on behalf of the plaintiffs.id.the arbitration proceeding is ongoing at the hague.
the texpet release aside,chevron also contends that the lago agrio proceedings were a fraud that donziger and others orchestrated.for instance,chevron alleges that donziger litigation team ghostwrote expert reports from richard cabrera,an impartial,damages expert.later,donziger and his associates are alleged to have commissioned a series of cleansing memos purportedly independent reports buttressing or cleansing cabrera findings that were actually based on the same fraudulent data.similarly,chevron contends that the ecuadorian plaintiffs attorneys forged an expert report from charles calmbacher,one of their own experts.donziger and his team then purportedly bribed the ecuadorian trial judge who authored the lago agrio judgment,offering to the judge in exchange for a favorable outcome.according to chevron,donziger and his associates then wrote the final judgment award,placing large verbatim portions of their own internal documents into the final opinion 
chevron maintains that the pages,who worked for donziger during the lago agrio litigation,directly involved themselves in this fraud.for example,chevron contends that the pages developed certain extortion strategies meant to pressure chevron into settling,such as instigating a bogus securities and exchange commission investigation,accusing chevron of committing genocide,and claiming that chevron violated the foreign corrupt practices act.the pages also allegedly contrived an entirely unsubstantiated damages estimate.and most importantly,the pages are said to have written or at least helped to write the draft alegato and the fusion memo,two internal documents that were then partially incorporated verbatim into the ecuadorian court final judgment.
to help establish its fraud and arbitration related claims,chevron sought discovery in the united states.by one court count,chevron brought at least early requests to obtain discovery from at least different parties.chevron,at.
chevron made these discovery requests under,which empowers federal district courts to order persons to give testimony or produce documents for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.intel advanced micro devices,d quotation marks omitted.chevron planned to use the discovery in the ongoing international arbitration proceedings and the pending ecuadorian appellate proceedings.
in a proceeding in the southern district of new york,chevron sought to compel donziger to produce certain documents and submit to a deposition.donziger moved to quash,arguing in part that the subpoenaed documents were privileged particularly under the and privileges.donziger,however,failed to file a privilege log when he raised these objections.
because donziger failed to file a privilege log,the new york district court determined on october,in a decision termed the donziger waiver that donziger had waived any of the privileges that he claimed.see in re application of chevron,d.nonetheless,the district court afforded donziger a chance to cure his waiver by filing a privilege log by a deadline.id.at.donziger failed to do so.in a subsequent decision on donziger motion for reconsideration,the court then reaffirmed that any claims of privilege with respect to the documents sought by the subpoena were waived.in re chevron,d.the court ordered donziger to produce each and every document responsive to the subpoenas irrespective of whether any privilege or other protection against disclosure has been or hereafter is or may be claimed.id.at.in so holding,the court stressed that donziger had deliberately delayed the proceeding with unsubstantiated privilege claims as a litigation strategy.see,id.at t he failure to submit a privilege log was a deliberate attempt to structure the response to the subpoenas in a way that would create the maximum possibility for delay.
the second circuit affirmed the donziger waiver,substantially for the reasons stated by the d istrict c ourt.lago agrio plaintiffs chevron,app x,cir.it further commended the exemplary manner in which the able district judge ha d discharged his duties.id.
chevron later sued donziger,the ecuadorian plaintiffs,and others in the southern district of new york in february.chevron complaint asserted claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act and certain new york statutes.
after a bench trial,chevron obtained a favorable judgment.the district court concluded that donziger and the ecuadorian lawyers he led had corrupted the lago agrio case in a variety of ways,including fabricating evidence,coercing judges,and bribing judicial officials.donziger,d at.accordingly,the district court enjoined donziger and the other defendants in the new york action from enforcing the lago agrio judgment in the united states.donziger,his law firm,and two of the ecuadorian plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the second circuit that appeal remains pending 
with the above background in mind,we move to the two appeals before us,which involve separate sets of subpoenas one set issued under in connection with the hague arbitration and ecuadorian appellate proceedings and the other under federal rule of civil procedure in connection with chevron new york suit.
pursuant to rule,chevron issued a pair of subpoenas to aaron and daria page on may,in the district of maryland the subpoenas,issued here as an ancillary proceeding related to chevron lawsuit in the southern district of new york,each included different document requests relating to the lago agrio litigation and its surrounding circumstances.
although the pages provided responses,objections,and some partial productions in june,chevron contended that these responses were inadequate.chevron then moved in the district of maryland to compel production,arguing that the pages had inappropriately asserted privilege primarily attorney privilege over some of the responsive documents.the pages and two ecuadorian plaintiffs,hugo gerardo camacho naranjo and javier piaguaje payaguaje,opposed chevron motion.
on august,a maryland magistrate judge granted chevron motion to compel,concluding that the pages asserted privileges did not apply for several reasons.of particular relevance,the magistrate judge determined that the donziger waiver acted to waive any privileges that applied to the pages documents the donziger waiver reached any legal work and privilege claims associated with donziger,and it made no difference that the pages rather than donziger physically possessed the documents given that they all worked on the same legal team for the same clients in the same proceedings.
thus,in september,the pages produced the documents over which they had asserted privilege but the production proved temporary.on september,for reasons not relevant here,the second circuit effectively stayed discovery in the new york action a few days later,the maryland district court responded by staying the maryland magistrate judge discovery order and administratively closing the maryland rule discovery proceeding.it further ordered chevron to return or destroy the pages documents.
however,several months after discovery in the new york proceeding was completely stayed,the new york district court lifted its stay and permitted discovery to go forward on all remaining counts in that case.in response,in january,the maryland district court lifted its own stay in the rule proceeding and instructed chevron to respond to objections to the magistrate judge decision,which the pages,naranjo,and payaguaje had previously filed.one month later,the district court overruled the objections and ordered the pages to produce the documents again.
the pages,naranjo,and payaguaje all timely appealed 
in november,while discovery pertaining to chevron new york suit was stayed,chevron filed a application in the district of maryland again seeking discovery from the pages.as it did in its other applications,chevron explained that the discovery was needed as part of its ecuadorian appeals and the arbitration proceeding at the hague.the application included all of the requests included in the pages rule subpoenas the pages,joined by naranjo and payaguaje,again asserted privileges from disclosure as to some of the responsive documents.
in january,the magistrate judge ordered the pages to turn over the documents that they possessed.as he did in the prior rule decision,the magistrate judge cited alternate,independent grounds,including the donziger waiver,in determining that any privileges applicable to page documents had been waived 
over objection,the district court affirmed the magistrate judge decision in a july,order.aaron page,naranjo,and payaguaje timely appealed 
to address the merits of these appeals,we must first be assured that we have jurisdiction to hear them.see united states wilson,cir s ubject matter jurisdiction must be decided before any other matter.both appeals present complicated questions concerning our jurisdiction and involve unique procedural postures.they also could stand in tension with the rule that d iscovery orders are inherently interlocutory and typically not appealable.nicholas wyndham int l,cir quotation marks omitted.
having considered our subject matter jurisdiction,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction in one appeal,number the rule proceeding,but have jurisdiction in the other,number the proceeding.
we first examine the appeal from the district court decision regarding chevron rule subpoenas.plainly,we are the court that must hear any appeal from the maryland district court decisions as to these subpoenas.although the rule subpoenas issued in connection with a proceeding in the second circuit,that court of appeals does not have jurisdiction over the district courts in the fourth circuit.only we may review a discovery order entered in the district of maryland.see explaining that appeals from district courts generally must be taken to the court of appeals for the circuit embracing the district.
nonetheless,we may review only final decisions of district courts.noohi toll,cir quotation marks and alteration omitted.final orders are those that end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.mccook metals llc alcoa,cir quotation marks and alteration omitted.this pragmatic rule carries out the twin purposes of avoiding the enfeebling of judicial administration that comes with undue delay and preserving the primacy of the district court as the arbiter of the proceedings before it.go computer,microsoft,cir quotation marks and alteration omitted.
discovery decisions bespeak their own interlocutory character,as they constitute only a stage in the litigation and almost invariably involve no determination of the substantive rights involved in the action.mdk,mike train house,cir.ancillary discovery proceedings granting discovery are no different.we have often and perhaps usually declined to permit immediate appeals in such actions,particularly where the party from whom discovery is sought is not a party to the primary underlying action.see nicholas,at we have held that the collateral order doctrine does not authorize appeal from an order granting discovery from a nonparty in an ancillary proceeding.emphasis in original mdk,at dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction where sought review of order that granted discovery in ancillary proceeding related to underlying proceeding.this is just such an ancillary action,as chevron seeks its rule discovery from two the pages in aid of an underlying action in the southern district of new york.our cases hold that a who wishes to appeal from an order granting discovery should resist the discovery order,be cited for contempt,and then challenge the propriety of the discovery order in the course of appealing the contempt citation.mdk,at.the pages,however,have not taken that route.
instead,the pages,naranjo,and payaguaje argue that we should find jurisdiction under the perlman exception,which has sometimes been applied to permit an appeal from a discovery order directed at a disinterested third party.church of scientology of cal.united states,d citing perlman united states.that type of discovery order is immediately appealable because the third party presumably lacks a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance.see also in re pruett,cir explaining that an uninvolved third party has little or no incentive to risk contempt by resisting a discovery order eastland serviceman fund,d marshall,concurring stating that a neutral third party could not be expected to risk contempt.
assuming but not deciding that the perlman exception could be applied here,it nonetheless fails to establish subject matter jurisdiction because the appellants do not meet its requirements.
the pages may not rely upon perlman,as perlman does not permit an appeal by the.rather,perlman has come to mean that a may step in and appeal when a disinterested subpoena target is about to relinquish the privileged documents.see,united states under seal,cir w hen the one who files the motion to quash,or intervenes,is not the person to whom the subpoena is directed,and the movant or intervenor claims that production of the subpoenaed documents would violate his privilege,the movant or intervenor may immediately appeal.in other words,perlman has permitted a to move into the appeal in the place.see,in re air crash at belle harbor,on,cir t he perlman exception is relevant only to appeals brought by the holder of a privilege where the disputed subpoena is directed at someone else.emphasis in original application of am.tobacco,cir perlman may not be extended to permit the party in possession of the subpoenaed documents to appeal prior to contempt simply because other persons might have been able to do so.conversely,in an ancillary proceeding,like the pages,must follow the path that we have already described they must either obey its commands or refuse to do so and contest the validity of the subpoena if they are subsequently cited for contempt on account of their failure to obey.united states ryan,d.
although the pages may not invoke perlman,that does not resolve whether the ostensive,naranjo and payaguaje,may use the doctrine to establish jurisdiction for their appeal.after all,may invoke the perlman exception if the are truly disinterested.on the other hand,naranjo and payaguaje can not invoke perlman as a jurisdictional ground for their appeal if the pages are not truly disinterested.
we have deemed attorneys disinterested in some prior cases.see,in re grand jury subpoena,cir in re grand jury subpoena,cir.the appellants suggest that we have adopted a blanket rule that counsel whether current or former are indeed within the perlman sphere.appellants supp.br.we disagree our cases do not take that kind of categorical approach.and in fact,we would very likely err in doing so,as lawyers and their clients often share substantial interests that sometimes keep the attorneys from being truly disinterested.church of scientology,at.a ttorneys assume an ethical obligation to serve their clients interests,and t he effective congruence of interests between clients and attorneys counsels against treating attorneys like other nonparties for purposes of appeal.cunningham hamilton,d.
on this record,we see at least three reasons to conclude that the pages are not disinterested in the perlman sense.
first,the pages have asserted their own privilege,arguing that the subpoenaed documents are protected work product.the attorney,however,holds the work product privilege along with the client.see,solis food emp rs labor relations ass n,cir.where the petitioner asserts its own interests in the work product,it has the requisite incentives to risk contempt.in re flat glass antitrust,cir quotation marks omitted in other words,the pages have put their own interests in play,so it is reasonable to expect the pages to defend them.
second,the pages have evidenced a willingness to face a contempt sanction.a party might be entitled to invoke perlman if that party is able to prove that the subpoenaed party will comply with an order enforcing the subpoena regardless of whether the subpoenaed witness is a current attorney,is a former attorney,or has some other relationship with the interested party.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.but the appellants here have not tendered proof of that nature.in fact,aaron page has recently litigated a contempt sanction in the district court in this proceeding,which directly arose from his failure to comply with chevron subpoena.we view this contempt contest as one of the surest signs that the pages will not simply produce all the documents to avoid a sanction.
and lastly,we can not ignore this case broader context.the subpoenaed party is more likely to risk contempt where he has either a particularly close relationship to the putative or a personal interest in nondisclosure of the material.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.here,both circumstances exist.the pages are not detached professionals who rendered disinterested services to the ecuadorian plaintiffs.quite the contrary they are alleged to have proactively assisted in a broad fraudulent effort engineered by their direct employer in fact,given that the lawyers are alleged to have committed greater misdeeds than any attributed to the clients,the pages might have a more substantial interest in keeping the documents confidential than do the ecuadorian plaintiffs these circumstances alone would prevent us from calling the pages disinterested.in re grand jury subpoena,cir refusing to find a subpoenaed person disinterested where the person was a potential target of the underlying action in re klein,cir f our of the subpoenaed lawyers are suspects themselves,and they have every reason to resist disclosure.
because the pages are not disinterested,naranjo and payaguaje can not rely upon perlman to establish jurisdiction to hear their appeal from the district court rule order.
in sum,if perlman applies at all,it applies only when there exists a real possibility the third party will not risk being found in contempt and will turn over the subpoenaed documents.united states jones,cir.no such possibility exists here.therefore,the perlman exception does not apply in this case.accordingly,we lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the district court order on chevron rule subpoenas because the finality rule prohibits such an interlocutory appeal.
we next consider our jurisdiction in the appeal from the district court decision on chevron application.here again,we are the only court that could properly hear an appeal from the maryland district court decision.the only real question is whether the decision below is considered final,allowing us to hear it.
we have not previously considered whether a decision on a application is immediately appealable.but on at least one prior occasion,the court has reviewed an order granting discovery under that statute without the need for a contempt sanction.see generally in re letter of request from amtsgericht ingolstadt,fed.republic of germany,cir.w hile we are not bound by previous exercises of jurisdiction in cases in which our power to act was not questioned but was passed sub silentio,neither should we disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper in previous cases.washlefske winston,cir quotation marks omitted.
every other circuit court that has considered the jurisdictional issue presented here has found subject matter jurisdiction to hear an immediate appeal from an order on a application.see,heraeus kulzer,gmbh biomet,cir in re premises located at ne,bellevue,cir bayer ag betachem,cir.in addition,at least two other circuit courts have found jurisdiction to hear appeals related to the very same dispute before us.see in re application of the republic of ecuador,cir holding that the district court decision on ecuador application was a final,appealable decision chevron berlinger,cir same as to application filed by chevron.
the reasoning and conclusions in this unanimous body of case law are convincing.in as much as applications aid foreign proceedings,we are not concerned with any underlying merits proceeding in the united states.lacking an underlying proceeding,many of the concerns that make us reluctant to review discovery orders on an interlocutory basis disappear.see united states sciarra,cir t he phrase interlocutory necessarily implies some underlying proceeding from which the challenged discovery is an.the many cases that characterize discovery orders as interlocutory become inapposite,therefore,when there simply is no underlying suit to disrupt.the rationale for requiring a witness to incur a contempt order as a jurisdictional predicate similarly breaks down when there is no central proceeding from which he must be severed.
because the order is a sufficiently final order,we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear an immediate appeal from a district court order granting discovery under that statute.we accordingly proceed to the merits of that appeal.
section affords the district courts wide discretion in responding to requests for assistance in proceedings before foreign tribunals.al fayed united states,cir quotation marks omitted.on appeal,we generally review a district court order under that statute using the familiar standard.amtsgericht ingolstadt,at.a district court abuses its discretion by resting its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact,or by misapprehending the law with respect to underlying issues in litigation.scott family dollar stores,cir.
first argues that the magistrate judge determined that his claimed privileges had been waived before the issues were ripe.page says that it was too early to decide these issues because the subpoena had not yet issued and neither the pages nor the ecuadorian plaintiffs had yet raised any privilege objections.
ripeness concerns the appropriate timing of judicial intervention.cooksey futrell,cir quotation marks and internal marks omitted.traditionally,we consider the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.id.quotation marks omitted.a case is fit for adjudication when the action in controversy is final and not dependent on future uncertainties conversely,a claim is not ripe when it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated.scroggins lee crossing homeowners ass n,cir.in addition,a fit case would ideally present purely legal issues.miller brown,cir.the hardship prong,on the other hand,is measured by the immediacy of the threat and the burden imposed on the parties.id.
considering fitness and hardship here,we find that the issues were ripe.the issues presented were largely legal ones that did not depend on future uncertainties.in effect,page argued as much at the application stage,saying that his privilege claims defeated chevron right to issue the subpoena.see,t he mere fact that chevron proposed subpoena impermissibly and primarily targets discovery of privileged information and other client confidences standing alone should lead this court to exercise its discretion to deny in toto chevron application.as for hardship,chevron demonstrated a need for the discovery in relation to the ongoing proceedings in ecuador and at the hague.
page asserts that the magistrate judge should have waited for him to produce a privilege log before deciding the privileges issues.we disagree.to begin with,page present argument strikes us as somewhat disingenuous given that he pressed the magistrate judge to decide the privilege issues without tendering a privilege log.moreover,the issues were adequately concrete and fully briefed,so the magistrate judge was free to decide them.the application sought documents essentially identical to those requested in the rule subpoenas that the same magistrate judge had earlier considered.see,opening br.noting parallels between the rule subpoenas and the applications.the magistrate judge thus had the privilege log from that prior proceeding to aid his decision.the parties and the court below well understood what issues were at play,and the court justifiably refused to delay its decision on those questions.
next,page contends that the donziger waiver should not have defeated his privilege claims and insists that the magistrate judge inappropriately extended the waiver across multiple proceedings.page bore the burden as to this argument.see united states bolander,cir the burden rests on the person invoking the privilege to demonstrate its applicability,including the absence of any waiver of it.
at the end of the day,we need not parse each point that page raises,as we conclude that the donziger waiver application in the maryland court served the interests of comity.
the doctrine of comity instructs federal judges to avoid stepping on each other toes when parallel suits are pending in different courts.smentek dart,cir see also gulf.ass ila deep seal local,cir explaining that comity requires federal courts to exercise care to avoid interference with each other affairs.we have invoked the doctrine,for instance,in explaining that a district court was precluded from issuing an injunction that conflicted with another district court decision in the same matter.see ulmet united states,cir.the supreme court,too,has called upon federal courts to apply principles of comity when faced with class certification decisions addressing a common dispute.smith bayer,d.by applying comity in these and similar circumstances,courts achieve at least two positive results avoiding an unnecessary burden on the federal judiciary and preventing the embarrassment of conflicting judgments.church of scientology of cal.dep t of army,cir see also mast,foos stover.explaining that comity should secur e uniformity of decision and discourag e repeated litigation of the same question.
were we to decline to apply the donziger waiver in this proceeding,we would significantly undermine the new york court decisions and potentially spawn conflicting judgments as to the very same subject matter.donziger was already required in new york to produce all the documents sought here.not even page contests that fact.other than questioning the period to which the donziger waiver would apply,page does not challenge the lower court reading of the waiver scope at all page concedes,for instance,that donziger was required to produce documents in his associates possession,including those now held by page.and page has never identified any specific document that he was required to produce by the maryland court that was not already subject to production by donziger in new york.page nevertheless invites us to deprive chevron of documents to which it is admittedly entitled under the new york court decisions,all without ever coming to grips with the fundamental inconsistencies that would result.we can not accept that invitation,as is a federal statute construed in a federal court system and the statute application must ultimately be uniform.republic of ecuador connor,cir.
what is more,the second circuit a circuit court has affirmed the donziger waiver,deciding the same fundamental issue before us today a fter an independent review of the record.lago agrio plaintiffs,app x at.even in less intimately related cases,we often consider whether our decisions fall in line with those of our sister circuits.see,treasury emps.union fed.lab.relations,cir in re frushour,cir.it seems all the more appropriate to do so here,where the parties are an issue pertaining to the same documents and affecting the same parties that were before the second circuit.after all,c ourts in one circuit should not grant relief that would cause substantial interference with the established judicial pronouncements of such sister circuits.united states amc entm t,cir colby penney,cir a posture somewhere in between some deference and complete deference is proper when cases in different circuits challenge the same practice of the same defendant.
to be sure,under the terms of,chevron was required to file a separate action when it determined to seek the documents from page.but that ministerial step should not alter the ultimate obligation to produce the same documents already under a production order.the same dispute may be framed in formally separ
