united states customs and border patrol cbp officers seized over two kilograms of heroin and kilograms of cocaine from ramón de jesús viera vehicle during a border search conducted upon de jesús viera return to puerto rico from the dominican republic.a jury convicted de jesús viera on one count of knowingly and intentionally possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of a and b a and one count of knowingly and intentionally importing to the united states heroin and cocaine in violation of a and b a,b.the district court sentenced de jesús viera to months imprisonment.
de jesús viera appeals,challenging both his conviction and his sentence.he argues the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence recovered from his vehicle,it erred when it instructed the jury on a willful blindness theory,and the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction.he also argues the district court erred by denying his request for an reduction for playing a minor role in the criminal activity.see b.
we affirm the conviction and the sentence.
because de jesús viera questions the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction,we relate the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states decologero,cir.
in the early morning hours of july,de jesús viera arrived in mayagüez,puerto rico,on a car and passenger ferry from santo domingo,dominican republic.cbp officer javier ruíz toro was working in the port primary inspection area at the time,and de jesús viera presented him with a puerto rico driver license,birth certificate,and customs declaration card.
as is customary practice for cbp officers,ruíz toro asked de jesús viera questions to determine whether to permit his entry or instead refer de jesús viera to secondary inspection.in response,de jesús viera stated that he had been in the dominican republic to visit friends for two weeks and had nothing to declare.ruíz toro asked de jesús viera how long he had owned his vehicle,a chevrolet el camino.de jesús viera replied that he had only recently purchased it.this raised ruíz toro suspicions because,by training and experience,he knew that drug trafficking organizations often registered vehicles in a driver name immediately before using that vehicle to import drugs.ruíz toro pressed further,inquiring as to whether de jesús viera had made any repairs to the vehicle,which de jesús viera denied.during this time,de jesús viera voice was trembling,his hands and legs were shaking,he was sweating profusely,and he avoided eye contact.de jesús viera explained his demeanor by telling ruíz toro that he had a hangover,but ruíz toro did not believe him.in light of de jesús viera demeanor and his vehicle recent registration,ruíz toro referred him to secondary inspection.
cbp officer jorge pitre,working in the secondary inspection area,asked de jesús viera about the duration and purpose of his trip to the dominican republic.de jesús viera said he had been in the dominican republic for two weeks in order to show off his new car,that he had not made any repairs to his car,and that he did not have anything to declare from the dominican republic.pitre noticed that de jesús viera avoided eye contact and was slightly shaking during the questioning.
after questioning de jesús viera,pitre used a machine that measures the density of an object when passed across the surface of that object,a buster,to inspect de jesús viera vehicle.the buster readings indicated that there was a dense object beneath the floor of one part of the vehicle.given the density readings and de jesús viera nervousness,pitre asked cbp officer isidro mercado to de jesús viera.
mercado asked de jesús viera about the purpose of his trip,the amount of money he took to and from the dominican republic,and whether he had made any repairs to his vehicle.de jesús viera responded that he had traveled with about to spend with girls,that he was returning with roughly,and that he had not made any vehicle repairs.mercado observed de jesús viera shaking and found him to be nervous.
officers mercado and pitre then visibly inspected the interior and undercarriage of de jesús viera vehicle.they opened the doors,pushed the seats forward,and saw a large speaker box mounted in the rear.when the box was removed,the felt lining underneath appeared freshly done.removing a portion of the felt,the officers smelled a chemical odor that suggested an adhesive agent had recently been used or the area had recently been painted.this contradicted de jesús viera claim that he had not made any repairs to the vehicle.meanwhile,another officer inspected its undercarriage,and informed the others that something is not right here,and that there was a bulge or compartment underneath the area of the felt lining.
cbp officer luis henríquez,who was present for the inspection of the car,left and returned with a dog to do a canine inspection of the vehicle.the dog searched the area and began scratching very aggressively at the portion of the vehicle that the officers were now focused upon,signaling there might be narcotics in that area.after obtaining permission from their superiors to do so,the officers drilled into the compartment which had been discovered on the underside of de jesús viera vehicle so as to allow a fiberoptic cable to peer inside the compartment.it was the drilling into the undercarriage on which the motion to suppress was based.
once the officers removed the drill bit,they noticed white powder on the bit tip.the officers administered a field test of the substance,and it tested positive for cocaine.
after placing de jesús viera in custody,the officers sawed open the hidden compartment and extracted packages.these packages were later determined to contain a total of kilograms of heroin and approximately kilograms of cocaine.they also discovered a device with exposed wires applying an electrical current to the wires caused the compartment to open,and reversing the wires and applying a current caused the compartment to shut.this type of device is commonly used in vehicles that have been modified specifically to transport contraband.
de jesús viera was charged with one count of possessing with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin and five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of a and b a,and one count of importing into the united states one kilogram or more of heroin and five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of a and b a,b.
on october,de jesús viera filed a motion to suppress the narcotics evidence seized from his vehicle on the grounds that the drilling of the vehicle was not a routine border search and that there was no reasonable suspicion to support the search.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge,who originally scheduled a suppression hearing but later cancelled it.the magistrate judge determined that the defendant has been fully heard on his motion with the submissions made,and that an evidentiary hearing is not required,and issued a recommended ruling denying de jesús viera motion to suppress on the grounds that the drilling qualified as a routine border search.
de jesús viera moved for reconsideration of the recommended ruling based on united states flores montano,which he said left open the possibility that the fourth amendment requires that some destructive property searches at the border be supported by reasonable suspicion,and united states robles,cir,which held,without the government taking a contrary position,that the drilling into a metal cylindrical container in that case was a search.the magistrate judge issued a second recommended ruling on december,rejecting de jesús viera arguments and denying de jesús viera motion for reconsideration.the second recommended ruling stated that any objections to it were due on january,but de jesús viera failed to make any objections.the district court adopted the ruling on february,agreeing that the cbp officers drilling of de jesús viera vehicle qualified as a routine border search that did not require reasonable suspicion.
the jury convicted de jesús viera on both counts following a trial from september,to september.de jesús viera filed a motion for judgment of acquittal,arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction,and a motion for a new trial,arguing procedural errors.the district court denied de jesús viera motions.
a sentencing hearing was held on february.de jesús viera argued that he was entitled to a reduction in his offense level because he played a minor role in the offense.see b.the district court found de jesús viera did not qualify for the role adjustment,setting his offense level at and yielding a guideline range of to months.the court imposed a sentence of months for each count,to be served concurrently.
denial of de jesús viera motion to suppress 
we first reject de jesús viera challenge to the district court denial of his motion to suppress the narcotics evidence seized from his vehicle.
by failing to object to the magistrate judge recommended ruling,de jesús viera has waived his fourth amendment claim.see united states lugo guerrero,cir.the magistrate judge december,recommended ruling explicitly advised the parties that civ.d required that any objections be made within ten days of receiving the ruling and that failure to do so would preclude further appellate review 
de jesús viera also argues the denial of his suppression motion constitutes plain error.see.b.the test for plain error requires that de jesús viera show there is an error the error is plain or obvious the error affected de jesús viera substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states gerhard,cir alteration in original quoting united states marcus,internal quotation marks omitted.he has failed to make such a showing.
the district court denial of the suppression motion was not error at all because there was more than reasonable suspicion to search the vehicle.the district court concluded that the drilling into the hidden compartment in the undercarriage of de jesús viera vehicle was a routine border search that did not require reasonable suspicion,see flores montano,and distinguished our holding in robles on its facts.we do not decide whether the search was a routine border search.even assuming the drilling was,it was supported by ample reasonable suspicion.see robles,at border search constitutional because supported by reasonable suspicion id.at we are not bound by the district court reasoning,and will affirm if the ruling below is supported by any independently sufficient ground.
a finding of reasonable suspicion requires a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity,united states espinoza,cir quoting ornelas united states,internal quotation marks omitted,which must be grounded in specific and articulable facts,id.quoting united states hensley,internal quotation marks omitted.the record shows an escalating sequence of events in which each step taken by the cbp officers led reasonably to the next that sequence was de jesús viera was visibly nervous and avoided eye contact with each of the officers in the chain he told the officers that he had recently purchased his vehicle,a recognized indicia the vehicle may have been used for drug trafficking de jesús viera gave inconsistent answers to the cbp officers when,telling one officer the purpose of his trip to the dominican republic was to visit friends,telling a second it was to show off his car,and telling a third it was to spend with girls the buster scan yielded abnormal readings indicating dense objects underneath the floor of the vehicle a search of the car interior found recent alterations or repairs,contrary to de jesús viera statement that he had not made any recent repairs an agent view of the underside of the vehicle showed an abnormal bulge underneath the area where the alterations to the car were found and finally,a canine inspection of the vehicle indicated the likely presence of narcotics.the cbp officers had an ample basis to reasonably suspect that de jesús viera was engaged in criminal activity that justified drilling into the secret compartment.de jesús viera fourth amendment claim fails 
willful blindness jury instruction 
de jesús viera next argues the district court erred by instructing the jury that,in deciding whether de jesús viera acted knowingly,the jury could infer that the defendant had knowledge of a fact if it found that he deliberately closed his eyes to a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him.because de jesús viera did not object to this instruction at trial,our review is for plain error.see estate of keatinge biddle,cir.there was no error.
a willful blindness instruction is appropriate if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge,the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance,and the instruction,taken as a whole,can not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.united states azubike,cir.de jesús viera defense hinged on a lack of knowledge of the drugs in his vehicle.
as an alternative to actual knowledge,the facts could be construed to suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance that the defendant heavily suspected what he was driving was a car with hidden narcotics.
as to the third element,the instruction stated 
in order to infer knowledge,you must find that two things have been established first,that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the existence of the drugs second,that the defendant consciously and deliberately avoided learning of that fact.that is to say,the defendant willfully made himself blind to that fact.
it is entirely up to you to determine whether he deliberately closed his eyes to the fact and if so,what inference,if any,should be drawn.however,it is important to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn the fact is not sufficient.there must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant of the fact.
the court instruction did not create the risk that the jury would employ a negligence standard the court explicitly instructed that finding de jesús viera acted negligently was not enough.
further,as discussed below,there was considerable evidence that de jesús viera had actual knowledge of the illegal narcotics in his vehicle.
sufficiency of the evidence 
de jesús viera argues the government failed to adequately prove that he acted knowingly and intentionally,an essential element under a or a.
w e must affirm the conviction if after de novo review of the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that a rational factfinder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.united states marin,cir.
viewed in the light most favorable to the government,the record contains ample evidence to support de jesús viera convictions.the jury could have inferred that de jesús viera acted knowingly and intentionally from testimony that the drugs were found in a car that de jesús viera both owned and was driving,notwithstanding the fact the drugs were concealed in a hidden compartment.see united states barnes,cir k nowledge of possession may be inferred by demonstrating dominion and control over the area where contraband is found.united states aponte,cir d efendant ownership and control over a vehicle are sufficient to infer possession of drugs therein even if the drugs are concealed.
the jury also could have inferred that de jesús viera knew of the presence of the illegal narcotics in his car from the sheer amount of drugs the cbp officers found.the jury heard testimony that cbp officers found kilograms of heroin and kilograms of cocaine in the car and that in july,the street value of a kilogram of heroin was at least and the street value of a kilogram of cocaine was at least.the jury could have drawn the inference that de jesús viera knew that the over million worth of drugs were in his car based on its common sense.
testimony regarding de jesús viera nervous behavior his trembling voice,his shaking hands and legs,his profuse sweating,his avoiding eye contact with the cbp officers was also supporting evidence of guilt.
de jesús viera urges that his convictions should be reversed because,he argues,the facts of his case are similar to those in united states pérez meléndez,cir,where i n light of the specific facts of that case we held that the evidence supporting a jury verdict was insufficient.id.at.de jesús viera is mistaken pérez meléndez is distinguishable from his case.
in pérez meléndez,two defendants,commercial truck drivers,were convicted in a jury trial of aiding and abetting each other to possess and distribute cocaine.id.at.the defendants were the driver and passenger of a truck carrying six wrapped pallets of reams of paper in which federal agents discovered hidden forty kilograms of cocaine.id.at.although the defendants offered inconsistent statements regarding whether the truck was rented and who rented it or whether it was borrowed from a friend,it was not disputed that neither of the defendants owned the truck.id.at.the defendants had picked up the shipment of paper,which had originated in the dominican republic,from an authorized company in puerto rico engaged in the lawful business of transporting shipments from,among other places,the dominican republic and which was not charged with any wrongdoing.id.at.the shipping company provided the defendants with documentation indicating that the customs and treasury departments had provided clearances on the shipment and what that shipment supposedly contained.id.
pérez meléndez is easily distinguished from the present case.the defendants in pérez meléndez did not own the truck or the reams of paper in which the drugs were hidden de jesús viera owned the car in which cbp agents found the cocaine and heroin.the drugs in pérez meléndez were found hidden amongst a shipment the defendants were paid by a legitimate freight company to pick up and deliver de jesús viera was engaged in no such seemingly legitimate activity and the drugs were found in his personal vehicle.the court in pérez meléndez observed that the defendants drove a common vehicle unequipped with weaponry or sophisticated technology,id.at,and that there was no evidence that defendants themselves resisted or otherwise tried to conceal the true nature of the shipment,id.at here,de jesús viera car had been modified to include a secret compartment that operated electronically to conceal contraband.
offense level reduction for minor role 
finally,de jesús viera argues the district court erred in denying his request for a downward adjustment in his sentence based on his minor role in the offense.see b.the defendant has not satisfied his burden of showing that finding is clearly erroneous.see united states bravo,cir.
the minor role guideline,b,is not applicable unless more than one participant was involved in the offense,see cmt,and de jesús viera had the burden of demonstrating that there were other,more culpable participants in the offense of conviction,see united states rosa carino,cir.the district court based its finding largely on the fact that de jesús viera had failed to meet that burden he offered no evidence that any other individuals participated in the criminal activity of conviction.
de jesús viera only challenge to the court determination is that the record could only support a finding that he was an expendable cog in a sophisticated trafficking operation.but it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to reject that unsupported assertion.
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
in,b was amended to allow parties fourteen days,not ten,to file objections to a magistrate judge recommended ruling.see id.subsequently,civ.d was amended to also allow fourteen days for objections.in,b was amended to allow parties fourteen days,not ten,to file objections to a magistrate judge recommended ruling.see id.subsequently,civ.d was amended to also allow fourteen days for objections.
de jesús viera concedes that he failed to properly object to the recommended ruling.nonetheless,he urges us to review the district court denial of his suppression motion under a de novo standard of review,reasoning that his motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge first recommended ruling clearly expressed his position that the cbp officers needed reasonable suspicion to justify drilling into his vehicle.we reject the argument.de jesús viera concedes that he failed to properly object to the recommended ruling.nonetheless,he urges us to review the district court denial of his suppression motion under a de novo standard of review,reasoning that his motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge first recommended ruling clearly expressed his position that the cbp officers needed reasonable suspicion to justify drilling into his vehicle.we reject the argument.
because the district court made no findings of fact in denying de jesús viera motion to suppress,we review the record de novo.see united states robles,cir.under plain error review,we may consider the entire record in assessing whether the district court decision affected de jesús viera substantial rights,not just the facts available to the district court at the time it ruled upon the suppression motion.see united states mescual cruz,cir.because the district court made no findings of fact in denying de jesús viera motion to suppress,we review the record de novo.see united states robles,cir.under plain error review,we may consider the entire record in assessing whether the district court decision affected de jesús viera substantial rights,not just the facts available to the district court at the time it ruled upon the suppression motion.see united states mescual cruz,cir.
we also reject de jesús viera argument that the district court erred by ruling on the motion to suppress without holding an evidentiary hearing.on appeal,de jesús viera raises this argument in a cursory fashion,and it is waived.see cortés rivera dep t of corr,cir.even if it were not waived,the argument would fail.in reviewing a claim that a defendant was erroneously deprived of an evidentiary hearing,we ask whether the defendant made a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt.united states vilches navarrete,cir.the district court has considerable discretion in determining the need for,and the utility of,evidentiary hearings,and we will reverse the court denial of an evidentiary hearing in respect to a motion in a criminal case only for manifest abuse of that discretion.united states allen,cir quoting united states staula,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that standard has not been met here.we also reject de jesús viera argument that the district court erred by ruling on the motion to suppress without holding an evidentiary hearing.on appeal,de jesús viera raises this argument in a cursory fashion,and it is waived.see cortés rivera dep t of corr,cir.even if it were not waived,the argument would fail.in reviewing a claim that a defendant was erroneously deprived of an evidentiary hearing,we ask whether the defendant made a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt.united states vilches navarrete,cir.the district court has considerable discretion in determining the need for,and the utility of,evidentiary hearings,and we will reverse the court denial of an evidentiary hearing in respect to a motion in a criminal case only for manifest abuse of that discretion.united states allen,cir quoting united states staula,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that standard has not been met here.
de jesús viera argues that knowledge that the car contained illegal drugs should not be attributed to him based on his ownership of the car because g overnment witnesses acknowledged that he likely owned the car in name only because contraband smugglers often register a car in a name to enable the to leave and enter the country.what de jesús viera fails to mention is that cbp officer ruíz toro told the jury that the practice described is one characteristic of drug trafficking organizations specifically,not contraband smugglers generally.de jesús viera ownership o
