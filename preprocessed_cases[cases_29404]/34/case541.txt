omar appeals from his sentence of months imprisonment for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of and a.finding his assignments of error to be without merit,we affirm sentence.
was a member of a organization that sold cocaine,crack cocaine,heroin,and marijuana at drug points in and around guayama,puerto rico.on september,following a investigation by federal and local law enforcement agencies,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against and.count one of the indictment alleged that from approximately april,to september,the defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of a and b a 
according to the indictment,supplied heroin and cocaine to the organization.he is one of only two suppliers identified in the indictment.at a detention hearing on october,the government described role in the conspiracy as significant.when asked about the quantity of drugs he had supplied to the organization at any given time,the government responded that 
has been involved since approximately or and he has supplied kilogram quantities,perhaps not one kilo each time there a drug transaction,perhaps half a kilo quantities,perhaps quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities.but we not talking grams here.we talking kilo or portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.
at a bail review hearing on january,the government again characterized role in the conspiracy as substantial and significant.the government described as a major cocaine supplier and informed the magistrate judge that it had three or four witnesses who had provided information that was a main supplier to the organization.the government indicated that was involved in the upper echelons of the organization,and that he had delegated authority to others to make transactions on his behalf.the government also introduced an organizational chart and asserted that acted as the right hand of the leader of the organization.
on july,pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement with the government.the parties agreed that would be held responsible for to kilograms of cocaine,which yielded a base offense level of under c.the parties also stipulated that would receive a increase for his role in the offense as an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor pursuant to c,and a decrease for his acceptance of responsibility under.
the parties anticipated a criminal history category of i,making the applicable sentencing range to months.although the plea agreement warned that his sentence was within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,the parties agreed that the government would recommend months of incarceration,while would request months.
the presentence report psr adopted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties in the plea agreement the psr described as the cocaine and marihuana supplier to the organization.notably,the psr stated that,as one of the suppliers to the organization,was more culpable than those members of the conspiracy who sold the narcotics.the psr also noted that under the terms of the plea agreement,had pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.
at the sentencing hearing on november,the court accepted the guideline calculations agreed to by the parties and adopted by the psr.defense counsel asked the court to sentence to the of the guideline range,or months.in support of this request for a sentence at the of the guideline range,defense counsel noted that had a,stable marriage and a daughter.counsel also argued that,despite having only a ninth grade education,had worked as a land surveyor,and had owned and operated a small grocery store since.defense counsel informed the court that she had information that a witness at the trial of several of had testified to the fact that after engaged in his grocery business,he withdrew from the conspiracy.
in arguing for the of the guideline range,defense counsel also asserted that the discovery provided by the government showed that was only a peripheral supplier.defense counsel stated that the evidence against consisted of two or three witnesses saying that he had supplied and of a kilogram,and that is the reason why the quantity of to kilograms of cocaine was stipulated to in the plea agreement.
in closing,defense counsel observed that was a offender and had shown a willingness to rehabilitate.she also noted that he was one of the first defendants to come forward and accept his responsibility.accordingly,defense counsel asked the court to consider a sentence at the of the guideline range.
the government,on the other hand,asked the court to sentence to the of the guideline range.the government stated 
as y our honor knows well,having presided over the two month trial of several,there were numerous drug points,between guayama and salinas,at least ten.the drugs had to come from somewhere,y our honor,i believe the court heard testimony that there were numerous sources,one being one of the defendants that stood trial and one being the man that stands here before you i submit that the testimony,discovery,and all of the evidence that the government has and presented at trial indicates that were this defendant to go to trial,the government would be seeking a base offense level of to start with.in this case we are seeking a much lower amount.
there were quantities frankly beyond the amount stipulated in the plea agreement and i submit that the government is bound by the plea agreement to recommend a maximum of months i would ask the court to impose the sentence that the government now recommends.
defense counsel countered that the quantity of drugs that had been stipulated to in the plea agreement was based on the discovery she had received from the government.
the court imposed a sentence,stating that it had taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence report,including the nature of the offense and all of the testimony that the court received in the course of trial.defense counsel objected,asking the court to reconsider in light of the court reliance on trial testimony.the court explained 
i said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial.you are talking about and quarters,that was for a long time that cocaine was being supplied.so the amount of from the evidence that i recall,is more than,i would say more than generous.
defense counsel responded 
but the question is as it pertains to him.i was not privy to that information and i do think it is fair that i am standing here requesting the lower end of the guideline range and then not have that information to be able to refute that.i am sure there were other suppliers in the indictment.
the court declined to reconsider 
counsel,the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary.taking into consideration the presentence report,the position of this defendant within the organizational chart which you knew,you had,and all of the evidence that i have before me.i am exercising my discretion and sentencing to the upper end.
defense counsel expressed her concern that the court was not taking into consideration employment history or status as a offender.the court noted,however,that one of the main purposes of sentencing considerations now under this congress,under these sentencing guidelines,is deterrence and punishment,and explained that the court had considered the factors cited by defense counsel by not doing its own sentencing guideline calculation and imposing a much higher guideline sic based on the evidence that it had.
assigns three errors on appeal.first,he contends that the district court erred by failing to give him notice that the court intended to rely on testimony from his trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range.second,argues that the government breached its plea agreement with him by urging the court to impose a higher sentence than that which the government agreed to recommend,and by arguing that he was responsible for a quantity of cocaine greater than the amount stipulated.finally,claims that the court erred by imposing a increase for his role in the offense pursuant to c,and asks that his case be remanded to the district court for resentencing under united states booker,d.we will address each argument in turn.
in arriving at an appropriate sentence,a district court enjoys broad discretion in the information it may receive and consider regarding a defendant and his conduct.united states curran,cir citations omitted see no limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the united states may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.in exercising this discretion,the district court is free to consider information from a trial proceeding at which the defendant was not present.see united states rios,cir citing united states romano,cir see also united states blackwell,cir collecting cases.it is well established,however,that a convicted defendant has the right to be sentenced on the basis of accurate and reliable information,and that implicit in this right is the opportunity to rebut the government evidence and the information in the presentence report.blackwell,at citation omitted.the supreme court has explained that,which addresses sentencing and judgment,contemplates full adversary testing of the issues relevant to a g uidelines sentence and mandates that the parties be given an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence.burns united states,d quoting.
in united states berzon,cir,we emphasized that a defendant must be provided with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the factual information on which his or her sentence is based.id.at.at issue was defendant robert berzon claim that the district court had based its upward adjustment of his base offense level on testimony from a sentencing hearing that neither berzon nor his attorney had attended.the testimony offered new and substantial information about berzon role in the offense as a leader or organizer under c.berzon contended,however,that he had no knowledge of the damaging testimony at the time of his own sentencing.in finding that a defendant must be provided with notice before such information is considered,we concluded that a defendant may not be placed in a position where,because of his ignorance of the information being used against him,he is effectively denied an opportunity to comment on or otherwise challenge material information considered by the district court.id.at see burns,at.th e right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that a decision is contemplated.quoting mullane cent.hanover bank trust.
because it was unclear from the record,however,whether the district court had considered the undisclosed information,we remanded the case to the original sentencing judge with directions that he indicate whether he had materially relied on this information in sentencing berzon.berzon,at.if the sentencing judge answered affirmatively,we ordered that berzon sentence be vacated,and berzon be resentenced by a different district judge.id.
on appeal,relies heavily on this court decision in berzon,arguing that berzon requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.according to,the district court erred when it failed to notify him that it would rely on testimony from his trial in deciding where to sentence him within the guideline range.he claims that he had no knowledge of the prior trial testimony and argues that he was by the contention that he was a significant supplier of drugs to the conspiracy.as a result,argues that he was denied the opportunity to challenge and rebut the court reliance on such information in violation of.and his right to due process under the fifth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution 
reliance on berzon,however,is misplaced.one of our concerns in berzon was that the undisclosed testimony at issue contained new and significant information about berzon role in the that was nowhere in the record and which berzon had no opportunity to challenge.id.at.the same can not be said here.at the sentencing hearing on november,defense counsel argued that her client was a peripheral supplier,who had only supplied and of a kilogram of cocaine.the court,however,was not persuaded.in imposing a sentence of months,the sentencing judge made a general,and somewhat vague,reference to all of the testimony that the court received in the course of trial.when defense counsel objected to this remark,the court clarified 
i said in the nature of the offense and my recollection of the testimony at trial.you are talking about and quarters,that was for a long time that cocaine was being supplied.so the amount of from the evidence that i recall,is more than,i would say more than generous.
based on this exchange,it is clear that the district court mentioned the testimony it had heard at trial to emphasize that the court was familiar with both the length of time the conspiracy had operated and the quantity of drugs that had been involved.by doing so,the sentencing judge was responding to defense counsel argument that her client was a peripheral supplier,who had supplied only small amounts of cocaine.
this information was hardly new to and his counsel.see id.requiring notice when a court expects to consider new information from a separate proceeding.the length of the conspiracy and quantity of drugs involved were set forth in the indictment,plea agreement,and psr.the psr noted that under the terms of the plea agreement,had pled guilty in exchange for the stipulation of a lesser drug amount.indeed,this information was at the heart of the government argument that was a significant supplier of cocaine.at his detention hearing,three days after was arrested,the government was asked about the quantity of drugs had supplied at any given time.the government responded that 
has been involved since approximately or and he has supplied kilogram quantities,perhaps not one kilo each time there a drug transaction,perhaps half a kilo quantities,perhaps quarter of a kilo or eighth of a kilo quantities.but we not talking grams here.we talking kilo or portion of kilo quantities of both cocaine and heroin.
notably,this is the same type of information that the court would later rely on at sentencing.any factual information from the trial to which the court may have been referring,therefore,was neither new nor absent from the record.
furthermore,we are not persuaded by claim that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to such information.although contends that he was by the assertion that he was a significant supplier,the government consistently maintained,throughout the proceedings below,that was a main supplier to the organization.at the bail review hearing on january,the government referred to as a major cocaine supplier.in fact,even as early as the detention hearing on october,the government had described his role as a supplier to the organization as significant.
at the sentencing hearing,defense counsel anticipated this argument from the government,stating that she was sure the government was going to get up and say her client was one of the main suppliers.in an attempt to counter this claim,defense counsel argued that her client was only a peripheral supplier,minimizing the quantity of drugs that had supplied.thus,clearly was on notice that this information was at issue during his sentencing,and he was given an opportunity to rebut it.
moreover,there is no indication from the record that the sentencing judge materially relied on any undisclosed testimony in deciding where to sentence within the guideline range.id.at.in imposing a sentence at the of the guideline range,the district court stated that it had taken into consideration all of the elements in the presentence report,including the nature of the offense and all of the testimony that the court received in the course of trial.after defense counsel challenged the court reliance on the trial testimony,the court corrected her 
counsel,the sentence at the lower or upper end of the guideline range is discretionary.taking into con
