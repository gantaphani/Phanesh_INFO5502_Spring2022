a jury convicted tyrone moore of carjacking,using a firearm in furtherance of carjacking,and conspiracy.after the trial,moore filed a motion for a new trial based,in part,on newly discovered evidence,but the district court denied it.because the district court erred in denying moore motion for a new trial,we vacate and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.
in the early evening of november,donald roarty parked his jeep grand cherokee on east street in baltimore,maryland to attend a meeting at a nearby church.when he exited his vehicle and began walking toward the church,he heard a voice behind him asking where he could find a whatchamacallit.when roarty turned around,a man who was standing approximately five feet away pulled out a handgun and demanded the keys to roarty jeep.roarty complied by tossing the keys to the assailant,who subsequently drove off in the jeep.roarty then called the police to report the crime.the encounter lasted only twenty to thirty seconds.because the assailant was wearing a hat and had a dark bandana over his face,roarty could only see his eyes and dreadlocks showing below the hat.
three days later,on november,detective brandon underhill of the harford county sheriff office,who was working in an undercover capacity at the time,met with larry pollin to conduct an undercover drug buy.pollin arrived at the meeting place in a jeep grand cherokee with three other people,and he and detective underhill exchanged money for crack cocaine.detective underhill could not determine who drove the vehicle to the drug buy,but he testified that pollin drove the vehicle away.a surveillance unit of the sheriff office working alongside detective underhill ran the plates and determined that the jeep was registered to donald roarty.at the time,however,the sheriff office was unaware that roarty had reported the jeep stolen.therefore,after following the jeep for minutes to conduct surveillance after the drug sale,the sheriff office terminated the encounter.the detectives involved in the drug buy were unable to identify the other three individuals in the vehicle 
four days later,on december,deputy jeffrey gerres of the harford county sheriff office was patrolling an apartment complex known for drug and gang activity.gerres noticed several men standing in a breezeway below a sign that proscribed loitering and recognized one of the men as lamere walton,a known gang member.deputy gerres parked outside of the development and approached the men on foot to investigate.as deputy gerres approached,some of the men ran into nearby apartments.however,deputy gerres was able to stop and detain walton,who immediately began reaching in his pockets.fearing that walton was attempting to get a weapon or seeking to destroy evidence,deputy gerres pulled walton hand out of his pocket.in walton hand was a car key.
deputy gerres pressed the key panic button,which activated the lights and horn of a jeep parked nearby.after running the plates on the vehicle,deputy gerres learned that the vehicle had been recently stolen in an armed carjacking.the vehicle turned out to be roarty stolen jeep,and walton was placed under arrest.deputy gerres then searched the vehicle with the aid of other officers and found a black and orange baltimore orioles baseball cap.during this encounter,tyrone moore,whom deputy gerres knew to be a gang member and an associate of walton,walked by the scene wearing a black orioles,black and orange pants,and black and orange shoes.because moore and walton were friends and because moore outfit matched the baseball cap within the vehicle,deputy gerres detained moore for a brief investigation.moore denied involvement in the carjacking,and deputy gerres took photographs of moore to show his clothing and then released him.
subsequently,the baltimore city police department began efforts to create a photo for use in the roarty case.the police department contacted corporal richard carroll,iii,of the maryland state police department,and requested a photograph of moore to use in the photo array.corporal carroll indicated that not only did he have a photo of moore,but he also possessed a photo array,already prepared for an unrelated investigation in october,that included moore photograph.corporal carroll provided that photo array to the city police officers who decided to use it in their investigation.
roarty was then contacted by the city police department and asked to come to the station to view the photo array.the police department told roarty that they had recovered his jeep and that they had a suspect in custody.although the police department did not tell roarty that the suspect was in the photo array,roarty testified that he assumed the suspect would be in it based on the fact that a suspect was in custody at the time.when looking at the photos,roarty initially indicated that he was not sure he would be able to make an identification in light of the fact that so much of the assailant face had been covered up at the time of the carjacking.one of the officers administering the photo array instructed roarty to focus on the portion of the face that roarty could see at the time of the carjacking the eyes.based on the eyes and general shape of the face in a particular photograph,roarty picked moore out of the photo array,indicating at the time that he was certain that the person he selected was the carjacker.
moore was indicted for conspiracy to steal a car with intent to cause serious bodily harm,see count theft of a car with intent to cause serious bodily harm,see count and use of a firearm in furtherance of carjacking,see c count.prior to trial,moore requested that the government provide photographs of pollin taken at or near the time the carjacking occurred.the government complied by providing moore with several pictures of pollin,including one depicting pollin with dreadlocks dreadlocks picture and one depicting pollin with short hair short hair picture.the government explained to moore attorney that some of the pictures came from a police incident report relating to pollin arrest for a shooting that occurred approximately one month after the carjacking.the short hair picture was dated december.notably,the dreadlocks picture was undated.
the focus of the trial that followed was the identity of the carjacker.seeking to persuade the jury that moore was the carjacker,the government made efforts to eliminate the possibility that someone other than moore committed the crime.because pollin was the first person seen driving the stolen jeep,only three days after the carjacking,part of the government case was excluding pollin as the possible assailant.
the government sought to achieve this end in large part by offering proof that pollin did not have dreadlocks at the time of the carjacking.to establish this fact,the government produced the testimony of the officer who saw and dealt with pollin shortly after the roarty incident and corroborated his testimony with a photograph taken of pollin a month later.specifically,detective underhill testified that he saw pollin on november,three days after roarty was robbed and that pollin had short hair at that time.detective underhill then viewed the short hair picture of pollin,represented by the government to have been taken by law enforcement on december,and confirmed that pollin short hair in that photograph was similar to his short hair length that detective underhill saw on november.detective underhill further testified that he could not recall pollin ever having dreadlocks.when counsel for moore asked detective underhill about the dreadlocks picture on,detective underhill explained that t he hair was different from what he kn e.
as previously stated,the government also provided moore with a picture of pollin with dreadlocks,but it was undated.in attempting to prove that pollin had dreadlocks at the time of roarty carjacking,moore counsel asked defense witness michael wells about the dreadlocks picture.wells was a friend of moore and a cousin of pollin,and was incarcerated at the time of moore trial for drug and firearm offenses.so although wells did testify that pollin had dreadlocks at the time of the carjacking,his testimony was weak in the face of the government dated photograph and corroborating testimony from detective underhill.ultimately,the jury believed that moore was the assailant and that pollin was not,and it convicted moore of each count in the indictment 
after trial,moore continued to insist to his attorney that the short hair picture,despite the fact that it was dated december,was not consistent with his recollection of pollin appearance at that time.counsel for moore contacted counsel for the government and asked him to confirm the date of the short hair picture.the government continued to represent that the picture was taken on december,and it belittled the defendant for continuing to raise a question about the date the photo was taken.specifically,the government responded to moore counsel with the following to the extent that your client claims to have seen pollin in december with dre a ds,he is either mistaken or lying.care to guess which it is.as it turns out,the government was the one mistaken.pollin did indeed have dreadlocks in november and december,and the date on the short hair picture was wrong.
moore attorney ultimately proved this by raising the issue with pollin former attorney,who happened to have in his file pollin real booking photograph taken on december,that depicted pollin with dreadlocks.this photo matched the undated dreadlocks picture.the government has now admitted that the short hair picture it received from harford county,produced to moore,used and relied upon at trial,and represented to have been taken on december,was,unbeknownst to it at the time of trial,not taken until early when pollin first cut off his dreadlocks.
this discrepancy resulted from a system utilized by harford county up until spring,in which booking photographs were replaced automatically by new photographs whenever an inmate changed his or her appearance dramatically.according to corporal christopher crespo,a booking supervisor with the harford county sheriff office,under this system,an inmate original booking photograph would always be retained in a file but the electronic copy of the original booking photograph would be replaced by any new photographs that were taken to depict an inmate appearance.and as is evident from the facts of this case,the new electronic photograph would apparently retain the date of the inmate initial booking,as if the new picture were taken when the inmate was initially processed and brought into the detention facility corporal crespo further stated that the short hair picture was taken in january and that his review of the complete record of photographs revealed that pollin had dreadlocks until january.
there is no doubt that harford county could have done more to ensure that it provided the united states attorney office with an accurate booking photograph of pollin.however,there is no evidence to suggest that the assistant united states attorney prosecuting this case produced and used the short hair picture with anything but an honest belief in its accuracy.that being said,moore suffered the consequences of having a jury believe that pollin,the first person seen in the jeep three days after the carjacking,looked nothing like the assailant described by roarty at the time of the carjacking.
for this reason,moore filed a motion for a new trial with the district court.in his motion,moore argued that the discovery of the actual dates of the short hair picture and the dreadlocks picture constituted newly discovered evidence and,alternatively,that the government failure to disclose this fact violated brady maryland,d.the district court denied the motion,and moore appeals from that ruling.because we find that the district court erred in rejecting moore argument,we conclude that moore is entitled to a new trial.
to be entitled to a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure based on newly discovered evidence,a defendant must satisfy a test by showing that the evidence is newly discovered the defendant exercised due diligence the newly discovered evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching the evidence is material and the evidence would probably result in acquittal at a new trial.see united states chavis,cir chavis test.we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.united states perry,cir.
the district court concluded that moore satisfied the first three prongs of the chavis test because the actual booking photograph of pollin taken on december,depicting him with dreadlocks was newly discovered evidence moore exercised due diligence in discovering the evidence and the new evidence was not merely cumulative or impeaching.however,the district court concluded that moore could not satisfy the materiality prong of the chavis test because he put on a defense at trial that the court found to be disingenuous.specifically,the court concluded that 
moore chose to put on a defense that he could not have committed the carjacking because he was present at a violent incident that occurred at another location when the carjacking occurred.although a photograph suggesting that pollin,not moore,might have committed the carjacking was tangentially relevant to the defense,the fact of the matter is that the defense was entirely unconvincing,as was moore contention,based upon false testimony that he produced,that it was a junkie who committed the carjacking because he chose to present a defense based on perjured testimony,i will not permit him to have another opportunity to obtain an acquittal because of the innocent error that was made by the production of an erroneous photograph to him.
and with regard to the fifth prong of the chavis test concerning the probability of success on retrial,the district court stated that it did not need to reach that issue given its conclusion that the evidence was not material.nonetheless,the court also stated that i f moore had not made the decision to present this fabricated defense,i would grant him the new trial he requests.
on appeal,moore contends that the district court correctly resolved the first three chavis factors in his favor,that the district court abused its discretion in evaluating the materiality prong,and that he can satisfy the fifth chavis factor by showing that it is likely that he would be acquitted at a new trial.the government,however,contends that moore can not satisfy any of the chavis factors.see united states mchan,cir observing that we are entitled to affirm on any ground appearing in the record,including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court internal quotation marks omitted.
in our view,the district court did not abuse its discretion in resolving the first prong of the chavis test in favor of moore.n ewly discovered evidence means evidence discovered since the trial,united states fulcher,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and the discovery of the actual dates of the dreadlocks picture pollin actual booking photograph and the short hair picture were discovered by moore counsel after the trial.the district court also did not abuse its discretion in concluding that moore exercised due diligence.first,as a general matter,moore made reasonable efforts before and during trial to establish that pollin had dreadlocks at the time of the carjacking.these efforts included making requests of the government for accurate photographs of pollin,seeking surveillance photographs of pollin taken during an unrelated narcotics investigation,questioning a friend of pollin about pollin hairstyle,and detective underhill about his recollection of pollin hair.with regard to the specific photo of pollin taken on december,what must be remembered is that the government not only represented to moore lawyer and the jury that the photo was taken on the date inscribed on the picture,but the date was confirmed and bolstered by the testimony of the government witness detective underhill.while there may be times when due diligence requires an attorney not to accept at face value a representation made by the government,here the photo evidence was created by law enforcement and could reasonably be presumed to be within the exclusive
