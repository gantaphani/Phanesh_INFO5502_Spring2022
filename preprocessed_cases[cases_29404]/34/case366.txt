background 
at on the morning of friday,june,officer aaron brown of the hooksett,new hampshire police department,patrolling alone,observed a motor vehicle being operated without a working driver side headlight.officer brown turned on his flashing lights to initiate a traffic stop and the driver complied by pulling to the side of the road.officer brown approached the driver side of the vehicle,which was occupied by the driver and two other individuals.he explained to the driver,renee lafontaine,the reason for the stop and requested her driver license and vehicle registration,which she provided.officer brown,while still standing at the driver side door of the van,also asked the passenger,later identified as vincent chaney,for his identification and learned from the driver that the adolescent boy in the back seat was her son,michael.at this point,only a minute or two had passed since officer brown initiated the traffic stop.officer brown testified that although chaney had not done anything to suggest that he was dangerous,he requested chaney identification as an officer safety function.
in response to officer brown request,chaney replied that he had left his identification at home.officer brown then asked chaney what jurisdiction had issued the identification and chaney replied that he believed it was massachusetts,but he was not certain.chaney gave the name,later determined to be false,of jacob williams and claimed his date of birth was july.officer brown found it unusual that chaney did not know what jurisdiction issued his official identification.he then asked chaney for his social security number,or the last four digits of it,which chaney could not provide.officer brown next asked chaney for his current address,or at least the most recent of his addresses that he could recall.once again,chaney could not remember the requested information.based on his experience,officer brown again found chaney inability to recall such information unusual.chaney demeanor during this exchange was uninvolved and officer brown testified that chaney primarily stared straight ahead and was meek in his behavior and mannerisms.by contrast,officer brown testified that people in these situations generally make eye contact or at least engage in some sort of conversation with the officer.
approximately seven minutes after the traffic stop was initiated,officer brown returned to his cruiser to verify the information he received from the driver and chaney.officer brown radioed the information to dispatch and requested a records check for license status and any outstanding warrants.he received the results of both records checks simultaneously,approximately ten minutes after he made the request.officer brown testified that the records checks could not be run simultaneously and that therefore approximately five of the ten minutes it took dispatch to respond were attributable to the check of chaney information.after he obtained the results of the records check,officer brown was able to verify the driver information but was unable to match the information given by chaney to any records in massachusetts,new hampshire,or new york.
officer brown returned to the driver side of lafontaine vehicle and returned her license and vehicle registration to her.he then asked lafontaine if she would mind stepping out of the van and speaking to him at the rear of the vehicle.officer brown testified that he asked lafontaine out of the vehicle because he wanted to obtain her independent account of the passenger identity.lafontaine agreed,and the two stepped to the rear of her vehicle.officer brown questioned lafontaine about the front passenger identity,how she knew him,where they were coming from,and what they were doing.lafontaine indicated that she knew the passenger as jake,and did not know his last name.she explained that she met jake around five years earlier,but had lost touch with him until recently.lafontaine said that when she recently spoke with jake they decided they would hang out,go for a ride,and talk.she stated that when the officer pulled them over,they were headed to drop jake off at his home on spruce street.officer brown then left lafontaine and approached the passenger side of the van to speak with the passenger,chaney.
officer brown explained to chaney that the information he provided did not check out.officer brown also told chaney that,based on his nervous demeanor and inability to provide an address or social security number,that he suspected chaney of providing a false name.chaney continued to assert that his name was jacob.he became increasingly nervous,fidgety,and continued to avoid eye contact.as officer brown was talking with chaney,he shined his flashlight into the car and observed a significant bulge,about the size of a fist,in the right front pocket of chaney jeans.at this point,officer brown was concerned that the bulge might be a weapon.he was also suspicious of criminal activity,given his belief that chaney had provided false information.
officer brown pointed out the bulge to chaney and asked what was in that pocket.at first,chaney did respond and became increasingly nervous.officer brown repeated his question,at which point chaney shifted his weight,reached into his right rear pocket and produced a big wad of napkins.he then said that nothing was in his pocket and fumbled with the napkins in his hand.officer brown observed that as chaney moved,the bulge in his right front pocket remained rigid.officer brown then redirected chaney to his right front pocket and chaney again indicated that nothing was in the pocket.chaney then took the napkins in his right hand and shoved them in his right front pocket.as he did,officer brown observed that the bulge in chaney pocket moved lower into the pocket.
officer brown opened the door and asked chaney to step out of the vehicle.he informed chaney that he was going to conduct a terry pat on him.officer brown brought chaney to the rear of the vehicle to conduct the search.at this point,another officer,officer megowan,had arrived on the scene.officer brown explained to chaney that he was only going to pat down his outer person by touching and feeling his pockets.chaney body language then became extremely rigid,and he began to clench his teeth.officer brown asked chaney a third time what was in his pocket.this time chaney responded that there were syringes in his pocket because he is a diabetic.officer brown asked if the syringes were capped,and chaney stated that he was unsure.officer brown informed chaney that he was going to retrieve the syringes.because of chaney change in body language,officer brown feared that he might fight or flee,and he placed chaney in handcuffs.he emphasized to chaney that he was not under arrest,and chaney indicated that he understood.
officer brown then went directly to chaney right front pocket and he squeezed the item in question.he told chaney that the item did not feel like syringes,and chaney responded that it must be his diabetic kit.officer brown removed the item,which was a small black pouch with the word keltec on the side.officer brown recognized the container as a firearm pouch and opened it.inside was a loaded keltec pistol.officer brown asked chaney if he had a permit to carry the weapon and chaney indicated that he did not.chaney was placed under arrest and eventually provided his actual name and date of birth.
chaney entered a conditional plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm,preserving his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the traffic stop.the district court granted chaney motion to suppress,and this interlocutory appeal by the government followed.
