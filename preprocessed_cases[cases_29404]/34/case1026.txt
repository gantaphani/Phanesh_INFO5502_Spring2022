glen hardwick appeals from a conviction after a jury trial before judge casey he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit and aiding and abetting a,both in violation of.in light of the supreme court decision in crawford washington,d,he argues that the district court committed plain error in violation of the sixth amendment confrontation clause when it permitted a plea allocution by his brother and,stacey hardwick,to be read into evidence.glen further contends that there was legally insufficient evidence to prove the consideration element of the underlying offense.
the admission of stacey plea allocution was plain error under crawford.see johnson united states,d.we must therefore vacate glen conviction.however,because the evidence presented at the improperly admitted plea allocution,united states cruz,cir was legally sufficient to prove section consideration element,we vacate,but do not reverse,the conviction and remand for further proceedings.
background 
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,see united states wilkerson,cir,we recount the evidence at trial.
in late march,the new york police department began an investigation into the sale of narcotics at the skate key,a skating rink and party venue in the bronx.on march,detective marco trujillo,in his undercover persona antonio,purchased cocaine and marijuana from stacey,who was working the door of the skate key.in a conversation,trujillo discussed his desire to do future business with stacey,purchase drugs and guns from stacey.trial tr.
in a series of transactions over the next several months,trujillo purchased varying quantities of cocaine and five guns from stacey.as part of his cover,trujillo claimed that he was an organized crime hit man and was constantly in need of new guns because he would use a gun only once,disposing of it after a killing to eliminate any evidence linking him to the murder.
on september,while in new jersey,trujillo received a voice message from stacey on his cellular telephone,requesting that trujillo call stacey back immediately.when trujillo returned stacey call,stacey stated that a neighbor had pulled a gun on his brother glen.stacey told trujillo that he wanted this neighbor to go away,be killed,and if trujillo could not do it,then stacey would find someone else.trial tr.trujillo told stacey that he would take the job,but on the agreement that trujillo would take a gun for payment.id.trujillo informed stacey that he would do the murder within a week.
on the morning of september,trujillo recorded the first of two telephone conversations with stacey that day during the first conversation,trujillo informed stacey that he would do the murder that night.trujillo talked to stacey in coded terms about procuring the gun he would use for the murder.trujillo told stacey that he was not going to charge stacey for the hit,but that he needed two guns,o ne for trujillo problem,one for stacey problem.telephone tr,at.trujillo informed stacey that he was willing to do the killing as a friendly gesture and would pay for one gun but that the other gun would be stacey cost.id.stacey,however,was unwilling to part with both weapons,claiming he needed at least one of them.
approximately one hour later,trujillo called stacey,and they agreed to meet at the olympic diner on jerome avenue in the bronx at five that evening.trujillo again requested that stacey bring two guns to the meeting.stacey refused,claiming that he could bring only one because he and glen needed the other.trujillo grew angry at this development and told stacey,you know what you better bring some fuckin cash too.you want this done the right way,you bring some fuckin cash.telephone tr,at.the men agreed that glen would join them at the meeting.
after meeting with other officers,trujillo,wearing two recording devices,went to the olympic diner when stacey arrived,he was alone but informed trujillo that glen was outside in a truck with the gun.stacey told trujillo that he needed a little bit of cash too for the gun.tr.trujillo became upset at stacey request for payment when trujillo was doing a job for him,and responded,lem me see the part gun and,i tell you what,i give you a couple but why did you bring the other fucking thing gun,i would gave you money for that.id.when trujillo asked stacey,w hat you looking at,how much money do you want for the replied,at least a thousand.id.trujillo expressed disbelief at the request,but stacey replied,no,no,no,lem me tell you what he glen was asking.this is what he was asking because he was gon na get rid of it.but i said no,you ca get rid of it when you have this fuckin cockaroach the intended victim out there,right.id.at.
shortly after this exchange,a waitress and her boyfriend began having a loud dispute when the waitress threatened to call the police,stacey became nervous and suggested relocating to a mcdonald down the street.on trujillo way to the mcdonald and while coordinating the new location with his undercover team,stacey and glen approached trujillo,and trujillo introduced himself to glen.stacey offered to make the necessary transfer of the gun and the information on how to locate the intended there,but trujillo refused,insisting that stacey and glen both join him at the mcdonald.
once in mcdonald,trujillo,stacey,and glen sat together at a table.stacey had brought the gun in a paper bag from his car into the mcdonald when he took the gun out and tried to hand it to trujillo across the table,trujillo told stacey to leave the gun in the bag.glen gave trujillo details on the intended victim physical appearance nationality,height,hair color,and usual attire as well as where and when he could be found.glen gave trujillo a pen to write the location down on the bag containing the gun.trujillo then told glen that he was doing the murder as a friend to stacey as a good gesture to stacey because trujillo fucked him on something a misunderstanding.id.at.
stacey concluded the conversation with let do what we got ta do.alright trujillo responded,alright.no problem,i going over to my car right now,let go.id.stacey replied,yo you got any change on you,and trujillo said,yeah,in my car.id.stacey then asked that they go pick it up.id.as they were exiting,trujillo began saying it a done deal,which was the code for his police team to come in and make the arrest.id.at.
glen was charged in a indictment with i conspiring to commit,in violation of ii aiding and abetting a,in violation of and and two other counts dropped by the government prior to glen trial.also prior to glen trial,stacey pleaded guilty to,inter alia,conspiring to commit and committing.
glen trial commenced on june.the jury heard recordings of various telephone calls between stacey and trujillo as well as of the meeting between trujillo,stacey,and glen.trujillo testified extensively in front of the jury about his undercover operation,the events leading up to stacey and glen arrests,and his interpretation of the various recordings played for the jury.the court also allowed stacey plea allocution to be admitted into evidence.while it did not mention glen,the allocution stated that stacey agreed and conspired to cause another person to travel in interstate commerce with the intent that a murder be committed in exchange for payment.the payment for the intended murder was a caliber pistol.plea tr,may.the defense objected to the reading of the plea allocution and requested that limiting instructions be given to the jury.the district judge agreed and told the jury that it could consider these statements as evidence of the activities of the person who made the statement and that is relevant to this case,but that the statements could be considered only as to whether a conspiracy existed and w hether the crime of murder for hire was committed as part of that conspiracy.trial tr.the judge cautioned that t he question whether the defendant glen hardwick participated in the conspiracy is an issue for which you will have to rely on other evidence there is nothing in stacey hardwick statement that answers the question of whether glen participated in the conspiracy.id.at.
while deliberating,the jury asked for,and received,a rereading of the portion of the transcript containing stacey plea allocution and a replaying of the recordings of both september phone conversations.the jury returned with verdicts of guilty on both counts of the indictment.
discussion 
on appeal,hardwick challenges his conviction on the following two grounds.first,in light of the supreme court decision in crawford washington,d,he contends that the district court admission of stacey plea allocution violated the sixth amendment confrontation clause.second,glen argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to prove the consideration element of the substantive offense.we address each of these claims in turn.
a confrontation clause claim 
the government concedes that under the supreme court decision in crawford,the admission of stacey plea allocution was in error.however,the government argues that we are limited to plain error review because glen counsel failed to raise a confrontation clause objection at trial.
although defense counsel made a general objection to the reading of stacey allocution and asked for a limiting instruction,which was given,she did not mention the confrontation clause,the sixth amendment,or any confrontation clause caselaw in her objection.the objection failed to put the trial court on notice that confrontation clause concerns were implicated thus,harmless error review is inappropriate,and we review the constitutional issue for plain error.united states dukagjini,cir 
for us to correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.johnson,at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.because the error here was not structural,in other words,a defect affecting the framework within which a trial proceeds,arizona fulminante,d,we will conclude that it affected the defendant substantial rights only if the error was prejudicial to the defendant and affect ed the outcome of the district court proceedings,united states bruno,cir.
the admission of stacey plea allocution against glen meets the test for reversible plain error.an error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.united states thomas,cir.although plea allocutions were admissible under our caselaw at the time of glen trial,we have since held that they are testimonial hearsay and are inadmissible under the confrontation clause unless the testifies at trial,or is unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for.united states becker,cir united states mcclain,cir see also crawford,at.because the plea allocution was admitted without meeting these requirements,the error is plain.
furthermore,the plea allocution affected glen substantial rights because it almost surely influenced the jury verdict.bruno,at cir a n error affects a defendant substantial rights if it is prejudicial and it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.internal quotation marks omitted.as discussed below,the sufficiency issue with regard to the consideration element of the statute is close.without the plea allocution,the issue largely turns on stacey state of mind as inferred from the recorded conversations.with the plea allocution,the issue is much easier because the allocution was a direct admission by stacey that he intended the pistol he gave to trujillo to constitute a quid pro quo for trujillo promise to murder the victim.as such,the plea allocution almost certainly contributed to the jury verdict.
first,the judge limiting instructions informed the jury that it should not consider the allocution as evidence that glen was part of the conspiracy but that it could consider the plea allocution as evidence that stacey had violated the statute in his dealings with trujillo.thus,the jury was explicitly permitted to consider the plea allocution on the issue of whether the gun constituted consideration for trujillo promise to murder the issue as to which the evidence,absent the plea allocution,was very close.bruno,at.
second,the government referred specifically to the plea allocution in its closing arguments,stating you have stacey hardwick guilty plea allocution,where he admitted to conspiracy to commit a.there is no dispute that a conspiracy existed.trial tr.finally,the plea allocution was to the jury at their request during deliberations.indeed,it is extremely doubtful that the jury even examined other evidence going to stacey state of mind,given the nature and force of the plea allocution.
therefore,the fairness and integrity of the proceedings in this case were seriously affected by the unconstitutional admission of the hearsay statements in stacey plea allocution.thomas,at.as a result,we vacate the judgment of conviction.
b sufficiency of the evidence 
glen also challenges his conviction by contesting,inter alia,the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to section consideration element.glen argues that stacey did not intend the gun he gave trujillo to be something of pecuniary value in exchange for trujillo promise to murder the intended victim.
the statute provided 
whoever uses or causes another to use the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce,with intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states as consideration for the receipt of,or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay,anything of pecuniary value,or who conspires to do so,shall be guilty of a crime under this section.
a.the federal statute proscribes a very limited category of behavior only those instances in which one party agrees to commit a murder in exchange for another party provision or future promise of payment are punishable under.united states frampton,cir.
the consideration requirement of section is interpreted in the traditional sense of bargained for exchange,united states wicklund,cir,so that there must be a or at least the promise of such between the parties to the transaction,united states hernandez,cir.see also united states richeson,cir c onsideration retains its contract law meaning of a exchange of something of value.united states washington,cir.
when the defendant is the solicitor of the,it is the defendant intent that controls.richeson,at the federal statute requires the government to prove that the accused intended for a murder to be committed as consideration for something of pecuniary value.emphasis added.the nature of the solicitor intent is especially important when the murderer is an undercover agent who by definition never intends to commit the crime.see generally united states ritter,cir reversing convictions for conspiracy to commit for two defendants the first did not know anyone was paid to commit the murder the second also lacked the required intent because the government agent pretending to be a hit man said he would not charge anything for the murder.
under section,the term anything of pecuniary value is defined as anything of value in the form of money,a negotiable instrument,a commercial interest,or anything else the primary significance of which is economic advantage.b.the promise of a future,unspecified the absence of any evidence suggesting that either party to the agreement had an understanding of what form such a favor would not constitute pecuniary value under section.frampton,at.however,the pecuniary value requirement is satisfied,for example,by the payment or promise of quantities of drugs,washington,at,insurance proceeds,hernandez,at,or a promise to reimburse a hit man for a firearm purchase in addition to letting him keep the firearm,richeson,at.thus,the mere fact that the consideration offered could inure to the economic benefit of the murderer is insufficient.rather,there must be some evidence to establish that at the time the agreement was formed,the consideration was something the primary significance of which lay in its economic advantage.frampton,at quoting b.
