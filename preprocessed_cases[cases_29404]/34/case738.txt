brian eugene meserve meserve appeals from his conviction for robbery and firearms offenses in the united states district court for the district of maine.on appeal,meserve claims four errors occurred during the course of his trial specifically that a the district court allowed a witness to repeat the statement of a third party in violation of federal rule of evidence,b the district court barred the defense from a government witness about the omission of certain information stated at trial from her grand jury testimony in violation of meserve sixth amendment right of confrontation,c the government used a stale conviction to impeach a defense witness in violation of federal rule of evidence b,and d the government a defense witness about his character for violence and his prior convictions in violation of federal rules of evidence and.meserve further asserts that even if these errors,considered individually,do not necessitate a new trial,the cumulative effect of the errors can not be considered harmless.
background 
on april,the ferris market,a convenience store in vassalboro,maine,was robbed at gunpoint.in a indictment,meserve was charged with the robbery and the associated firearms offenses 
viewing the evidence adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,united states josleyn,cir,the facts are as follows at around on the evening of the robbery,meserve showed his girlfriend and accomplice,holly grant grant,a shotgun and told her that he was going to rob the ferris market.after nightfall,meserve and grant drove to the ferris market together in meserve car,where they waited until the store became less busy.meserve then got out of the car,while grant stayed behind.
meserve,wearing a ski mask and carrying a black bag and a short gun with a brown handle,entered the ferris market.he forced shawna vashon,an employee,and sumayah ferris,the mother of the owner,to the floor,and ordered amy craig craig,a second employee,to give him the money in the cash register.craig handed meserve everything that was in the cash hundred dollars.meserve then fled from the store,passing a customer on his way out of the building.
when meserve returned to the car where grant was waiting,he told grant that the robbery was a piece of cake,and that the only problem was that an old lady gave him a hard time.during the drive away from the scene,meserve tossed his gloves and ski mask,the bag used to carry the money,and the gun out of the car.when meserve and grant arrived at meserve mother house,he gave grant his sweatshirt and asked her to burn it and buried his shoes in the woods.
later that evening,grant and meserve went to the chez paris and the,two local bars,where they used the robbery proceeds to buy drinks.while meserve and grant were at the chez paris,craig came into the bar and meserve commented to grant that craig was working at the ferris market when he robbed it.later that night,when a report about the robbery came on the evening news,meserve remarked to grant,if they only knew.
at trial,grant supplied many of the details about the robbery and meserve conduct afterwards.although grant denied any knowledge of the crime when first asked about it by detective sampson pomerleau detective pomerleau in october,she later came to an agreement with the government.grant met with prosecutors several times to go over her grand jury testimony and police reports regarding her statements.she also discussed the case with sergeant gerard madden sergeant madden,a maine state trooper who testified on her behalf at her child custody proceeding.under direct examination,grant admitted to several prior bad acts,including fraudulently using her grandmother credit card on multiple occasions and obtaining aid for families with dependent children after she no longer had custody of her child.
meserve presented a defense based on alibi and mistaken identity.both meserve mother,lindsay overlock overlock,and his brother,kevin meserve kevin,testified that he was at home until a little after on the evening of the robbery.kevin testified that at approximately,he and meserve went to the chez paris,where they stayed for two hours before heading to the.kevin also testified that he had seen grant at the chez paris during the last week of august,two months before the trial.kevin stated that grant was drinking heavily at that time,and complained to him that sergeant madden had been keeping tabs on her,and that every time she met or spoke with sergeant madden,he would instruct her what to say at trial.
meserve other alibi witness,jane morissette morissette,a bartender at the chez paris,testified that she saw meserve and his brother,kevin,enter the bar around,but that grant was not with them.she stated that later in the evening,meserve told her that he was going to the with kevin,and asked her to let grant know where he was when she arrived.according to morissette,grant entered the chez paris shortly thereafter and morissette told her that meserve had gone to the.morissette testified that between and midnight,a girl named amy craig arrived at the chez paris.morissette overheard craig tell a man about a robbery that had occurred earlier that evening at a store at which she worked in vassalboro.
on october,the jury convicted meserve on all four counts.meserve filed a motion for a new trial,which was denied on july.accordingly,on august,meserve was sentenced to concurrent terms of one hundred months imprisonment on counts i,iii,and iv of the indictment and to a consecutive term of one hundred twenty months on count ii of the indictment.
ii.analysis 
hearsay evidence 
generally,questions of admissibility of evidence that do not raise issues of law are reviewed for abuse of discretion,baker dalkon shield claimants trust,cir.during the government case in chief,detective pomerleau was permitted to testify over the objection of the defense that he drove by meserve house on the night of the robbery to see exactly where the subject was living.detective pomerleau further testified,again over objection,that meserve became a suspect in the case because he matched the description of the robber and because craig thought meserve might have been the robber because she knew him.meserve asserts that this testimony constitutes hearsay and is inadmissible under federal rule of evidence.the government argues,however,that the district court admitted craig statement not for the truth of the matter asserted,but rather to explain why detective pomerleau drove by meserve home that evening.meserve counters that the statement was nevertheless inadmissible because,if not hearsay,the fact that detective pomerleau drove by meserve home shortly after the robbery had no tendency to prove any issue in the case.
hearsay is an statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.testimony that is not offered to prove the truth of an statement,but is instead offered to provide relevant context or background,is not considered hearsay,united states mazza,cir accord united states freeman,cir united states love,cir.moreover,the hearsay rule does not apply to statements that are offered to show what effect they produced on the actions of a listener.united states,cir.
in the instant case,however,the government espoused reason for introducing the explain why detective pomerleau drove by meserve house on the evening of the completely irrelevant to the government case.detective pomerleau did not discover any evidence or valuable information during his and made no observations pertinent to the investigation thus,the fact that he went on such a drive has no tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.detective pomerleau motivation for driving by meserve home is likewise irrelevant.in light of the government baldly pretextual basis for the introduction of craig statement,this court is not prepared to say that the statement is admissible.the government is thus reduced to its claim that the error is matter considered below.
exclusion of using grand jury testimony 
meserve claims that the district court erred by not allowing the defense to grant concerning a discrepancy between her trial testimony and her grand jury testimony.at trial,grant testified that craig came into the chez paris on the night of the robbery and that craig entrance prompted meserve to mention that craig was working at the store when he robbed it.in contrast,although grant testified before the grand jury that after the robbery she went to two bars with meserve,the chez paris and the,she never stated that she saw craig at the chez paris.nor did she mention seeing craig that night at the chez paris even though,in response to a question as to whether meserve had recognized any of the ferris market employees,grant testified that meserve told her that he recognized a girl named amy because she was dating a friend of theirs.
when the defense sought to question grant about why she had not mentioned craig presence at the chez paris in her grand jury testimony,the district court barred this line of questioning because grant was not specifically asked about the incident before the grand jury.meserve argues that this restriction on grant violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,delaware van arsdall,d davis alaska,d.the government responds that grant grand jury testimony was not inconsistent with her testimony at trial and that even if error occurred,it was harmless.
pursuant to the federal rules of evidence,a witness credibility may be impeached by asking him about prior inconsistent statements.a united states hudson,cir.the rule applies when two statements,one made at trial and one made previously,are irreconcilably at odds.united states winchenbach,cir.prior statements,such as the grand jury testimony at issue here,that omit details included in a witness trial testimony are inconsistent if it would have been natural for the witness to include the details in the earlier statement.united states stock,citing jenkins anderson,d.this test is an elastic one,because the naturalness of a witness decision not to include certain information in an earlier statement may depend on the nuances of the prior statement context,as well as the witness own loquacity.id.
district courts have broad discretion concerning whether two statements are in fact inconsistent,and thus whether the witness may be impeached by the prior statement.udemba nicoli,cir citing united states agajanian,cir united states jones,cir.nevertheless,under certain circumstances,a district court refusal to permit a witness to be questioned about a prior inconsistent statement may constitute reversible error.see,stock,at citing united states standard oil,cir united states ayotte,cir.
here,however,the district court did not abuse its wide discretion by refusing to allow meserve to grant regarding the omission from her grand jury testimony of certain details about which she testified at trial.before the grand jury,grant was not asked whether she remembered anyone coming into the chez paris on the night of the crime nor whether she saw any of the victims of the crime at any point.although meserve argues that questions about whether meserve recognized any of the workers at the ferris market and about grant and meserve activities after they went to the chez paris should have prompted grant to mention that she saw craig at the chez paris that night,such nuances are peripheral and not directly inconsistent.
thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow grant to be questioned about her prior omission.the right to confrontation through is not unlimited.a district court has wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on based on concerns about interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.van arsdall,at.the district court appropriately exercised its authority under the circumstances of this case.
impeachment by stale conviction 
meserve argues that the district court erred by allowing the government to use a conviction for theft that was over twenty years old to impeach morissette.the government raises three first,as meserve did not contemporaneously object to the question,the issue was not preserved for appeal.second,because federal rule of evidence does not render such impeachment evidence per se inadmissible,the lack of an objection deprived the district court of the opportunity to make the appropriate rulings with respect to its admissibility.third,even if error occurred,it was harmless.
meserve concedes that he failed to make a contemporaneous objection at the time of morissette.thus,this court reviews the district court allowance of this impeachment evidence for plain error.b.d.review for plain error entails a quadripartite showing that there was error that it was plain that the error affect ed substantial rights and that the error affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states eirby,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also johnson united states,d united states olano,d.in a plain error argument,the defendant bears the burden of persuasion.united states rose,cir.
pursuant to federal rule of evidence b,evidence of a conviction is not admissible to impeach a witness if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction,whichever is the later date id.thus,because morissette conviction for theft occurred in and she had been released from any confinement by,the conviction was stale under the terms of rule b.see united states,cir.
it is not clear,however,that the error was plain.rule b contains an exception,which establishes that evidence of convictions over ten years old may be admissible if the court determines,in the interests of justice,that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.b.meserve failure to make a timely objection to the admission of the evidence deprived the district court of the opportunity to determine whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect.thus,the plainness of the error can not be established on the current record.
and even if,by some stretch,this court were to conclude that the admission of a conviction over ten years old as impeachment evidence under the circumstances of this case constituted plain error,meserve can not satisfy his burden of showing that the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding,johnson,at.quoting olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the government points out,t he subject of morissette prior conviction occupied a single question,produced a single answer and neither party returned to the topic again either in the testimony or in summations.see,united states tse,cir finding harmless error where the improperly admitted evidence played an insignificant role in the proceedings.even meserve seems to acknowledge that the admission of a single piece of impeachment evidence against a single defense witness is not capable of depriving him of substantial rights.instead,meserve attempts to argue that the impeachment evidence was particularly likely to be damaging because it was followed by the improper of kevin.the argument that the cumulative effect of multiple errors warrants reversal,however,is distinct from the argument that the admission of impeachment evidence against and of reversible error.viewed alone,the use of a stale conviction to impeach morissette,even if such evidence was admitted in violation of rule b,was not a sufficiently egregious violation of meserve rights to have deprived the proceedings of their fundamental integrity and fairness.
of kevin meserve about his prior convictions and character for violence 
meserve argues that the district court committed reversible error by permitting the government to his brother,kevin,about his disorderly person and assault convictions and about his alleged violent reputation in the community.the challenged portion of kevin is as follows 
q now,mckee asked you questions about your conviction for unlawful sexual contact in and,but that not your only conviction,is it 
a i have a couple of assaults on my record.
q,disorderly conduct.
mckee i object,your honor,that improper under rule.it specifically precludes that.a disorderly conduct 
mccarthy i can lay a foundation for it.
the court go ahead.
by mccarthy 
q you a tough guy,are you kevin 
mckee i object.
the court overruled.
by mccarthy 
q you a tough guy,are you 
a i would classify myself as a tough guy.
q been in a lot of fights in your day 
mckee i object,improper character evidence,impeachment.
the court just a minute.objection overruled.
a how many would you classify as a lot 
by mccarthy 
q more than one 
a yeah,i been in more than one,probably two.
q okay.and as a result of that,people in the community are afraid of you,are they 
mckee object,your honor.a continuing objection to my client excuse witness alleged behavior in the past as not being relevant,as not being permissible character evidence under rule or any other rule.
the court mccarthy 
mccarthy well,your honor,i disagree.if his reputation in the community is basically as an assaultive person about whom people are afraid,that very significant when it comes to the other people testimony about him and about what happened.
the court i going to allow it over objection.you have a continuing objection.
mckee thank you,your honor.
by mccarthy 
q in fact,you were convicted of assault as recently as,were you.
mckee same objection,your honor.
the court you have a continuing objection.
mckee this is with respect to rule.
the court overruled.
by mccarthy 
q is that right 
meserve objects to this entire line of questioning,asserting that the questions about kevin disorderly person and assault convictions were improper because these convictions were not permissible subjects of under rule a and that the questions about kevin being a tough guy and having been in a lot of fights in his day were improper character evidence under rule.the government counters that meserve failed to preserve these issues for review and that any errors that may have occurred were harmless,given the cumulative weight of the evidence against meserve.
preservation of the issues for review 
the government devoted a great deal of space in its brief and time at oral argument to defending the untenable position that the issues raised by meserve on appeal were not preserved for review because the defense failed to make both contemporaneous objections and motions to strike and because kevin did not answer many of the government questions,or provided answers arguably favorable to the defense.because of the vehemence with which the government argues a position with no seeming support in the law,this court pauses to discuss the obligations placed on each of the parties to a trial by the federal rules of evidence.
it is a basic tenet of our law that in order to preserve an evidentiary issue for review,the party opposing the admission of the evidence must make a timely objection.a united states auch,cir united states barone,cir united states wihbey,cir willco kuwait trading desavary,cir see also united states taylor,cir in general,the law ministers to the vigilant,not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.thus,the government argues that the defense failure immediately to object when kevin was asked about convictions in addition to his unlawful sexual contact convictions constrains this court from considering the matter on appeal absent plain error.b olano,at.examination of the transcript,however,reveals that meserve attorney objected as soon as it became obvious that the government line of questioning was in violation of rule,when the government indicated that the conviction about which it was asking was a disorderly conduct conviction.to be timely,an objection must be made as soon as the ground of it is known,or reasonably should have been known to the objector.united states check,cir quoting charles alan wright kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure quoting john henry wigmore,code of evidence ed.the general principle that an objection should be made after a question has been asked but before an answer has been given,hutchinson groskin,cir,is flexible in deference to the heat of a hotly contested criminal trial,check,at.thus,the defense was not required to anticipate the government line of questioning in order for the objection to be timely.compare hutchinson,at holding that objection was timely,even though objection was not made until after question was answered,and inge united states,holding that defense counsel failure to object until after he learned the nature of the document being used to refresh the defendant recollection did not render objection nugatory,with united states benavente gomez,cir holding that because at least three pages of transcript were recorded before the defendant objected,the objection came too late to preserve the objection for appeal,and fire ins.word,cir it is a rule of law so old that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary that one may not sit by without objection to rulings or instructions,and then after verdict and judgment,and when it is too late for the court to change its rulings or charge,come forward with objections on appeal and seek to put the court in error,cited with approval in putnam res.pateman,cir.meserve objection,although delayed,was sufficiently contemporaneous to comport with the federal rules of evidence.
the government attempts to place an additional onus on parties opposing the admission of such evidence,however,by arguing that the defense was further obligated to move to strike kevin answers to the government questions in order to preserve meserve right to review.according to the government,once a question has been answered,even if that answer was provided pursuant to a district court evidentiary ruling,the proper procedural vehicle to preserve rights for appeal is the motion to strike.the government was able to cite no authority for this proposition during oral argument and the court has found none 
the rule governing objections to evidence states that error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected,and i n case the ruling is one admitting evidence,a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record.a emphasis added.because rule is written in the disjunctive,the right to review may be preserved either by objecting or by moving to strike and offering specific grounds in support of that motion.the rule is intended to ensure that the nature of an error was called to the attention of the trial judge,so as to alert him to the proper course of action and enable opposing counsel to take proper corrective measures.a advisory committee note.thus,both the plain language and underlying goals of rule a indicate that a party opposing the admission of evidence may do so through either a timely objection or motion to strike 
moreover,the position espoused by the government is contrary to logic.according to the government,even if a witness answer was given pursuant to a district court order overruling an objection,the party opposing admission of the evidence must move to strike the witness answer to escape plain error review.modern trial practice is unreceptive to such procedural redundancies,and were this court to adopt the government view,it would take several steps back from the streamlining that the judicial conference,the supreme court,and the congress attempted to accomplish through the enactment of the federal rules of evidence in.because the law imposes no obligation on a party opposing the admission of evidence both to object and to move to strike,meserve timely objections were sufficient to preserve his rights for review.
in its final effort to prevent this court from reaching the merits of meserve claims,the government asserts that where kevin did not answer the question posed,or where the answer elicited was arguably favorable to the defense,review is not warranted.according to the government,n o answer to the challenged question having been given,no evidence was admitted,and thus there is no error to correct.this position is without support in the law.
no court has ever held that review is forestalled if a witness does not answer a question posed or answers that question with a response favorable to the objecting party.although the government cites two cases to support this proposition,united states innamorati,cir and united states zaccaria,cir,these cases simply stand for the proposition that under such circumstances,the harmless error analysis is likely to weigh in favor of the appellee.see innamorati,at noting that because the challenged questions were not answered,the prejudicial effect of the questions was lessened see also zaccaria,at holding that even if the district court erred in sustaining the objection,the error was harmless because the witness answered the question in the negative and the court did not strike his answer.
even when a question elicits no answer or an answer arguably favorable to the defense,the question itself may nevertheless prejudice a defendant because of the weight a jury gives to the questions asked by a prosecutor,united states simonelli,cir that the witness denied these acts does not,of course,render the questioning harmless.there is a lingering odor left by such questions united states cudlitz,cir under these circumstances,it would have been not strictly the jury to have given great weight to the government suggestion see also john henry wigmore,wigmore on evidence peter tillers,hereinafter wigmore f acts of discreditable conduct may be groundlessly asked about in the hope that though denied they will be assumed by the jury to be well founded.the law provides protection against illegitimately posed questions even where they produce no answer.
furthermore,the district court instruction to the jury here that the lawyers questions were not evidence may not eliminate the potential taint of the government questions.cudlitz,at.the instruction did not occur during the course of the challenged,but rather as part of the court final jury charge several hours later.the court instruction was therefore unlikely to eradicate the impression left on the jury by the government line of questioning.id.t he sting of objectionable questions survives such instructions,which is why lawyers ask impeaching questions that they know will produce denials.
the government various arguments that meserve failed to preserve his challenges to kevin for review are therefore without merit.because timely objections to the government of kevin were raised at trial and because objectionable questions may be reviewed even where they produced no answer or an arguably favorable answer,the court considers meserve arguments under the harmless error standard of review,not the more demanding plain error standard.united states joyner,cir.
review of challenged testimony 
having determined that meserve challenges to the government of kevin were properly preserved for review,the court considers the testimony to which meserve objects,bearing in mind the following points 
first,the district court construction of evidentiary rules is a question of law which we review de novo.second,the application of an evidentiary rule to particular facts is normally tested by an abuse of discretion standard,which favors the prevailing party.finally,we may affirm the district court evidentiary rulings on any ground apparent from the record on appeal.
united states barone,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
a federal rule of evidence 
meserve first challenge to the government of kevin is that the government questions about kevin disorderly conduct and assault convictions were improper because these convictions were not permissible subjects of under rule a.pursuant to federal rule of evidence a 
for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,
evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted,subject to rule,if the crime was punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted,and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused and 
evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement,regardless of the punishment.
id.thus,the government could only inquire about kevin convictions for disorderly conduct and assault if the crimes were punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than one year or involved dishonesty or false statement.
under maine law,disorderly conduct is a class e crime.ann.tit,punishable by a maximum term of six months,id.e,and assault is a class d crime,id,punishable by a term of imprisonment less than one year,id.d.because the sentences for these crimes do not exceed one year,meserve argues that evidence of these crimes is per se inadmissible under rule a.in opposition,the government asserts that assault is not always a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for less than one year in maine section provides that when the perpetrator is at least eighteen years of age and the assault produced bodily injury to a child under six years of age,the crime is classified as a class c crime,punishable by a prison term of up to five years.id.
the record before this court does not resolve the question whether kevin assault conviction was for bodily injury to a child less than six,an omission for which the government blames meserve i t is meserve failure to develop a record that leaves this court with inadequate facts to resolve the issue definitively.through this simple sentence,the government attempts to shift the burden of proving admissibility from the proponent of evidence to the party opposing the admission of the evidence.
it is a principle too simple to seem to need stating,however,that the government,as the party seeking to introduce evidence of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes under rule,was obligated to have researched kevin prior offenses and to have determined that they were admissible,wigmore,supra.upon meserve challenge,the government should have been prepared to produce to the district court concrete proof that kevin had been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year within the previous ten years.admittedly,the government may have been in possession of precisely such proof,and merely failed to produce it because the district court did not demand it upon meserve objection.even so,the failure of the district court to press the government on this issue does not shift the burden to meserve.
nor do the convictions for disorderly conduct and assault introduced by the government against kevin fall within rule a,as the legislative history of the rule makes clear 
t he phrase dishonesty and false statement means crimes such as perjury or subornation of perjury,false statement,criminal fraud,embezzlement,or false pretense,or any other offense in the nature of crimen falsi,the commission of which involves some element of deceit,untruthfulness,or falsification bearing on the accused propensity to testify truthfully.
conf,at,reprinted in.to be admissible under rule a,a prior conviction must involve some element of deceit,untruthfulness,or falsification which would tend to show that an accused would be likely to testify untruthfully,united states seamster,cir,elements not readily apparent in the crimes of disorderly conduct and assault 
because the government failed to develop an adequate predicate for admitting the convictions for disorderly conduct and assault,it was error to permit interrogation concerning these convictions for the purposes of impeaching kevin.
b federal rule of evidence 
meserve further argues that the questions the government posed to kevin about being a tough guy and having b een in a lot of fights in his day were improper under federal rule of evidence.the government counters that it was entitled to introduce evidence that kevin had previously been involved in fights as impeachment by contradiction following kevin denial that he was a tough guy.
pursuant to federal rule of evidence a 
the credib
