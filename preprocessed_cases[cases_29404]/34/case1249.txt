alton coles was the leader of a philadelphia drug distribution ring responsible for selling a staggering amount of both cocaine and cocaine base also known as crack from to.the defendant in this appeal,asya richardson,was coles fianc√©e.in the summer of,the couple used drug money to purchase a new home.not long after,a federal grand jury returned a series of indictments charging coles and others with various drug trafficking and firearms offenses.eventually the grand jury returned a fourth superseding indictment charging richardson with money laundering.the government theory was that,in the course of purchasing the new home,richardson had participated in financial transactions knowing that they were designed to conceal the criminal origin of the money involved.the case proceeded to trial,and at the close of the government case,richardson moved for judgment of acquittal,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a guilty verdict.the court denied the motion and richardson was convicted.having reviewed the record,we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to sustain richardson conviction.we will therefore vacate the conviction and remand for entry of a judgment of acquittal.
in addition to being a drug dealer,coles was the ceo and owner of take down records,a recording label that produced rap and music.he also threw weekly parties at palmer,a nightclub located in downtown philadelphia.coles drug activity generated substantial revenues,but his legitimate businesses were not profitable.take down records operated at a loss,and the nightclub parties broke even though they produced substantial cash receipts in the form of cover charges.
in the summer of,coles and richardson met and began dating.the relationship blossomed into a serious romance,and by december,the two were engaged.but within a year of the engagement,the couple was involved in a domestic dispute causing richardson to flee their apartment.she went to court seeking a restraining order,and in support of her application,submitted an affidavit in which she averred among other things that coles is a big time drug hustler.despite their difficulties,coles and richardson eventually reconciled.
in february,coles and richardson decided to purchase a home together.they picked out a new house located in mullica hill,new jersey.the purchase price for the home was.coles and richardson signed a purchase contract with the homebuilder,and coles issued two checks from his personal checking account at citizens bank one for and another for as a deposit towards the home purchase price.
coles and richardson applied for a joint mortgage through the homebuilder lender affiliate,nvr mortgage company.in the application,coles claimed to earn per year as the ceo of take down records,and richardson truthfully stated that she made annually as a customer service representative at bank of america.the mortgage application was rejected because coles had poor credit.
nvr referred the couple to pine creek mortgage services,a last resort mortgage company.pine creek reviewed coles credit history and concluded that it would not be able to secure a joint mortgage for the couple.it determined,however,that richardson had good credit and that it could probably obtain an individual mortgage in her name.at pine creek suggestion,the couple removed coles name from the home purchase contract and richardson completed an application for a stated income mortgage the application vastly overstated richardson income.it indicated that she had three jobs and that she earned over per year.pine creek nevertheless approved the application,and settlement on the house was scheduled for july.
besides the already paid to the homebuilder,the couple planned to put an additional down on the home at settlement.in the days leading up to the settlement,coles made a number of cash deposits into take down records business account at citizens bank.he later transferred the funds to his personal checking account to use towards the down payment.
the day of settlement was marked by a flurry of banking activity.at,a cash deposit was made into coles and richardson joint checking account at pnc bank.this deposit took place at a pnc branch located in philadelphia.at,coles made a cash deposit into take down records business account.the funds were later transferred to coles personal checking account and used towards the down payment.half an hour later,at the same bank branch,coles deposited in cash directly into his personal checking account.at,richardson made a cash deposit into the couple joint checking account.this deposit was made at a pnc branch located in stratford,new jersey,which was near the location of the settlement finally,at,coles made a cash deposit into a wachovia checking account belonging to his son.this deposit,too,occurred at a branch located in stratford.
the couple proceeded to the settlement,where coles tendered three checks to cover the outstanding on the down payment.the first was an official check for purchased with money from coles personal checking account at citizens bank.the second was a cashier check purchased with money from the couple joint checking account at pnc bank.the third was an official check for bought with money from coles son checking account at wachovia.the settlement went smoothly.because coles had been dropped from the home purchase contract and mortgage,the property was titled in richardson name only.
ii.procedural history 
on august,shortly after the couple had moved into the new home,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging coles with a single count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.three superseding indictments followed charging coles and others with various drug trafficking and firearms crimes.on march,a fourth superseding indictment was filed charging coles and richardson with money laundering,a b i,conspiracy to commit money laundering,h,and wire fraud.coles and richardson proceeded to trial along with four other defendants.at the close of the government evidence,richardson moved for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.the district court took the matter under advisement,after which richardson presented evidence in her own defense.the jury found coles and richardson guilty on the charges but acquitted them of wire fraud.the jury also convicted coles of drug trafficking.after the trial,the district court issued a ruling denying richardson motion for judgment of acquittal.the court sentenced richardson to months in prison.this appeal followed.
iii.jurisdiction standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over a district court grant or denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence.united states starnes,cir.because richardson moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government,and because the district court reserved ruling on the motion,we must confine ourselves to the evidence that existed at the time the motion was made.see.b united states tyson,wl cir united states moore,cir noting that rule entitles the defendant to a snapshot of the evidence at the point that the court reserves its ruling.we can uphold richardson convictions only if the government evidence would permit a reasonable jury to find the essential elements of the crime s beyond a reasonable doubt.starnes,at.in determining whether this standard is met,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,mindful that it is the jury province and not ours to make credibility determinations and to assign weight to the evidence.united states boria,cir.
iv.analysis 
we begin with the provision of the statute under which richardson was convicted.it provides 
whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity shall be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for not more than twenty years,or both.
a b i.thus the government had the burden of establishing four elements an actual or attempted financial transaction involving the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity knowledge that the transaction involves the proceeds of some unlawful activity and knowledge that the transaction was designed in whole or in part to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.united states omoruyi,cir.richardson sufficiency challenge focuses on the second and fourth elements.
richardson attacks the district court conclusion that the financial transactions culminating in the purchase of the home involved the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.omoruyi,at.she does not dispute that drug trafficking is a specified unlawful activity.it clearly is.see c a.nor does she dispute that the transactions involved at least some drug money.the government demonstrated that coles legitimate businesses take down records and the nightclub parties were unprofitable,thereby permitting the jury to infer that at least some of the money used on the down payment came from coles other source of income drug trafficking.see united states stewart,cir evidence that a defendant was engaged in drug trafficking and had insufficient legitimate income to produce the money used in a transaction is sufficient to establish that the money was derived from drug distribution.quoting united states hardwell,cir.
richardson contends,however,that the government failed to prove that the transactions involved the proceeds of drug distribution.the evidence,richardson notes,established only that the transactions involved gross receipts of drug distribution,and not that they involved profits of drug distribution.citing the supreme court decision in united states santos,richardson argues that the term proceeds,as used in the statute,means profits,not gross receipts.for its part,the government acknowledges that it failed to prove that the transactions involved profits of drug distribution.but it disagrees with richardson reading of santos,arguing that the statute use of the term proceeds means gross receipts,at least in drug trafficking cases.
efrain santos operated an illegal lottery for over two decades.he used the gross receipts of the lottery to pay the winners and his employees the runners and collectors who made the scheme possible.id.at.based on these payments,santos was convicted under a provision of the statute that makes it unlawful to use criminal proceeds to promote illegal activity.see a a i.concluding that the statute use of the term proceeds means profits,the lower courts invalidated santos conviction because the evidence showed only that the predicate payments involved gross receipts of the illegal lottery.santos united states,cir,aff g d.
a splintered supreme court affirmed.a plurality noted that the term proceeds is ambiguous dictionary definitions indicate that it can mean either profits or gross receipts.at.invoking the rule of lenity under which ambiguity in a criminal statute must be construed in the defendant favor,the plurality opined that the term proceeds,as used in the statute,means profits,not gross receipts.id.at.the plurality also observed that adopting a receipts definition of proceeds would create a merger problem in certain types of cases 
if proceeds meant receipts,nearly every violation of the statute would also be a violation of the statute,because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery.since few lotteries,if any,will not pay their winners,the statute criminalizing illegal lotteries would merge with the statute.congress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily deserve up to years of imprisonment,a,but as a result of merger they would face an additional years,a.indeed,t he merger problem is not limited to lottery operators.a ny specified unlawful activity,an episode of which includes transactions which are not elements of the offense and in which a participant passes receipts on to someone else,would merge with money laundering the government suggests no explanation for why congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code to radically increase the sentence for that crime.interpreting proceeds to mean profits eliminates the merger problem.a criminal who enters into a transaction paying the expenses of his illegal activity can not possibly violate the statute,because by definition profits consist of what remains after expenses are paid.
justice stevens concurred in the judgment.he eschewed the plurality conclusion that proceeds should always be construed to mean profits.id.at stevens,concurring in judgment t his court need not pick a single definition of proceeds applicable to every unlawful activity,no matter how incongruous some applications may be.he began by observing that the legislative history of the statute makes it clear that congress intended the term proceeds to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.id.at.at the same time the legislative history sheds no light on how to identify the proceeds of many other types of specified unlawful activities,including operating an illegal lottery.id.given the absence of helpful legislative history,justice stevens was persuaded to concur in the judgment because applying a receipts definition in santos case would have run headlong into the merger problem that the plurality had identified.congress could not have intended such a perverse result.id.at.
writing for the four dissenting justices,justice alito argued that the term proceeds in the money laundering statute means gross receipts,not net income.id.at alito,dissenting.although the dissent disagreed with justice stevens approach insofar as it holds that the meaning of the term proceeds varies depending on the nature of the illegal activity that produces the laundered funds,it expressly agreed with him that a receipts definition was appropriate in cases arising from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.id.at.finally,the dissent disagreed that the merger problem called for a profits definition in some or all cases t he merger problem is fundamentally a sentencing problem,and the proper remedy is a sentencing remedy.id.at 
we believe that proceeds means gross receipts in the circumstances of this case.for starters,the merger problem that impelled a majority of the supreme court to throw out santos conviction is not present here.purchasing real property is neither integral to nor an expense associated with the crime of drug trafficking.moreover,five justices agreed in santos that proceeds means gross receipts in cases involving the sale of drugs and other contraband.although not binding because four of the justices who expressed this view did not concur in the court judgment,see marks united states,the collective view of five justices is,of course,persuasive authority.see rutledge united states,swisher int l,schafer,cir.finally,our sister circuits uniformly agree that proceeds means receipts in the drug trafficking context at least where as here there is no merger problem.see wilson roy,cir collecting cases united states quinones,cir.united states yusuf,cir upholding conviction where transactions clearly involved profits,thus eliminating need to address issue.
richardson next argues that even if she knew drug money was used to purchase the home,there was not sufficient evidence to meet the fourth element of money laundering,that she participated in financial transactions knowing that they were designed at least in part to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the money.omoruyi,at.in this context,design means purpose or plan,the intended aim of the transactions.cuellar united states.the gove
