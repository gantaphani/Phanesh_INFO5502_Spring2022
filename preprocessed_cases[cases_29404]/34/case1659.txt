larry johnson appeals on fourth amendment grounds from his conviction on various drug and firearm charges.police witnessed johnson making what appeared to be a series of exchanges with multiple people in a known drug market.by this point,the facts known to the officers were at least sufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that johnson was dealing drugs,justifying a brief investigatory detention under terry ohio,d.a police officer then approached johnson and ordered him to show his hands.when johnson responded by attempting in front of the officer to toss a heroin gelcap out of sight,reason able suspicion ripened into probable cause to arrest.and when police later learned that johnson had been back and forth to a nearby car just before the series of contacts,probable cause to arrest in turn ripened into probable cause to search the car.
johnson was not detained until police had a basis for a reasonable suspicion,he was not arrested until police had probable cause to arrest,and the car was not searched until police had probable cause to search it.since no fourth amendment violation occurred at any point,we affirm the district court rejection of johnson motions to suppress evidence arising out of these events.that court carefully examined the evidence,heard from the parties,and its considered conclusion warrants our respect.see,united states arvizu,d.
on the evening of september,baltimore city police detective eric green was monitoring the block of pennsylvania avenue in the city of baltimore by video camera from a police station about five minutes drive away.the block is reputedly home to a brisk drug trade.around,detective green witnessed johnson standing on the sidewalk of the street.he watched as johnson,in rapid succession,made quick contact with three different men,after which each of the three men immediately hurried off.although he could not see an actual object being exchanged,it appeared to green that something small was being passed between them.green,who had made thousands of drug arrests based on observing exchanges during his career,concluded that johnson was dealing drugs.he immediately dispatched his partner,officer joseph bannerman,and another officer to the scene.
while his colleagues were en route,detective green continued to monitor johnson movements.he watched as john son milled about on the sidewalk,briefly turned down a side street,and soon returned to the spot where the previous inter actions had taken place.green then saw two other people enter the frame,whereupon johnson headed for a local chinese restaurant with the two others appearing to follow.green suspected johnson was about to sell them drugs,since local dealers sometimes conduct their business in legitimate shops in order to elude police cameras.
green alerted his colleagues that johnson was taking the suspected buyers into the chinese.johnson and one of the suspected buyers entered the eatery as the police officers pulled up,but the second suspected buyer kept walking up the street after spotting the approaching police.immediately upon arriving,officer bannerman entered the restaurant and approached johnson,identified himself as a police officer,and asked to see johnson hands.johnson,however,did not comply,instead throwing what bannerman correctly believed to be a heroin gelcap over the restaurant counter.a struggle ensued,but bannerman eventually gained the upper hand and johnson was duly arrested and handcuffed.bannerman recovered the gelcap and loaded johnson into his patrol car.johnson was found to be carrying in cash.
while this was taking place,detective green reviewed a recording of the earlier surveillance video.in doing so,he noticed something he had originally overlooked.the video showed that just before the suspected drug deals,johnson had gone to a car parked along the street,opened the passenger door,shut it,paced back and forth,reached back into the car and emerged appearing to hold something in his hand.concluding that johnson was using the car to store drugs,green radioed to officer bannerman and instructed him to return to the scene and secure the car.
officer bannerman arrived at the car and looked inside the passenger side window.on the floor of the car,he saw a plastic bag containing baggies of gelcaps like the one johnson had thrown during their tussle.bannerman also saw a set of keys on the car seat.he relayed this information to detective green,who told him to bring the car back to the police station.bannerman then opened the car door and saw that in addition to the gelcaps the plastic bag contained vials of what he suspected to be cocaine.officer bannerman drove the car back to the police station,whereupon detective green conducted a full search.he found heroin gelcaps,cocaine vials,a mirror and scale,both of which had what appeared to be drug residue on them,a razor blade,and a loaded rossi special handgun.
in march,johnson was charged by a federal grand jury with distribution and possession of cocaine and heroin with intent to distribute under,possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under c,and being a felon in possession of a firearm under g.prior to trial,johnson filed two motions to suppress evidence.the court held a hearing on the issue,at which it viewed the surveillance footage and heard testimony from detective green,officer bannerman,and the officer who had accompanied bannerman,as well as from johnson.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court denied johnson suppression motions.following a jury trial,johnson was convicted of all three charges and thereafter sentenced to months imprisonment.he now appeals from the denial of his suppression motions.he also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the two firearms charges and raises a sixth amendment objection to a portion of his sentence.
at the suppression hearing,detective green explained that johnson conduct appeared to him like based on hundreds of observations in that area and hundreds of arrests.johnson contends that detective green experience counts for little,if anything.he argues that although green background and experience certainly affected his perception of events,that experience simply could not transform johnson outwardly lawful behavior into a criminal offense.appellant br.at.
johnson insistence that green training and experience count for little runs headlong into the teachings of the supreme court.as the court has explained,a trial judge views the facts of a particular case in light of the distinctive features and events of the community likewise,a police officer views the facts through the lens of his police experience and expertise.the background facts provide a context for the historical facts,and when seen together yield inferences that deserve deference.ornelas united states,d.
the fourth amendment requires such an approach.it is more practical than theoretical.both the language of the amendment,which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures,and the decisions of the court interpreting it are purposely imprecise.they reflect a preference for analysis,informed judgment,and an examination of the entire factual picture over any neat set of legal rules.illinois gates,d.
the reason for this is plain enough.the task the police per form requires them to translate the law abstractions into actual practice in the unpredictable circumstances of the streets.this is at once a vital and a difficult mission.it is vital because errors in either excessive intrusion or toward impotent be costly.it is difficult because the contexts are varying and,quite often,the time for deciding is short.
getting the balance right is never guaranteed,but the chances of doing so are improved if officers,through training,knowledge,and experience in confronting criminality,are uniquely capable both of recognizing its signatures,and by the same token,of not reading suspicion into perfectly innocent and natural acts.in this way,experience leads not just to proper action but to prudent restraint.reasonableness is a matter of probabilities,and probability in turn is best assessed when one has encountered variations on a given scenario many times befo
