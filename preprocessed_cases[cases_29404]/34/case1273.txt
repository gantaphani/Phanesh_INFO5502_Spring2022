opinion of the court 
following a jury trial in the district court for the district of new jersey,richard stadtmauer was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states in violation of,and nine counts of willfully aiding in the filing of materially false or fraudulent tax returns in violation of.on appeal,stadtmauer raises many challenges to these convictions.we deal principally with the issue stadtmauer raises last whether the district court erred in giving a willful blindness instruction in this case,including whether the supreme court decision in cheek united states,forecloses the possibility that willful blindness may satisfy the legal knowledge component of the willfulness element of criminal tax offenses.we join our sister circuit courts in concluding that cheek does not prohibit a willful blindness instruction that applies to a defendant knowledge of relevant tax law.we reject also stadtmauer other claims of error,and thus affirm.
richard stadtmauer and the kushner companies 
this criminal case stemmed from an investigation of charles kushner,a prominent real estate entrepreneur,political fundraiser,and philanthropist in new jersey.kushner controls hundreds of limited partnerships,each of which owns and manages a single commercial or residential property.kushner is the general partner of each partnership and,for most,his siblings including his brother,murray and their children are the other limited partners.these partnerships have collectively operated under the name kushner companies kc.kc is not a registered entity and does not own any properties 
in the,charles and murray kushner accused each other of taking more than his fair share out of their common businesses.during the course of the ensuing civil litigation,murray alerted federal authorities to potential misconduct by his brother and kc.following an investigation,kushner pled guilty in to,among other things,assisting in the filing of false partnership tax returns and federal campaign contribution offenses.
during the course of its investigation of kushner,the government indicted several other individuals,including certified public accountant,a law school graduate,and kushner.he became an employee of kc in,and eventually rose to become an executive vice president.in this role,stadtmauer oversaw the operations of kc residential and commercial properties.stadtmauer also held a small stake between and in many of kc partnerships.stadtmauer and kushner held equal interests each in westminster management,an entity which collected management fees from the other partnerships.
b.the other players 
several former kc executives testified against stadtmauer at trial,including chief financial officer cfo stanley bentzlin chief operations officer coo scott zecher and alan lefkowitz,who succeeded bentzlin as cfo in.of these three,only zecher was indicted 
kc employed the accounting firm of schonbraun,safris,mccann,bekritsky company,llc ssmb as its main outside accountant.the lead ssmb accountant for kc matters was marci plotkin,who served as kc cfo in the early before returning to ssmb though plotkin was technically an employee of ssmb,kc reimbursed ssmb for yearly bonuses it paid to and certain of plotkin salary increases,and reimbursed plotkin for the cost of her son private school tuition.kushner did not heed bentzlin warning that paying plotkin a bonus would impair her independence and preclude ssmb from issuing financial statements on behalf of kc partnerships.
marci plotkin was assisted by among others ssmb partner stanley bekritsky and anne amici,a staff accountant who worked almost exclusively on kc matters.plotkin,bekritsky,and amici were indicted along with stadtmauer and each pled guilty to conspiring to defraud the united states.of these three,only bekritsky testified at stadtmauer trial.
c.the alleged conspiracy 
the government charged that stadtmauer,bekritsky,plotkin,and amici conspired to file false or fraudulent tax returns for the tax years for westminster management and eleven other kc limited partnerships oakwood garden developers,elmwood village associates,pheasant hollow,qem,arlington,and six partnerships with variations of the name quail ridge.the government alleged that these partnerships fraudulently claimed four categories of expenditures as fully deductible business on their tax charitable contributions,which generally are not deductible as business expenses expenditures incurred by one partnership but paid by a different partnership known as expenses capital expenditures,which generally must be amortized and depreciated over the life of the relevant asset and thus are not immediately deductible in full and gift and entertainment expenses,which generally are not fully deductible as business expenses.
the government theory was that these four types of expenditures were fraudulently deducted in full as ordinary business expenses on the partnerships tax returns through a process.first,the expenses were logged in each limited partnership general ledger via a accounting program that broke down all revenue and expenses into categories called accounts.second,kc used the general ledgers to prepare internal financial statements that automatically categorized these four types of expenditures as expenses.finally,ssmb used the general ledgers and internal financial statements to prepare external financial statements and tax returns for each partnership that falsely claimed these four categories of expenditures as fully deductible business expenses.
to illustrate,below we discuss primarily the tax return for one of the limited partnerships,elmwood village associates elmwood village.
the general ledgers 
charitable contributions 
kushner and stadtmauer frequently directed that charitable contributions be paid out of partnership funds,which were logged into the general ledger under the contributions account.in,elmwood village paid approximately to various charitable organizations,including donations to the suburban torah personal synagogue of kushner and to the center rabbi,stadtmauer rabbinical advisor.
also logged under the contributions account were donations made to various political campaigns and political action committees,and in private school tuition payments for zecher and plotkin children.because the latter payments were logged as partnership expenses rather than entered into the payroll system as taxable income,no taxes were withheld and no form was issued to zecher or plotkin.zecher testified that he generally left the descriptions blank on the checks for tuition payments because t here was nothing he really could write.it was not an appropriate business expense.id.at.
ii.expenses 
whenever a particular kc partnership incurred an expense that it could not satisfy out of its current funds,kushner would direct that a different partnership pay the expense.he referred to this practice as losing a bill,and it was a regular agenda item for management meetings held every tuesday referred to as tuesday meetings or cash meetings.typically,either kushner,the cfo,or the controller chose the source of payment in other instances,kushner directed stadtmauer to choose which partnership would pay the expense.zecher testified that it was kushner view that an expense could be paid by any partnership that he controlled.sometimes kushner would tell zecher that the partnership actually paying the expense did matter because it was all family.id.at.
for example,in various kc partnerships paid more than million in expenses associated with the renovation of kc central office building in florham park,new jersey kushner directed bentzlin to have several different partnerships,on a rolling basis,pay portions of the total expenses incurred as a result of the renovations.these expenditures were logged in the partnerships respective general ledgers under the repairs and maintenance account.eventually,kushner instructed bentzlin to review with stadtmauer the list of all bills due for the renovation work,and directed stadtmauer to instruct bentzlin on how to lose it,to choose what entity to pay it out of.id.at.
in addition to one partnership paying another partnership expenses,kc partnerships also paid for expenses that had no relation to any partnership business.in,elmwood village paid approximately in expenses that were booked to various general ledger accounts,including advertising,seminars,legal,and other professional fees.this amount included among other things paid to a consulting firm to research the viability of a comeback by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu toward a fee to pay netanyahu to speak at a breakfast sponsored by norcrown bank an entity not affiliated with kc in which kushner held an interest and toward a fee to pay former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker to speak at another norcrown bank event.
iii.capital expenditures 
from through,various kc partnerships purchased capital assets and made capital improvements to their properties.in general,these expenses were logged in the partnerships general ledgers under the repairs and maintenance account rather than the capital expenditures account.as lefkowitz explained at trial,t here were a few instances where things might have been capitalized,but as a general rule everything went through expenses.id.at.bentzlin explained that,although each general ledger had a capital improvement account,capitalizing assets was the way it was done at kushner companies.he added that 
w e regularly and routinely expensed capital assets under one of the repairs and maintenance or capital improvement accounts that was the way they were doing it upon my arrival,and it did change throughout my tenure with a with a few exceptions.
you did question it.you know,it was ruled with an iron fist.they controlled pretty much everything.
in,elmwood village spent on improvements that allegedly should have been capitalized,which included adding new bathrooms and kitchens to new cabinets and worth of new appliances such as washers and dryers and a new truck for.all of these expenses were logged in the partnership general ledger under the repairs and maintenance general ledger account rather than a capital account.
iv.gift and entertainment expenses 
kushner and stadtmauer frequently directed various partnerships to pay gift and entertainment expenditures that had no specific connection with the partnership paying the expense.in,elmwood village paid to cater a brunch at the new jersey performing arts center to a wine store for alcohol delivered to kushner and stadtmauer private homes during the holidays to cater a fundraiser for former new jersey governor jon corzine and thousands of dollars for new york yankees,new york mets,and new jersey nets season tickets.each of these expenditures was logged in elmwood village general ledger under a miscellaneous,or travel account.
kc internal financial statements 
kc used the general ledgers to generate internal financial statements for each partnership.the accounting template or skeleton used to produce these statements automatically grouped certain accounts from the general the contributions,miscellaneous,and seminars the category of office expenses.in addition,the legal and other professional fees accounts were grouped under the category of payroll and related expenses.each of these addition to the advertising and repairs and maintenance,in turn,grouped under the general category of expenses,and thus deducted in full from the partnership revenue on the internal financial statement this violated applicable accounting standards,which required the partnerships financial statements to be prepared on an income tax basis.
ssmb preparation of the partnerships tax returns 
ssmb used kc general ledgers and internal financial statements to prepare external financial statements for each partnership.kc would submit a management representation letter to ssmb along with its financial statements,in which kc management certified that t here are no material transactions that have not been properly reflected in the financial statements.stadtmauer signed most of these representation letters.kc also provided ssmb with the template it used to prepare its internal financial statements.
in preparing the partnerships external financial statements and tax returns,ssmb used the groupings applied by kc internal accounting software.thus,the internal and external financial statements for elmwood village reflected virtually identical amounts for office expenses and repairs and maintenance.as bekritsky testified,the tax returns were prepared on the same basis as the partnerships financial statements,meaning that if something is deducted on the financial statement,it is deducted on the tax return and produces income or increases the loss of the partnership.id.at.
elmwood village tax return deducted a total of in ordinary and necessary business expenses on lines through of form,entitled rental real estate expenses.included in this amount was in charitable contributions,political donations,and tuition payments for,among others,plotkin and zecher children.line of schedule k to the partnerships are required to list charitable left blank.the,and gift and entertainment,expenses incurred by elmwood village in were similarly claimed as fully deductible business expenses instead of listed separately as required on schedule.finally,elmwood village reported no increase in capital assets in.rather,in alleged capital expenditures were included in the reported as repairs on line of form,while other alleged capital expenditures were spread among various items in statement of schedule entitled other rental expenses 
around march or april of each year,stadtmauer met with kc cfo and someone from plotkin,and infrequently review and sign the kc partnerships tax returns.during these sessions,stadtmauer sometimes reviewed ssmb financial statements for the partnerships indeed,he refused to sign a tax return unless he had the financial statements next to him.id.at.he would flip through each return,look at certain things,and then sign it.id.at.stadtmauer only occasionally asked questions about the returns,and typically spent seconds to a minute on each.id.at.however,he spent more time on kc major properties,particularly those that had large annual increases in repairs and maintenance expenses.id.at.
stadtmauer reviewed and signed as many as tax returns in a given day.stadtmauer signed each of the partnerships tax returns below a legend declaring,u nder penalties of perjury,that he had examined th e return,including accompanying schedules and statements,and that,to the best of his knowledge,the return was true,correct,and complete.stadtmauer signed each return in his capacity as of the corporate general partner as bentzlin and zecher testified,stadtmauer believed that by doing so he would protect himself from personal liability.app.
the government alleged that,from through,the twelve kc partnerships identified in the indictment claimed more than million in improper deductions.capital expenditures that were deducted in full the year they were incurred accounted for more than half of this amount.
evidence of stadtmauer knowledge 
to establish that stadtmauer willfully aided in the preparation of materially false or fraudulent tax required for a violation of the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he voluntarily and intentionally violated a known legal duty.united states pomponio.whether stadtmauer had knowledge that the deductions claimed on the partnerships tax returns were materially false or fraudulent was the critical issue at trial.
at trial,bentzlin,zecher,and bekritsky each testified that they never discussed with stadtmauer the falsity of any particular deduction or tax return.accordingly,the government sought to meet its burden of proving that stadtmauer acted willfully through various forms of circumstantial evidence some of which have already been discussed,including evidence of stadtmauer intimate familiarity with the partnerships and how their general ledgers were maintained evidence that stadtmauer made decisions on how to treat partnership expenses in the past with tax consequences in mind and other evidence suggestive of a consciousness of guilt,evidence that stadtmauer was aware that the partnerships were making improper expenditures.
thursday meetings 
in addition to the tuesday meetings that stadtmauer regularly attended,for many years he ran weekly thursday meetings with the limited partnerships property managers,as well as kc counsel,controller,bentzlin,and sometimes plotkin the purpose of each meeting was to conduct an review of one or two kc properties.the managers prepared presentation packages that showed the partnerships actual expenses to date.stadtmauer went through the presentations line by line,and asked specific questions about each.app.according to zecher,there was nothing stadtmauer did see fit to get involved with in property management,and he was one of the brightest people that zecher had ever met.id.at.
in,certain property managers started using special letter codes on their general ledgers to identify expenses paid for by their respective partnerships.the codes allowed property managers to identify those expenses more easily and exclude them from their thursday meeting presentations.according to bentzlin,the property managers were hesitant to answer stadtmauer questions about such expenses during thursday meetings previously listed as miscellaneous expenses on the presentations,because they knew the expenses were for expenses paid out of other properties,and did want to blurt it out in front of a roomful of people.id.at.
stadtmauer was quite unhappy when he learned of the codes,and directed his subordinates to end the practice.id.at.stadtmauer and bentzlin ultimately decided to lump expenses together under a category called other.doing so obviated the need for stadtmauer to interrogate or continue to question the property manager as to the nature of those expenditures during thursday meetings,and made it easier during tuesday meetings to figure out how the apartment complex on its own was really operating.id.at.in addition,stadtmauer directed that kc accounting software be modified to allow somebody to go in and change existing descriptions within the general ledger.id.at.
stadtmauer also frequently instructed his subordinates to omit descriptions in check requests to avoid leaving a trail when kc used one property to pay another property expenses.id.at.he admonished zecher to never put the descriptions in,because he d id want the descriptions to show up in the ledger.id.at.stadtmauer also reminded zecher,over and over,to be careful what he put in emails.emails never disappear.id.at.
richard specials and other special financial statements 
in certain circumstances,stadtmauer directed that special financial statements for the partnerships be prepared for banks and other entities.these were known as richard specials.these special financial statements were often prepared when kc wanted to reduce outstanding letters of credit on particular properties.stadtmauer would direct that negative items that tended to depress the partnership profitability be removed from these statements,such as capital expenditures that had been logged as repair and maintenance expenses and expenses.id.at.to prepare these statements,stadtmauer was given a detailed report of the partnership general ledger,which he would go through line by line and indicate the items to be removed for the financial statement.id.at.kc prepared both internal and external versions of every richard special the internal version revealed the adjustments made,while the external version showed only the final numbers after adjustments.id.at.
the first time stadtmauer asked bentzlin to create a richard special,bentzlin objected and told stadtmauer that he did think it was the right thing to do because they would be sending different financials out other than the ones prepared by the accountant.id.at.stadtmauer argued it would be proper because they would call it a statement from operations as opposed to a statement of operations,supposedly making clear that it was a true financial statement.id.emphasis added.bentzlin told stadtmauer he thought the justification was ridiculous,and though bentzlin ultimately agreed to prepare the richard specials,he did want them ever to go out with his name on them.id.
similar to richard specials,on several occasions kc prepared special financial statements in connection with potential acquisitions and joint ventures.for example,in certain lenders agreed to finance kc acquisition of elmwood village,provided that kc would commit to making million in capital improvements to the property and secure a million letter of credit.these expenditures were entered,as usual,under accounts on the partnership general ledger.at the end of the year,however,kc decided to capitalize the items on the partnership financial statement to get the letter of credit cancelled.id.at.this decision was made during a tuesday cash meeting in which stadtmauer participated.
elmwood village tax return accurately reported almost million in capital improvements.after the letter of credit was cancelled,however,kc went back to the usual procedures of expensing those types of expenditures.id.at.elmwood village did not capitalize any expenditures after,and its returns treated the renovations that had been capitalized as fully deductible repairs.
similarly,in kc paid million to acquire a company called wny,which owned approximately properties in new jersey,pennsylvania,maryland,and delaware.kc was required to obtain a million letter of credit in connection with the acquisition.stadtmauer,plotkin,and zecher had a very detailed meeting on how they would do the accounting for the wny properties.id.at.they agreed that they would capitalize everything and anything they could,instead of expensing it,like they always did in the other properties.id.zecher testified that stadtmauer was convinced,because the transaction was so large,and the million in letters of credit were so unusual for kc,that the banks were going to come in and look at not only the tax returns,but the actual books and records.id.
when the letters of credit were removed,plotkin asked whether she should expense the capitalized items.zecher responded that he and stadtmauer had determined that the financial statements would look very weird if they stopped capitalizing.id.at.
other circumstantial evidence of stadtmauer knowledge of tax law and consciousness of guilt 
rationale for private school tuition payments 
as noted,for several years kc paid the private school tuition for,among other kc employees,plotkin and zecher children.zecher testified that stadtmauer came up with the idea of paying the tuition directly to the school instead of increasing zecher bonus by that amount.id.at.stadtmauer told zecher that he was trying to be nice by paying the tuition directly to the school,which would allow zecher to avoid thousands of dollars in additional income taxes.id.
i.the irs audit 
in,the internal revenue service irs audited the tax returns for two kc partnerships,focusing on the large deductions taken for repairs including to reconstruct a building facade,which was deducted in full as a business expense.the irs ultimately issued no change letters.following the audit,however,plotkin sent a letter to which stadtmauer was bentzlin to change the word improvements to repairs in the tenant improvements,apartment renovations,and building improvements general ledger accounts.id.at.bentzlin believed the purpose was to make these categories appear as if they contained repair and maintenance expenditures rather than potentially a capital improvement type item.id.at.
iii.dissenting limited partners and executives 
in addition to the kushner family and stadtmauer,there were other individuals who held interests in various kc partnerships.as zecher testified at trial,many of these individuals made repeated requests for information regarding the financial state of their partnership interests.in many instances,stadtmauer and kushner ordered zecher to refuse those requests.
in one instance,a partner of a kc partnership named k f clinton inquired as to certain political contributions made by that partnership and attributed to him.id.at.the partner denied he had ever authorized the contributions,and noted that,had he been informed of the intention to make political contributions,he would have advised that such political contributions were inappropriate and he would have demanded that they not be made from k f funds.id.at.he further noted that n othing in the partnership agreement authorized the disbursement of k f funds for any unrelated purpose.id.at.zecher got similar responses from several other partners.id.at.
another limited greenberg constantly had difficulty obtaining annual financial statements for the partnerships in which he had an interest.id.at.when he finally obtained and examined the partnerships financial statements for a prior period it was obvious to him that the expenses claimed for run ning the properties were way out of line.id.among other things,greenberg noticed that the partnerships in which he had an interest had treated capital expenditures as ordinary expenses,and had made numerous charitable contributions to kushner and stadtmauer synagogues,as well as political contributions.id.at.
when greenberg expressed his concerns to kushner,the latter told him that if you do like it,i will give you your money back.id.at.greenberg also had conversations with stadtmauer,both in person and by phone,regarding the improper expenses being paid by the partnerships,and asked stadtmauer to stop kc from doing what they were doing.id.though he offered no excuse or any explanation for the expenses,stadtmauer rejected greenberg request,explaining that that was the way they did business.id.following these conversations,kc attempted to buy out greenberg interests in the partnerships.
in addition to these dissenting limited partners,the government also introduced testimony that kc executives were expected not to challenge kc accounting practices.as bentzlin explained,y ou had to do pretty much as you were told at kc.stadtmauer and kushner often would throw tirades at any number of the meetings on a regular routine basis or in the office,you know,that you really did have latitude to make any changes.id.at.
former cfo alan lefkowitz learned this lesson the hard way.in early,he emailed kushner to ask whether he should follow the past practice of paying a bill for a mikvah a jewish ritual with funds from one of the partnerships.kushner was furious,and admonished lefkowitz that he should never write something like th at down.id.at.according to zecher,kushner was angry that lefkowitz had put in an email in writing that kc was paying bills for a project out of properties.id.at.kushner printed out the email and this guy is a definite moron.we must deal with the situation.kushner forwarded a copy of the email bearing his note to stadtmauer,and it was later discussed among management.stadtmauer later told zecher this is a stupid thing to do and you better make sure this guy does do it again.id.
lefkowitz was eventually barred from tuesday meetings and later resigned.he believed that management including stadtmauer had concluded that he was not a team player,was not willing to go along with what they want ed to do.id.at.
e.the verdict and stadtmauer motions 
following a trial the jury convicted stadtmauer of one count of conspiracy and nine counts of aiding in the willful filing of materially false or fraudulent partnership tax returns the district court denied stadtmauer motions for a judgment of acquittal and to dismiss the indictment in february,the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.he timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
iii.discussion 
stadtmauer contends that the district court erred in giving a willful blindness instruction to the jury the court improperly admitted prejudicial lay opinion testimony by a government witness the prosecutor violated his obligation to correct false testimony by a government witness the court improperly allowed an irs agent to testify as an expert witness and the court violated the federal rules of evidence and his sixth amendment rights by restricting the scope of his of government witnesses.we address each claim in turn.
willful blindness 
stadtmauer argues that the district court erred in giving a willful blindness instruction to the jury for three reasons.relying on cheek united states,he first argues that the willfulness element of criminal tax requires the government to prove that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,and that the defendant knew of th at duty,id.at never be satisfied by willful blindness.second,he contends that the court improperly instructed the jury that the element of intent could be satisfied through proof of willful blindness,by analogy in violation of our recent en banc decision in pierre attorney general,cir en banc.he finally argues that the trial evidence did not warrant a willful blindness instruction.
we exercise plenary review over whether a willful blindness instruction properly stated the law.united states khorozian,cir see also united states,cir.we review a district court determination that the trial evidence justified the instruction for abuse of discretion,united states flores,cir,and view the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the g overnment,at.
whether the district court willful blindness instruction applied to stadtmauer knowledge of the law 
before turning to stadtmauer first challenge to the district court willful blindness instruction,we address the government contention that the court instruction applied only to stadtmauer knowledge of facts,not his knowledge of the law.
the government initial proposed willful blindness instruction plainly applied to stadtmauer knowledge of the law.the final sentence of that instruction stated you may find that the defendant acted knowingly if you find either that the defendant actually knew about the applicable irs requirements for the prosecution years,or that the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what he had every reason to believe.stadtmauer submitted a brief objecting to this instruction.though he conceded that willful blindness may be appropriate to establish knowledge of facts,he argued that,under cheek,willfulness requires actual knowledge of the law,which can not be satisfied through deliberate ignorance.
at the charging conference,the government submitted a revised instruction that omitted the reference to stadtmauer knowledge of applicable irs requirements.it instead instructed the jury that the element of knowledge would be satisfied if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt a conscious purpose by the defendant to avoid knowledge that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent as to a material matter.app.at.though the government revised its charge to address stadtmauer objections,it nonetheless made explicit its position that willful blindness could cover both knowledge of the law and knowledge of facts,arguing that it is a little difficult to say that it ca apply to legal knowledge at all,because it really kind of a mixed question of law and fact in many tax cases.id.at.
in its final instructions,the district court gave a willful blindness instruction consistent with the government revised instruction.in relevant part,the court instructed the jury as follows 
the element of knowledge on the part of the defendant may be satisfied by inferences drawn from proof that the defendant closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to the defendant.a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a conscious purpose by the defendant to avoid knowledge that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent as to a material matter would permit an inference that he had such knowledge.
stated another way,the defendant knowledge of a fact or circumstance may be inferred from his willful blindness to the existence of that fact and circumstance.
no one can avoid responsibility for a crime by deliberately ignoring what is obvious.thus,you may find that the defendant knew that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent as to a material fact based on evidence that you find exists that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent as to a material matter and two,that defendant consciously and deliberately tried to avoid learning about this fact or circumstance.
app.emphases added.thus,though the court willful blindness instruction referred to stadtmauer knowledge of a fact or circumstance,it also instructed the jury that the government could satisfy its burden of proof on the element of knowledge by proving that stadtmauer consciously avoided learning that the returns were false or fraudulent as to a material matter,using language that tracks the applicable statute.see.
the government argues that the court reference to stadtmauer knowledge that the tax returns were false or fraudulent as to a material matter was merely addressed to stadtmauer knowledge of the contents of the returns.appellee br.at.the government notes,for example,that regardless of stadtmauer knowledge of the relevant tax laws,he could have consciously avoided learning of the fact that an expenditure from one partnership was falsely represented as a deduction of another partnership,a question of fact that did not require proof of stadtmauer knowledge of tax law.id.at.we disagree.
the government charges in this case were not limited to improper deductions for expenses,expenses paid by a partnership different than the one that actually incurred the expense.indeed,the bulk of the allegedly improper deductions were for expenditures that should have been capitalized,and it was undisputed that these amounts were paid for work that was actually performed.rather,for this category of deductions and others,the government theory was that legitimate expenditures were deducted in a fraudulent manner on the partnerships tax returns.
to prove that stadtmauer knew the partnership tax returns were false or fraudulent as to a material matter with respect to these deductions,the government needed to establish two facts beyond a reasonable doubt that stadtmauer knew that these expenditures were claimed as fully deductible business expenses and that he knew those deductions were impermissible under the relevant tax laws,that they rendered the tax returns false or fraudulent as to a material matter.united states schiff,cir noting that in a criminal tax case the defendant knowledge of tax law is,itself,a fact to be proved as part of the government case emphasis in original.in that light,we believe a reasonable juror could have interpreted the district court willful blindness instruction as applying not only to stadtmauer knowledge of facts,which expenditures were claimed as deductible business expenses on the tax returns,but also his knowledge of the law i,whether those deductions were materially false or fraudulent under the tax code.accordingly,we turn to stadtmauer argument that the court instruction incorrectly stated the law in that regard.
willful blindness and cheek 
stadtmauer argues that a willful blindness charge that applies to a defendant knowledge of the law is categorically and unequivocally inappropriate in a criminal tax case in light of the supreme court decision in cheek.appellant br.at.we disagree.
we begin with the facts of cheek.the defendant there stopped filing federal income tax returns in and was charged with willfully failing to file federal income tax returns and willfully attempting to evade income taxes.at.cheek defense at trial was that,as a result of indoctrination he received as a member of a group that believed the federal tax system is unconstitutional,he sincerely believed that the tax laws were being unconstitutionally enforced and that his actions were lawful,and thus had acted without the willfulness required for the offenses charged.id.at.
the trial court instructed the jury that,to satisfy the element of willfulness,the government was required to prove the voluntary and intentional violation of a known legal duty,a burden that could not be proved by showing mistake,ignorance,or negligence.id.however,the court also instructed the jury that only an objectively reasonable misunderstanding of the law would negate willfulness.id.emphasis added.the seventh circuit court affirmed cheek conviction,holding that even actual ignorance is not a defense unless the defendant ignorance was itself objectively reasonable.id.at.
the supreme court reversed.it first reaffirmed that the term willfully,as used in criminal tax statutes,carv es out an exception to the traditional rule that ignorance of the law is not a defense to criminal liability.id.at.second,it reaffirmed its prior decisions establishing that the standard for the statutory willfulness requirement is the voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.id.at quoting pomponio,at see also united states bishop.
turning to the jury instruction given in cheek trial,the court concluded that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that a claimed belief must be objectively reasonable to negat e evidence purporting to show a defendant awareness of the legal duty at issue.at.the court explained that,in proving that a defendant had actual knowledge of the legal duty imposed on him by the tax laws,the government must also 
negat e a defendant claim of ignorance of the law or a claim that because of a misunderstanding of the law,he had a belief that he was not violating any of the provisions of the tax laws.this is so because one can not be aware that the law imposes a duty upon him and yet be ignorant of it,misunderstand the law,or believe that the duty does not exist.in the end,the issue is whether,based on all the evidence,the government has proved that the defendant was aware of the duty at issue,which can not be true if the jury credits a misunderstanding and belief submission,whether or not the claimed belief or misunderstanding is objectively reasonable.
id.at.the court thus distinguished between two types of persons a person with actual knowledge of a legal duty,and a person who,in good faith,is ignorant of the duty,misunderstands it,or believes that it does not exist.it held that criminal tax liability could not attach to a person in the latter category.
stadtmauer attempt to equate a person who deliberately avoids learning of a legal duty with a person falling within the latter category,one who is ignorant of that duty by virtue of a belief or misunderstanding is not persuasive.the willful blindness charge,also known as a deliberate ignorance charge,originates from the ninth circuit court decision in united states jewell,cir.see united states caminos,cir.jewell explained that 
t he substantive justification for the charge is that deliberate ignorance and positive knowledge are equally culpable.the textual justification is that in common understanding one knows facts of which he is less than absolutely certain.to act knowingly,therefore,is not necessarily to act only with positive knowledge,but also to act with an awareness of the high probability of the existence of the fact in question.when such awareness is present,positive knowledge is not required.
jewell,at emphasis added.thus,willful blindness is a subjective state of mind that is deemed to satisfy a scienter requirement of knowledge,united states v.one rolls royce,cir,and can not become a safe harbor for culpable conduct,at.
we see nothing in did not involve a willful blindness suggests the supreme court intended to exempt criminal tax prosecutions from this general rule.united states bussey,cir defendant reliance on cheek in challenging willful blindness instruction in criminal tax trial was seriously misplaced because cheek did not involve a willful blindness instruction.the justification for requiring knowledge of the relevant tax laws is that,in our complex tax system,uncertainty often arises even among taxpayers who earnestly wish to follow the law,and it is not the purpose of the law to penalize frank difference s of opinion or innocent errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care.cheek,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also bryan united states,explaining that t he danger of convicting individuals engaged in apparently innocent activity is what motivated the court decision in cheek united states murdock,congress did not intend that a person,by reason of a bona fide misunderstanding,should become a criminal by his mere failure to measure up to the prescribed standard of conduct,overruled on other grounds by murphy waterfront comm n.by definition,one who intentionally avoids learning of his tax obligations is not a taxpayer who earnestly wish es to follow the law,or fails to do so as a result of an innocent error made despite the exercise of reasonable care.cheek,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.rather,a person who deliberately evades learning his legal duties has a subjectively culpable state of mind that goes beyond mere negligence,a good faith misunderstanding,or even recklessness,at willful blindness is not to be equated with negligence or lack of due care,for willful blindness is a subjective state of mind that is deemed to satisfy a scienter requirement of knowledge.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also rolls royce,at describing the mainstream conception of willful blindness as a state of mind of much greater culpability than simple negligence or recklessness,and more akin to knowledge.
several of our sister circuit courts have similarly concluded that a willful blindness instruction that applies to a defendant knowledge of tax law does not run afoul of cheek.see united states anthony,cir united states dean,cir bussey,at the first and eleventh circuit courts have interpreted cheek as counseling that,though a belief that one is complying with the tax laws need not be objectively reasonable to constitute a defense,it nonetheless must be held in good faith.anthony,at see also dean,at reasoning that the cheek court had,albeit,not in so many words,held that the law would not countenance willful blindness to one tax obligations.accordingly,the defense that the accused did not know of his legal duty fails if he came by his ignorance through deliberate avoidance of materials that would have apprised him of his duty,as such avoidance undermines the claim of good faith.anthony,at see also dean,at a willful blindness instruction is entirely appropriate where the evidence supports a finding that a defendant intentionally insulated himself from knowledge of his tax obligations.
we agree with the reasoning of these courts and join them in concluding that a willful blindness instruction that applies to a defendant knowledge of the law in a criminal tax case such as the instruction at issue here does not run afoul of cheek.
the district court willful blindness instruction in this case also adhered to our precedent requiring that such an instruction make clear that the defendant himself was subjectively aware of the high probability of the fact in question,and not merely that a reasonable man would have been aware of the probability,at quoting caminos,at.the court instructed the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that stadtmauer was aware of a high probability that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent as to a material matter,and consciously and deliberately tried to avoid learning about this fact.app.the court told the jury that it could not find the element of knowledge satisfied if it found only that stadtmauer should have known that the tax returns at issue were false as to a material matter,or that a reasonable person would have known of a high probability of that fact.id.emphases added.finally,the court stressed that it was insufficient that stadtmauer may have been stupid or foolish or may have acted out of inadvertence or accident.a showing of negligence or of a mistake of law is not sufficient to support a finding of knowledge.id.
the instruction as a whole thus belies stadtmauer claims that the district court allowed the jury to substitute a failure to inquire for evidence of actual knowledge of the tax laws allowed the jury to convict him simply for being ignorant of or for misunderstanding the law and instructed the jury to apply an objective test in determining whether he had knowledge of the law appellant br.at.accordingly,we conclude that the court willful blindness instruction correctly stated the law.
whether the district court willful blindness instruction applied to the element of specific intent 
though we agree with stadtmauer that the district court willful blindness instruction could be interpreted as applying to his knowledge of the law,we reject his argument that the instruction also and impermissibly applied to the element of intent.
in addition to requiring a known legal duty,cheek requires proof that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.at.willfulness thus requires more than a general intent to accomplish an act it requires proof that the act was done with the specific intent to do something that the law forbids.see id.at pomponio,at murdock,at see also carter united states,explaining that general intent as opposed to specific intent requires that the defendant possessed knowledge only with respect to the actus reus of the crime.
the penultimate paragraph of the district court willful blindness instruction stated 
y ou may find that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully if you find beyond a reasonable doubt either that the defendant actually knew that the tax returns were false or fraudulent as to a material matter or that the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what he had every reason to believe.app.stadtmauer argues that the court instruction that the jury could find that stadtmauer acted knowingly and willfully if he deliberately closed his eyes to what he had every reason to believe improperly substituted willful blindness for proof of a specific intent,as the element of willfulness encompasses both a knowledge and intent component.in that light,stadtmauer argues that the court instruction by analogy ran afoul of pierre,where we held that,although w illful blindness can be used to establish knowledge,it does not satisfy the specific intent requirement under the convention against torture cat at.
even assuming that the inclusion of these two words and willfully in the district court willful blindness instruction was technically an incorrect statement of the law we conclude that the court instructions,taken as a whole,properly instructed the jury as to the proof required for the element of intent.united states leahy,cir.the court instructions made clear that willful blindness applied only to the element of knowledge.see app.the element of knowledge on the part of the defendant may be satisfied by inferences drawn from proof that the defendant closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.emphasis added.indeed,aside from two isolated instances where the court mentioned the words willfully or willfulness,its instruction referred only to the element of knowledge,stadtmauer knowledge that the tax returns at issue were false or fraudulent,or his knowledge of a fact or circumstance.it never mentioned intent,purpose,or any other language that could be reasonably interpreted as applying to the element of intent.
in this context,we can not agree that a reasonable juror would have concluded from the district court instructions that a finding of willful blindness may also satisfy the element of specific intent.see united states gurary,cir though the trial court also mentioned conscious avoidance in connection with willfulness,the components of which are knowledge and intent,a fair reading of the charge as a whole indicate d that conscious avoidance was to be used only in connection with the knowledge component.accordingly,we reject stadtmauer contention that the court willful blindness instruction improperly charged the jury as to the element of intent.
whether trial evidence warranted the willful blindness instruction 
stadtmauer finally argues that the trial evidence did not warrant a willful blindness instruction,noting simply that n ot one of the government witnesses directly claimed that he deliberately tried to shield himself from learning any fact about the tax returns.appellant br.at.we disagree.the government need not present direct evidence of conscious avoidance to justify a willful blindness instruction,united states singh,cir.in any event,the district court did not err in concluding that the instruction was warranted in this case.
at trial,there was abundant evidence that stadtmauer was intimately involved with the operations of the partnerships and was aware of how the partnerships characterized capital expenditures,charitable contributions,gift and entertainment expenses,and expenses in the general ledgers and financial statements.there was also evidence that,despite this despite the logical inference that,as bentzlin described,if there is garbage in,there garbage out app stadtmauer spent very little time reviewing the partnerships tax returns,and never asked questions of ssmb as to the propriety of the expenses deducted therein.one possible inference from this is what stadtmauer asked the jury to draw that he relied in good faith on his accountants to prepare the tax returns consistent with applicable law and thus had no need to review them closely.however,another possible inference is that stadtmauer deliberately avoided ask ing the natural question s,whether the deductions claimed in the tax returns were consistent with how expenses were falsely characterized in the general ledgers and reported on the financial his awareness of a high probability of that fact,at united states brodie,f d,cir see also united states stewart,cir evidence justified willful blindness instruction in mail fraud and money laundering trial,where the defendant maintained that he lacked the intent to defraud because he relied upon the findings of solvency reported in state examinations and audit reports,and where the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant recognized the likelihood of insolvency yet deliberately avoided learning the true facts.
in this context,we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in giving a willful blindness instruction 
lay opinion testimony 
stadtmauer next contends that the district court admitted impermissible lay opinion testimony as to his knowledge of the falseness of the partnerships tax returns by ssmb partner stanley bekritsky.we review the admission of lay opinion testimony for abuse of discretion.united states hoffecker,cir.
background 
about one month into trial,the government informed defense counsel that,during a recent interview in preparation for his testimony,bekritsky had recalled a tax return signing session during which stadtmauer asked him whether the returns were okay to sign.the government disclosed that bekritsky understood stadtmauer question to be about whether the irs would be likely to detect the problems with the returns,and stated i signed them in response to stadtmauer question.
stadtmauer filed a motion in limine to prevent bekritsky from testifying as to his understanding of stadtmauer intended meaning of the question that stadtmauer posed to bekritsky.id.at.stadtmauer argued that such testimony would be impermissible lay opinion testimony under federal rule of evidence.the government opposed the motion,arguing that,as a participant in the conversation,bekritsky should be permitted under rule to testify as to his understanding of what stadtmauer was attempting to convey to him.the government further noted that,unless bekritsky was permitted to testify as to that understanding,stadtmauer question could be interpreted as having an exculpatory meaning,that he was seeking bekritsky confirmation that the tax returns were.id.at.
the district court granted the motion in limine,reasoning that the jurors could come to their own conclusions about what stadtmauer meant by the question.app.the court nonetheless made clear that the government was authorized to ask bekritsky what he mean t when he said,i signed it.id.
at trial,bekritsky testified on direct examination as follows 
q.did stadtmauer ever ask you generally about the returns 
q.what did he ask you 
on one occasion,he asked me if he he should sign the the returns were okay,and 
and i said,i signed the returns.
q.what did mean by that 
defense counsel objection.
the court i do want you to tell us what you thought stadtmauer meant by asking you the question.you can testify,however,as to what you meant by your answer.
a.what i meant by my answer was that i knew that there were problems with these tax returns,and based upon my understanding of richard involvement,richard knew 
defense counsel objection.

the parties then went to sidebar,where defense counsel objected to bekritsky testifying to what stadtmauer knew or did know.id.at.counsel argued that bekritsky testifying about what stadtmauer knew was the basis for the motion in limine.id.
the district court disagreed 
i disagree with you that was the basis of the court ruling.the basis was his interpretation of a statement by stadtmauer as to what stadtmauer statement meant,because those words,in my view,did not need interpretation to help the jury.
that is different than this witness testifying about what,based on his perception,he believed stadtmauer knew or did know,so i will allow it.
id.bekritsky testimony then resumed 
the court you said,what i meant by my answer was that i knew there were problems with these tax returns,and based on my understanding of richard involvement.what did you mean by that 
richard was involved with the details of the operations of the partnerships.he knew that professional expenses of one entity were being paid by another entity.
defense counsel same objection to his testimony as to what stadtmauer knew or did know.
the court overruled.
the court what did you intend to convey when you said you signed it 
a.what i intended to convey was there were problems that we both knew that existed in the returns.the returns were prepared in a way that i thought that they would get by the government and questions would not be raised.
id.at emphasis added.
defense counsel then moved to strike bekritsky statement as to what stadtmauer knew in the alternative,he moved for a mistrial.defense counsel argued that bekritsky testimony was incredibly prejudicial,had no probative value at all,and lacked a foundation.id.at.the district court denied stadtmauer motions,reasoning that bekritsky perception of stadtmauer involvement in and knowledge of the partnerships provided a sufficient foundation for his testimony as to what stadtmauer knew and in testifying that stadtmauer knew that things were being expensed that should have been,bekritsky was merely explaining what he meant when he said i signed it.id.at.
at the close of its summation,the government quoted bekritsky testimony and emphasized that,instead of asking whether the returns were accurate or a hundred percent correct,stadtmauer had asked whether they were okay to sign.id.at.in that in light of bekritsky testimony regarding what he intended to convey by his answer,i signed them the government argued that stadtmauer goal was not to file accurate,true returns,but to file returns that would not raise flags with the irs.id.
by contrast,defense counsel urged the jury to draw the opposite inference from bekritsky testimony.counsel argued in summation that any reasonable person would have interpreted stadtmauer question to mean the returns are okay to sign,meaning that they are correct.id.at.in that light,defense counsel contended that bekritsky testimony as a whole exonerate d stadtmauer.id.
stadtmauer argues that bekritsky testimony that stadtmauer knew there were problems with the tax returns was inadmissible under federal rule of evidence.in relevant part,it limits lay testimony in the form of opinions or inferences to those which are a rationally based on the perception of the witness,and b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.
rule represents a movement away from courts historically skeptical view of lay opinion evidence,and is rooted in the modern trend away from fine distinctions between fact and opinion and toward greater admissibility.asplundh div.benton harbor eng g,cir see also,kimball int l,cir.the rule is nonetheless designed to exclude lay opinion testimony that amount s to little more than choosing up sides.advisory committee note,or that merely tell s the jury what result to reach,united states.rea,cir quoting.advisory committee note on proposed rules.lay testimony in the form of an opinion about what a defendant did or did not know often comes dangerously close to doing just this.though we have never held that lay opinion evidence concerning the knowledge of a third party is per se inadmissible,we have explained that this kind of evidence is difficult to admit under either prong of rule 
if the witness fails to describe the opinion basis,in the form of descriptions of specific incidents,the opinion testimony should be rejected on the ground that it is not based on the witness perceptions.to the extent the witness describes the basis of his or her opinion,that testimony should be rejected on the ground that it is not helpful because the fact finder is able to reach his or her own conclusion,making the opinion testimony irrelevant.
united states polishan,cir internal citation omitted.
in our case,stadtmauer primarily argues that bekritsky testimony was inadmissible under the first prong of rule.bekritsky opinion that stadtmauer knew there were problems in the tax returns was not,according to stadtmauer,rationally based on bekritsky perceptions because he never discussed with stadtmauer the falseness of any specific tax return or any deduction claimed on a return.appellant br.at.we do not follow this path.
rule rationally based requirement is essentially a restatement of the personal knowledge requirement necessary for all lay witness testimony.see.advisory committee note see also christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence,at ed.we agree with the district court that bekritsky testimony that stadtmauer knew there were problems with the partnership tax,that certain partnerships were claiming deductions for expenses paid on behalf of other partnerships expenses was at least rationally based on his perception of stadtmauer involvement with and control over the operations of the partnerships,knowledge of how certain kinds of expenditures were characterized in the partnerships general ledgers and financial statements,and knowledge that those materials were used to prepare the partnerships tax returns.polishan,at lay opinion testimony may be based on the witness own perceptions and knowledge and participation in the affairs of the business.alteration in original quoting lightning lube,witco,cir rea,at t here are a number of objective factual bases from which it is possible to infer that a person knows a given fact,including what the person was in a position to see or hear,conduct in which he engaged,and what his background and experience were.
indeed,our court and other circuit courts have held far more prejudicial statements to satisfy this rule requirement even where such statements violated rule helpfulness requirement.see united states anderskow,cir lay witness testimony that defendant must have known of loan fraud scheme satisfied the rationally based requirement of rule,as the testimony was based on the witness knowledge of the defendant frequent exposure to fraudulent loan schedules see also united states wantuch,cir lay witness testimony that defendant knew all the time that everything that he was doing was illegal satisfied the rationally based requirement of rule,as the witness was deeply involved in the fraudulent scheme and was the defendant contact every step of the way rea,at,lay witness testimony that defendant had to have known of scheme to evade taxes satisfied the rationally based requirement of rule,as the witness testified that he repeatedly told the defendant that he lacked a license that would exempt their transactions from federal excise taxes.
whether bekritsky testimony violated the helpfulness prong of rule requires closer attention at first blush,bekritsky testimony that stadtmauer knew there were problems with the returns seems unhelpful because the basis for b ekritsky,stadtmauer intimate knowledge of the partnerships operations and how their books and records were already in evidence.rea,at w hen a witness has fully described what a defendant was in a position to observe,what the defendant was told,and what the defendant said or did,the witness opinion as to the defendant knowledge will often not be helpful because the jury will be in as good a position as the witness to draw the inference as to whether or not the defendant knew.
bekritsky testimony is nonetheless different in important respects from the lay opinion testimony we found inadmissible in anderskow,the principal case on which stadtmauer relies.in that case,a cooperating conspirator in a loan fraud conspiracy testified that he provided one of the defendants,donald anchors,with fraudulent loan schedules to be passed along to borrowers.at.on direct examination,the government asked the witness whether anchors would have been deceived by the information that the witness was sending him.id.the witness responded 
donald anchors had probably or borrowers,maybe more for all i know,who had been promised millions of dollars for a long time,some as long as a year.he had never seen one dime funded or loaned,and he kept on with the business at hand.i had no reason to believe that he was fully aware of what was occurring,as long as he was getting paid.
id.at emphasis added.we held that this testimony was inadmissible under rule helpfulness prong,reasoning that a witness subjective belief that a defendant must have known of the object of a conspiracy is not helpful to a factfinder that has before it the very circumstantial evidence upon which the subjective opinion is based.id.at.stated another way,the witness testimony was not thus inadmissible under rule the jury was in just as good a position as the witness to infer what anchors must have known.
however,unlike the witness in anderskow,bekritsky did not offer his opinion as to what stadtmauer knew in a vacuum.rather,bekritsky was responding to a question asking him to explain what he meant by his ambiguous answer i signed them to stadtmauer equally ambiguous questions whether he should sign the returns,and whether the returns were okay.rather than opining as to what stadtmauer must have known,bekritsky more specifically testified as to what he believed stadtmauer knew at the time of this conversation in the context of explaining why he answered stadtmauer questions the way he did.in that light,even if bekritsky opinion regarding what stadtmauer knew was unhelpful to the determination of a fact in issue,whether stadtmauer had guilty knowledge,it arguably was helpful to a clear understanding of bekritsky testimony.united states de peri,cir lay witness testimony was helpful to a clear understanding of conversations consisting of unfinished sentences and punctuated with ambiguous references to events that were only clear to the participants see also united states urlacher,cir lay witness testimony was helpful to a clear understanding of statements or words recorded on the tape that would be ambiguous or unclear to someone who was not a participant in the conversation united states awan,cir same 
this question is close.however,even assuming that the district court erred in refusing to strike bekritsky testimony we conclude that any error was harmless.a error at trial does not warrant reversal where it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment.united states helbling,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also kotteakos united states.this high probability standard requires that we have a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant however,we may be firmly convinced that the error was harmless without disproving every reasonable possibility of prejudice.united states jannotti,cir.
when bekritsky testimony is viewed in the context of the record as a whole,we conclude that it is highly probable that any error in admitting that testimony did not prejudice stadtmauer.see,united states zehrbach,cir the harmless error doctrine requires that the court consider an error in light of the record as a whole.though stadtmauer challenges bekritsky testimony that stadtmauer knew there were problems with the returns,he does not challenge bekritsky testimony that,by his answer i signed them,he intended to convey that there were problems that existed in the returns and t he returns were prepared in a way that bekritsky thought that they would get by the government and questions would not be raised.app.the plain and unmistakable implication of these unchallenged portions of bekritsky testimony is that he believed stadtmauer also knew that there were problems with the return.otherwise,bekritsky explanation of what he intended to convey by answering i signed them would be nonsensical 
moreover,any error in refusing to strike bekritsky testimony regarding what he believed stadtmauer knew was harmless in light of the mountain of circumstantial evidence supporting the inference that stadtmauer knew that improper deductions were claimed in the partnerships tax returns,anderskow,at,including evidence that stadtmauer was intimately familiar with how the partnerships operated and maintained their general ledgers was involved in deciding which partnerships would pay certain expenditures was aware that certain expenditures were falsely characterized as expenses in the ledgers and financial statements mischaracterized expenditures in the partnerships financial statements when expedient and made all of these decisions with awareness of their tax consequences,the tuition payments for zecher children,and the decision to continue appreciating capital expenditures for the partnerships involved in the wny transaction.in that light,we are conviced that,regardless of bekritsky testimony,the jury would have rejected stadtmauer defense that he genuinely believed that by plotkin,to whom kc was funneling yearly bonuses and private school tuition,for purposes of the partnerships tax returns,correcting the extensive mischaracterizations of expenditures as reflected in the partnerships general ledgers and financial statements.
in sum,any error in admitting bekritsky testimony is harmless and thus does not require reversal.
prosecutorial misconduct 
stadtmauer claims that the government violated his due process rights by improperly standing silent when one of its witnesses,former coo scott zecher,made several statements during that the lead prosecutor knew to be false.appellant br.at.to succeed on this claim,stadtmauer bears the burden of establishing that zecher committed perjury the government knew or should have known that zecher committed perjury but failed to correct his testimony and there is a reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the verdict.see hoffecker,at.because stadtmauer can not meet his burden as to the first two of these elements,we need not address the third.
in,zecher was interviewed several times by fbi agents and prosecutors including one of the prosecutors that tried stadtmauer case.during trial,defense counsel sought to impeach zecher with his statements during these interviews,as recorded in summaries prepared by the fbi agents present known as form.to take one example,defense counsel asked zecher during whether he recalled telling investigators that kushner,and not stadtmauer,had raised the idea of paying zecher children private school tuition rather than paying zecher a bonus.app.zecher first stated that he did not recall making the statement,and then denied that he made such a statement.defense counsel then showed zecher the form to refresh his recollection,which stated 
zecher stated when he was hired kushner told him that he could not pay zecher the salary he wanted,but instead would make up the difference in bonuses in june and december.kc normally issues bonuses to employees in december,but does not issue bonuses in june.zecher stated that because no bonuses were paid in june,kushner would pay zecher school tuition rather than paying him a bonus.
id.at.zecher denied that the form refreshed his recollection,and was adamant that the only conversations he had regarding the issue were with stadtmauer.id.at.though the district court permitted stadtmauer to zecher on the content of his statements,it refused on several occasions to admit the form themselves as prior inconsistent statements,rulings,we note,that stadtmauer does not challenge.the court reasoning was that the form contained the fbi characterizations of what zecher said which zecher had not adopted 
after both sides rested,defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the perjured testimony of scott zecher and the government failure to correct that testimony.id.at.defense counsel argued that,when considered in light of the totality of zecher included numerous instances where zecher testified that he could not recall certain events and was enough for the district court to determine that zecher testimony was demonstrably false.the court denied the motion,explaining that it could not find that zecher apparent lack of recollection in some instances was due to confusion or mistake or faulty memory or a willful lie.id.at.
we review a district court factual finding that a witness testimony was not false for clear error,and will not disturb that finding unless it is wholly unsupported by the evidence.hoffecker,at.we have little trouble concluding that the district court finding in this case was not clearly erroneous.as the court noted,other than the inconsistencies between the fbi agent notes and zecher recollection of his statements,there was no other evidence that zecher perjured himself.united states dunnigan,a witness does not commit perjury if his false testimony is the result of confusion,mistake,or faulty memory.
even assuming the district court clearly erred in finding that zecher testimony was not false,stadtmauer has not demonstrated that the government knew or should have known that zecher testimony was false.see hoffecker,at.stadtmauer relies on united states harris,cir,where the government failed to correct a witness who falsely testified during that prosecutors had made no promises to help her achieve a reduced sentence on pending state charges in exchange for her testimony against the defendant.in concluding the government had violated its duty to disclose a promise made to a government witness,id.at,we first noted that the witness arguably had not committed perjury by her responses because she may have believed in good faith that the questions posed to her only referred to specific promises concerning her sentence,which the government did not and could not make.id.at.we reasoned,however,that the prosecution duty to disclose false testimony should not be narrowly and technically limited to those situations where the prosecutor knows that the witness is guilty of the crime of perjury.id.at.rather,when it should be obvious to the government that the witness answer,although made in good faith,is untrue,it has an obligation to correct that testimony.id.
the circumstances of zecher testimony are far afield from the witness testimony in harris,where it was undisputed that the prosecutor had personal knowledge that the witness answers were not correct.see id.at prosecutor admitted that he had promised the cooperating witness that the government would do whatever it could to get her state sentence reduced.here,there was no way for the prosecutor to know whether zecher was giving false testimony when he could not certain statements during the interviews.thus,stadtmauer assertion that the government counsel refused to speak up when he knew for a fact that zecher had made false statements is simply unsupported by the record.tapia tansy,cir contradictions and changes in a witness testimony alone do not constitute perjury and do not create an inference,let alone prove,that the prosecution knowingly presented perjured testimony.
expert testimony 
over stadtmauer objection,the district court permitted irs agent susan grant to testify as an expert and summary witness.see.stadtmauer argues that the court erred in admitting agent grant testimony because she opined,with insufficient factual or legal foundation,that the kc partnership returns were false and fraudulent.appellant br.at.we review a district court admission of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.estate of schneider fried,cir.
prior to trial,the government disclosed the expert testimony that agent grant intended to provide and produced to defense counsel a set of her summary charts.stadtmauer moved in limine to preclude grant from testifying,arguing that her proposed testimony would improperly bear on the ultimate legal issues in the case,and would be unhelpful and unreliable.the district court denied stadtmauer motion,finding that grant testimony had sufficient indicia of reliability and relation to the facts of this case.
in her direct testimony,grant described how a partnership tax return is prepared,and explained where on the return different categories of deductions were reported.grant explained how she totaled the expenses she determined were improperly deducted from each partnership return,and carried them through to a summary chart for each partnership for each tax year,illustrating how the total amount of improper deductions affected the net income reported to the irs.defense counsel vigorously grant for two days,including questions on many specific deductions,and nearly every category of deductions,she determined were improperly claimed.
our sister circuit courts that have addressed the issue are unanimous that expert testimony by an irs agent which expresses an opinion as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction is admissible evidence.united states mikutowicz,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see,united states bedford,cir united states pree,cir united states sabino,cir,modified on other grounds,cir united states duncan,cir united states moore,cir.the primary limitation on such testimony is that the expert may not testify about the defendant state of mind when the challenged deductions were claimed.mikutowicz,at see.b an expert witness may not opine as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged see also sabino,at.
in our case,it is undisputed that grant did not opine on stadtmauer knowledge or intent.stadtmauer nonetheless argues that the district court impermissibly allowed her to interpret the tax laws and add her unreliable and otherwise inadmissible opinion that the tax returns were false and fraudulent.appellant br.at.stadtmauer seeks to compare grant testimony to expert testimony the second circuit court found objectionable in united states scop,cir.there an investigator from the securities and exchange commission testified as an expert in securities trading practices,and opined,drawing directly upon the language of the statute,that the defendants scheme of buying and selling securities to create artificial price levels constituted market manipulation and fraud.id.at.the second circuit court determined that,through this testimony,the expert had invade d the province of the court to determine the applicable law and to instruct the jury as to that law.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in addition,the expert conceded on that his opinion was largely based not on his expertise in securities trading,but on his positive assessment of the trustworthiness and accuracy of the testimony of the government witnesses.id.at.
agent grant testimony is far from the expert testimony deemed objectionable in scop.she never used the words false or fraudulent to describe any of the deductions she concluded were improper,and did not base any portion of her testimony on her assessment of the credibility of other witnesses.accordingly,scop is unavailing to stadtmauer.hoffecker,at distinguishing the testimony in scop from testimony that defendant commodities investment program was a scam,where the witness did not couch his view on the language of the mail fraud statute,and did not base his opinion on the credibility or testimony of others see also duncan,at distinguishing the testimony in scop from irs agent testimony that did not use any legally specialized terms and was based on the agent own investigation of the facts and review of the records.
stadtmauer also contends that the district court erred in admitting grant testimony because she made mischaracterizations and bald assertions of the law in explaining her opinions.appellant br.at.the record belies these assertions in any event,all expert testimony as to the proper tax consequences of a transaction is bound to touch on the law to some extent,mikutowicz,at,and we have little trouble concluding that grant testimony did not improperly invade the province of the court.indeed,the court not only gave extensive instructions on the applicable tax laws,and during grant testimony emphasized to the jury that it was bound to follow the law as the court tell s you it applies in this case.app.the court emphasized that only it,and not grant,was authorized to instruct the jury as to the law.see id.at for example,instructing the jury that to the extent that agent grant use s the word law,i will instruct you as to the law at the end of the case.agent grant can certainly testify as to what her understanding based on her experience as a tax expert is and to what the irs view of things is.
in sum,to the extent there were as stadtmauer contends shortcomings in the irs agent conclusions as to the propriety of specific deductions,they were raised properly on and went to the credibility,not the admissibility,of her testimony,kannankeril terminix int l,cir,and the record in this case confirms that defense counsel had ample opportunity to grant on her specific conclusions,methodology,and assumptions accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting agent grant testimony 
restrictions on 
we end with the argument that stadtmauer raises first that the district court improperly barred him from affirmatively admitting certain exhibits into evidence during of government witnesses.we review a district court rulings on the scope of for abuse of discretion,united states casoni,cir,but to the extent the district court ruling turns on an interpretation of a federal rule of evidence,our review is plenary,united states velasquez,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
stadtmauer contends that the district court erroneously barred him from admitting several categories of exhibits during defense counsel of bentzlin,zecher,and bekritsky.for example,during of zecher,defense counsel sought to introduce hundreds of advertisements bearing the name kushner companies instead of the name of an individual partnership.defense counsel sought to introduce the concept of branding through these exhibits,and thus to offer an exculpatory explanation for why expenses incurred by one partnership were frequently paid by a different partnership 
the district court prevented stadtmauer from admitting these documents because they were materials rather than impeachment materials.see,app.excluding proposed defense exhibits during because they were not really specifically impeachment material,but more akin to type evidence id.at excluding proposed defense exhibits during because stadtmauer was limited to impeachment material,not material.stadtmauer contends that the district court thereby violated federal rule of evidence b,which provides that should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination,and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.b.he argues that the court erroneously barred him from admitting the documents on the grounds that they did not impeach the witness even though they pertained to the subject matter of the witness direct testimony,and could be introduced in stadtmauer.united states segal,cir the fact that some of the points which defendant sought to explore could have been introduced in the defense case is not determinative of whether the evidence is within the subject matter of the government direct examination.
from our review of the record,however,it is apparent that the district court was using the terms materials and impeachment materials as shorthand to describe those documents that it would or would not permit stadtmauer to introduce during so as to manage effectively the presentation of evidence.the court did not rely on rule b in its rulings,and,as it later described,the question was not the admissibility of these exhibits but the timing of the ir introduction.app.see also id.at agreeing that proposed defense exhibit was within the subject matter of the government direct examination,but excluding it because it was more akin to a document.
in that light,the more pertinent provision of rule is subsection a,which grants district courts broad discretion to exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence.a see also charles wright victor gold,federal practice and procedure,at rule a gives trial courts broad powers to control the mode and order of what is otherwise admissible evidence.in our case,we have little trouble concluding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in postponing the admission of stadtmauer proposed exhibits,even if they were technically within the subject matter of the government direct examination.see,united states lambert,cir district court did not abuse its discretion under rule a by excluding defendant proffers of voluminous documentary evidence during united states ellison,cir district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding proposed defense exhibits during,even assuming the documents would have been relevant rebuttal evidence if offered during the presentation of the defendant own case.
finally,even assuming that the district court relied on an erroneous interpretation of rule b in excluding stadtmauer proposed exhibits,the error was harmless.for example,though the court did not permit stadtmauer to introduce the kc advertisements themselves,it nonetheless gave defense counsel broad leeway to use them in zecher.the court allowed defense counsel to show zecher approximately advertisements,and he agreed that they refreshed his recollection that kc placed advertisements in newspapers and professional journals and spent money advertising the kushner name.he also agreed that management used the name kushner companies in a generic sense,rather than listing all or partnerships on corporate materials.id.at.through this testimony,defense counsel was able to establish the same basic point that the partnerships often did business under the name kushner companies rather than names of individual partnerships in this context,we conclude that any error in excluding the exhibits during defense counsel of the government witnesses did not prejudice stadtmauer 
in summary,we conclude that a willful blindness instruction may,where warranted by the trial evidence in a criminal tax case,properly apply to a defendant knowledge of his legal duties.the district court did not abuse its discretion in giving such an instruction in this case,and we disagree with stadtmauer contention that the instruction also impermissibly applied to the element of specific intent.
though the question whether bekritsky lay opinion testimony was admissible under rule is close,we conclude that an error here,if any,was harmless.in addition,we reject stadtmauer prosecutorial misconduct claim based on the government supposed failure to correct zecher testimony that he could not recall statements he purportedly made to fbi agents with government counsel present during investigatory interviews.finally,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert testimony of an irs agent in this complicated tax fraud case,and preventing stadtmauer from affirmatively admitting certain categories of exhibits into evidence during defense counsel of government witnesses.
for these reasons,we affirm the district court judgment of conviction.

stadtmauer moved before trial to dismiss the indictment to the extent it was based on the failure to capitalize expenditures,arguing that the law on capita
