opinion of the court 
rogers lockett argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress because the police exceeded the scope of his consent to search his suitcase and unlawfully seized him,rendering the search of his backpack involuntary.additionally,he submits that he is no longer bound by the dictates of his plea agreement as a result of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d.we will affirm.
lockett was sitting on a bench in the amtrak street train station in philadelphia.after watching lockett for approximately fifteen minutes,special agent carl giardinelli and corporal william burdette approached him.burdette showed lockett his badge,identified himself,and asked if lockett would answer a few questions.after lockett answered yes,burdette sat down on the bench approximately two feet to lockett right and giardinelli remained standing a few feet to the right of burdette.burdette asked lockett some questions about his travel and lockett explained that he was from philadelphia but was traveling to boston,where he attends newbury college.burdette examined lockett identification and train ticket and then returned them to lockett.
burdette explained to lockett that he and agent giardinelli were looking for contraband including narcotics,large sums of money,guns,and other weapons.he asked lockett if he had any of these items in his possession lockett said that he did not.then burdette asked lockett if the rolling suitcase on the seat next to lockett belonged to him and lockett admitted that it did.burdette asked if he could look in the suitcase and lockett said yes.lockett then placed the suitcase on the floor and started to open it,at which point burdette said,that okay,i can get that.lockett responded,no,i get it,but burdette repeated,no,that okay,i can get it.burdette then opened the bag.
after opening the suitcase,giardinelli and burdette saw three large plastic bags that contained numerous small clear plastic bags,which the officers recognized as the type of bags commonly used to package illegal drugs.on one of the larger bags was a picture of a marijuana leaf.burdette pushed the rolling suitcase over to giardinelli,who continued searching through it.
while giardinelli was searching the suitcase,burdette asked lockett if the other bag,a backpack,belonged to him and lockett said yes.burdette asked if he could look in the backpack and lockett said yes and handed the backpack to burdette.
as giardinelli was searching the rolling suitcase,his finger hit a metal object and he realized it was a gun he yelled gun in a loud voice so as to get the attention of burdette and the other law enforcement officers in the vicinity.burdette and officer sean martin,an amtrak police officer,handcuffed lockett and walked him from the public area of the train station to the amtrak police station,which was a short distance away within the same building.lockett was handcuffed to a bench in the amtrak police station while burdette physically searched through the bags with giardinelli observing nearby after the search,officer james corbett,a member of the philadelphia police department,read lockett his miranda rights and then asked him who owned the guns.lockett answered,the guns are mine.corbett then asked lockett from whom he obtained the firearms,at which point lockett said that he wanted to talk to a lawyer.at this point all questioning of lockett stopped.
lockett was charged with possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute,possession of firearms in connection with a drug trafficking offense,and possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers.lockett filed a motion to suppress the physical evidence and the statements he made to the law enforcement officers.after a hearing,the district court denied the motion,with the following detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law the encounter between burdette,giardinelli,and lockett was not coercive and did not constitute a stop or seizure under the fourth amendment a reasonable person in lockett position would have felt free to refuse to talk to giardinelli and burdette lockett voluntarily gave his consent to search his rolling suitcase and backpack lockett never revoked his consent to the searches of his rolling suitcase and backpack lockett was not in custody until his arrest after giardinelli discovered the gun in his rolling suitcase and lockett voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently waived his miranda rights prior to saying the guns are mine.
pursuant to a written guilty plea agreement,lockett pleaded guilty to all charges,reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.the plea agreement expressly limited the defendant right to appeal,excepting only an appeal based on a claim that the defendant sentence exceeded the statutory maximum,that the sentencing judge erroneously departed upwards from the guidelines range,or that the district court erroneously decided the suppression issues.
the district court imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers pursuant to the federal sentencing guidelines.the district court also imposed a sentence of sixty months imprisonment to run consecutively for possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,which is the statutory mandatory minimum.the total sentence was for months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment of.lockett now appeals his conviction and sentence.
this is an appeal from a final judgment of the district court.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying factual findings and exercise plenary review over the district court application of the law to those facts.united states perez,cir.a district court determination of consent to search is a finding of fact.schneckloth bustamonte,d.
lockett asserts that he was unlawfully seized when he submitted to authority by relinquishing control of his suitcase.we do not agree.
it is well established that no seizure has occurred when an officer approaches an individual in a public place,identifies himself as a law enforcement agent,asks questions,asks to search a person bags,or explains that he is conducting a narcotics investigation.see florida royer,d united states thame,cir.even when law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual,they may pose questions,ask for identification,and request consent to search luggage,provided they do not induce cooperation by coercive means.see florida bostick,d.if a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter,then he or she has not been seized.id.
under similar circumstances,we have held that questioning of a traveler by police officers,followed by a request to search the traveler bags did not amount to a seizure of that traveler under the fourth amendment.see thame,at.we reasoned that the officers had not restrained thame,blocked his path,or otherwise controlled his movement by retaining his papers.id.nor had the police,in any way,suggested to thame that he was positively identified as a suspect.id.thus,despite the fact that other law enforcement officers may have been in thame view,we concluded that no seizure had occurred.id.
as in thame,the encounter here took place in an open public area.the officers did not control or block lockett movement.they did not retain lockett papers or identification.and they did not tell lockett that he was a suspect.we hold that the officers did not induce lockett cooperation by coercion.in light of all the circumstances,a reasonable person would have felt free to terminate the encounter,and therefore lockett was not seized.
under the fourth and fourteenth amendments,a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.schneckloth,at.it is equally well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is
