on august,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned a superseding indictment charging melvin richardson with four counts.the first three counts charge richardson with possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base counts one and three or cocaine count two in violation of a.count four charges richardson with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.counts one and two arose out of a september,traffic stop.counts three and four arose out of an october,deal in which richardson provided the drugs in exchange for the firearms.on march,a jury convicted richardson on all four counts.the district court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment on each count,all terms to be served concurrently.
richardson now appeals his conviction and sentence.he argues that the district court erred in refusing to sever counts one and two from counts three and four and in admitting extrinsic evidence of an alleged prior inconsistent statement.in a pro se brief,richardson raises three additional arguments that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the drugs seized during the september inventory search of his vehicle that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender and as an armed career criminal and that the district court erroneously failed to determine whether sentencing entrapment or sentencing factor manipulation had occurred.after carefully reviewing the record,we affirm richardson conviction and sentence.
background 
we summarize here the relevant facts evidenced in the record,saving additional details for our analysis.throughout this opinion,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states fenton,cir.
september,arrest 
on september,state police trooper sean maher observed a gray nissan automobile rapidly accelerate while changing from the right to the left travel lane of northbound route in northampton,massachusetts.he followed the car for over half a mile and clocked its speed at between eighty and miles per hour.
maher pulled the vehicle over and asked richardson,the vehicle sole occupant,to produce his license and registration.richardson could not produce a valid license because it had been revoked in april.without a valid license,richardson could not legally operate his vehicle,and his vehicle could not remain on the highway.maher,therefore,radioed for a tow truck to remove the vehicle.he also radioed for assistance.
state police trooper david nims arrived to assist.after informing richardson that his license had been revoked,which richardson acknowledged,the troopers ordered him to exit the vehicle.richardson complied and waited on the highway guardrail.
nims then began an inventory search of the vehicle.upon entering the vehicle,nims told maher that it smelled of burnt marijuana.richardson informed the troopers that he had smoked marijuana in the vehicle earlier that day and on other occasions.the troopers found several marijuana roaches in the ashtray.nims discovered a plastic bag containing what appeared to be cocaine powder in smaller plastic baggies under the driver side rear floor mat.maher then lifted the passenger side rear floor mat and located another plastic bag.that bag held several baggies containing what appeared to be cocaine base.nims also found under the driver side front floor mat a glass receptacle containing marijuana.the troopers found no other drug paraphernalia in the vehicle.based on their training and experience,the troopers determined that the apparent cocaine and cocaine base were packaged for distribution.
the troopers placed richardson under arrest and transported him to the police barracks.at the barracks,richardson waived his miranda rights.he volunteered that the substances were cocaine and cocaine base but denied that he was a drug dealer.he told the troopers that he was transporting the drugs to the northampton where he was supposed to meet a person from vermont who would give him money for the drugs.richardson also stated that he transported drugs in this manner every other day.
crime lab testing confirmed that one bag contained grams of cocaine powder in nine plastic bags and that the other bag contained grams of cocaine base in plastic bags.expert witness john baron,a drug enforcement administration dea special agent,testified that,based on the quantity and packaging of the drugs,both the cocaine and cocaine base removed from richardson vehicle were consistent with retail distribution rather than personal use.
richardson was charged with drug offenses in massachusetts state court and released on bail.
october,arrest 
in september,rashiid mapp,a cooperating witness and paid confidential informant for the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms,and explosives atf,told atf special agent james martin that he knew richardson.mapp described richardson as a cocaine base dealer who frequently used a residence on oak grove avenue in springfield,massachusetts to conduct his business.mapp also told martin that richardson,in furtherance of his drug dealing,carried an older firearm that he wanted to replace.based on mapp information,martin began investigating richardson.martin learned that richardson was a convicted felon and,consequently,was prohibited from carrying a firearm.on october,martin surveilled richardson and saw him enter the oak grove avenue residence.
martin arranged for mapp to present richardson with the opportunity to exchange cocaine for two firearms supplied by a fictitious person from vermont.on october,mapp telephoned martin mapp was with richardson at the time he placed the call.during the conversation,the three men arranged a deal between martin and richardson.through mapp,richardson stated he was looking for two handguns in exchange for an ounce of cocaine base.the tape recording of the october phone call reflects that richardson said nines,get a couple of nines he can get me the baby nine and a regular nine i ready right now and tell him,listen,tell him to bring two nines.i gon na take both of them.richardson then agreed with martin to trade one ounce of cocaine base for two handguns.
martin arranged a meeting between mapp,richardson,and special agent malcolm van alstyne of the atf.van alstyne would play the role of the vermont firearms supplier.the meeting,originally scheduled for october,eventually took place on october.during the meeting,richardson gave van alstyne the cocaine base.van alstyne passed the two firearms to richardson and then handed him a shirt in which to wrap them.van alstyne then exited the vehicle,ostensibly to put the cocaine base in the trunk and to get bullets for richardson.richardson and mapp also exited the vehicle.at that point,van alstyne gave the arrest signal,and agents arrested richardson as he stood outside the vehicle holding the firearms.agents also staged a mock arrest of mapp in order to conceal his identity as a confidential informant.crime lab testing later revealed that the narcotics richardson gave to van alstyne contained grams of cocaine base.
after the arrest,martin and dea agent john barron interviewed richardson,who waived his miranda rights and agreed to speak with the agents.richardson told the agents that the firearms were for mapp,not for him he admitted that the cocaine base belonged to him.richardson expressed a desire to cooperate with the government but stated that he could not reveal his drug supplier at that time.when asked again about the firearms,richardson stated,t hose guns were for atf.they were for me.agents expressed disbelief in his statements and confronted him with the telephone recordings in which he talked about wanting the firearms.
at that point,richardson became upset and evasive.the agents,therefore,decided to wait until a later time to do the interview and terminated the interrogation.the next day,martin and dea task force detective norman shink of the springfield police department advised richardson of his miranda rights and resumed the interview.in an effort to cooperate with law enforcement,richardson named four or five people involved in the drug trade in the area.
prior to trial,richardson moved to suppress the drug evidence seized during the september traffic stop and to sever counts one and two from counts three and four for trial purposes.richardson contended that the september search of his vehicle violated his fourth amendment rights.regarding severance,he argued that joinder was improper and prejudicial.he stated that a joint trial would force him to cede his fifth amendment right against with respect to counts one and two in order to exercise his sixth amendment right to testify as to counts three and four.richardson offered an affidavit summarizing the testimony he had to give regarding his entrapment defense to counts three and four.following a hearing,the district court denied the motion to sever,concluding that everything is going to come in at the trial in any event and severance of these charges would really accomplish anything.the district court also denied the motion to suppress,holding that the search troopers nims and maher performed comported with the massachusetts state police inventory search policy and the fourth amendment.
trial on all four counts commenced on march.during the trial,the district court admitted two certified prior convictions into evidence as part of the government case.the district court admitted these convictions to satisfy the predicate offense requirement for count felon in possession of a firearm charge.dea agent barron testified that one conviction was for assault and battery,which carries a potential penalty of more than one year of imprisonment in massachusetts.the other conviction was for assault with a dangerous weapon a knife,which also carries a potential penalty of more than one year of imprisonment in massachusetts 
richardson presented his case through the government witnesses,presenting his own testimony,and producing his medical records.while on the stand,richardson explained the factual details of his entrapment defense.he testified regarding his history of substance abuse,his relationship with mapp,the specifics of the deal,and how mapp allegedly trapped him into participating in the deal.he testified that he just went along with mapp plan and that he had no need for the firearms.he explained that he had only pretended to be a big willie,a drug dealer,and insisted that the firearms were actually for mapp.
the government permissibly sought to impeach richardson credibility by revealing three of his prior convictions.the district court admitted the following three convictions for impeachment purposes a conviction for larceny from a building a conviction for possessing a dangerous weapon a knife and a conviction for giving a false name.the judge immediately provided a limiting instruction indicating that the jury should only consider these prior convictions for purposes of assessing richardson credibility.
the government also sought to impeach richardson testimony that he did not want the two firearms for himself.the prosecutor offered a tape recording and written transcript of an october,telephone conversation.richardson counsel objected because the judge had previously excluded this evidence the judge eventually admitted the tape and transcript for impeachment purposes.the judge admitted the evidence because the jury could interpret the vast majority of the conversation as inconsistent with richardson testimony admission of only part of the tape would confuse the jury and parts of the tape included potentially exculpatory information.immediately,the judge instructed the jury regarding the limited purpose for which it could consider the telephone call.
after the close of evidence,the judge instructed the jury.he once again explained to the jurors the limited purposes for which they could consider richardson predicate felonies,his other prior convictions,and the recording and transcript of the october telephone conversation.he repeatedly reminded the jury to consider each count separately.his presentation also included an instruction on the entrapment defense applicable to counts three and four.the jury rejected richardson entrapment defense and returned a guilty verdict on each of the four counts.
ii.analysis 
we shall address richardson arguments seriatim.
richardson contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to sever counts one and two the september offenses from counts three and four the october drug and offenses.richardson asserts that the joint trial of the september counts with the october counts caused him substantial prejudice with regard to the earlier counts.he argues that joinder of the offenses prejudiced him because he was forced to testify to his detriment regarding the september charges.he also asserts that the joinder prejudiced him because the court admitted prior crime evidence that was admissible for some counts but inadmissible for others.he seeks a new trial on counts one and two only he does not argue that the joinder prejudiced him with respect to counts three and four.the government responds that richardson suffered no prejudice because substantially the same evidence would have been admitted in both trials and severance would have contravened the interest in judicial economy and the conservation of prosecutorial resources.
richardson does not contest the propriety of the initial joinder of all the offenses.see.a permitting joinder of offenses of same or similar character.rather,he argues that rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which permits relief from prejudicial joinder,entitled him to severance of the joined counts.see.a.on appeal,we consider whether the denial of severance unduly prejudiced him.
the question of whether joinder of offenses unduly prejudices a defendant is addressed to the district court sound discretion.united states casas,cir,cert.denied,d united states alosa,cir see also united states fenton,cir severance on the ground of undue prejudice is a judgment call and,thus,is a matter committed to the trier informed discretion.we reverse a refusal to sever only upon a showing of manifest abuse of discretion.united states burgos,cir alosa,at.rarely has this court found an abuse of discretion sufficient to warrant reversal.see united states diallo,cir united states scivola,cir.but see united states jordan,cir granting severance where joinder likely eviscerated defendant planned defense.
rule provides if the joinder of offenses for trial appears to prejudice a defendant,the court may order separate trials of counts.a emphasis added.we must affirm the district court denial of a motion to sever unless the defendant makes a strong,see united states edgar,cir,and convincing,united states vega molina,cir,showing of prejudice.some prejudice results in almost every trial in which the court tries more than one offense together.burgos,at.garden variety prejudice,however,will not,in and of itself,warrant severance.id.at.the defendant must demonstrate that the prejudicial joinder likely deprived him of a fair trial.see also united states baltas,cir noting reversal only appropriate where defendant makes strong showing of evident prejudice.
three types of prejudice may result from trying a defendant for several offenses during the same trial 
the defendant may become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses proof that defendant is guilty of one offense may be used to convict him of a second offense,even though such proof would be inadmissable in a second trial for the second offense and a defendant may wish to testify in his own behalf on one of the offenses but not another,forcing him to choose the unwanted alternative of testifying as to both or testifying as to neither.
with regards to the third type of prejudice,this court has held that a defendant may deserve a severance of counts where he makes a convincing showing that he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and strong need to refrain from testifying on the other.alosa,at emphasis added quoting scivola,at.the defendant must offer sufficient information so that the court can weigh the considerations of judicial economy against the defendant freedom to choose whether to testify as to a particular charge.id.quoting scivola,at.
in this case,we conclude that richardson has failed to make the strong showing of prejudice required to justify severance.before the district court,richardson attempted to frame his severance argument in terms of the third type of prejudice.he highlighted the important testimony he had to give regarding his entrapment defense,which applied only to counts three and four.he explained that he could not present his entrapment defense without testifying regarding the details of the trap.richardson did not,however,adequately explain his strong need to refrain from testifying on counts one and two.before the district court,he did not articulate how his testimony might aid the government in obtaining a conviction on those charges.moreover,even with the benefit of hindsight,he does not argue on appeal that any of the testimony actually elicited from him at trial aided the government in obtaining convictions on counts one and two.
instead,richardson argument before the district court,and renewed on appeal,was that he would be severely prejudiced by the admission of incriminating evidence that would not have otherwise been admissible in a severed trial at which he did not testify as to counts one and two.specifically,he argued that the evidence of the october events,which form the basis for counts three and four,would not have been admitted in such a severed trial on counts one and two.this argument is based on a theory of evidentiary spillover,the second type of prejudice outlined in jordan.when such spillover serves as the ground for a defendant severance motion,this court has repeatedly refused to overrule a denial of severance if substantially the same evidence would have been admitted in separate trials.see burgos,at united states stackpole,cir united states,cir accord united states freeman,cir.
here,the district court correctly concluded that,irrespective of whether richardson testified,the conduct underlying the october deal would have been admissible to demonstrate,at a minimum,richardson knowledge of and intent to distribute drugs on september.see.b allowing admission of other bad acts evidence to prove motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.counts one and two charged richardson with possessing cocaine base and cocaine,respectively,with the intent to distribute on september.he defended counts one and two by claiming that he lacked the requisite intent to distribute he testified that he was merely driving somewhere with the drugs to get high with friends.evidence that,fewer than five weeks after his september arrest,richardson provided the cocaine base for and received the weapons in the deal rebuts his lack of intent defense.see united states,cir holding testimony regarding prior activities probative of knowledge and intent united states nickens,cir deeming evidence of prior drug convictions admissible to show knowledge and intent see also united states acosta,cir noting drug dealing often associated with access to weapons united states white,cir recognizing correlation between drug dealing and weapons united states hopkins,cir accepting expert testimony describing possession of small caliber weapon as indicia of drug dealing united states ward,cir noting admission of handguns into evidence in drug cases consistently upheld as relevant to issues raised by such cases.to defend himself against count one,richardson denied that the baggies found under his rear floor mat on september contained cocaine base.he testified that he believed the substance to be rock cocaine.the fact that richardson knowingly provided cocaine base for the october transaction is probative of his knowledge that the baggies seized on september contained cocaine base see,at nickens,at.
rule b would also have permitted admission of the conduct underlying the september drug counts in a separate trial on counts three and four to prove richardson knowledge of and intent to distribute drugs and to rebut his entrapment defense.see.b see also united states smith,cir deeming evidence of drug dealing relevant to show motive or knowing possession of a firearm acosta,at recognizing probative value of prior offenses to prove predisposition to possess firearm.
additionally,we note that the district judge limited any prejudice that might result from admission of other crime evidence by instructing the jury to consider the evidence separately as to each count.see united states baltas,cir noting appropriate limiting instruction provides adequate safeguard against evidentiary spillover prejudice.
on appeal,richardson raises an additional prejudice argument,which he failed to articulate before the district court.he avers that he suffered prejudice because the jury heard evidence regarding his prior criminal convictions.richardson specifically argues that this evidence,used to prove the felon element of count four and to impeach his credibility,would have been inadmissible against him in a separate trial on counts one and two in which he chose not to testify 
because richardson failed to articulate this argument before the district court,he has not properly preserved it.see scivola,at holding that defendant has burden of presenting district court with enough information to demonstrate prejudice de castro,cir a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold its peace.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,we review only for plain error the district court failure to order severance on this ground sua sponte.see.b see also united states thomann,cir.we find no such error for two reasons.
first,the district court took appropriate measures to limit any prejudice by giving thorough and accurate limiting instructions.see burgos,at noting flexibility rule grants district court to minimize prejudice see also baltas,at acknowledging jury instructions as appropriate method of minimizing prejudice.during the presentation of evidence and during the closing charge,the judge repeatedly instructed the jury regarding the limited purposes for which it could consider all the prior convictions.
second,the government presented an exceedingly strong case with respect to counts one and two.we doubt that the admission of the prior conviction evidence influenced the verdicts on those counts.see united states adams,cir affirming conviction notwithstanding evidentiary error where government presented overpowering and untainted evidence of guilt united states collins,cir deeming error where court gave appropriate limiting instructions and government presented overwhelming evidence of guilt.
richardson has not made the strong showing of unfair prejudice required to warrant severance.having thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and the applicable case law,we are satisfied that the district court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying richardson motion for severance.
prior inconsistent statement 
richardson contends that the district court erroneously admitted for impeachment purposes a suppressed tape recording and transcript of a telephone conversation between richardson and mapp.the court erred in admitting the telephone conversation,he argues,because the government failed to make a sufficient showing that richardson trial testimony actually conflicted with statements he made during the telephone conversation.the government responds that richardson testimony directly conflicted with his phone statements and that even if error occurred,it was harmless.
in an october,telephone conversation with mapp,richardson stated,i want it and i take it,in reference to a firearm.during trial,richardson repeatedly testified that he took possession of the firearms temporarily as a middleman before handing them over to mapp.he denied taking possession of the firearms for his personal use.the government sought to richardson about the inconsistencies between his trial testimony and his statements during the october telephone conversation.the district court agreed that richardson telephone statements and trial testimony were inconsistent and permitted the government to impeach him with his prior statement
