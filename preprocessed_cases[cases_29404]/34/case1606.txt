kevin tyrelle summers appeals his drug trafficking and firearm convictions,entered in the district of maryland in accordance with the jury verdict.summers contends that the district court erroneously admitted into evidence a jacket recovered from the vicinity of his arrest.he asserts further that the court compounded its error by declining to exclude,on confrontation clause grounds,expert evidence concerning dna testing performed on the jacket,together with evidence documenting the jacket handling and custody during the testing process.discerning no reversible error,we affirm.
during the evening of november,summers,wearing a black north jacket,stood with another man near the corner of glacier avenue and fable street in capitol heights,maryland.corporal patrick hampson,a uniformed detective with the prince george county police department,emerged from his cruiser to ask the pair about an exchange of gunfire that had occurred shortly before at the intersection.both men fled,with summers sprinting down glacier avenue past undercover detectives chad schmick and kevin morris,who were parked at the curb.summers detoured through a couple of backyards on kayak avenue before surrendering to morris.by then,however,summers was no longer wearing the jacket.
hampson and schmick found a black north face jacket atop one of the houses along summers flight path.hampson placed the jacket and its contents a hi point model c handgun,eleven rounds of ammunition unloaded from the pistol clip,and a large packet containing more than ninety grams of crack cocaine inside separate evidence bags for transport in his cruiser.hampson filled out property receipts on the items to catalog them and to direct forensic examination.
on march,summers was indicted for possession with intent to distribute crack,in violation of a count one,and possession of a firearm by a felon,contravening g count two.a superseding indictment of may,charged summers with the additional offense of possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,conduct proscribed by c count three.
following the federal indictment,the county police sent a black jacket to the fbi baltimore field office.the jacket was then forwarded to the agency laboratory in quantico,virginia,arriving at the evidence control unit the ecu on may.the ecu routed the jacket to dna analysis unit,where,according to an internal log,it was delivered to storage on may.the log shows that fbi analysts took possession of the jacket on may,to perform dna testing,then shuttled it back to storage on may,for eventual return to the ecu on october.
at trial,a black jacket was marked for identification as government exhibit.asked whether he recognized the exhibit,hampson answered that i t looks like the black northface coat the defendant was wearing.schmick and morris were rather less equivocal.schmick confirmed that exhibit was the coat that we recovered,id.at,and,when questioned whether the jacket in the courtroom was the one that summers wore while fleeing,morris responded simply,yes,it was,id.at.
the government otherwise featured the expert testimony of brendan shea,a forensic examiner at the quantico laboratory who supervises unit analysts and directs them to perform particular tests on evidence.after identifying government exhibit as the coat submitted to the lab,shea explained that he had directed his subordinate analysts to conduct two methods of polymerase chain reaction based,short tandem repeat typing on the jacket.the lab also performed dna typing on buccal swabs taken from summers mouth.shea compared the typing data,testifying that although dna from at least four different people was found on the jacket,summers was the major contributor.
shea documented the typing results and his conclusions in a report.the report contained a table juxtaposing the numerical identifiers of the allele found at corresponding loci of the dna extracted from the jacket and the buccal swabs,revealing an exact match.shea stated to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that summers was the major dna contributor,statistically calculating the probability of a random match as equal to or less than one in billion.see.shea signed the report,and no other lab employee was named therein or testified at trial.the report was admitted into evidence as government exhibit.
the government presented no evidence of the jacket whereabouts from the time corporal hampson placed it in his cruiser until it arrived at the fbi laboratory.while the jacket was at the lab,the internal log documented its movement within unit.the log reflects that four lab employees signed for and took custody of the jacket at different times.based on the varying legibility of their signatures,some of the employees identities are more susceptible than others of being ascertained.it is clear,however,that none of them were shea,though he did initial the log at its bottom right corner.see.the log was admitted into evidence as part of defendant exhibit.
on,shea acknowledged that he could not confirm that the jacket he tested was the one that hampson recovered.though verifying the authenticity of the log,shea could only speak in generalities concerning the jacket safekeeping during the time that it was housed at the lab,testifying that the jacket would have been subjected to the standard routing and inventory process.arguing to the jury at closing,defense counsel emphasized shea concession brendan shea told you,six or seven months,i do know what happened to that jacket.i ca tell you that that jacket is the same jacket that was allegedly pulled off of kevin summers.
counsel argument ultimately failed to persuade the jury,which found summers guilty of the drug and firearm possession charges underlying count one and count two.the jury acquitted summers on count three,concluding that he did not,beyond a reasonable doubt,possess the firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.the district court entered judgment on the jury verdict,sentencing summers to months in prison,followed by five years of supervised release.summers timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review for abuse of discretion a trial court decision concerning the admissibility of evidence.see united states myers,cir.we will not adjudge the court to have abused its discretion unless its ruling was arbitrary and irrational.see united states haney,cir.we review de novo,however,an evidentiary ruling implicating the confrontation clause.see united states williams,cir.finally,we review for abuse of discretion a trial court determination that an evidentiary item chain of custody has been sufficiently established.see united states ricco,cir.
the sixth amendment affords a criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.summers maintains that he was convicted by the testimony of witnesses whom he was not permitted to,in derogation of the confrontation clause.according to summers,the government was constitutionally compelled to produce at trial the laboratory employees who signed the internal log,along with the subordinate analysts who actually conducted the dna typing upon which shea expert conclusions were premised.
in crawford washington,d,the supreme court unanimously ruled that the defendant confrontation clause rights had been violated by the admission into evidence of his nontestifying wife statement to the police.the opinion of the court,authored by justice scalia,overruled ohio roberts,d,which had permitted statements of unavailable witnesses to be admitted at trial insofar as they bore adequate indicia of reliability,meaning that they satisfied a firmly rooted hearsay exception or were otherwise bolstered by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.roberts,at.
crawford changed the law to condition the admission of such statements on the witness being unavailable at trial,and the defendant having had the prior opportunity to the witness.crawford applies whenever testimonial evidence is at issue.at.inasmuch as it was the result of formal police interrogation,the evidence at issue in crawford plainly met the court criterion,although it elected to leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial.id.the court did distinguish nontestimonial hearsay,however,noting that an approach that exempted such statements from confrontation clause scrutiny altogether would be consistent with the framers intent.united states cabrera beltran,cir holding that border crossing records not created for trial are nontestimonial and admissible under public records exception to hearsay rule.
the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements came to the forefront in davis washington,d,in which the trial court had admitted a recording of a call from a woman to prove,in the absence of the woman testimony,that the defendant,her former boyfriend,had assaulted her.the supreme court unanimously ruled that the woman statement was nontestimonial.the court again spoke through justice scalia 
statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.they are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency,and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution this is not to imply,however,that statements made in the absence of any interrogation are necessarily nontestimonial and of course even when interrogation exists,it is in the final analysis the declarant statements,not the interrogator questions,that the confrontation clause requires us to evaluate.
davis,at.the court assumed,for the sake of argument,that the questions posed by the operator eliciting the incriminating responses were the acts of the police,constituting interrogation.see id.at.notably,justice thomas concurred only partially in the judgment,concluding that the responses were admissible because they were not part of a formalized dialogue resembling testimony.see id.at.thomas,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
about a year after the supreme court decision in davis washington,we had occasion to apply its teachings in united states washington,cir.in the latter proceeding,an appeal from federal criminal driving convictions,the district court admitted the expert testimony of a lab director with respect to his report which was not part of the evidentiary record of gas chromatograph tests performed on the defendant blood,though the technicians who operated the diagnostic machines did not appear at trial.we affirmed the convictions,concluding that the test data revealing the presence of alcohol and pcp in the defendant blood were not the technicians statements,but instead were the statements of the machines themselves.washington,at emphasis deleted.judge niemeyer,writing for the panel majority,explained that such raw data,being independent of human observation or reporting,was not susceptible to and thus did not implicate the confrontation clause.id.
next,in melendez diaz massachusetts,d,the supreme court considered whether sworn certificates from forensic analysts,admitted to attest that the substance seized from the defendant was cocaine,were testimonial for confrontation clause purposes.the court,by a vote,held in the affirmative and vacated the defendant conviction,with justice scalia observing for the majority that the certificates were functionally identical to live,testimony,doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.melendez diaz.at quoting davis,at.the court pointed out that the sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide prima facie evidence of the composition,quality,and the net weight of the analyzed substance,and that it could be safely assumed that the analysts were aware of the affidavits evidentiary purpose.id.internal quotation marks omitted.because the analysts could have been available to testify or,at least,there was no showing to the contrary and because there had been no opportunity for them to be,crawford demanded that the defendant conviction be overturned justice thomas,providing the determinative fifth vote,wrote a concurring opinion noting his adherence to the position that extrajudicial statements implicate the confrontation clause only insofar as they are contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.id.at thomas,concurring.
not long thereafter,we decided united states johnson,cir.in that case,the trial court admitted the expert testimony of police officers to decipher code words used in telephone conversations between drug traffickers.the experts testimony was based upon their experience in general,together with particular knowledge gleaned from the investigation.judge wilkinson authored our opinion,pointing out that crawford in no way prevents expert witnesses from offering their independent judgments merely because those judgments were in some part informed by their exposure to otherwise inadmissible evidence.johnson,at.on the other hand,crawford would apply to bar testimony where the witness is used as little more than a conduit or transmitter for testimonial hearsay,rather than as a true expert whose considered opinion sheds light on some specialized factual situation.id.thus,an expert use of testimonial hearsay is a matter of degree.id.judge wilkinson opinion distinguished melendez diaz,observing that,in johnson,the government experts appeared at trial and were.see id.at.
most recently,the supreme court issued its opinion in bullcoming new mexico,d.bullcoming was another case,and this time justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court,which attracted the concurrence of justice thomas in everything but part iv and footnote reiterating justice scalia primary purpose test in davis for evaluating whether a statement is testimonial.bullcoming involved a trial in which the state introduced a lab report certifying the results of a test performed on a sample taken from the defendant.the signatory analyst did not testify,having very recently been put on unpaid leave.at alteration in original,but another analyst familiar with the lab procedures did.the testifying analyst had not participated in or observed the defendant blood test,however.
the supreme court vacated the defendant conviction as a rule,if an statement is testimonial in nature,it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.bullcoming.at.the court stressed that the first analyst certification reported more than a number,in that it also verified that the lab had received the blood sample intact,that the sample was in fact the defendant,that the analyst performed a particular test in accordance with a specific protocol,and that the process had not been compromised.id.at.although the report was in this case unsworn,it was yet testimonial because it was created solely for an evidentiary purpose,id.at quoting melendez diaz.at,and was formalized in a signed document,id.quoting davis,at.thomas,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
writing separately,justice sotomayor pointed out that bullcoming is not a case in which the person testifying is a supervisor,reviewer,or someone else with a personal,albeit limited connection to the scientific test at issue.at sotomayor,concurring in part.according to justice sotomayor,i t would be a different case if,for example,a supervisor who observed an analyst conducting a test testified about the results or a report about such results.id.in addition,bullcoming is not a case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.id.citing.finally,justice sotomayor noted that bullcoming perhaps in contrast to the situation we confronted in united states washington,supra is not a case in which the state introduced only results,such as a printout from a gas chromatograph,and that the court did not decide whether a state could intr
