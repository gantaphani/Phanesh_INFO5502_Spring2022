larry whitfield appeals his convictions and aggregate sentence in the western district of north carolina for his role in a botched bank robbery and a home intrusion,which ended tragically in the death of an innocent elderly woman.whitfield asserts four appellate contentions,only one of which has merit that the district court erred in instructing the jury on an offense not charged in the indictment.as explained below,we are constrained to vacate whitfield conviction and mandatory life sentence on the uncharged offense and remand for an amendment of the judgment and resentencing,while affirming the balance of his convictions.
on the morning of september,whitfield and his quanterrious mccoy armed with a handgun and an ak assault rifle entered the front door of the fort financial credit union in gastonia,north carolina as they crossed the threshold into the credit union small vestibule,a metal detector triggered an automatic locking mechanism on the inside lobby doors.whitfield shook the bulletproof doors,but the lock held fast,preventing entry into the lobby of the credit union.as a result,whitfield and mccoy fled in their car in an eastwardly direction towards charlotte on interstate.alerted to the attempted bank robbery,a gastonia police officer began pursuing a white ford crown victoria with two occupants matching the culprits descriptions.because it was raining and the gastonia officer was fearful of an accident,he withdrew from the pursuit.the officer was about to exit the interstate when he noticed that the crown victoria had left the highway and was stuck in the median.whitfield and mccoy had fled the vehicle on foot into the woods,ditched their firearms,made their way to nearby belmont,north carolina,and separated from one another.
mccoy was apprehended after being found hiding under a van.whitfield opted to forcibly enter the residence of a woman named tina walden,who soon thereafter returned from work.when walden sought to unlock her door and enter her home,she realized the lock was jammed and noticed a footprint on the door.while walden was attempting to call her husband by cell phone,whitfield opened the door from inside the residence,brandished a kitchen knife,and instructed walden to shut up and come in.instead,walden turned and ran.whitfield then fled from walden home,discarding the knife along his escape route to the nearby home of herman and mary parnell.he entered the parnell residence through the unlocked front door and encountered parnell,who was home alone.parnell immediately became very upset and began to cry.meanwhile,whitfield used his cell phone to text message a friend,tamecia sanders,notifying her that he was in trouble and asking for a ride.sanders spoke on the phone with whitfield several times during the approximate drive from her location on the east side of charlotte to the parnell residence.during their final conversation,sanders informed whitfield that she needed directions in order to find him.at that time,sanders overheard whitfield tell parnell,m a am,just calm down.i probably more scared than you are,and i actually just trying to leave.see id.at.sanders also spoke on the phone directly with parnell.according to sanders,parnell sounded afraid,though she calmed herself enough to give sanders directions.
when whitfield got back on the phone with sanders,he said that it looked like parnell was breathing.sanders also overheard parnell say that she was short of breath,to which whitfield inquired whether she had any aspirin or anything that she usually takes and if he could get her a glass of water.id.at.sanders suggested that whitfield step outside in the hallway,give parnell a minute,and call an ambulance.id.at.whitfield did not call the ambulance,but remained on the phone with sanders,remarking to her sporadically that parnell appeared to be unconscious and may have died.between and,a neighbor of the parnells,joshua smith,an police officer with the nearby town of cramerton,called the parnells to warn that one of the bank robbers had been seen in the area.after repeatedly receiving a busy signal or no answer,smith walked to the parnell house,knocked,and rang the door bell.when no one answered,he returned home.smith efforts nonetheless prompted whitfield to end his phone call with sanders and flee the parnell home through its back door.whitfield was soon discovered hiding nearby,and he was arrested.
when herman parnell returned home through the back door that whitfield had left ajar,he found his wife motionless,sitting in a chair at his desk in the computer room.although parnell sought to resuscitate parnell and called for assistance,she was never revived and was pronounced dead,having suffered a heart attack.during whitfield questioning by the police on the evening of september and the early morning of september,he signed two statements confessing to the belmont home and another statement confessing to the attempted robbery of the credit union.
on january,the grand jury in charlotte returned a indictment against whitfield and mccoy,charging them with attempted bank robbery,in contravention of a and count one conspiracy to carry a firearm during an attempted bank robbery,in violation of o count two and carrying a firearm during an attempted bank robbery,in contravention of c and count three.count four,naming whitfield only,charged him with violating e,which provides,in relevant part,that 
w hoever,in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the commission of any offense defined in this section,kills any person,or forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person,shall be imprisoned not less than ten years,or if death results shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.
as discussed further infra,e encompasses three alternative offenses pertinent to this case penalizing a defendant who,in evading apprehension for an attempted bank robbery kills any person the killing offense or forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person the forced accompaniment offense or forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person and death results the death results offense count four of the indictment,however,alleged only two of the three alternative offenses,charging 
larry whitfield did knowingly enter and attempt to enter fort financial credit union with intent to commit therein a felony affecting that credit union,in violation of a,as set forth in count one of this indictment and in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for said offense,forced to accompany him without her consent,and killed 
thus,the allegations of count four were limited to the first and second alternative e offenses the killing offense and the forced accompaniment offense and failed to include the third,the death results offense.
on september,whitfield moved to dismiss count four of the indictment,asserting that e was unconstitutionally vague and that the killing offense could only be properly charged if the prosecution were required to prove that whitfield intentionally caused the death of parnell.the government opposed the dismissal motion and argued the elementary principle that it had charged killing and forced accompaniment in the conjunctive,but was entitled to prove them in the disjunctive.see.the government also proposed that the word kills in e be understood from its basic dictionary definition,which does not require specific intent,and invoked the statute unindicted if death results provision as reinforcement of such a meaning.see id.at.on october,the district court validated the constitutionality of e and denied whitfield motion to dismiss count four.
on october,about five weeks before trial,whitfield moved to suppress his confessions to the two belmont home and the attempted bank robbery.whitfield confessions to the belmont home had been elicited during what the district court would designate as the first part of the police interview,while the attempted bank robbery confession had been obtained at the conclusion of the second part of the interview.
on november,the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the suppression motion,receiving evidence from gastonia police detective tony wilson and gaston county police detective michael sumner.following argument from counsel,the court orally denied whitfield motion.in so ruling,the court observed that it had reviewed the video recording of the interview and listened carefully to the evidence of the detectives,which it found credible.see.from the evidence,the court perceived that whitfield,though very young,and less experienced,was conversational,comfortable,and intelligent enough to be capable of deciding when to provide information and when not to.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that,based on the totality of circumstances,whitfield will was not overborne,and t hat the statements he made were not in violation of the constitution.id.at.an order denying whitfield motion to suppress was entered the day of the hearing.
whitfield jury trial began a week later,on november,in charlotte.the prosecution presented several witnesses on the first day thereof,including credit union tellers and codefendant mccoy,who testified to his and whitfield involvement in the attempted bank robbery and getaway the witnesses included gaston county police detective william sampson and other investigating officers.during its examination of sampson regarding the first part of whitfield interview,the prosecution introduced whitfield confessions to the two belmont home,as well as a transcript primarily consisting of the first part of the interview.before sampson could testify concerning the second part of the interview,however,the trial court elected to begin the defense of sampson deferring sampson direct testimony about whitfield confession to the attempted bank robbery.the second day of trial concluded after the prosecution examination of tamecia sanders.
when the trial commenced the next morning,the district court explained that sampson trial testimony warranted further analysis of whether whitfield had voluntarily confessed to the attempted bank robbery.the court then delayed the trial proceedings to conduct another suppression hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding the second part of whitfield interview.after hearing further evidence and argument,the court suppressed whitfield confession to the attempted bank robbery because it had been coerced,such that his will was overborne,and his capacity for was critically impaired.
memorializing the ruling made at the second suppression hearing,the district court,nearly a year thereafter,entered an order confirming that the attempted bank robbery confession was inadmissible and so amending its contrary november,order.see united states whitfield,cr,the suppression order the court findings of fact relating to whitfield confessions to the home and the attempted bank robbery are summarized below supplemented to a limited extent by the interview transcript.
after whitfield arrest on september,which occurred at approximately,he was detained at the gastonia police department.gaston county detectives sumner and sampson questioned whitfield initially,beginning at approximately.as whitfield had been outside in the rain,he was cold,wet,and visibly shaking for some of the interview.suppression order.before questioning whitfield,sampson gave miranda warnings,explaining that it was no big deal and would be just like whitfield had seen on id.consistent with established procedure,sampson provided whitfield a copy of the miranda warnings and requested that he initial each of them.sampson directed whitfield to initial the sheet without inquiring whether he understood his rights,except for the right to remain silent.sampson read whitfield a concluding summary of his miranda rights and,instructing whitfield to sign,asked,is that cool,larry see id.at.
at the outset,detectives sampson and sumner led whitfield to believe that their interest in questioning him was limited to the two belmont home.suppression order.the detectives explained that,as members of the gaston county police,their jurisdiction only covered the,and they were not concerned with what happened in another jurisdiction,the attempted bank robbery in gastonia.id.at.or,as one of the detectives put it,they were interested in the lesser of the evils.id.in reality,however,the detectives aimed to acquire enough information to charge whitfield with attempted bank robbery,kidnapping of parnell,and,because she had subsequently died of a heart attack,first degree.id.at.after the detectives questioned whitfield aggressively,he confessed to the two,explaining that he had entered the parnell home from its back door,but had not interacted with parnell because she was asleep in the computer room.see id.at.at approximately,whitfield signed a written statement to that effect.both detectives expressed their appreciation for whitfield forthrightness,and they took a brief break.see id.
when detectives sampson and sumner returned,they continued questioning whitfield about the at the parnell home.the detectives were at times joined by gaston county police sergeant chris reynolds.at one point,sergeant reynolds encouraged whitfield,advising him that you doing nothing but helping yourself by volunteering information,and falsely stating that parnell had id whitfield.see.eventually,whitfield admitted that he had entered the parnell home through its front door rather than the back door and that parnell was awake when he encountered her inside the home.whitfield emphasized that he told parnell that he had no weapons and was not t here to hurt her,but just need ed somewhere to stay.id.at.
with respect to why parnell was later found in the computer room,whitfield initially admitted that he had guide d her to the office but then appeared to retract that statement,explaining 
l ike i did,no.i did i just know,she,she was in front of me and she went into the computer room.i do remember to,i really do remember touching her.like come on i was cooperative with her and she was cooperative with me.i did put my hands on her.
whitfield stated that he asked her where they could go where the police would see,and that he and parnell just took the first room,the computer room i was like right here.id.at.when parnell later emerged from the computer room insisting that whitfield leave,he asked her to go into the computer room,and also asked where could they go in the house where the police could see,at which point parnell sat down in the chair in the computer room.id.at.
at,whitfield signed a second written statement,correcting his first statement by admitting that he had entered the parnell home through the front door and had interacted with parnell.in its suppression order,the district court confirmed its previous ruling of november,that the inculpatory statements made by whitfield regarding the two belmont home were knowingly and voluntarily made.suppression order.
after whitfield signed his statements confessing to the belmont home,the tone of the interrogation suddenly changed.suppression order.during the first part of their interview of whitfield,neither detective sumner nor detective sampson asked whitfield about his reasons for fleeing from the police.following whitfield initial cooperation,however,sampson and sumner began to focus on the bank robbery,telling him they wanted to g et everything together,stack it up and get it all over with.id.as the district court found,sumner and sampson questioning became leading,mounting an assault on whitfield repeated denials of his involvement in the attempted bank robbery with an arsenal of both real and fabricated evidence.id.despite the detectives warnings to whitfield that his case would be hopeless if it were ever brought before a jury and that his charges could be mitigated if he would only cooperate instead of holding out and acting like a thug,whitfield continued to deny any involvement in the attempted bank robbery.id.at.
at approximately,detectives sumner and sampson notified whitfield that he would be transported to a gaston county detention facility and then formally charged.gastonia detectives wilson and mcswain,however,then questioned whitfield for another hour or so.according to the court,wilson and mcswain followed sumner and sampson tack,intend ing to convince whitfield that his only chance to salvage his otherwise bright future was to confess to the attempted bank robbery.suppression order.whitfield,however,refused to admit he had been involved in that offense,finally prompting wilson to urge whitfield to be righteous tell me what happened today and we both walk out of here.id.at.whitfield attempted to end the interrogation by saying i ca say no more.but i gon na plead,just plead my case that i got against me.id.detective wilson persisted,however,until he realized that whitfield was unlikely to confess.whitfield was then transported to the gaston county jail.
after arriving at the jail at approximately on september,detective sampson read whitfield the arrest warrant that had been issued against him,which charged kidnapping,breaking and entering,and first degree murder.realizing he was being charged with murder,whitfield looked at sampson and sumner and asked,what can i do to help myself suppression order.at that point,sampson believes that he clarified whitfield intent to reinitiate the interrogation by asking if whitfield was sure that he wanted to talk.id.sampson and sumner again mirandized whitfield,who wrote yes beside each statement of his rights.thereafter,whitfield signed his confession to the attempted bank robbery.
in its suppression order,the district court explained that the coercive nature of the preceding interrogation,sampson mediocre reading of whitfield miranda rights,and the fact that the presentation of whitfield charges was an attempt to elicit his confession rather than a standard booking procedure,inevitably led to the conclusion that whitfield did not questioning at the presentment of his charge by asking what can i do to help myself suppression order.nor did the break in time and location resulting from whitfield transport to the gaston county jail dissipate the coercion.id.at.based upon the totality of circumstances,therefore,the court suppressed whitfield attempted bank robbery confession,finding that it was involuntary and inadmissible under.id.
after the district court evidentiary hearing and suppression of whitfield confession to the attempted bank robbery,the proceedings resumed.although the prosecution had not completed its case by the end of the third day of trial,the court conducted a charge conference.much of that conference dealt with the issues relating to e and count four allegations.notably,the government proposed instruction on count four tracked the language of the indictment,referencing only the killing offense and the forced accompaniment offense,as follows 
count four requires you to determine whether the defendant killed the victim,or whether the defendant forced the victim,to accompany him,while the defendant was attempting to avoid apprehension for the bank robbery charged in count one.
acting sua sponte,the court presented an instruction directing the jury to consider the unalleged third alternative offense,the death results offense.in objecting to the court instruction on count four,whitfield pointed out that the grand jury had failed to allege the death results offense charging only that whitfield had forced parnell to accompany him without her consent and killed her.therefore,according to whitfield,the court instruction and the count four allegations do not match.see id.at.the court overruled the objection,explaining that the death results language did not need to be alleged because the general reference of e in count four triggers the instruction in the two ways e can be violated,either by killing mary parnell or by knowingly forcing her to accompany him.id.at.moreover,the court explained that if it the latter,forced accompaniment,there would be two different ramifications one is forced accompaniment without death,and the other is forced accompaniment with death,and those have sentencing implications.id.at.
the prosecution rested its case on the fourth day of trial after calling experts to testify about the nature and cause of parnell death.whitfield then moved for judgment of acquittal on count four,asserting that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt on that charge,because there was no evidence that he had killed parnell and there was no way to exclude other possible causes of her death.whitfield also maintained that there was insufficient proof that he had forced parnell to accompany him anywhere,or that such forced accompaniment caused her death.the court promptly denied the motion for acquittal,and,after calling a single witness his own medical expert whitfield also rested.there was no rebuttal evidence.at that point,whitfield renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal on count four,contending again that there was insufficient evidence to prove that his conduct proximately caused parnell death.the court again denied the motion.
after the parties made their closing arguments,the district court charged the jury.as to count four,the court instructed that,in order for the jury to find whitfield guilty,it had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that 
one,the defendant committed the offense alleged in count one that is attempted robbery of a credit union.
two,in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for that offense,the defendant 
a,killed mary parnell.
or b,knowingly forced mary parnell to accompany him without her consent.
the court explained to the jury that whitfield was charged with violating this statute in two ways,and that the jury must consider both whether the defendant killed mary parnell whether he forced her to accompany him in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the attempted robbery.id.at.significantly,the court then instructed the jury that,
w ith respect to the second way of violating this statute,if you find that the defendant forced mary parnell to accompany him,you must also decide whether that forced accompaniment resulted in mary parnell death.
id.at emphasis added.
other count four instructions advised the jury that the term forced accompaniment includes forcing a person to move from one part of a building to another against her will and does not require that the defendant crossed a property line,moved a person a particular number of feet,held a person for a particular period of time,or placed the person at a certain level of danger.regarding the terms killed and resulted in death,the court clarified that the government was not required to prove that the defendant intended to kill mary parnell,but that the evidence was required to prove that the defendant actions in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension,were the proximate cause of her death,that whitfield conduct played a substantial part in bringing about or actually causing the death of parnell.id.at.
during its deliberations,the jury asked several questions concerning count four,including inquiries concerning the issue of forced accompaniment and the definitions of killed and resulted in death.when the court convened to discuss the jury inquiries,whitfield counsel repeated his objection to the entirety of the instruction s on count four and specifically objected to the proposed proximate cause instruction on the resulted in death jury question.see.the court responded that whitfield had not waiv ed any earlier objection,and that the court rulings were the law of the case now.see id.at.nevertheless,the court overruled whitfield objections and,in response to the jury inquiries,referred it to the earlier instructions.
on november,the jury returned a verdict of guilty against whitfield on counts one through three.on count four,the jury answered the verdict form inquiry as follows 
paragraph.a not guilty on the e charge of killing mary parnell in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the attempted bank robbery alleged in count one 
paragraph.b guilty on the e charge of forcing mary parnell to accompany him in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension for the attempted bank robbery alleged in count one and 
paragraph.c yes to the question did the forced accompaniment result in mary parnell death 
see,following the jury return of its verdict,whitfield renewed his earlier objection made during the charge conference,in that the language given to the jury is inconsistent with the charging documents,and that resulted in prejudice.see id.at.the court overruled the objection.
on november,the district court sentenced whitfield to life imprisonment on count four,which the court deemed to be statutorily required.see the court also imposed concurrent month sentences on counts one and two,plus a consecutive sentence on count three.the court entered judgment on november,providing that,with respect to count four,whitfield had been found guilty and was sentenced on the death results offense that is,as the judgment recited,f orced accompaniment while attempting to avoid apprehension for an attempted bank robbery resulting in death.id.at.whitfield has timely appealed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
on appeal,whitfield presents four contentions of error.first,whitfield faults the district court for declining to suppress his confessions to the two belmont home,which he argues were the product of coercive interrogations and thus involuntary.second,he posits that two aspects of the jury instructions on count four regarding the forced accompaniment offense were plainly erroneous,in that they failed to instruct on a offense and permitted the jury to convict on count four for a mere confinement as opposed to a forced accompaniment.third,whitfield maintains that the court erred in instructing the jury on the death results offense not alleged in count four.finally,whitfield asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on the forced accompaniment offense.we assess whitfield contentions in turn.
whitfield first contends that the district court erred by declining to suppress his confessions to the two belmont home,especially the statements about his encounter with parnell.whitfield agrees,of course,that the court properly suppressed his confession to the attempted bank robbery a ruling not challenged by either party on appeal.he nevertheless maintains that his other two confessions should have been suppressed because the officers used coercive tactics in the interview process.in particular,whitfield points out that,at the outset of the interview,detectives sampson and sumner led whitfield to believe that their interest in questioning him was limited to the two belmont home the lesser of the evils not the forced accompaniment and death of parnell or the attempted bank robbery.see suppression order.indeed,the court found that whitfield was misled throughout his interrogation regarding the seriousness of the charges against him.id.at.whitfield also emphasizes that he was especially vulnerable to the detectives coercive interrogation tactics,because,as the court observed,w hen his questioning began,whitfield was cold,wet,only years old,and had never before faced any serious charges.id.at.
in considering whether a defendant inculpatory statement was voluntary,we must make an independent determination on the issue of voluntariness,and accept the district court findings of fact on the circumstances surrounding the confession unless clearly erroneous.united states khan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in undertaking that review,we must specifically determine whether the confession was extracted by any sort of threats or violence,or obtained by any direct or implied promises,however slight,or by the exertion of any improper influence.united states holmes,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.even where threats,violence,implied promises,improper influence,or other coercive police activity exist,however,a confession may yet be voluntary unless the defendant will has been overborne or his capacity for critically impaired.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in that regard,we examine the totality of the circumstances,including the characteristics of the defendant,the setting of the interview,and the details of the interrogation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
to begin with,we are struck by the district court perceptive and sensible differentiation between the two parts of the interview of whitfield.in stark contrast to the second part which the court deemed embarrassing to law enforcement and extremely coercive,the first part of that interview was the kind of police conduct that is entirely appropriate,aggressive,trying to ferret out the truth of evidence of criminal activity,id.at.although there were some fairly minor discrepancies in the detectives testimony,the court specifically found them to be credible and their evidence consistent and corroborated by the dvd of the interview.id.at.moreover,the court found that,during the first part of the interview,whitfield was conversational was comfortable,though wet and cold and,despite his youth and inexperience,generally seemed intelligent enough to decide when to provide information and when not to.id.at.notably,whitfield has not argued nor do we perceive that any of the court factual findings were clearly erroneous.we are therefore bound to accept those findings.see united states braxton,cir observing that we accept the district court findings of fact on the circumstances surrounding the confession unless clearly erroneous internal quotation marks omitted.
whitfield chief complaint is that the police officers deceived him about the offenses they were investigating,particularly those involving the forced accompaniment and death of parnell.nevertheless,whitfield concedes that the officers had no duty to advise him of the identity of the specific offense under investigation or inform him of every potential theory of liability related to his conduct.braxton,at.although detectives sampson and sumner led whitfield to believe that their only interest at the start of the interview was the belmont home,whitfield obviously knew that his interactions with parnell were the result of his breaking and entering of her home.whitfield persists,however,that he could not have rationally assessed the consequence of confessing to the because sergeant reynolds had indicated that parnell was alive and had id whitfield.see.because of reynolds misrepresentations,whitfield contends that he mistakenly believed that he was being investigated for only a minor crime.
as the supreme court has explained,p loys to mislead a suspect or lull him into a false sense of security that do not rise to the level of compulsion or coercion to speak are not within miranda concerns.illinois perkins.indeed,misrepresentations are insufficient,in and of themselves,to render a confession involuntary.johnson pollard,cir collecting cases accord braxton,at concluding that investigator statement that you can do five years because you not coming clean,did not result in involuntary confession.the determinative factor remains the question of whether such misrepresentations overbore the defendant will.see frazier cupp,t he fact that the police misrepresented the statements that the codefendant had made is,while relevant,insufficient to make this otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible.put simply,we are satisfied as was the district court that whitfield capacity for was not critically impaired by sergeant reynolds misrepresentations 
as a result,the totality of the circumstances support the district court denial of suppression.during the first part of the police interview,whitfield statements pertaining to the two belmont home including his statements about interacting with parnell were voluntarily made.united states byers,cir ruling that defendant confession was not coerced,even though detective statements were somewhat equivocal,because,inter alia,defendant received miranda warnings and police never told defendant he would not be charged with murder united states gray,cir same,where defendant initialed his understanding of each of his miranda rights and signed a form indicating that he understood no law enforcement officer made assurances,promises or inducements to convince defendant that he would in any way be immunized and there was no evidence that the officers had engaged in any threats,violence,or improper suggestions about how defendant testimony would be used.
whitfield next contends that the instructions on the forced accompaniment offense were plainly erroneous in two respects.first,he argues that the district court failed to instruct on a offense,and,second,that the instructions permitted the jury to convict on a theory of mere confinement as opposed to an actual forced accompaniment.as whitfield acknowledges,we must review these contentions for plain error because they are raised for the first time on appeal.see united states robinson,cir.to satisfy the plain error standard,a defendant must establish that the district court erred,that the error was plain,and that it affected his substantial rights.id.at quoting united states olano,alterations omitted.even if those three prerequisites are met,we retain discretion to deny relief plain errors should only be corrected where not doing so would result in a miscarriage of justice,or would otherwise seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,w e review for abuse of discretion both the district court decision to offer an instruction and the content of that instruction.united states jinwright,cir.
first,whitfield asserts that the district court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury that a conviction under e for forced accompaniment with or without a resulting death requires proof of a predicate d violation we have recognized d as a lesser included offense of the e offenses,such that a ll of the elements required under d are elements under e.united states turner,cir accord united states whitley,cir en banc.nevertheless,the government maintains that no error occurred much less a plain error in that the instruction is not supported by the terms of e and does not fit the unique facts of this case.we need not reach or decide those points,however,because even if the court abused its discretion by failing to instruct on d,and even if that assumed error was plain,it neither contravened whitfield substantial rights nor warrants the exercise of our discretion to correct it 
as whitfield acknowledges,an instructional error is harmless in circumstances where the jury actually made an equivalent or identical finding pursuant to another instruction.see united states aramony,cir.by its guilty verdicts on counts one through three,the jury in this case found,inter alia,that whitfield entered the credit union intending to commit a felony therein,namely,taking the credit union money from the person or presence of another,by force,violence,and intimidation,and that he then carried a smith wesson caliber revolver and a cn romarm caliber assault rifle in furtherance of a crime of violence.see.such underlying conduct amply supports the proposition that,as required by d,whitfield used a dangerous weapon to assault a person or put in jeopardy the life of a person during an attempted bank robbery.indeed,we have long recognized that the act of b randishing weapons during a robbery threatens victims and bystanders alike,sufficient to support a conviction under d.see united states bennett,f d,cir see also united states harris,cir affirming convictions under.c and d where evidence established that defendant carried firearm during bank robbery as a result,we are satisfied that,even if a plain instructional error occurred,it did not affect whitfield substantial rights.see.d olano,at.
furthermore,even if whitfield had been prejudiced by a plain instructional error,we would not exercise our discretion to notice the error.as we have explained,central to the question of whether to notice a plain error affecting substantial rights is a determination of whether,based on the record in its entirety,the proceedings against the accused resulted in a fair and reliable determination of guilt.united states cedelle,cir.based on the trial evidence including whitfield confessions the jury found that he forced parnell to accompany him without her consent.the evidence showed further that parnell reasonably feared whitfield,and that whitfield attempted to commit an aggravated armed bank robbery.in these circumstances,the failure to correct the assumed instructional error would not result in a miscarriage of justice or undermine the fairness or integrity of the trial proceedings.rather,it would be the reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that effect.johnson united states,cedelle,at declining to correct trial court error in failing to instruct jury on essential element because evidence permit ted no other conclusion but that defendant was guilty.
second,whitfield contends that the district court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury on the requirements of a literal forced accompaniment under e.see turner,at.more specifically,whitfield argues that the court erred by instructing that the e forced accompaniment offense includes such an accompaniment,rather than requires it.whitfield also takes issue with the court instruction that the jury need not find that the defendant held the person for a particular period of time,id.at emphasis added,because that instruction suggests that a mere confinement is sufficient a suggestion that the prosecution availed itself of by emphasizing in closing that parnell had been held against her will,see id.at.
we perceive no error in the district court use of the word includes in its instruction on the meaning of forced accompaniment.a trial court has considerable discretion in choosing the specific wording of its instructions,and we will not reverse unless an instructional error is determined to have been prejudicial,based on a review of the record as a whole.figg schroeder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that is,we do not view a single instruction in isolation rather we consider whether taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge,the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.united states rahman,cir.on the whole,the contested instruction advising the jury that the term forced accompaniment includes forcing a person to move from one part of the building to another against her will accurately sets forth the applicable law.see.this instruction was appropriately contextualized to the facts of this case and,by employing the word includes,fairly conveys that,although a defendant can force a person to accompany him beyond the walls of a building,movement from one part of the building to another without consent is literally a forced accompaniment consistent with our recognition that e includes no or threshold requirement.see turner,at 
finally,we do not fault the district court for advising the jury that a forced accompaniment does not require that the victim be held for a particular time period,because the instruction contained language we have already approved,see turner,at agree ing with the eleventh circuit that the text of e contains no requirement that she be held against her will for a particular time period alterations omitted quoting united states bauer,cir.in any event,the challenged instruction expressly disallows rather than endorses a mere confinement theory of forced accompaniment.in the circumstances,there was no instructional error made by the trial court,and this argument must also be rejected.
whitfield next contends that his fifth amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury was abridged because he was convicted of an offense not charged in count four the death results offense.in essence,whitfield asserts that the manner in which count four was tried,including the court instructions on death results and the derivative verdict form,contravened the grand jury clause by constructively amending count four we review de novo the legal question of whether there has been a constructive amendment of an indictment.see united states malloy,cir.
the government has maintained throughout this appeal that count four alleged the essential elements of the e offense of which whitfield was convicted,arguing that the allegations omitted only an enhancing element death results that the jury later found but was not used to support a sentence above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.see br.of appellee as several courts have observed,however,the death results terminology in similar criminal statutes prescribes an offense element rather than a sentencing factor.
in jones united states,the supreme court held that provisions of the carjacking statute,authorizing more severe penalties when the carjacking involves serious injury or death establish separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements that are not mere sentencing factors.see.relying on jones,we identified death results as a separate offense element of.see united states blake,cir.consistent with jones,we have also recognized that death resulted is an essential element of the offense of kidnapping resulting in death as defined in a,a statute structured similarly to e.see united states lentz,cir.our sister circuits have likewise construed analogous death results provisions.see,united states montgomery,cir kidnapping resulting in death,a logan united states,cir arson resulting in death,i united states rebmann,cir drug trafficking resulting in death,b c united states friedman,cir racketeering violence resulting in death,united states rezaq,aircraft piracy resulting in death,n b.
we are unable to discern any reason to either interpret or apply e differently in this case.rather,we are content to adhere to the supreme court nomenclature and describe e as creating separate offenses by the specification of distinct elements.see jones,at more specifically,the killing offense requires proof that a defendant kill ed any person.the forced accompaniment offense necessitates proof that a defendant force d a person to accompany him without the consent of such person.and the death results offense although entailing the forced accompaniment offense requires further proof that death result ed.hence,by instructing on the uncharged death results offense,the district court constructively amended count four to broaden the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented to the grand jury.see united states floresca,cir en banc.when such a constructive amendment is found,the error is fatal and reversible per se.lentz,at 
of course,not every inconsistency between an indictment and the proof offered at trial constitute s a constructive amendment of an indictment.united states redd,cir.short of a constructive amendment,a mere variance,for example,occurs when the facts proven at trial support a finding that the defendant committed the indicted crime,but the circumstances alleged in the indictment to have formed the context of the defendant actions differ in some way nonessential to the conclusion that the crime must have been committed.floresca,at.such a variance does not violate a defendant constitutional rights unless it prejudices the defendant either by surprising him at trial and hindering the preparation of his defense,or by exposing him to the danger of a second prosecution for the same offense.united states ashley,cir.furthermore,an indictment can be amended without further consideration by the grand jury when it is necessary to strike surplusage,see id.at united states ford,cir,or to correct the indictment form,a misnomer,see united states snowden,cir,or a typographical error,see united states morrow,cir.
in much the same fashion as it sought to downplay the constructive amendment in floresca as a variance,the government suggested during the oral argument of this case that the count four allegations constituted no more than an indictment error within the meaning of higgs united states,cir.in higgs,we defined an indictment error as the failure of an indictment to allege an element of a charged offense.id.at.after concluding that the indictment was adequate in that case,we went on to observe,albeit in dicta,that any assumed indictment error would nevertheless be subject to harmless error review.
although the distinction between a constructive amendment and a indictment error may be nuanced,the difference is appreciable in this case.here,there was substantially more than a simple neglect to allege an element of a charged offense.indeed,the killing offense and the forced accompaniment offense were properly charged with all of their essential elements and,thus,there was no defect in the count four allegations.the error arose not from the indictment omission of an element of a charged offense but from the district court instructions on an element of an uncharged offense the death results offense on which whitfield was ultimately convicted and sentenced.see higgs,at recognizing practical distinction between indictment error and constructive amendment.the result was an archetypical constructive amendment.
moreover,it can not be fairly said that the decision to allege count four as it is drawn,specifying only the killing offense and the forced accompaniment offense,was other than intentional.the prosecution proposed instruction on count four was consistent with count four allegations,and did not mention the death results offense.in addition,while opposing whitfield motion to dismiss count four,the government correctly emphasized that it had charged the two e offenses of killing and forced accompaniment in the conjunctive,but it was entitled to prove them in the disjunctive.see thus,to the extent that the grand jury charge can be said to have resulted in indictment error,it was not error premised on a mistake of perception,an oversight as occurred in higgs,but the prologue to legal error occasioned by the district court inconsistent instructions.
to constitute a constructive amendment,the incongruity must in fact change the elements of the offense charged,such that the defendant is actually convicted of a crime other than that charged in the indictment.see ashley,at.a broadening of the alleged charges is precisely what occurred in this case when the district court instructed the jury on the death results offense.simply put,an indictment may not be so amended except by resubmission to the grand jury.russell united states.in deference to the exclusive province of the grand jury to amend the charges in an indictment,in this circuit constructive amendments are erroneous per se and require reversal regardless of preservation.united states robinson,cir citing united states foster,cir floresca,at.or,as more succinctly put by our friend judge hall,a constructive amendment is not subject to review for harmlessness.floresca,at.
even if this case involved an indictment error subject to harmless error review,we would yet vacate whitfield conviction and mandatory life sentence on the death results offense.the government argues that any fifth amendment violation was harmless because whitfield life sentence was within the statutory range and fully supported by the elements alleged and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.br.of appellee.as whitfield correctly observes,however,the government focus on the sufficiency of the evidence is misplaced,inasmuch as to demonstrate harmlessness in the sentencing context,it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the court would have imposed the same sentence in the absence of the constitutional error.see united states.shatley,cir see also united states mackins,cir reviewing preserved error for harmlessness and concluding that defendant substantial rights were affected by receiving life sentence when guidelines mandated sentence.
the government simply can not make the required showing here.the district court believed that it was statutorily mandated to sentence whitfield to life imprisonment on the death results offense,and the court never indicated that it would have imposed that same sentence had a more lenient alternative been available.in that circumstance,the sentencing court silence must be interpreted in favor of whitfield.see united states rodriguez,cir adjudging preserved statutory booker error as prejudicial where court did not indicate that it might have imposed different sentence if guidelines were advisory.
consequently,whether we deem the district court error a constructive amendment or an indictment error,we reach the same result vacatur of whitfield conviction of the death results offense and the resulting mandatory life sentence.on remand,the court will be obliged to amend the jud
