appellant antonio marin marin was convicted by a jury of possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking,in violation of c on appeal,marin claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the firearm was possessed in furtherance of drug activities.he also asserts the trial judge committed reversible evidentiary errors.we affirm.
factual background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states isler,cir.during the fall of the united states drug enforcement administration dea used a cooperating witness known as gijo to make a series of cocaine purchases from marin in springfield,massachusetts.the first occurred in november,when gijo purchased grams of cocaine from marin for outside a grocery store.after the sale,marin drove to his home.a month later gijo purchased an additional to grams of cocaine from marin for.marin drove from his home to a car wash to make this second sale.a third sale,in february,involved grams for.again,marin arrived at the sale his home.
the dea arrested marin on february,the day after the third controlled cocaine purchase.in order to make the arrest,the dea had gijo order grams of cocaine from marin,who drove from his home to the arranged sale point.marin was arrested upon his arrival,after dea agents trapped his car with their own vehicles.although marin got out of his car brandishing what was described as a two or three foot long billy club,he dropped the club at the demand of approaching agents.a clear plastic bag containing grams of cocaine was found in his pocket.
simultaneous with the arrest,other dea agents executed a search warrant at marin apartment.in a bedroom nightstand,they found grams of cocaine,a digital scale and packaging materials.they also found,under the bed mattress,a loaded caliber semiautomatic handgun with a defaced serial number and a spare clip loaded with caliber ammunition.the search yielded in cash,discovered in a bedroom bureau.agents also found roughly grams of cocaine in a plastic bucket in the basement.in interviews,marin admitted to dea agents that all of the cocaine,the gun and ammunition were his,as was the bedroom in which the gun,ammunition and the smaller amount of the cocaine were discovered.he told the agents he had purchased the gun from a cocaine dealer approximately six months prior to his arrest.
the cocaine recovered in marin bedroom and basement formed the basis for the charge of possession with intent to distribute,which,in turn,was the predicate drug crime for the firearm count on which marin was ultimately convicted and which he now appeals.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
marin argues,as he did at trial that the government evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that he possessed the recovered firearm in furtherance of his admitted drug dealing.specifically marin notes the uncontroverted evidence that he was not seen carrying a gun at any of the arranged deals.thus,he argues,the only connection between the firearm and the cocaine was the gun mere presence in the bedroom,which,marin points out,did not even hold the lion share of the stash.while marin accurately recounts the two facts he relies was not seen carrying the gun during the subject drug deals,and the significantly greater share of the cocaine was located in another part of the legal conclusion misses the mark by a wide margin.
in analyzing marin sufficiency claim we must affirm the conviction if after de novo review of the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that a rational factfinder could find that the government proved the essential elements of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.united states stark,cir.
marin was convicted of violating c,which prescribes various mandatory punishments for any person who,during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm to obtain a conviction,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant committed a drug trafficking crime knowingly possessed a firearm and possessed the firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.united states,cir.here,there is no dispute that marin committed a drug trafficking crime and knowingly possessed a firearm.marin appellate argument is aimed at the in furtherance of requirement.
the in furtherance of element does not have a settled,inelastic,definition.see id.meaning is fluid united states felton,cir,cert.denied,d meaning is not.our cases,however,do provide sufficient guidance for the task here.in the context of a drug trafficking predicate,we have understood in furtherance of to demand showing a sufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime.united states grace,cir united states garner,cir.for example,we have held that possession of a firearm to protect drugs or sales proceeds can establish such a nexus.united states robinson,cir,at garner,at.
we have also analyzed in furtherance of evidence from both subjective and objective standpoints.felton,at in applying an objective analysis,we have often considered the proximity of the firearm to the contraband.in grace,for example,we found evidence sufficient where an unloaded firearm was found in the same residence as drugs and sales proceeds.at.and in united states luciano,cir,we affirmed a conviction where the firearms were located in a crawl space also containing heroin and drug paraphernalia.
marin argues that the objective evidence consisted only of the presence of the handgun a few feet from an amount of drugs far smaller than what was found in the basement.this,he claims,in combination with the fact that there was no evidence of him carrying the gun while actually engaging in the drug deals,proves no more than mere presence of the firearm,insufficient to support a conviction.but there was much more to the evidence,which,taken in sum,supports a different conclusion.as noted,dea agents discovered a loaded gun in marin bedroom where it would be easily accessible to him if surprised in the night.the weapon was found,with a loaded spare clip,under marin mattress,in the same room only a few feet grams of cocaine and a digital scale,and in the same house as an additional grams of cocaine and proceeds from drug sales we have little doubt that a jury could have reasonably inferred from this evidence that marin possessed the firearm to protect his drug trafficking activities.moreover,the jury also heard testimony that drug traffickers often possess firearms for protection of their trafficking activities.and,as we have noted,the cases dealing with weapons used in drug dealings regularly uphold in furtherance findings based on a weapon capacity to counter resistance.actual use may be more common in drug deals,but there is no requirement that actual use be proved.felton,at footnote omitted.
our conclusion is no different with respect to the evidence of marin subjective intent to possess the firearm in furtherance of his drug trafficking.where direct evidence of subjective intent is lacking,the jury is free to infer intent from objective circumstances.id.here,in addition to the objective facts as noted proximity of the gun to the cocaine,cash and paraphernalia,as well as it being easily accessed by marin when he was otherwise facts that the gun had an obliterated serial number and that marin admitted that he purchased the gun from another cocaine dealer also support an inference that he subjectively intended to possess the weapon in furtherance of the underlying drug crime.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying marin motion for judgment of acquittal.
evidentiary issues 
agent barron testimony 
appellant next argues that the district court improperly allowed dea agent john barron to testify that,during an interview of marin,he did not ask marin why he had the gun because it was obvious.marin claims this was improper expert testimony in violation of.we disagree.
the testimony came during examination.on by defense counsel,barron had testified that marin never admitted to him that the gun recovered in his
