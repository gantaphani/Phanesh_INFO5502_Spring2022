opinion of the court 
we decide principally whether a shotgun hanging on a defendant living room wall qualifies as an antique firearm not subject to the general registration requirement of the national firearms act.a jury convicted alexander introcaso in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on two counts of violating the firearms act by possessing an unregistered firearm the shotgun and unregistered destructive devices hand grenades.in addition to introcaso contention that the shotgun was an antique firearm,he argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he was in possession of the hand grenades and that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because the government failed to establish guilt on either count.
we disagree with introcaso possession argument as to the hand grenades,and thus affirm on that count.but after examining the statutory text and its history as to whether the firearms act required introcaso to register the gun in question,we conclude that the statute is ambiguous.in the face of this ambiguity,we apply the rule of lenity which instructs that statutory ambiguities should be resolved in favor of the defendant,and conclude that there has been no violation of the firearms act on the firearm count.accordingly,we reverse the conviction and vacate the sentence on that count.as we shall see,these actions have no effect on introcaso sentence save the minimal special assessment.
factual background 
on february,the lehigh county sheriff office in pennsylvania responded to a protection from abuse pfa order which required introcaso to immediately relinquish all weapons to law enforcement,barred him from the marital residence shared with his wife,samia introcaso,and prohibited him from having any communication with her.pursuant to the pfa order,and at the direction of introcaso wife,police officers searched the house and found firearms including handguns and rifles,a machete,knives,seven swords,and hundreds of pounds of ammunition.the police seized the weapons,but physically were unable to take the ammunition,which they left to retrieve later.one week later,introcaso again called the sheriff office to inform them that she had found still more firearms belonging to her husband that she wanted removed from the house.one of the firearms was a shotgun that was displayed on a wall and not registered it forms the basis for count of the indictment against introcaso knowing possession of a rifle shotgun in violation of d.see also id.a defining firearm,id.specifying penalty.
again,pursuant to the initial pfa order as well as introcaso signed written consent to the search,the police retrieved six more firearms a thompson submachine gun,an rifle with a scope,a pistol,two handguns,and another rifle,plus several ammunition boxes,containing three live hand grenades and related components for explosive devices black gun powder and fuse wire.the latter items were found inside a locked cabinet,for which the keys that introcaso had given the police did not work,forcing them to break open the lock again with her consent.these items form the basis for count of the indictment possession of unregistered destructive devices,also in violation of d.see also id.f defining destructive device,id.specifying penalty.
in may,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging introcaso with illegal possession of an unregistered firearm and possession of unregistered destructive devices.at the conclusion of trial in january,the judge declared a mistrial because the jury was deadlocked.at the end of a second trial in may,a jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of the indictment.soon after,introcaso filed motions for acquittal,arrest of judgment,and for a new trial.at a sentencing hearing in august,the district court denied all of introcaso motions and sentenced him to six months imprisonment and six months supervised release on count one months imprisonment and three years supervised release on count two a fine of and a special assessment of.the imprisonment terms were to run concurrently.
introcaso now appeals to us,asserting three claims that the government failed to prove all the elements sufficient to support a conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm,as the gun at issue fell within an antique exception to the firearm registration requirement that the government failed to prove all the elements to support a conviction for possession of destructive devices,as he was not in sole possession of the devices and that the sentence was unreasonable.on the basis of these claims,introcaso also challenges the court denial of his motions for acquittal,arrest of judgment,and for a new trial 
ii.statutory 
statutory text 
the plain language of the statute is the starting place in our inquiry.staples united states,d.if the language of a statute is clear,the text of the statute is the end of the matter.if the language is unclear,we attempt to discern congress intent using the canons of statutory construction.united states jones,cir citations,quotation marks,and brackets omitted.
the firearms act generally requires firearms to be registered in the national firearms registration and transfer record,which is maintained by the secretary of the treasury.firearm is defined as follows 
a term firearm means a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than inches in length a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than inches or a barrel or barrels of less than inches in length a rifle having a barrel or barrels of less than inches in length a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than inches or a barrel or barrels of less than inches in length any other weapon,as defined in subsection e a machinegun any silencer as defined in section of title,united states code and a destructive device.the term firearm shall not include an antique firearm or any device other than a machinegun or destructive device which,although designed as a weapon,the secretary finds by reason of the date of its manufacture,value,design,and other characteristics is primarily a collector item and is not likely to be used as a weapon.
a emphasis added for purposes of the exception,antique firearm is defined as follows 
g antique term antique firearm means any firearm not designed or redesigned for using rim fire or conventional center fire ignition with fixed ammunition and manufactured in or before including any matchlock,flintlock,percussion cap,or similar type of ignition system or replica thereof,whether actually manufactured before or after the year and also any firearm using fixed ammunition manufactured in or before,for which ammunition is no longer manufactured in the united states and is not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade.
neither party contests that introcaso owned a shotgun that was not registered.the gun was,with an overall length measuring inches,and a of inches each.app,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf agent testimony.these measurements meet the statutory requirements for firearm under a,subjecting this gun to a registration requirement unless it met the specifications of the exception 
introcaso argues that he was exempt from a registration requirement because the definition of antique firearm encompasses all guns for which fixed ammunition specifically designed for that gun is no longer made or readily available for support,he cites the expert testimony of an atf agent who determined that the gun was manufactured between and.see app.in addition,the shot made for guns of this type is no longer manufactured or readily available.see app.
the government contends that a gun is not antique,even if manufactured before,if it fits the definition for firearm and if any fixed ammunition can be found in a commercial market that can be used to fire the gun.although shells are no longer available,an atf agent testified that the gun can fire fixed ammunition that is currently commercially manufactured in the united states,namely shotgun shells.see app.in fact,an atf agent testified that he had the gun successfully with shotgun shells.see app.thus,we must decide whether the antique firearm exception applies to guns for which the ammunition initially designed for them is no longer available.if it does not,we will uphold introcaso conviction on count one,but if it does,we will reverse it.
the plain text of the statute clearly exempts,inter alia,antique firearms,but provides little guidance concerning the precise question presented here as the parties suggest,for in the phrase for which ammunition is no longer manufactured,g,can be read two ways in the sense of specifically designed for design or able to be used in usability.if we read for to refer to design,that sense applies to both predicate phrases guns are antique if manufacturers have stopped issuing ammunition of a specific design and if the market likewise no longer provides ammunition here shells of that design.the other reading would require us to understand for in two different senses guns are antique if manufacturers have ceased to produce shells of a particular design for use in a range of guns of a certain period design and if the market no longer has shells that can be used in these guns usability.id.although the first seems to us to be a better or more likely reading,it does not reveal definitively congressional intent on this matter.
statutory purpose 
we next look to statutory purpose to the extent we can discern it.see,nugent ashcroft,cir to resolve ambiguous terms,courts should look to the reading that best accords with the overall purposes of the statute quoting moskal united states,d.it is evident from the face of the act that the firearms act object was to regulate certain weapons likely to be used for criminal purposes.united states arms,d see also,at,as reprinted in,noting concerns that firearms be kept away from those not legally entitled to possess them because of age,criminal background,or incompetency in order to decrease,at,as reprinted in,listing statistics of those killed by unlawful guns.at the same time,by adding the exception in,congress also intended to preclude coverage of antique guns held by collectors in pursuance of the clearly indicated congressional intent to cover under the national firearms act only such modern and lethal weapons,except pistols and revolvers,as could be used readily and efficiently by criminals or gangsters,at.citing,at see also,at,as reprinted in,cong.rec.remarks of senator long.
this legislative history does not determine our issue because that history reveals two competing purposes regulation of guns to control violence and avoiding placing undue burdens on museums and gun collectors the facts here may be read to meet the concerns of former from the perspective of the government viewing introcaso as a gun owner,and the latter from the perspective of introcaso as a gun collector.
analysis of the second circuit court of appeals 
in its review of a similar case,the second circuit court of appeals offered a different interpretation of the antique firearm exception.united states tribunella,cir in that case,tribunella was convicted for possession of an unregistered shotgun that police found concealed in an area above the ceiling tile of his basement bedroom.id.at.a firearms expert from the local police department examined the gun and testified that its measurements fit the statutory ones for firearm,and that he successfully it using standard shotgun shells that were commercially available.id.at.a dealer and consultant in antique firearms gave his expert opinion that the shotgun had been manufactured before and was designed to fire a type of fixed ammunition made before that is no longer commercially available in the united states.id.furthermore,he testified that while the many other fire ammunition not designed for it,modern ammunition would eventually make the gun explode it could happen on the next shot,or it could be a hundred shots down the line id.
construing the exception two conditions that ammunition for the gun is no longer manufactured and that ammunition for the gun is not readily available,the court opined that a lthough the first condition appears to focus on ammunition designed specifically for the gun,no such focus is spelled out in the second condition.id.at.it rejected tribunella interpretation of the second condition as requiring only that specifically designed ammunition be unavailable,though it acknowledged that his view was not definitely refuted by the language of the condition.id.instead,it adopted the government interpretation that the second condition applies to any ammunition and not to just specially designed ammunition if one attributes to the word for different connotations in the two conditions in the first,for means designed for use in in the second,for means able to be used in.id.though this reading requires some interpolation,the court concluded that it was truer to the language congress actually used,as i t is more likely that congress meant the word for to have different connotations in accordance with its context than that it used the absolute word not to denote the less absolute concept of no longer.id.emphasis added.moreover,it acknowledged the dual purposes behind the statute,id.at detailing the statutory and legislative history,but determined that decreasing gun violence was the overriding concern.id.at.if ammunition made for other weapons is readily available in commercial channels and is usable in a firearm,it reasoned,it can not safely be inferred that the firearm is never likely to be used as a weapon.id.at.therefore,the court concluded,the firearm exception exclud es from the definition of antique any firearm for which any usable ammunition is readily available in ordinary channels of commerce.id.at emphasis added.
design versus usability 
though its reasoning is plausible,we do not agree with the second circuit court of appeals analysis.the court acknowledged that the statutory language was ambiguous and the statutory purposes varied.id.acknowledging that tribunella interpretation was not definitely refuted by the language of the condition,that the government reading require d some interpolation,but that i t is more likely that congress meant the word for to have different connotations in support of the government view emphasis added.
when a criminal statute language is unclear,we can not satisfy ourselves with what we think congress more likely intended without some clear indication of what it actually intended.see united states gradwell.b efore a man can be punished as a criminal under the federal law his case must be plainly and unmistakably within the provisions of some statute.citation and quotation marks omitted see also united states wiltberger,wheat.the rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly is perhaps not much less old than construction itself,at.applying the rule of lenity to the firearms act to conclude that an arms manufacturer had no tax liability for m aking a firearm because of ambiguity in the ambit of the statute and because significant penal sanctions attached to violations of the payment requirement.the rule is designed to ensure that legislatures and not courts exact penal laws as well as to ensure that individuals have fair notice of what the law requires so as to avoid arbitrary enforcement.mcboyle united states.although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals,it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world,in language that the common world will understand,of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.wiltberger,wheat.at t he power of punishment is vested in the legislative,not in the judicial department.it is the legislature,not the court,which is to define a crime,and ordain its punishment.smith united states,d applying the the traditional canon of construction which calls for the strict interpretation of criminal statutes and rules in favor of defendants where substantial rights are involved,in part to avoid oppressive and arbitrary proceedings.
as noted,the statutory text,history and legislative purpose do not provide clarity,because they recognize opposing interests in regulating guns that may be used for violence and in avoiding placing burdens on gun collectors.with these competing concerns,the question for us is what conduct congress intended to,and did,criminalize.b ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties,and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community,legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity.united states bass,d.thus,to criminalize possession of purported antique firearms that may fit the technical definition of firearm,congress must have spoken in language that is clear and definite.jones united states,d quoting united states universal credit.here,where we are left with no more than a guess,ladner united states,d,as to what it was more likely that congress intended,we should resolve the case in introcaso favor.because congress did not declare clearly an intent to impose a registration requirement on firearms in which any modern ammunition is usable in addition to or instead of guns for which ammunition is specifically designed,we apply the rule of lenity to conclude that introcaso is not liable for failing to register the firearm in question we will therefore reverse his conviction and vacate his sentence on the first count of the indictment.
iii.unregistered destructive devices 
introcaso argues that he was not in direct possession of the hand grenades and other destructive devices that the police seized because he had been barred from going to the house pursuant to the pfa order,and that the government did not otherwise prove that he was in possession of the devices.the government counters that there was sufficient evidence at trial for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that introcaso was in constructive possession of the devices.as this is a issue,we ask whether there was substantial evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,to support defendant conviction.united states castro,cir.
in order to convict for possession of unregistered destructive devices,the government must present sufficient evidence to demonstrate that introcaso was in possession of the devices.this demonstration may be actual or constructive.united states brown,cir.to demonstrate constructive possession,the government 
must submit sufficient evidence to support an inference that the individual knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing,either directly or through another person or persons.constructive possession necessarily requires both dominion and control over an object and knowledge of that object existence.
id.quoting united states iafelice,cir citations omitted.such dominion and control need not be exclusive but may be shared with others.united states davis,cir.mere proximity is not enough to demonstrate constructive possession.united states jenkins,cir.
in brown,the court concluded that the evidence sufficed to support a finding of constructive possession where the defendant possessed a key to the house,came to the house during the search,admitted that items found in the same room as the contraband items belonged to her,established that she owned the house,and a government witness testified that the house was used to store and prepare drugs for distribution.brown,at.similarly here,the government established that introcaso was the lessee of record on the house and had occupied the house along with his wife up until a week before the explosive devices were removed,he was seen in the vicinity of the house when police returned for the second search,his wife keys did not work to open the locked cabinet in which the explosives were found,he likely knew about the devices,as two former employees testified that they had seen him store similar or identical hand grenades in a similar or identical military ammunition box in his office and an box was in his basement during the search.see app.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we have no doubt that it presented evidence sufficient to allow a jury to conclude that introcaso was in constructive possession of the explosive devices,and there is no indication that its conclusion rested on mere proximity.jackson byrd,cir apartment lessee who exercised control over parts of it was in constructive possession of its contents united states wahl,jury may infer that a person exercises constructive possession over items found in his or her home 
iv.sentence 
introcaso received a sentence of six months imprisonment and six months supervised release on the firearm count count i,months imprisonment and three years supervised release on the grenades count count ii,a fine of,and a special assessment of reflecting a mandatory assessment of on each count.the sentences were to run concurrently.though we reverse introcaso conviction and vacate his sentence on the first count,we affirm his conviction on the second count.thus,it is necessary for the court to determine whether the sentencing court imposition of a sentence on the second count was reasonable.
introcaso argument that months imprisonment is an unreasonable sentence is no more than a rehashing of his challenge to the conviction.in challenging the sentence,he merely reiterates that he was not in possession of the destructive devices secured in the basement,and that no one intended to utilize any item in this case for a destructive or otherwise illegal purpose.appellant br.at.he argues that these facts combine to render the sentence imposed unreasonable under the circumstances and therefore same should be reversed.id.
a review of the sentencing hearing reveals that the district court complied with the sentencing procedure we set out in united states gunter,cir it performed the initial guidelines calculation based on the report,it ruled on introcaso downward departure motion,and it exercised discretion in imposing a sentence in the middle of the guidelines range.see.we discern no abuses of discretion,and thus have no reason to hold the sentence unreasonable.
finally,though we reverse introcaso conviction on count i and vacate his sentence thereupon,a remand for resentencing is unnecessary because our actions with respect to count i do not affect his sentence under count ii our decision to reverse introcaso conviction and vacate his sentence on the first count materially changes his sentence in only one way he was initially sentenced to a mandatory special assessment,reflecting an assessment of on each count.because we are vacating the sentence on count one,the mandatory special assessment should be,reflecting an assessment on the second count only.
conclusion 
concluding that the statute was ambiguous as to whether the antique firearm exception applied to the gun in question,we apply the rule of lenity to reverse introcaso conviction on that count.but because the government evidence was sufficient to establish that he was in possession of the hand grenades,we affirm the conviction on the second count.while we vacate the portion of introcaso sentence relating to count one and affirm the conviction and sentence for count two,there is no need to remand for resentencing because but for our eliminating a special assessment his sentence remains the same.
i join the majority opinion insofar as it affirms introcaso conviction on count two,for possession of unregistered destructive devices.i also concur with the majority conclusion that the sentence imposed on introcaso was not unreasonable.however,i must respectfully dissent from the majority decision to reverse introcaso conviction as to count one,possession of an unregistered shotgun.for the reasons stated by the second circuit in united states tribunella,cir,i would conclude that the exception does not apply in this case and would affirm introcaso conviction on this count.
as the majority suggests,in enacting the national firearms act,congress had several purposes,including not placing undue burdens on museums and gun collectors and decreasing the violent use of guns.tribunella,at.however,the mere fact that congress had multiple and perhaps competing purposes does not automatically r
