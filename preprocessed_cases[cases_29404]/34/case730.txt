on january,albert taylor taylor and his thomas isaac webb webb were found guilty of one count of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine and two counts of knowingly distributing crack cocaine in violation of and a,respectively.taylor was sentenced to months in prison and five years of supervised release on each count,with the sentences to run concurrently 
taylor challenges a number of evidentiary rulings of the trial court,claiming that these rulings,individually and in combination,warranted a mistrial or reversal of his conviction.we conclude otherwise and affirm the district court rulings.
factual background and procedural history 
during a five day trial,the government sought to prove that taylor and webb engaged in a conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine and did so on two occasions,april,and april.the government called several witnesses,including william cossia cossia,a cooperating witness and the putative purchaser of the drugs.cossia purchased crack cocaine from the defendants at the blue star motel in westerly,rhode island,while the federal bureau of investigations fbi recorded the transactions.the government introduced the tapes of the recorded conversations as well as the crack cocaine reportedly sold by taylor and webb during the two transactions.
motion in limine hearing 
prior to trial,taylor and webb filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of a prior drug transaction under.rule.the motion sought to exclude any evidence or testimony that the informant,william cossia,had prior drug dealing activities with albert taylor.the motion noted that the challenged testimony was highly prejudicial,irrelevant and would mislead the jury.specifically,taylor sought to prevent cossia from testifying about a november incident in north stonington,connecticut,six months before the two charged transactions,during which cossia and a female friend met taylor and webb at a truck stop and purchased crack cocaine from them.
the government countered that the testimony was important for several reasons a to enable the jury to understand that cossia did not contact taylor out of the blue to set up the charged transactions b to counteract the expected defense that cossia incorrectly identified taylor and webb on those occasions and c to establish a common scheme or plan under.b rule b.
characterizing the motion as one raising a difficult issue,the trial court concluded that because six months elapsed between the alleged prior sale and the april,transaction,the connection between the two incidents was too tenuous to show a common scheme or plan under rule b.the court expressed concerns about avoiding a on the subject of the north stonington incident,which would open up a pandora box of other issues.the court also found that the north stonington evidence was not probative on the subject of cossia identification of taylor and webb because cossia claimed to be able to identify the defendants on the basis of his dealings with them on the two charged occasions.the court did,however,allow the government to establish that cossia had met taylor and webb before the april,transaction,so long as it instructed cossia not to explain the circumstances of their meeting.
the problem was that there were two sources of evidence concerning the north stonington testimony and a reference on the audiotape recordings which the government was seeking to introduce of the april,meeting.while the tape reference was mentioned during the motion in limine hearing,the focus of the court order was directed to the cossia testimony neither the government nor defense counsel ever sought clarification from the court as to whether the court order covered the audio taped reference to north stonington as well as cossia testimony.the defendant,in particular,never objected to the north stonington reference or sought its redaction from the conversation at any time 
cossia trial testimony 
during the course of cossia testimony at trial,the government did establish that cossia had met taylor and webb prior to the april,crack cocaine deal cossia,however,did not refer to the north stonington incident.
cossia testified that he phoned taylor on april,and placed an order for two eight balls grams of crack cocaine.a meeting was arranged at the blue star motel for that evening.when cossia arrived,he was wearing a tape recorder and wire transmitter.
the tape was played to the jury.in it,cossia could be heard posing as a retail drug dealer with wealthy clients who demanded high quality crack cocaine.cossia identified taylor and webb,who were also posturing.they boasted about dealing large quantities of drugs,larger than other dealers in the area.taylor warned cossia that he taylor controlled all future transactions.he remarked,we do do what you say you do what we say 
when taylor expressed concern that cossia might be working for the police,cossia,in the portion of the audiotape whose introduction the defendant now challenges,sought to ease taylor concerns by reminding taylor that they had met in north stonington six months before.although the reference was brief and the context not entirely clear,the dialogue does suggest that the earlier transaction involved a drug deal cossia told taylor that if cossia was working for the police,then taylor surely would have been arrested at the time.cossia added,we met you over north stonington if i the police why are you jammed defense counsel did not object at any time to the playing of this portion of the audiotape.
taylor then went on to threaten cossia w hen the shit go wrong they know why it happened.they get shot.cossia testified at trial that shortly after making the threat,taylor leaned back in his chair and exposed the automatic handgun tucked in his waistband,calling cossia attention to it by patting it.taylor objected,but his objection was overruled 
webb then placed two eight balls of crack cocaine on the table.after a brief dispute over their texture,cossia accepted the drugs and handed taylor in cash that had been supplied to him by the fbi.meeting with the fbi as soon as he left the defendants,cossia turned the drugs over to them.the weight of the drugs was recorded at grams of crack cocaine.
on april,cossia phoned taylor to set up a second meeting to purchase three eight balls grams of crack cocaine.after setting the price at,the two agreed to meet again at the blue star motel.cossia again wore a wire transmitter and recording device.at the meeting,taylor and webb exchanged cash for cocaine base,which cossia turned over to the fbi.the weight was determined subsequently to be grams.
in addition to cossia,law enforcement officers testified that they monitored cossia transmissions.the government also presented evidence which linked taylor and webb to a gold ford probe that was parked outside the blue star motel during the transactions.
during its closing argument,and specifically,in rebutting defense counsel argument,the government briefly referred to the north stonington incident mentioned in the audiotape of the april,transaction.defense counsel did not object.
on appeal,taylor challenges the admission of the north stonington reference on the april,tape and the fact that the court permitted cossia to testify that taylor had a gun in his waistband during the april,drug deal,to which he had objected.in addition,taylor challenges the prosecutor reference to the north stonington incident in his closing and the court failure to grant a mistrial sua sponte based on the collection of errors.
ii.legal analysis 
cossia taped statement concerning the north stonington incident 
taylor concedes that he did not object to the admission of cossia taped statement concerning the north stonington incident.absent an objection to the evidence at trial,our review under.b rule b is for plain error.united states meserve,cir.taylor must prove that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected his substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.taylor challenge to the north stonington reference on the tape can not meet this standard.
