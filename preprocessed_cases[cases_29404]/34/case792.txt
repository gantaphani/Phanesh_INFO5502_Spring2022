volkan mergen appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york garaufis.mergen had been for years a paid fbi informant operating inside mob families.in,he participated with mob members in an arson without giving the fbi a signal that would have allowed the agency to abort the crime.the government suspected that mergen feared his status as a paid informant would end if the fbi,forewarned,intervened.on june,mergen entered into a cooperation agreement with the united states attorney office,by which he would plead guilty to a travel act offense in connection with the arson he bought gas in new jersey to avoid surveillance on staten island in exchange for a letter.one provision of the agreement tolled the statute of limitations for prosecutions resulting from mergen breach and premised upon,among other things,mergen statements to the government,or his testimony,or leads derived therefrom.when mergen breached that agreement by falsely disclaiming knowledge about a theft of three cheap watches,the government demanded that mergen also plead to making a false statement mergen refused and two superseding indictments were filed,charging him with the travel act offense as well as various criminal acts drug distribution,attempted robbery,firearm possession,and related conspiracies that the government learned about from persons who had been convicted based on mergen cooperation.mergen was not charged with making any false statement.
mergen brings this appeal from his conviction on all counts.
we reject mergen sufficiency challenge to the travel act conviction,but nevertheless vacate that conviction because the district court erred when it excluded,on hearsay and authentication grounds,a recording in which an fbi agent assured mergen that he had done nothing wrong in connection with the underlying arson.as to mergen remaining convictions for drug distribution,attempted robbery,firearm possession,and related conspiracies,we reverse because the wording of mergen cooperation agreement did not toll the expired statute of limitations for those offenses.
the facts recited in this opinion are taken from the trial record.because the jury found mergen guilty,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states geibel,cir.
in may,mergen contacted fbi special agent george wright and agreed to become a paid fbi informant.mergen efforts over the next included wearing a wire while working with members of the gambino and bonanno crime families.mergen service was fruitful he sometimes submitted so many recordings to the fbi that the agency could not keep pace.
in january,mergen began associating with a crew on staten island affiliated with the bonanno family.the crew was led by michael maggio and also included joseph young and john tufarelli.mergen made hundreds of recordings of their conversations.
the following year,on january,mergen warned the fbi that the crew was planning an arson that night.fbi special agent anthony zampogna,mergen,told mergen that he was not authorized to participate in the arson and that the fbi would do whatever was necessary to prevent it even if it meant ending mergen role as an informant.the fbi laid preparations near the target and gave mergen a code phrase to use if the arson was imminent he was to call and alert special agent lauren regucci,who would pose on the phone as mergen girlfriend,and tell her i running late.the arson,however,was postponed when mergen was able to distract young.nor did it happen the next day mergen told agent zampogna that young was ill.
the arson was eventually committed in the early hours of january.maggio told mergen about the plan the prior afternoon but although mergen spoke with and met agent zampogna later that day,there is no evidence beyond mergen own testimony that mergen took these opportunities to warn the fbi.mergen did,however,record the conversations leading up to the arson,and later turned over those recordings to the fbi.
mergen recordings document the of the arson and were used by the prosecution to demonstrate that mergen passed up opportunities to give warning.at pm on january,young said let go to my house,pick up the gas cans in my garage,go take care of this kid.see app.gov t app.over the next six hours,mergen,young,and maggio planned and executed the operation.mergen,in the presence of young and maggio,phoned several girlfriends,but did not call agent regucci to deliver the coded warning.around am,mergen,young,and maggio went to young home to pick up a propane bomb and gas canisters.mergen suggested that they get gasoline from new jersey,a useful precaution he explained to the others because,after the arson,law enforcement would review camera tapes from gas stations in staten island.the three drove to new jersey,bought gasoline,and then returned to staten island to eat.at the diner,mergen saw police officers enter,but did not alert them.at about am,mergen told another girlfriend that he would be busy for the next half hour or so.shortly before am,the crew went to the target house in separate cars.mergen,who drove young,parked near the target young ran out,firebombed the house,and ran back all three drove away.minutes after the house was set afire,young left mergen car.at that juncture,mergen called agent zampogna and told him that t hey had committed the arson.
agent zampogna testified that he and agent regucci were unaware the arson would occur and therefore did not prepare.the fire department put out the fire,but not before the owner of the house suffered cardiac arrest and had to be revived at the hospital.
after the arson,the united states attorney office approached mergen about a possible deal.on june,mergen signed a cooperation agreement he agreed to plead guilty to a travel action violation,the trip to new jersey to get gasoline for the arson,in return for a substantial assistance sentencing letter.the statutory maximum sentence for a travel act offense is five years imprisonment.see a a.
that same day,mergen waived indictment and pled guilty.his plea allocution recited that he traveled with others by car to obtain gasoline to be used to set fire to a house in staten island,we drove to a house and one of the individuals set fire to the house using the gasoline.at the time of these events,i was cooperating with the government but i did not have authorization to set fire to a house or to obtain gasoline for that purpose.gov t app.
the deal unraveled when,in a debriefing session months later,mergen falsely denied knowledge regarding theft of three stolen fake watches worth about in the aggregate.the government told mergen he now had to plead guilty to an additional charge of false statement mergen refused and the government decided to withhold a motion after all mergen successfully moved to withdraw his plea,and refused to sign any new agreement without a commitment.
the standoff continued.naturally,the government stopped paying mergen his monthly stipend.then,on september,the government filed a superseding indictment charging five additional counts conspiracy to commit robbery,attempted robbery,firearm possession during the attempted robbery,conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana,and actual distribution of cocaine and marijuana.a second substantively identical superseding indictment was filed on april.
the government gathered evidence of mergen participation in these crimes from the obliging targets mergen had helped convict.at mergen trial,tufarelli a member of the maggio crew testified that he and mergen began dealing marijuana in staten island in about early and that,after about a year of that business,he convinced mergen to join him in selling cocaine,an enterprise that lasted until early to maybe.app.
tufarelli and daryl rosenblatt another criminal associate brought down by mergen testified that,in august,mergen plotted to rob a check cashing operation run out of a staten island gas station parking lot that,in preparation,mergen supplied the other two with firearms,and enlisted as getaway driver but that the attempt was frustrated when the target became suspicious.
normally,the statute of limitations would have barred prosecutions for offenses occurring before september.see a.the government,however,relied on the tolling provision of the cooperation agreement,which,by the government reading,allowed it to commence any prosecution not as of the date of the agreement signing,june.mergen moved to dismiss the additional charges as the district court agreed with the government reading and concluded that mergen had waived the statute of limitations.
at the ensuing trial,the government used mergen own recordings and testimony from fbi agents and from cooperating witnesses whom mergen had ensnared.
mergen was the sole defense witness.he acknowledged that he was authorized to commit only certain crimes,and needed prior approval for any others but,he testified,he did warn agents about the arson timing and the fbi told him that everything was under control.given this approval and his fear of being discovered and killed by young and maggio mergen went along with the crew plan.
on april,after six days of trial,the jury convicted mergen on all counts.the district court entered judgment on july,and sentenced mergen to years imprisonment.
mergen argues that his travel act conviction should be reversed because a there was insufficient evidence that he possessed the requisite intent and b his conduct was justified by the public authority and related defenses.we reject these arguments.
the travel act punishes with imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine those who travel in interstate commerce with intent to promote,manage,establish,carry on,or facilitate the promotion,management,establishment,or carrying on,of any unlawful activity.a.mergen argues that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent to facilitate the arson.
we defer to the jury determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,and to the jury choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.united states morrison,cir.a defendant bears a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a conviction on grounds that the evidence was insufficient.united states aleskerova,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
that burden is decisive here.it is certainly odd that mergen would intend to facilitate an arson that he had himself brought to the government attention and had warned the government about days earlier,and that he was contemporaneously recording for the fbi.we can not say,however,that no rational jury could find that the government established the essential elements of the travel act crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
the evidence at trial credited by the jury established that mergen was an active participant in the arson.mergen failed to warn the fbi despite numerous opportunities to do so.he had meetings with agents earlier that day,and ample time to relay a secret code while the plot was progressing.moreover,he repeatedly spoke to his girlfriends on the phone,and the jury was free to conclude that the only reason he did not deliver the coded warning to agent regucci posing as yet another girlfriend was his intent to facilitate the arson.
we are not unsympathetic to mergen argument that he was in fear of young and maggio,who are indisputably violent criminals.maggio,for example,suggested that young shoot anybody who ran from the burning building.mergen testified to earlier occasions on which the fbi had stood aside after he warned them that the crew might engage in crimes of violence,such as an october episode in which a victim was beaten and threatened while the fbi was conducting surveillance.
the jury,however,was privileged to discount or reject mergen testimony,and obviously did.we therefore reject the invitation to reverse the travel act conviction.
we also conclude that mergen can not rely on the public authority defense,which exists where a defendant has in fact been authorized by the government to engage in what would otherwise be illegal activity.united states giffen,cir emphasis added.mergen concedes that he plainly was not expressly authorized to participate in an arson.appellant br.at.
nor has mergen made out a defense of entrapment by estoppel,which requires that the government,by its own actions,induce the defendant to do criminal acts and le a d him to rely reasonably on his belief that his actions would be lawful by reason of the government seeming authorization.id.at.g reat caution should be exercised when it comes to the application of the defense,united states corso,cir the defendant conduct must remain within the general scope of the solicitation or assurance of authorization and the defense will not support a claim of an license to commit crimes in the expectation of receiving subsequent authorization,united states abcasis,cir.beyond his own testimony which the jury did not credit,mergen adduced no evidence of government action that would have created a reasonable belief that his participation in the arson was implicitly authorized.
finally,mergen raises the negation of intent doctrine,a doctrine we have not previously recognized,by which a defendant undertakes to rebut the government proof of the intent element of a crime by showing that the defendant had a belief that he was acting with government authorization.giffen,at.even if we were to recognize the doctrine,it is unclear what independent role it would play mergen already argues that he lacked the requisite intent for a travel act violation because of his informant status.we therefore reject this argument for the reasons stated supra.
mergen argues that the district court erred by excluding a recorded conversation between mergen and agent wright,who was mergen handler in the recording,which mergen made surreptitiously soon after the arson,agent wright assured mergen he had not done anything wrong the night of the arson.
at trial,the prosecution asked agent wright if,based on agent wright conversations with mergen about mergen conduct on the night of the arson,agent wright form ed a view as to whether mergen should be criminally prosecuted for what he had done.app.over mergen objections,agent wright testified that he had taken the view that mergen should be criminally prosecuted.id.
on,agent wright reaffirmed that he felt that mergen was criminally responsible,involved with the arson.app.mergen then asked,d id you ever tell mergen that you felt he did nothing wrong agent wright responded,no,i did not.id.mergen sought to impeach by playing the recorded conversation.the district court ruled that mergen could not play the recording to the jury mergen was able only to ask agent wright again if he ever t old mergen on any occasion that with regards to the arson,he did nothing wrong to which agent wright again responded,no.app.when mergen later took the stand in his own defense,he again sought to play the recording to the jury but the district court upheld the government objection,on grounds of hearsay and lack of authentication.see app.it is hearsay.and furthermore,there is no way of authenticating that tape.
a prior summary order issued in this case,united states mergen,app x cir,remanded for the district court to clear up some lingering evidentiary confusion the record on appeal included multiple recordings,and to confirm that the recording mergen sought to introduce at trial included the following 
mergen between you and me,do you think i did anything wrong that night of the arson 
agent wright no,no.
after a hearing on may,the parties agreed that the recording mergen sought to play at trial did include this exchange.because of the district court evidentiary rulings,however,the jury never heard it,and only had before it agent wright testimony regarding his consistent view that mergen was criminally responsible.
as we explained in our earlier summary order,the recording should not have been excluded on the bases of either hearsay or lack of authentication.id.at.that is because prior inconsistent statements offered for impeachment are,by definition,not hearsay and the fact that some portions of a recording may be inaudible is not a proper basis for exclusion unde
