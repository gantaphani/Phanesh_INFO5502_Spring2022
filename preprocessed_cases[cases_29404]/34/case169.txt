in february,andrew symonevich was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute,and to possess with the intent to distribute,cocaine and heroin in violation of a.he moved to suppress evidence recovered during the search of a car in which he was a passenger.the district court denied symonevich motion to suppress.after a trial,the jury convicted symonevich of the charged offense.
symonevich now appeals the district court denial of his motion to suppress and challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction.alternatively,he demands a new trial because of the improper admission of certain testimony and charts and the inadequacy of the conspiracy instruction given to the jury.
we recount the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states mubayyid,cir.
a.the wiretap investigation 
as part of its ongoing investigation of drug trafficking by a group known as the duran gomez organization,the drug enforcement agency dea obtained permission to wiretap six telephone numbers associated with the organization,referred to as target telephones,or tt numbers one through six.calls from symonevich were intercepted on three days in november on tt,a customer line.
on november,through a series of seven intercepted phone calls,symonevich arranged to buy grams of heroin at a mcdonald off interstate in massachusetts.four days later,on november,symonevich arranged through a series of phone calls to buy grams of heroin and one ounce of cocaine.during one of the intercepted calls,an individual known as tony asked symonevich what kind of car he was driving.symonevich then asked an unidentified male,what this what kind of car is this the unidentified male answered that they were in a green subaru.tony was later identified as wilson ariel soto,the alleged leader of the drug trafficking organization.
on november,agents intercepted a number of calls between symonevich and ariel soto,during which symonevich arranged to purchase grams of heroin.after symonevich first recorded call at,dea agents sent unmarked surveillance units toward interstate to follow symonevich.massachusetts state police sergeant james bazzinotti,who was assisting the dea with surveillance during the investigation,observed a green subaru and followed it.after surveillance units observed what dea agents believed to be a meeting between symonevich and ariel soto drug courier,agents planned to stop symonevich.in the meantime,however,bazzinotti stopped at a traffic light and lost sight of the subaru,which he only saw again after it had been stopped.
b.the vehicle stop 
symonevich was arrested on november after a traffic stop that commenced at approximately and was apparently unrelated to the dea investigation and bazzinotti surveillance.the arresting officer,massachusetts state trooper sweeney,was patrolling and observed a broken side tail light on the green subaru in which symonevich was traveling.sweeney pulled his police cruiser up behind the subaru and initiated a stop by activating his blue lights.as he turned on his lights,sweeney observed the passenger,symonevich,lean down as if placing or retrieving something from underneath his seat.sweeney testified that this movement caused him concern for his safety.the subaru slowly pulled into the breakdown lane and stopped.sweeney approached the vehicle on the passenger side where he observed symonevich in the passenger seat looking completely ashen faced and scared to death.
sweeney asked symonevich and the driver,later identified as gerard adair,where they were going.adair first said that he had been visiting his grandmother.in response to further questioning,he stated that he had met a girl online and was going to meet up with her but could not find her.sweeney asked symonevich if he was related to adair.symonevich responded that he was just going for a ride with his friend.when sweeney asked adair for his license and registration,he observed that adair hand was shaking as he handed sweeney his driver license.sweeney returned to his cruiser to run a record check and radioed for backup.trooper brian sweet arrived shortly thereafter.
after informing sweet of his observations,sweeney went back to the subaru and asked symonevich to exit the vehicle.symonevich complied.as symonevich exited,sweeney and sweet smelled the stale odor of marijuana coming from symonevich clothing.sweeney took symonevich to the rear of the subaru and asked him why he had reached under the seat as sweeney pulled them over.after he first said that he was putting a piece of paper down,symonevich revised his statement,saying that he had actually put a can of under the seat.sweeney asked symonevich why he had the can.symonevich responded that he had it in case we get a flat.sweeney told symonevich that his answer gave him concern for his safety.although symonevich was not under arrest,sweeney wanted him to sit in the back of the police cruiser while sweeney spoke to adair.symonevich complied.
sweeney approached adair and asked what symonevich had put under the seat.adair said that he did not know.sweeney asked if there were weapons in the car.adair replied,not that i know of.sweeney asked permission to search the car and adair declined.sweeney nevertheless searched the car because he wanted to be sure there was nothing under the seat that posed a safety threat.about of the way through the stop,sweeney got a radio call informing him that symonevich was also the subject of an ongoing dea investigation.
sweeney looked under the passenger seat and found a can of tire puncture sealant.he picked it up and observed that the weight was not consistent with a can of tire sealant.sweeney shook the can and felt something solid move around inside.he looked at the bottom of the can,saw that it was slightly separated from the can,unscrewed the bottom,and found a wad of paper towels and three bundles of brown substances that he believed to be packages of heroin sweeney placed symonevich and adair under arrest 
symonevich makes four arguments on appeal the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the basis that,as a passenger in the vehicle,he lacked standing to challenge the seized evidence the district court abused its discretion in admitting certain testimony and charts there was insufficient evidence to show that he joined the charged duran gomez conspiracy to distribute drugs and the district court failed to properly instruct the jury that intent to resell drugs is not necessarily sufficient to prove membership in a conspiracy to distribute drugs.we address each argument in turn.
motion to suppress 
where the denial of a motion to suppress has been challenged,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,united states werra,cir,and we review de novo the district court conclusions of law,including its application of the law to the facts,its probable cause and reasonable suspicion determinations,and the district court ultimate legal decision to grant or deny the motion to suppress,united states camacho,cir.
after hearing argument on the standing issue,the district court orally denied symonevich motion to suppress,relying on rakas illinois,d 
i f the drugs were taken on symonevich person but taken from the car,simply as a passenger,without more,without some kind of showing beyond the fact of being a passenger in a car and it having been found underneath his seat,that not enough so the motion will be denied for lack of standing.
symonevich argues that as a passenger in the subaru,he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in items seized therefrom and,thus,had standing to challenge the lawfulness of a search he argues that 
the law simply can not be so fine as to allow an individual to challenge a pat frisk of his person,but not allow him to challenge the seizure of property he had placed just beneath his seat seconds before the encounter w hen symonevich was placing the can beneath his seat,he expected it would remain as private as if he placed it in his pocket.
in addition,symonevich argues that the district court failed to adequately consider the duration of the trip between maine and massachusetts in determining whether he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle.he also claims that he had a possessory interest in the can of tire sealant that afforded him a reasonable expectation of privacy in the space under the seat and thus standing to suppress the recovered evidence.
the government makes three arguments in response that a passenger does not have standing to challenge the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle in which he or she has no proprietary interest in the alternative,that there was probable cause to believe contraband would be found in the subaru,and hence the search was lawful under the automobile exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement and in the further alternative,that the recovered evidence would have inevitably been discovered by dea agents if they had stopped the subaru before trooper sweeney,as they were about to do,and hence it should be admitted pursuant to the inevitable discovery doctrine,see united states pardue,cir.we focus on the government first argument.
the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches may only be claimed where a defendant demonstrates that he or she personally has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched.see rakas,at.as a general proposition,a person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person premises or property has not had any of his or her fourth amendment rights infringed.id.at.in the context of a vehicle search,a passenger who has asserted neither a property nor a possessory interest in the automobile,nor an interest in the property seized,has made no showing that he or she has a legitimate expectation of privacy in,for example,the area under the seat of the car in which he or she was merely a passenger.id.at.under such circumstances,a vehicle search does not infringe upon the passenger fourth amendment rights.thus,the passenger lacks standing to challenge the search.
symonevich argues that the supreme court has recently recognized the fourth amendment rights of passengers in the context of vehicle stops.see arizona johnson,d explaining that a passenger is seized,just as the driver is,from the moment a car stopped by the police comes to a halt on the side of the road alteration in original quoting brendlin california,d internal quotation marks omitted.these cases,however,do not extend fourth amendment rights to passengers who challenge only the search of the vehicle in which they were traveling and not their seizure.indeed,the brendlin court noted that the appellant did not assert that his fourth amendment rights were violated by the search of the driver vehicle,but claimed only that the traffic stop was an unlawful seizure of his person.at citation omitted.moreover,the court approvingly cited rakas for its rejection of the target theory of standing,embraced by symonevich here,which would effectively allow any criminal defendant at whom a search was directed to challenge the legality of the search.id.at quoting rakas,at internal quotation marks omitted.
symonevich argues that even if brendlin and johnson did not explicitly overrule rakas,they did so implicitly because concluding otherwise would defeat the deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule we disagree.t he exclusionary rule is an attempt to effectuate the guarantees of the fourth amendment,and it is thus proper to permit only defendants whose fourth amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the rule protections.rakas,at.indeed,d espite the deterrent aim of the exclusionary rule,the supreme court has never held that unlawfully seized evidence is inadmissible in all proceedings or against all persons.the application of the rule has been restricted to those areas where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served.id.at alteration omitted citations omitted quoting united states calandra,d.the supreme court has regularly declined to extend the benefits of the exclusionary rule to defendants whose personal fourth amendment rights have not been infringed upon,and we decline to do so here.see,carter,at.
symonevich argues in the alternative that the particular circumstances in this case gave him a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle.relying on our decision in united states lochan,cir,symonevich argues that the duration of the trip between maine and massachusetts a nearly six hour drive was long enough that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle.we did say in lochan that the fact of a long trip would engender a slightly greater privacy expectation than would a short trip.id.at.symonevich says that vehicle passengers on long rides are akin to overnight guests and thus have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle.as he puts it,s ociety would consider it reasonable to bring personal items along on such a lengthy car ride and recognize that this long of a trip would give rise to some expectation of privacy on the part of a passenger within the vehicle.
we are skeptical about the continued relevance of the type of duration argument that symonevich makes since we decided lochan,the supreme court has developed extensive case law on the automobile exception,circumscribing the amount of privacy one can expect in a vehicle and further differentiating searches of automobiles from searches of homes.compare,new york class,d one has a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle because its function is transportation and it seldom serves as one residence or as the repository of personal effects.a car has little capacity for escaping public scrutiny.it travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its contents are in plain view.quoting cardwell lewis,d plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted,and hilaire city of laconia,cir fourth amendment law recognizes a distinction between a person home and a person car.for example,the fourth amendment permits a slightly broader search pursuant to the arrest of the occupant of a vehicle and some warrantless searches of vehicles are permitted even if there are not emergency circumstances,with carter,at kennedy,concurring the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their houses,and it is beyond dispute that the home is entitled to special protection as the center of the private lives of our people.alteration in original quoting const.amend.iv.thus,any analogy between an automobile and a house is suspect.in any event,without categorically rejecting the relevance of the duration of a trip in an automobile to the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis,we conclude that the duration of the trip here,under all of the circumstances,did nothing to enhance symonevich expectation of privacy.
symonevich also argues that he had a possessory interest in the can of,and that this possessory interest established his reasonable expectation of privacy in the space under the passenger seat.although symonevich acknowledges that he never explicitly claimed a possessory interest in the can,he says that the government imputed such possession to him when it charged him with criminal conspiracy to distribute narcotics based on the heroin found in the can.he now argues that he was entitled to the same presumption for purposes of his constitutional challenge to the search.the government contends that symonevich insufficiently asserted his possessory interest in the can,arguing that he did not submit an affidavit claiming that interest with his motion to suppress 
we need not resolve that dispute because even if symonevich had demonstrated a possessory interest in the can,that interest would not establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the space beneath the passenger seat.whether or not symonevich had a possessory interest in the can,he placed the can under the seat,an area in which he had no reasonable expectation of privacy.see rawlings kentucky,d citing rakas,at.as the rawlings court noted,h ad the petitioner placed his drugs in plain view,he would still have owned them,but he could not claim any legitimate expectation of privacy.id.at.here,too,the petitioner may have owned the can of tire sealant that contained the drugs.as a passenger in the vehicle,however,he lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the space beneath the car seat for the reasons already discussed.symonevich alleged possessory interest does not strengthen his expectation of privacy argument.
in summary,we agree with the district court that,as a passenger in the subaru,symonevich did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the space below the passenger seat from which the heroin was recovered.we affirm the district court denial of his motion to suppress on that basis.
evidentiary challenges 
symonevich argues that the district court erred by admitting two types of evidence at trial special agent murray archambault opinion testimony that symonevich was a distributor,and summary charts of intercepted phone calls and information conveyed therein we review a district court evidentiary determinations,including its decision to admit certain testimony,for abuse of discretion.united states rodríguez vélez,cir.
special agent archambault distributor testimony 
during a colloquy,the government stated that it was content to proceed without expert testimony per se,and the court noted that the government had noticed no experts.nevertheless,symonevich argues that the government presented,and the district court admitted,expert testimony from archambault,who stated a number of times that in his opinion,based on the quantity of drugs symonevich purchased,symonevich was a drug distributor,not a mere consumer.symonevich alleges that the admission of that expert testimony was an abuse of discretion.see united states valdivia,cir lipez,concurring.
we bypass that issue.even assuming that it was an abuse of discretion,the error was harmless given the abundance of additional evidence,discussed below,that supported the jury conclusion that symonevich participated in the charged conspiracy to distribute drugs 
charts summarizing data from intercepted calls 
government witness kristina,an internal revenue service agent,testified about the data that she collected from the more than intercepted calls.the page spreadsheet containing the call data was admitted into evidence.of the deals arranged during those calls by different individuals,testified that symonevich made the second largest individual purchase of heroin.to summarize information contained in the extensive data spreadsheets,the government presented a chart showing the average amount of heroin purchased by each of the individuals exhibit,and a chart showing how symonevich individual purchases compared to the average purchase arranged during intercepted calls exhibit.
in arguing that the district court abused its discretion by admitting these charts,symonevich claims that information about the size of his purchases compared to other individuals purchases was utterly immaterial to the issues in the case and was used only to buttress archambault testimony.he further argues that the charts probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice here the danger was one of unfair subtle persuasion the charts create a subtle bias.the working assumption is that a large buyer must have been a distributor.see.
rule states that a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.evidence,however,is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it is harmful to the defendant.indeed,if the evidence did not prejudice symonevich in some way,it would not be relevant to the case.for purposes of rule,unfair prejudice occurs where there is an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,commonly,though not necessarily,an emotional one.advisory committee note.
only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.fitzgerald expressway sewerage,cir quoting freeman package mach,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the circumstances here are not compelling.the relevance and probative value of evidence demonstrating the size of symonevich purchases relative to ariel soto other customers purchases are apparent.the evidence may have appropriately informed the jurors understanding of the nature of the relationship between symonevich and ariel soto and whether the drugs were intended for personal consumption or redistribution,both critical components of the government conspiracy case.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of this testimony was not substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.
sufficiency of the evidence 
having determined the scope of the record for the purpose of the sufficiency analysis,we now consider whether there was sufficient evidence to prove that symonevich joined the charged conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute narcotics.we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,considering both direct and circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.rodríguez vélez,at.a reversal is warranted only where no rational factfinder could have concluded that the evidence presented at trial,together with all reasonable inferences,established each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
to prove a conspiracy to distribute narcotics,the government must show that a conspiracy existed,the defendant knew of the conspiracy,and the defendant voluntarily participated in it.id.symonevich purchased grams of heroin in a period for approximately.his gram purchase on november was the second largest individual sale of heroin of the more than one thousand deals recorded on the wiretap.the average size of symonevich purchase across three purchases was grams of heroin.the average for all the deals recorded between august and january was grams.
each of the deals that symonevich arranged with ariel soto followed a familiar pattern and was arranged quickly.ariel soto would direct symonevich where to meet with a courier.symonevich then traveled from maine to purchase drugs in massachusetts within hours of calling ariel soto.other evidence showed that symonevich made orders using the conspiracy code,understood the structure of the organization,and cooperated with ariel soto to avoid police detection.
the jury could have inferred from this evidence that ariel soto and symonevich shared more than a relationship involving personal use or redistribution of the drugs by symonevich independent of the duran gomez organization.further,from symonevich willingness to contact ariel soto a month after symonevich arrest,the jury could have concluded that the two had a relationship based on trust and familiarity.moreover,from the fact that symonevich always introduced himself as dale man from maine,the jury could have inferred that symonevich and ariel soto were connected by a third party known to ariel soto as part of the redistribution network.
while we have stated that proof of redistribution may not necessarily prove a conspiracy,it may be sufficient in some circumstances 
the use of conspiracy doctrine in a vertical context has caused courts unease.in this circuit the continuing purchase and sale relationship between the dealers and the defendant,and the dealers knowledge of the defendant,would permit a jury to infer both an agreement between them that the defendant possess the drugs and the requisite intent as to distribution.
united states boidi,cir.the foregoing evidence,together with all reasonable inferences,was sufficient for a rational jury to conclude that each element of the conspiracy to distribute its existence,symonevich knowledge of it,and his voluntary participation in it had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
