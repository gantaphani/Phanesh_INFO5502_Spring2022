opinion of the court 
in this appeal we consider the legality of a warrantless search incident to arrest in light of the supreme court decision in arizona gant.
on may,a pennsylvania state magistrate judge issued an arrest warrant for naim nafis shakir,who police believed was involved in an armed robbery of a pnc bank a month earlier.the warrant was promptly entered into the database of the national crime information center and came to the attention of federal bureau of investigation agents in pennsylvania.because those agents believed shakir had gambling ties to atlantic city,new jersey,they enlisted the help of fbi special agent joseph furey in new jersey.
the following day,special agent furey learned that shakir had recently stayed in the trump plaza hotel and casino.in response,furey asked atlantic city police detective david smith,who was assigned to an fbi task force,to investigate the lead.detective smith visited the trump plaza and was informed that not only had shakir been gambling at the casino the previous day,but he was expected to check into the hotel at that afternoon.since it was already around,smith immediately notified special agent furey,who began to organize a team to arrest shakir upon his appearance at the hotel.before the arrest team arrived,however,security spotted shakir entering the hotel.when he learned this,smith asked special agent furey to expedite his arrival to effectuate the arrest.smith also called the atlantic city police to request a squad car.smith then proceeded to the lobby with two hotel security personnel all three were dressed in plainclothes.
soon after he entered the lobby,detective smith spotted shakir standing at the end of the line some feet away,holding a gym bag.as smith drew closer to shakir,he heard a man about feet away yell shit,which smith took as a warning to shakir.although shakir turned as if to respond,he simply maintained eye contact with the shouter.meanwhile,detective smith asked the hotel security agents,both of whom were unarmed,to detain shakir apparent confederate while smith hurried over to shakir,grabbed his arm,and placed him under arrest.shakir complied and dropped his bag on the floor at his feet.
detective smith immediately patted down shakir and found no weapons on his person.smith attempted to handcuff shakir,but was unable to do so because of shakir girth.indeed,shakir advised smith that police usually use three sets of handcuffs.shakir was polite and compliant during the arrest,and after the initial excitement,the arrest was very low key.there were approximately people in the hotel lobby during and following the arrest.
within five minutes of shakir initial arrest,two armed police officers arrived with handcuffs which smith used to restrain shakir.while the other officers held shakir by the arms,smith bent down to investigate the contents of the bag at shakir feet.therein smith found clothes and a large amount of cash,but no weapons.some of the cash in the bag was later identified as having been stolen during an armed robbery of the belco credit union in lancaster,pennsylvania on may,not from the pnc bank robbery that prompted the warrant for shakir arrest.
shakir was indicted on one count of armed robbery of the belco credit union in violation of d and.prior to trial,shakir filed a motion to suppress evidence,claiming detective smith search of his gym bag violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches.after the district court denied the motion,shakir proceeded to trial and was convicted by a jury.
the district court had jurisdiction under and we have jurisdiction under.we review the district court factual findings for clear error,and we exercise plenary review over its application of law to those facts.united states bond,cir.
shakir sole argument on appeal is that the cash found by police was inadmissible at trial because it was the fruit of an illegal search.the government counters that it conducted a legal search incident to arrest.under this exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment,w hen an arrest is made,it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape.chimel california.the permissible scope of a search incident to arrest includes the arrestee person and the area within his immediate control construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.id.at.
the crux of shakir appeal is that because he was already handcuffed at the time detective smith searched his bag,he had no access to any weapon or destructible evidence that might have been in the bag.the government responds by citing several appellate decisions upholding searches incident to arrest conducted after the suspect was handcuffed.see,virgin islands rasool,cir united states horne,cir united states nohara,cir united states helmstetter,cir united states mitchell,cir united states.these decisions followed a general trend among the courts of appeals,following the supreme court decision in new york belton,toward a rule that although the search is limited to the area under the defendant control at the time of his arrest,the fact that it is no longer under his control at the time of the search does not invalidate the search.united states tejada,cir see also,at i f the courts were to focus exclusively upon the moment of the search,we might create a perverse incentive for an arresting officer to prolong the period during which the arrestee is kept in an area where he could pose a danger to the officer.united states mclaughlin,cir united states currance,cir o fficers may separate the suspect from the item to be searched,thereby alleviating their safety concerns,before they conduct the search.citation,quotation marks and alteration omitted.
like the district court decision denying shakir motion to suppress,however,the cases upon which the government relies all predated the supreme court decision in arizona gant,which narrowed the scope of the doctrine.in gant the supreme court held that officers could not search an arrestee car after he had been removed from the vehicle and secured,noting that t o read belton as authorizing a vehicle search incident to every recent occupant arrest would thus untether the rule from the justifications,officer safety and preventing the destruction of evidence underlying the chimel exception.gant.at.accordingly,the gant court concluded that searches of a suspect automobile are not permitted incident to an arrest when the police could not reasonably have believed that the arrestee could have accessed his car at the time of the search.id.
because gant involved an automobile search,and because it interpreted belton,another automobile case,the government contends that the rule of gant applies only to vehicle searches.we do not read gant so narrowly.the gant court itself expressly stated its desire to keep the rule of belton tethered to the justifications underlying the chimel exception,and chimel did not involve a car search.moreover,as we noted above,many courts of appeals perceived belton to establish a relaxed rule for searches incident to arrest in all contexts.see,tejada,at applying belton to search of a cabinet in a home,f d at applying belton to an apartment search.because gant foreclosed such a relaxed reading of belton,there is no plausible reason why it should be held to do so only with respect to automobile searches,rather than in any situation where the item searched is removed from the suspect control between the time of the arrest and the time of the search.although this court has never explicitly adopted a time of the arrest rule like that adopted in the aforementioned cases,we do read gant as refocusing our attention on a suspect ability or inability to access weapons or destroy evidence at the time a search incident to arrest is conducted.
it is in this vein that shakir points to our decision in united states myers,cir,which we regard as being consistent with gant despite predating it.in myers,a single policeman responded to
