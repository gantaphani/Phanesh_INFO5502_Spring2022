brian bailey was one of seven jailers charged with federal offenses arising from five incidents at the nashua street jail in boston,massachusetts,where guards employed excessive force against pretrial detainees and then acted to conceal their misconduct.the grand jury superseding indictment charged all seven defendants with conspiracy to deprive pretrial detainees of their civil rights in violation of the global conspiracy charge.bailey was also charged with assaulting and aiding and abetting the assault of a pretrial detainee,see conspiring to obstruct and obstructing a federal criminal investigation,see b the witness tampering statute and perjury for lying to a federal grand jury,see.
three of the defendants pleaded guilty to the global conspiracy charge and to their individual substantive charges,and the trial of the fourth defendant was severed.bailey and the other two remaining defendants were tried together.bailey two were acquitted on all counts.bailey was acquitted of the global conspiracy charge,but was convicted of the other charges and sentenced to months in prison.he now appeals his convictions and sentence.
the following facts are either uncontested,or,if contested,are presented in the light most favorable to the verdicts.see united states mccann,cir.
boston nashua street jail,operated by the suffolk county sheriff department,houses pretrial detainees.on september,officer bailey and officer michael ross were assigned to work in the jail psychiatric unit.on that day,the psychiatric unit housed a pretrial detainee who was on suicide watch.in accordance with jail policy,the detainee was stripped of his clothes and denied sheets and blankets to prevent their use in a suicide attempt.his only covering was a paper johnny.
during the course of the afternoon,the detainee complained repeatedly that his cell was cold and that he needed a blanket.when ross denied his request,the detainee began screaming,swearing,and punching and kicking his cell door.he persisted in this behavior for approximately three hours.at about,bailey told ross that he had had enough of the detainee and that he was going to bang him out.ross replied that they should wait until later that evening.
bailey left the unit for dinner at about.while at dinner,he saw officer paul davis,a member of the sheriff emergency response team.the team is summoned to jail emergencies by way of an electronic alarm that all officers carry.bailey informed davis that he was having a problem with an inmate and that davis might hear his alarm go off later that night.
when bailey returned from dinner,he and ross discussed entering the detainee cell to slap him around.since ross and bailey were not ordinarily authorized to enter a detainee cell without permission from a superior,they fabricated a story to justify their actions.they initially agreed to report that the detainee had made a mess in his cell,that they had entered the cell to clean it,and that they were attacked upon entry.
at,officer brian murphy arrived at the psychiatric unit to relieve ross so that the latter could go to dinner.ross notified murphy of the plan to enter the detainee cell.murphy replied that he wanted no part of it and that they had better write a good report.undeterred,ross and bailey put on gloves and entered the detainee cell.ross approached the detainee and yelled at him to be quiet.when the detainee refused,ross slapped his face several times and then delivered multiple knee strikes,driving his knee into the victim thigh.bailey joined the attack by punching the detainee several times in the ribs and shoulder.as he was being struck,the detainee cried and complained of back pain.the detainee was then pushed down onto his bed,and bailey and ross attempted to handcuff him.at no point during the altercation did the detainee assault the officers or make any threatening gestures.he did not fight back other than to resist the handcuffing.
bailey alarm was activated at some point during the melee.the emergency response team,including davis and deputy anthony nuzzo,arrived shortly thereafter.they placed handcuffs on the detainee and strapped him in a restraint chair.while secured in the chair,the detainee cried and complained of back pain.bailey informed ross later that night that he had slapped the detainee while he was restrained in the chair.bailey also bragged to davis that he and ross had beat the fuck out of the detainee.
shortly after the incident,bailey consulted with nuzzo,who told him that the story about entering the detainee cell to clean up a mess was not adequate cover for the beating.nuzzo advised bailey to report that he and ross had entered the detainee cell because of an apparent medical emergency,only to be attacked upon their entrance.after further discussion,bailey and ross decided to go with this revised medical emergency fabrication in their incident reports.they stood by this story when subsequently questioned by sheriff department investigators who were conducting an internal inquiry.relying in part on what they were told by bailey and ross,the investigators filed a report concluding that the officers had acted appropriately.this report,containing the false statements,was subsequently obtained by the fbi in connection with an investigation of a separate incident of excessive force at the nashua street jail.
in october,bailey was summoned to testify before a federal grand jury about the september,incident.he testified that he had entered the detainee cell because he thought the detainee was having a seizure,that the detainee jumped up and attacked him,and that no one struck the detainee during the incident.at trial,however,bailey admitted that he had intentionally lied to the grand jury in an effort to protect himself and ross.
obstruction of justice 
as set forth above,bailey was convicted of violating and conspiring to violate the federal witness tampering statute by knowingly engaging in misleading conduct with the intent to prevent the communication of information concerning the commission of a federal crime to a federal law enforcement officer.see b.bailey argues that the prosecution failed to prove the intent element of this crime,and that the jury was improperly instructed on this point.underlying bailey argument is the premise,rejected by the district court,that the intent required by the statute can not be found when there was no federal investigation extant or imminent at the time of the alleged misleading conduct 
bailey interpretation of b is not consistent with its plain language,which reads 
whoever knowingly uses intimidation,threatens,or corruptly persuades another person,or attempts to do so,or engages in misleading conduct toward another person,with intent to hinder,delay,or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
b.nothing in this provision implies that a federal investigation must be imminent or underway at the time of the actus reus.to the contrary,and as several circuits have recognized,the statutory language suggests that congress intended b not merely to safeguard the integrity of ongoing or imminent federal investigations,but more broadly to facilitate federal law enforcement ability to gather information about possible federal federal crimes that are not yet under investigation at the time of the offense.see,united states guadalupe,cir p roving a violation of b does not depend on the existence or imminency of a federal investigation but rather on the possible existence of a federal crime and a defendant intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime by officials who happen to be federal.united states perry,cir finding a violation of b where the defendant provided false information to local police intending to prevent the initiation of a federal investigation into his status as a felon in possession of a firearm,cert.denied,d united states veal,cir by its wording,b does not depend on the existence or imminency of a federal case or investigation but rather on the possible existence of a federal crime and a defendant intention to thwart an inquiry into that crime.accordingly,we reject bailey argument that b requires an existing or imminent federal investigation at the time of the defendant misleading conduct.
in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledge bailey argument that f supports reading a requirement into b.section f provides that,for purposes of certain provisions of the obstruction of justice statute,an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.bailey would have us draw a negative inference from congress explicit statement that an official proceeding need not be underway or,that congress contemplated that a federal investigation,contrary to an official proceeding,must be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.
such a negative inference is not warranted.for one thing,f does not apply to b because b does not require that the proscribed conduct occur in the context of an official proceeding.see veal,at.and even if f did apply,its application would support our ruling because the federal grand jury investigation to which bailey misstatements eventually led which,per f,need not have been underway or imminent at the time of the offense constitutes an official proceeding within the meaning of f.see a a defining an official proceeding for purposes of f as,among other things,a proceeding before a federal grand jury united states frankhauser,cir both a federal trial and a federal grand jury investigation are official proceedings within the meaning of the statute.
before concluding,we also acknowledge bailey argument that a failure to read a requirement into b raises due process and ex post facto concerns because it leaves open the possibility of a prosecution for conduct that no defendant could have understood to constitute a federal offense at the time of its commission.we do not see how this is so.section b requires that the misleading conduct affect the communication of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense.therefore,the statute applies only to obstructive behavior that the defendant knows could impede an investigation into conduct that could constitute a federal crime at the time of its commission here there can be no claim that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statute to bailey,whom the jury reasonably found was aware of the conduct giving rise to the eventual federal civil rights charges at the time he misled the sheriff department investigators.
aiding and abetting 
the prosecution presented two theories for conviction on the substantive civil rights charge that bailey was a principal,or,alternatively,that he aided and abetted ross in the assault.bailey argues that the jury instruction on aiding and abetting was erroneous.because the verdict form does not specify the theory under which the jury found bailey guilty,and because bailey claim is one of legal error rather than sufficiency of the evidence,the availability of an alternate theory of conviction would not save the jury verdict.see griffin united states,d jurors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them is contrary to law.united states boots,cir general verdict that may have been grounded on legally erroneous theory requires setting aside verdict on all grounds.we thus assume arguendo that the guilty verdict was grounded on the challenged theory.
bailey raises two issues regarding the instructions.primarily,he contends that the jury was wrongly instructed to find him guilty if it found that he failed to act when he had a legal obligation to do so,because,he says,an affirmative act must be proved.alternatively,he argues that it was not appropriate to give a instruction in this case because the prosecution presented no evidence or argument that bailey had a legal obligation to act.because bailey failed to object to the instructions with the requisite specificity,see.d,our review is only for plain error,see.b united states olano,d.a defendant alleging plain error must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.
bailey has fallen well short of meeting the demanding test.the district court provided the jury with a instruction.within this comprehensive instruction,the court stated 
in order to aid and abet another to commit a crime,a defendant must willfully and knowingly have associated himself in some way with the crime,and willfully and knowingly have sought by some act to help make the crime succeed.participation in a crime is willful if action is taken voluntarily and intentionally,or,in the case of a failure to act,with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done.
emphasis added.bailey argues that the instruction misstates the law to the extent that it countenances criminal liability for a failure to act.he cites a number of cases for the proposition that an aider and abettor must have affirmatively participated in the crime.see,united states martin,cir united states indelicato,cir.
but the government did not allege that bailey merely stood by while his partner attacked the detainee.rather,the government theory,elucidated in closing argument,was that bailey struck the detainee himself,or,at a minimum,that he actively participated in his partner assault by g oing into a locked cell for no legitimate reason,knowing that force was going to be used and then assisting ross,whether by holding the detainee down or really just emboldening ross by preventing the inmate from defending himself.
because the government did not proceed on a theory,the court instruction on that point was extraneous.but it is highly unlikely that this extraneous reference,when read in the context of an otherwise correct instruction,misled the jury to believe that it could convict bailey simply for failing to intervene in the attack.see jones united states,d jury instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.this is especially so given the clarifying instruction that immediately followed the passage to which bailey objects 
the mere presence of a defendant where a crime is being committed,even coupled with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being committed,or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the criminal conduct of others,is not sufficient to establish aiding and abetting.an aider and abettor must have some interest in the criminal venture.
this instruction properly safeguarded against any misapplication of the instruction.see id.holding that instructions that may appear problematic when read in isolation can be cured when read in conjunction with other instructions 
bodily injury 
bailey next contends that the prosecution failed to introduce evidence sufficient to permit a rational jury finding of bodily injury for the purposes of his felony conviction under.in determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict,we review the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and then ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states henderson,cir quoting united states woodward,cir.
a felony conviction under requires proof that the defendant willfully subject ed a person to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured or protected by the constitution or laws of the united states,if bodily injury results from such deprivation.although the statute does not define bodily injury,the term is defined identically in four other provisions of title.see f h a d all defining bodily injury as a a cut,abrasion,bruise,burn,or disfigurement b physical pain c illness d impairment of function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or e any other injury to the body,no matter how temporary.the eleventh circuit has applied this definition in cases.see united states myers,cir noting that w hen congress uses,but does no
