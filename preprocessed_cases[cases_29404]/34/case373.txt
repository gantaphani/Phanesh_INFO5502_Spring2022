in this direct criminal appeal,sean bucci challenges his sixteen convictions for drug trafficking,money laundering and tax evasion,his resulting prison sentence,and a forfeiture order.having jurisdiction under a and,we affirm.
background 
the evidence presented at trial established that bucci anthony belmonte sold bucci approximately to pounds of marijuana eight or nine times each year,over the course of three and years.following a investigation,the united states charged bucci with sixteen counts of drug trafficking,money laundering and tax evasion.at trial,bucci acknowledged that he was a marijuana dealer,but disputed the amount of marijuana with which he was charged.the jury found bucci guilty on all sixteen charges and specifically found that the charged conspiracy involved over kilograms of marijuana.the jury also returned several special forfeiture verdicts against bucci the district court then sentenced bucci to months in prison.
ii.discussion 
challenges to the.vindictive prosecution 
the united states initially indicted bucci,along with belmonte and another,darren martin,on two charges conspiring to possess at least kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of and possessing at least kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and b b vii.the indictment also charged that any of bucci property that represented proceeds from his offenses was forfeitable under.
a year later,in august,bucci started a website,where individuals could post information about government informants.six months after bucci started this website,the government,on february,filed a superseding indictment which charged only bucci and martin with the same two counts,but increased the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged conspiracy from to at least kilograms.the increased amount of marijuana charged raised the statutory mandatory minimum sentence bucci faced for the conspiracy offense,if convicted,from five to ten years.see b a vii.
a year after bucci started,the government,on july,filed a second superseding indictment charging bucci with the same two offenses,but adding fourteen additional counts involving money laundering,tax evasion,and unlawfully structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements.the second superseding indictment also added bucci mother,catherine bucci,as a.
bucci claims that the government decision to file the two superseding indictments in his increased the number of charges against him from two to sixteen and the amount of marijuana charged in the alleged conspiracy from to at least to vindictive prosecution intended to punish him for exercising his first amendment right to operate his website,bucci sought to prove vindictive prosecution by demonstrating circumstances establishing a likelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to create a presumption that the prosecution was,in fact,acting vindictively.see united states jenkins,cir,cert.denied,d.it is difficult to make such a showing pretrial,however,in light of the broad discretion afforded the prosecutor to determine who should be prosecuted and for what crime,and the presumption that the prosecutor has exercised that discretion in good faith see united states goodwin,d united states armstrong,d discussing presumption in context of claim.
in our system,so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute,the decision whether or not to prosecute,and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury,generally rests entirely in the prosecutor discretion.within the limits set by the legislature constitutionally valid definition of chargeable offenses,the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation so long as the selection was not deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race,religion,or other arbitrary classification.

denial of bucci discovery request 
in the district court,bucci sought discovery from the government in order to support his claim.the district court denied that request.we review that decision for an abuse of discretion.see united states lewis,cir reviewing claim.
applicable standard 
in light of the presumption that a prosecutor has acted in good faith in exercising his discretion to make charging decisions,courts require a defendant seeking discovery first to come forth with some objective evidence tending to show the existence of prosecutorial vindictiveness.see,united states wilson,cir united states sanders,cir.these courts derive this standard from united states armstrong,see at,in which the supreme court addressed discovery sought in support of a claim.see wilson,at sanders,at.this is the standard that the district court applied in bucci case,and we adopt it here.
ii.whether bucci made such a showing here 
in order to obtain discovery,then,bucci first had to advance some evidence tending to establish his claim.he failed to do so.
in support of his discovery motion,bucci relied on the statements of law enforcement and government officers reporting contained in newspaper articles,documents,and security reports.while the reported statements of these officers expressed serious concern about the danger to informants posed by postings made on bucci website,bucci set forth no evidence suggesting that this concern ever affected the prosecutors making the specific charging decisions in his case.to obtain discovery,bucci must do more than simply identify a potential motive for prosecutorial animus.sanders,at.he must connect any vindictive animus to those making the challenged charging decisions in his case.see united states goulding,cir.
bucci also relied on evidence regarding the government opposition to a pretrial motion bucci,catherine bucci,filed in this case seeking early disclosure of statements made by government witnesses.in opposing that request,the government noted that,while it generally would not oppose early disclosure,in this case it would not agree to it because of the government concern that bucci was trying to intimidate government witnesses through.in opposing catherine bucci motion,however,the government was only asserting a legitimate litigation strategy.the fact that it was based in part on the effects the information posted on bucci website might have on this specific prosecution did not suggest that prosecutors filed the superseding indictments against bucci to retaliate against him for operating the website.see united states segal,cir a prosecutor can not be said to act vindictively by taking into account a defendant perceived efforts to intimidate witnesses.
in support of his discovery request,bucci further relied on the general circumstances attendant to his prosecution,asserting that the prosecutor all along had enough evidence to charge him with the added offenses and increased amount of marijuana,but did not bring those charges until after bucci started.assuming that the government had enough evidence to indict bucci initially on the increased charges,this fact alone is insufficient to establish that the government later filed the superseding indictments to punish bucci for.see united states roach,cir rejecting argument that the fact that the government could have brought charges initially,but did not do so,indicated the prosecutor vindictiveness,cert.denied,d.
moreover,evidence of suspicious timing alone does not indicate prosecutorial animus.united states cooper,cir quotations omitted.in any event,the district court noted that the sequence of events in this case is not so remarkable as to justify discovery.we agree.bucci began operating his website in august.it was six months later that the government filed the first superseding indictment,and another six months before the government filed the second superseding indictment against bucci.these superseding indictments were not so close in time to bucci starting the website to provide strong evidence that the prosecutor acted vindictively.see united states marrapese,cir noting two events that were well removed in time were not strong evidence of actual vindictiveness.
for all of these reasons,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying bucci discovery in support of his claim.
denial of motion to dismiss indictment 
despite not being able to conduct discovery,bucci nevertheless moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment,asserting that it was the result of vindictive prosecution.the district court denied bucci motion.we review that decision for an abuse of discretion.see united states poole,cir.but in applying this deferential standard,we review any ancillary factual findings for clear error and relevant legal determinations de novo.see united states,cir.we agree with the government that the subsidiary question presented here,whether bucci established a presumption of vindictiveness,is a legal determination that we should review de novo.see united states barner,cir wilson,at.
bucci argues that he presented evidence to the district court sufficient to establish a presumption of vindictiveness and shift the burden to the prosecution to show it had legitimate reasons for increasing the charges against him.we reject that argument,for the same reasons discussed above.
denial of motion to dismiss count as 
bucci moved for the dismissal of the second superseding indictment fifth count,arguing that it was.because the pertinent facts are undisputed,this court reviews de novo the district court decision to deny that motion.see united states deleon,cir.
the relevant statute of limitations,a,provides that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,no person shall be prosecuted,tried,or punished for any offense,not capital,unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.ordinarily the limitation period begins to run when the crime is complete,see toussie united states,d,and the parties do not argue otherwise here.
the fifth count of the second superseding indictment charged that bucci,
o n or about july,did knowingly and intentionally engage in a monetary transaction in property derived from specified unlawful wit the deposit of approximately into his checking account at first massachusetts bank with proceeds derived from the sale of controlled substances.
all in violation of title,united states code,section 
the government filed the second superseding indictment on july,exactly five years to the day after the charged offense.but the parties agree that bucci actually submitted the deposit at issue to the bank after on july.the bank did not credit that deposit to bucci account until the next business day,july.the question presented in this case,then,is when was this charged offense complete when bucci submitted the deposit on july or when the bank credited bucci account on july.the parties do not cite,and we have not found,any authority addressing this exact question.
in resolving this question,we look to the relevant language of a.the statute proscribes knowingly engaging in a monetary transaction.the transaction at issue here was the deposit of funds.pursuant to the express terms of the bank policy,of which the bank informed bucci,a submission of funds to the bank after would not be deposited into the depositor account until the following business day.thus,bucci did not engage in this monetary transaction until july,and the indictment charging this offense was,therefore,timely filed.
fourth amendment issues 
bucci claims that law enforcement officials violated the fourth amendment by conducting almost constant surveillance of his home using a video camera and stopping his vehicle without probable cause.the district court denied bucci motion to suppress asserted on these grounds.in considering the district court decision to deny a suppression motion,this court reviews legal questions de novo and any factual findings for clear error.see united states mcmullin,cir,petition for cert.filed.
video surveillance of bucci residence 
law enforcement authorities installed a video camera on a utility pole across the street from bucci home and conducted surveillance of the front of his house for eight months.the camera was placed in a fixed location that enabled agents to monitor activity on the driveway and afforded agents a view of the garage door and inside the garage when the door was open.the video camera had no remote capabilities that allowed agents to either change the view or magnification of the camera without being physically at the scene.
before a court can address the merits of a motion to suppress,see united states,cir,petition for cert filed,may,the defendant must first establish that his own fourth amendment rights were violated by showing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched see united states rheault,cir,petition for cert.filed,june.to establish such an expectation of privacy,bucci must show that he has exhibited an actual,subjective expectation of privacy in the area searched and such subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.id.citing smith maryland,d.
bucci has failed to establish either a subjective or an objective expectation of privacy in the front of his home,as viewed by the camera.we focus here only on the lack of a reasonable objective expectation of privacy because this failure is so clear.see united states,cir,cert.denied,d.there are no fences,gates or shrubbery located in front of bucci residence that obstruct the view of the driveway or the garage from the street.both are plainly visible.an individual does not have an expectation of privacy in items or places he exposes to the public.see katz united states,d t he fourth amendment protects people,not places.what a person knowingly exposes to the public,even in his own home or office,is not a subject of fourth amendment protection.see also california ciraolo,d.that legal principle is dispositive here.see kyllo united states,d noting lawfulness of unenhanced visual surveillance of a home.
search of bucci vehicle on june,
bucci also moved to suppress over three hundred pounds of marijuana that officers found in bucci vehicle when they pulled him over on june,alleging the officers did not have probable cause to stop him at that time.if there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity,officers may,without a warrant,search any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.arizona gant,d.to prove the applicability of this exception to the warrant requirement,united states dickerson,cir,cert denied,d,the government must demonstrate that law enforcement officers had a belief,reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer,that the vehicle contained that which by law is subject to seizure,united states lopez,cir quotation,alterations omitted.whether a particular set of facts rises to the level of probable cause is a legal determination that this court reviews de novo.see united states rodrigue,cir.
here,at the time officers stopped and searched bucci vehicle,they knew the following a confidential informant told officers that bucci was involved in marijuana trafficking.over the next eight months,officers themselves observed what appeared to be deliveries being made to bucci home through vehicles driven into his garage and unloaded out of public view.after these deliveries,officers would find empty boxes and bags in bucci garbage which contained marijuana residue.soon thereafter,a number of individuals would come to bucci home,take other boxes or bags from the house,and depart in short order.
on june,the confidential informant told agents that bucci might have recently received a shipment of marijuana.
on the morning of june,the pole camera showed bucci and another identified as defendant eight large cardboard boxes similar to the size and construction to those seized during the garbage searches into the garage of bucci residence.once the boxes were in the garage,the door was closed,and bucci and belmonte remained inside the residence for approximately two hours 
belmonte and bucci eventually emerged from the garage carrying a box which appeared to
