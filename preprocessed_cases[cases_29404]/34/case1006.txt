over sixty years ago,the supreme court established the test for whether a given financial instrument or transaction constitutes an investment contract and,therefore,a purposes of the federal securities laws.sec howey.we write today to underscore that,in applying the howey factors,courts can and should look beyond the formal terms of a relationship to the reality of the parties positions to evaluate whether the reasonable expectation was one of significant investor control.sec prods,cir.
appellants dickau and silverstein were two of individuals indicted for criminal fraud for their role in marketing investment interests in film companies.following a jury trial,they were each convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and mail fraud.on appeal,they challenge their convictions,claiming,inter alia,that insufficient evidence supported the determination that the interests at issue were securities and that the district court erred in including a no ultimate harm charge in the jury instructions.in addition,they challenge their sentences on the ground that the district court erred in measuring the loss amount as the entire cost of the total shares that defendants sold.we find the various objections to the conviction to be without merit.we agree with appellants,however,that the district court erred in its determination of the loss amount and therefore remand the cases for resentencing.
background 
appellants paul dickau and nanci silverstein each operated an independent sales office iso selling interests in companies formed to finance the production and distribution of motion pictures.dickau iso sold interests in little giant,llc,an entity created to produce the film carlo wake both appellants isos sold interests in heritage film group,llc,which was established to produce the film the amati girls.as their names suggest,little giant and heritage are limited liability companies llcs,and the interests in the companies took the form of investment units,priced at each.
the isos solicited investments in little giant and heritage over the phone,calling potential investors to generate interest in the film projects.the film promoters would then mail potential investors offering materials,including a brochure,operating agreement,subscription agreement,risk disclosure sheet,and instruction sheet.if the potential investor decided to participate in the investment,he or she would send the subscription agreement,along with a check,directly to the film promoters.
when an iso succeeded in selling an interest in little giant or heritage,it would receive a commission.dickau company received a and commission on sales of little giant and heritage units,respectively.silverstein company received a commission on sales of heritage units.the offering memoranda did not reflect these hefty commission rates.read liberally,the offering materials might be said to indicate that no more than of the unit price would go toward sales commissions 
dickau company sold a combined total of worth of little giant and heritage units and retained in commissions.silverstein company sold in interests in heritage,pocketing in commissions.
the government charged dickau with four counts one count of conspiracy to commit securities and mail fraud in relation to each of little giant and heritage,see,and one count of securities fraud in relation to each of little giant and heritage,see.the government charged silverstein with one conspiracy count and one fraud count in relation to heritage.all counts centered around the failure to disclose accurately the sales commission that the isos would be taking on the investment units.following a trial in the eastern district of new york,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts against dickau and silverstein.judge wexler sentenced dickau to months imprisonment and ordered him to pay in restitution.judge wexler sentenced silverstein to six months imprisonment,ordering her to pay in restitution.
discussion 
whether sufficient evidence supported the finding that the units were securities 
a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction bears a heavy burden.united states nektalov,cir.as we consider the challenge,we must view the evidence,whether direct or circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the government and credit every inference that could have been drawn in its favor.united states diaz,cir.we will reject the sufficiency challenge if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
section b of the securities exchange act of the act makes it unlawful t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device.b.section of the act creates criminal penalties for willful violations of the provisions of the act,including violations of section b.a.thus,for the convictions of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud to stand,there must be sufficient record evidence for the jury to have concluded that the interests in little giant and heritage were securities within the meaning of the act 
although federal statutes enumerate many different instruments that fit the definition of security,the parties agree that the only category that potentially applies to this case is investment contract.in the seminal case,sec howey,the supreme court provided the following definition of investment contract 
an investment contract for purposes of the securities act means a contract,transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party,it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.
id.at.appellants suggest that the little giant and heritage units can not constitute securities because investors never expected profits solely from the efforts of the promoters or others.
following the ninth circuit lead,see sec glenn turner enterprises,cir,we have held that the word solely should not be construed as a literal limitation rather,we consider whether,under all the circumstances,the scheme was being promoted primarily as an investment or as a means whereby participants could pool their own activities,their money and the promoter contribution in a meaningful way.sec prods,cir thus,in we distinguished between companies that seek the passive investor and situations where there is a reasonable expectation of significant investor control.id.at.it is the passive investor for whose benefit the securities laws were enacted where there is a reasonable expectation of significant investor control,the protection of the and acts would be unnecessary.id.
our consideration of whether the investors in little giant and heritage viewed the units primarily as a passive investment is complicated by the fact that little giant and heritage were each structured as an relatively new,hybrid vehicle that combines elements of the traditional corporation with elements of the general partnership while retaining flexibility for federal tax purposes.see generally louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation ed.although common stock is the quintessence of a security,reves ernst young,d citing landreth timber landreth,d,and n ormally,a general partnership interest is not considered a security,odom slavik,cir,because of the sheer diversity of llcs,membership interests therein resist categorical classification.thus,an interest in an llc is the sort of instrument that requires analysis into the economic realities of the underlying transaction,reves,at.
one of the original promoters of little giant and heritage,russell finnegan,testified at trial that the llcs were structured so as to minimize the possibility that the investment units would constitute securities to get into the gray areas of the securities law.indeed,were we to confine ourselves to a review of the organizational documents,we would likely conclude that the interests in little giant and heritage could not constitute securities because the documents would lead us to believe that members were expected to play an active role in the management of the companies.for example,the sheet titled summary of business opportunity heritage film group,llc explains 
each member is required to participate in the management of the company retaining one vote for each unit acquired.each important decision relating to the business of the company must be submitted to a vote of the members.
the purchase of interests in the company is not a passive investment.while specific knowledge and expertise in the day to day operation of a film producing and distributing company is not required,members should have such knowledge and experience in general business,investment financial affairs as to intelligently exercise their management and voting rights further,each member is required to participate in the management of the company by serving on one or more committees established by the members.
the summary further states that a manager may be chosen to perform certain ministerial functions,such as keeping books and records,keeping the members informed,and circulating ballots to members,but the members retain the right to replace the manager and appoint his successor upon majority vote.likewise,the operating agreement for heritage provides that the company shall be managed by the members e ach member shall have the right to act for and bind the company in the ordinary course of its business.thus,on the face of the documents,heritage and little giant appear to provide for too much investor control to allow the jury to conclude that the units were securities.
in actuality,however,the little giant and heritage members played an extremely passive role in the management and operation of the companies.at trial,members testified that they voted,at most,a couple of times.although the organizational documents provided for the formation of a number of committees,only two committees were formed for each of heritage and little financial committee and a management committee.of the investors in little giant,five served on the management committee and seven served on the financial committee.of the investors in heritage,ten served on the management committee and seven served on the financial committee.thus,the vast majority of investors in both companies did not actively participate in the venture,exercising almost no control.
record evidence allowed the jury to conclude the language in the organizational documents suggesting the start there could be no reasonable expectation of investor control,prods,at.such consideration of the reality of the transaction is consistent with the supreme court repeated instruction to prize substance over form in our evaluation of what constitutes a security.see,reves,at.in discharging our duty,we are not bound by legal formalisms,but instead take account of the economics of the transaction under investigation.tcherepnin knight,d i n searching for the meaning and scope of the word security in the act,form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality.howey,at.disregarding the legal terminology in which contracts are clothed.
for one,under the organizational documents,the members managerial rights and obligations did not accrue until the llcs were fully organized.as promoter james alex testified,interim managers initially held legal control rights,and they decided almost every significant issue prior to the completion of fundraising the script,the director,the cast,the crew,scoring of it,editing.the entire picture was pretty well preproduced thus,the jury could reasonably have found the managerial rights contained in the organizational documents were hollow and illusory.
the jury was also entitled to consider the fact that the members appear not to have negotiated any terms of the llc agreements.rather,they were presented with the subscription agreements on a basis.that they played no role in shaping the organizational agreements themselves raises doubts as to whether the members were expected to have significant control over the enterprise.
moreover,the members had no particular experience in film or entertainment and therefore would have had difficulty exercising their formal right to take over management of the companies after they were fully organized.prods,at noting that investors had no experience in selling dental products and therefore would be unlikely to feel capable of undertaking distribution themselves bailey,cir finding that investors had little to no control over the ultimate success or failure of their cattle breeding investments where they had the contractual authority to direct the breeding but no expertise in selecting embryos or.and their number and geographic dispersion left investors particularly dependent on centralized management.we echo the fifth circuit in finding that investors may be so lacking in requisite expertise,so numerous,or so dispersed that they become utterly dependent on centralized management,counteracting a legal right of control.see williamson tucker,cir what matters more than the form of an investment scheme is the economic reality that it represents.the question is whether an investor,as a result of the investment agreement itself or the factual circumstances that surround it,is left unable to exercise meaningful control over his investment.robinson glynn,cir internal citation omitted emphasis added.
in sum,upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances,we conclude that the jury could have determined that,notwithstanding the organizational documents drafted to suggest active participation by members,the defendants sought and expected passive investors for little giant and heritage,and therefore the interests that they marketed constituted securities.
ii.the jury charges 
appellants also raise a number of objections to the jury charges,only one of which merits specific objection to the inclusion of a no ultimate harm charge.the district court charged the jury as follows 
under the statutes,even false representations or statements or omissions of material facts do not amount to a fraud unless it is done with fraudulent intent.however misleading or deceptive a plan may be,it is not fraudulent if it was devised or carried out in good faith.an honest belief in the truth of the representations made by a defendant is a good defense,however inaccurate the belief may turn out to be.
in considering whether or not a defendant acted in good faith,you are instructed that a belief of a defendant,if such belief existed,that ultimately everything would work out so that no one would lose any money does not require a finding by you that he acted in good faith.no amount of honest belief on the part of a defendant that the scheme will ultimately make a profit for the investors will excuse fraudulent actions or false representations by him.
appellants claim that none of the defendants presented any indication that the ultimate outcome of their actions would differ from the immediate outcome of their actions,and therefore this charge risked confusing the jury into thinking that appellants could be guilty even if they believed their conduct lawful.see united states rossomando,cir finding no ultimate harm charge improper where defense was not that defendant thought that there would be no ultimate harm,but rather that defendant thought that there would be no harm at all.
we are of the view that there was a proper predicate for the no ultimate harm charge.the record provides evidence to support a finding that dickau and silverstein intended to deceive the investors into thinking that money would be spent on,rather than on sales commissions.insofar as dickau and silverstein intended to deprive investors of the full information they needed to make refined,discretionary judgments,they intended to harm the investors,id.at see also united states dinome,cir.in addition,at trial,both dickau and silverstein highlighted their good faith belief that the movie would be made.the focus on the completion of the movie amounted to a no ultimate harm argument even though the isos intended to deny the investors of inform
