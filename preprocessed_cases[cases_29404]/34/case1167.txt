david barroso,appeals from a conviction after a jury trial before judge scheindlin.he was found guilty of conspiring to commit securities and wire fraud,in violation of.on appeal,barroso contends that the district court i violated the hearsay rule and the confrontation clause when it admitted a statement sought by the government during the plea allocution ii erroneously charged the jury that it could find the requisite level of criminal knowledge on a conscious avoidance theory and iii admitted certain audiotapes without sufficient authentication.
although the admission of the statement from the plea allocution was error,we conclude that it was harmless.we further conclude that giving the conscious avoidance charge was proper and that the audiotapes were admissible.we therefore affirm.
background 
the evidence showed that barroso and his,marlon and frederick tropeano,conspired to defraud four customers of the brokerage firm at which they were employed.the scheme involved the use of forged documents to transfer the customers accounts to other brokerage firms without the customers knowledge.see united states barroso,d.once the transfers were made,defendants liquidated the accounts and took the proceeds.marlon and frederick tropeano pleaded guilty a few days prior to the commencement of the trial.barroso went to trial,his primary defense being that he was duped by the tropeano brothers into unknowingly facilitating their crimes.see id.at.however,there was considerable evidence that barroso active participation in the scheme was hardly innocent.he was recorded on audiotape both urgently requesting the liquidation of transferred accounts and stating to a transferee brokerage that he knew the owner of an account and had authority over that account as a result of his friendship with the owner son.that owner had no sons and had never met barroso.moreover,barroso endorsed a check drawn on a transferred account.the jury convicted barroso of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud,in violation of.
following his conviction,barroso moved for a judgment of acquittal,see,or alternatively,a new trial,see.only one of the various claims in that motion is relevant to this appeal,namely,that the district court improperly admitted a portion of marlon tropeano plea allocution.
the factual background for this claim is as follows.we quote first from the portion of marlon tropeano plea allocution relating to the factual predicates for his plea

the court i see.with whom did you agree you said you agreed with others.with whom did you agree 
the defendant marlon tropeano.
we turn now to the events at barroso trial that gave rise to the present appeal.for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment,the government initially offered the portions of marlon and frederick allocutions describing the conspiracy and each one participation in it,namely,the nearly identical paragraphs quoted above beginning i entered appellant response was,first,to request redaction of the words with others from both allocutions,and,second,to offer the additional portion of frederick statement in which frederick was asked with whom he conspired and replied,marlon tropeano.the purpose of this latter offer was to bolster barroso claim that the sole conspirators were marlon and frederick tropeano.
in response to the offer of frederick description of a seemingly limited conspiracy,the government sought the admission of the statement from marlon allocution,in which,after an explicit request by the prosecutor,marlon stated that he conspired with more than one person.in support,the government argued that the defense should not have it both ways.they should be able to argue that there were only two members of the conspiracy,offer only the portion that supports that and not allow the government to offer the portion of the allocution that supports our theory that there were more than one.the district court agreed with the government and admitted the answers to the questions posed to both tropeanos see d at.the portion of marlon allocution that was read to the jury included the prosecutor explicit request regarding the number of.
in his motion,barroso argued that marlon tropeano statement that he conspired with more than one person was inadmissible hearsay and that its admission violated his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses.the district court denied the motion,holding that both of the tropeanos allocutions qualified as statements against penal interest under.b and possessed sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness justifying their exemption from the confrontation requirement.see d at.the district court noted that it had issued a limiting instruction at trial,allowing the jury to consider the statements from both allocutions only on the issues of the existence of the conspiracy and what,if anything,marlon and frederick tropeano did in order to further the object of the conspiracy.id.at.a further instruction had informed the jury that,if it found that the conspiracy as charged in the indictment existed,it must decide as a separate question whether david barroso was a part of the alleged conspiracy or scheme.id.
the district court also noted that barroso had refused to stipulate to the existence of the conspiracy,thereby putting the government to its proof on that issue,and that the government would not have sought the introduction of marlon answer had barroso not sought the introduction of frederick.see id.at.with respect to marlon answer in particular,the district court concluded that marlon statement that he conspired with more than one
