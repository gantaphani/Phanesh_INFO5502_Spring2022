henry cole appeals his convictions for filing false tax returns in violation of and evading taxes in violation of.cole,a real estate agent and investor,agreed with several others to purchase commercial properties in the baltimore metropolitan area.without his knowledge,cole secretly negotiated with the sellers of each property to increase the purchase price.he then arranged to have the difference million in the aggregate paid to an entity only he controlled.he paid no income tax on this bounty.a jury accepted the government theory of the prosecution and rejected cole innocent version of his acts and omissions,which he vigorously supported with documentary evidence and witness testimony including his own and that of his expert accountant,among others.on appeal,cole asks us to overturn his convictions,principally on the ground that the proper tax treatment of the million was ambiguous as a matter of law,rendering proof of his willfulness a legal impossibility.he also assigns error to the district court admission of certain evidence and its denial of a continuance.we affirm.
this prosecution for tax offenses arose from cole promotion of real estate investment partnerships in connection with which he clandestinely extracted commissions that he reported on his tax returns as capital gains offset by capital losses.we summarize the facts in the light most favorably to the government theory of the case and consistent with the jury verdict.
cole was a real estate agent at the,piper flynn real estate brokerage later consolidated into coldwell banker opf.he also invested in real estate.as relevant to this case,cole partnered with three doctors to purchase five office buildings during the period to.prior to the first disputed purchase,there existed a partnership between cole and david miller.miller testified as a witness for the defense that he had long had an understanding with cole that cole,who was to serve as the property manager for any of their purchased investments,would take a profit up front on any building that he bought or sold.stanley friedler,a friend of miller,paid a premium to buy into the venture in.shortly thereafter,friedler solicited the participation of his friend,selvin passen,who invested in subsequent deals.
friedler and passen contradicted miller apparently favorable view of cole business methods.each testified for the prosecution,attesting to his understanding that the had agreed to make equal capital contributions toward the purchase of commercial properties in return for equal returns,and that cole specifically promised not to take a commission over and above the customary broker commissions paid to opf,which opf shared with cole for finding and negotiating deals.
in each of the five transactions presented at trial,after cole had negotiated a purchase price with the seller on behalf of the specific,he asked the seller to increase the price by several hundred thousand dollars ranging from to.he then arranged,with one exception,to have funds representing the agreed increase paid at closing to an entity he controlled,b n realty 
the evidence of the contemporaneous treatment of the increased payments as commissions was substantial.first,the agreed increases in the sales prices of the investments,which totaled million,were designated as commissions in the sales contracts,though several of the sellers testified that they were quite high for commissions.second,cole told carol wildesen,opf settlement attorney who oversaw the disbursement of funds generated by the transactions,and john evans,the opf partner who oversaw sales associates,that they were commissions.third,the checks wildesen issued to cole were labeled as commissions as were the descriptions appearing in certain internal opf documents.fourth,in the course of civil litigation in between friedler and passen,on the one hand,and cole on the other hand,cole stated under oath that the disputed payments were commissions.t he commission and fees received by cole were not material to passen and friedler decisions to invest in the properties as the commissions and fees were paid by the sellers,not the investors.emphasis added 
cole had attorney wildesen prepare separate settlement reports for the buyers and sellers in the subject transactions,a practice wildesen testified was unusual.the payments to b n realty cole alter ego were listed only on the sellers settlement reports.friedler and passen testified that they were wholly unaware of the secret payments to cole.indeed,friedler testified that cole urged him not to attend the settlement for the first property in which he invested.
each of the sales contracts negotiated by cole identified the buyer as henry cole assigns.nevertheless,each of the sellers testified that cole told them he was purchasing the buildings not just for himself,but also as an agent for his.the down payments were all paid with partnership funds or with checks written directly by the doctors or their spouses,and one of the buildings was financed in part by a million note personally guaranteed by cole,miller,and friedler 
in addition to the transactions summarized above,cole arranged during the tax year for passen children to buy at a discount the million note financing the third property.passen testified that cole was not to receive a commission on the purchase and sale of the note.nonetheless,the evidence at trial showed that the seller sold the note for less than cole received from passen children,and cole pocketed the difference.
in april,having learned a few months earlier of the government criminal investigation,cole filed tax returns for the years,and,reporting no taxable income for each year.he had his accountant characterize the million in payments he received in the transactions summarized above as assignment fees earned from the sale of his contractual right to make the purchases individually,and thus capital gains rather than ordinary income.in this fashion,he was able to offset completely the capital gains income in each year with losses.he entirely failed to report the he received for arranging the sale of the million note to passen children he testified at trial that he missed it due to a bookkeeping error.he did report approximately of tax each year,though by the time of trial he had never paid the taxes.
a grand jury issued a superseding indictment in september charging cole in six counts three counts for willfully filing false tax returns for tax years,and,in violation of u,and three counts for evading income taxes in the same years in violation of.the indictment charged that,inter alia,cole falsely claimed million of ordinary income as capital gains.
as mentioned above,to justify characterizing the million as capital gains,cole argued at trial that the amounts were proceeds from the assignment of the sales contracts to his.cole expert accountant,james wilhelm,testified that he believed the underlying economics of the transactions justified their treatment as assignments,though he admitted that the sale of a contract would require at minimum that the buyer knew he was purchasing the contract rights.the government,eliciting the above testimony from friedler and passen that they were unaware of the funds paid to cole,citing the commission labels used in the relevant documents,and adverting to the totality of the direct and circumstantial evidence of cole suspicious methods,argued that the payments were disguised commissions,ordinary income and not capital gains.
over cole objection,the trial court admitted into evidence three forms cole had submitted to the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf in and in order to purchase firearms.the forms asked if the applicant was an unlawful user of,or addicted to any narcotic drug,or any other controlled substance,and cole answered no on each.but,as cole stipulated at trial,he was addicted to narcotic pain medication at the time he purchased the se firearms,and prior to the purchase of the firearms,he had to a hospital for drug addiction and was subsequently for drug addiction treatment between and.the government also proffered evidence that cole plead guilty in to possessing those firearms while an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance in violation of g,but the trial court sustained cole objection to admission of the conviction.
the district court also admitted evidence of cole lavish spending during the tax years and in subsequent years of.cole objected that the evidence was irrelevant because he would have had enough money to cover his lifestyle expenses even had he paid the taxes the government alleged were due but unpaid.the trial court admitted the evidence,finding it relevant to cole motive to commit the tax offenses.
in a special verdict form the jury largely adopted the government theory of the case,although it declined to find that cole had fraudulently claimed charitable deductions and business expenses.ultimately,the jury found cole guilty on all six counts for willfully mischaracterizing the million as capital gains each year and failing to report the in income from the sale of the million note.
the material facts concerning cole health at the time he was denied a continuance are set out in part iv.
cole was convicted under,which makes it a crime to willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by title or the payment thereof,and,which reaches one who w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter.
cole contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.in this regard,he principally asserts that the proper characterization of the million was uncertain as a matter of tax law and thus,under controlling precedent,he was incapable of achieving the mental state required under the statute,willfulness,as a matter of law.questions of both the legal sufficiency of evidence to sustain a conviction and of tax law uncertainty are questions of law subject to de novo review.see united states gallimore,cir united states mallas,cir.
having closely examined cole contentions,we conclude that because the two cases cole relies on,united states critzer,cir,and mallas,speak only to legal,not to factual,uncertainty in the treatment of income under federal tax law,they are wholly inapposite to this case and cole argument is wholly without merit.
critzer concerned the failure to report income from improvements on land within the eastern cherokee reservation,which generated a tax law question so uncertain that even branches of the united states government plausibly reach directly opposing conclusions,at.that is,despite the defendant prosecution by the department of justice,the department of the interior continued to maintain that the income was not taxable.id.at.likewise,mallas concerned novel questions of tax liability to which governing law offer ed no clear guidance,at,arising from a complex tax shelter that the government claimed was illegal,id.at.we reversed the convictions,finding that present authority in support of the government theory is far too tenuous and competing interpretations of the applicable law far too reasonable to justify these convictions.id.at.we particularly emphasized that,as the government conceded,the relevant treasury regulation simply does not address the issue.id.at.
the instant case presented no novel questions of tax liability to which governing law offers no clear guidance.mallas,at.rather,the jury here confronted a straightforward question of fact did cole sell the sales contracts to his partners for an aggregate of million,or was that amount simply the sum of purloined the government says,as to the fifth sale at least,embezzled funds cole secretly extracted from the respective investment ventures 
resolution of this question hinged not at all on the legal definition of commission,ordinary income,capital gains,or on permissible methods of assignment,but rather on whether,in fact,the elements of a sale of capital assets were present.most importantly,the jury was tasked with determining whether the doctors,the alleged buyers of these contracts,knew they were purchasing them from cole.in sum,because the ambiguity urged by cole is a quintessential question of fact,it was properly left to the jury to decide,based on the evidence presented,whether the funds cole generated for himself were properly treated as ordinary income or capital gains.plainly,the jury did not entertain a reasonable doubt as to the government proof of the negative that cole was not engaged in a sale of capital assets to his who already owned an interest in the assets by virtue of their payment of the down payments needed to acquire the assets in the first place.
as a distinct strand of his contention,cole argues that the favorable testimony of his expert accountant,wilhelm,should foreclose conviction under either statute as a matter of law.at trial,wilhelm insisted that the payments were correctly characterized as assignment fees,and he persisted in this view even after he learned that cole had not contributed to the down payments and had a zero basis in many of the contracts.cole makes the odd contention that the government failure to object to this testimony under federal rule of evidence operated as a concession that the testimony met the rule strictures,and thus that wilhelm opinion was based upon sufficient facts,was the product of reliable principles and methods,and that wilhelm applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.see.accordingly,cole argues,the opinion of a single accountant,hired by a defendant,should suffice to establish the sort of legal uncertainty we found adequate to defeat a finding of willfulness in critzer and mallas.indeed,cole boldly invites us to take this opportunity to announce a general rule that admissible rule evidence of actual correctness of a tax characterization precludes a finding of willfulness in tax prosecutions.br.of appellant,at.we decline this invitation.
of course,even when an expert methodology qualifies as reliable and his testimony is thus admissible for the purposes of rule,the expert resulting conclusions are by no means unassailable here wilhelm conclusion was predicated upon the fact of a sale of contract rights between cole and his partners wilhelm himself conceded that a sale would at least require that the partners have been aware that they were purchasing cole rights.the jury was clearly entitled to find,as it did,that the government evidence conclusively negatived that possibility.
finally,asking us to blink at the evidence of the repeated contemporaneous descriptions of the disputed payments as commissions,cole contends that if we look to the objective economic realities of the transaction rather than the particular form the parties employed,boulware united states,quoting frank lyon united states,we must find that the million in payments were assignment fees,not commissions.we disagree.to excuse a party attempted tax evasion by giving him the benefit of a different transactional structure he concocts post factum would be to turn frank lyon on its head.here,where the jury could easily have found that cole could not have structured these transactions as assignments because his partners did not know and would not have approved of cole inflating sales prices to capture solely for himself million in income,this argument entirely lacks merit.
we readily conclude,therefore,that no complexity of tax law rendered cole prosecution untenable and that the jury verdict finding beyond a reasonable doubt that cole had willfully falsified the character of his income on his tax returns was amply supported by the evidence presented at trial.there was no error in the district court denial of cole motion for judgment of acquittal.
cole next argues that the trial court violated federal rule of evidence b when it admitted evidence that he provided false answers on three forms filed with atf in and and engaged in lavish spending before and after filing the tax returns in question.
we review a trial court rulings on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion,and we will only overturn an evi
