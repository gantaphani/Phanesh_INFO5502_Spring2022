today we deal with the fallout from a deadly drug conspiracy in puerto rico involving a small army of criminals affiliated with the combo of pila from now on,the combo,a vicious gang named after a local housing project where members ran one of their many drug points.the five defendants whose joint trial led to these consolidated appeals are acosta,fournier,castillo,rodríguez,and guzmán their full names and aliases appear in our case caption.
a federal grand jury indicted each of them for conspiring to possess and distribute illegal drugs within feet of a facility.see,and.the grand jury also indicted fournier,rodríguez,and guzmán but not acosta and castillo for aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime or the possession of a firearm in furtherance of that crime.see and c a.as shorthand,we shall refer to these counts as the count and the gun count.
covering the period from january to july,the indictment tagged rodríguez and guzmán as leaders in the combo conspiracy,acosta and castillo as sellers,and fournier as a facilitator.these five were not the only ones indicted.far from it.the grand jury also indicted others on similar charges.but some of them copped pleas and agreed to testify for the government at our defendants trial.
after hearing what these and other witnesses had to say,the jury filled out verdict forms,finding,essentially,each defendant guilty as charged and picking ranges for the drugs each defendant conspired to possess and distribute all while using a standard.the only slight wrinkle on the conviction front is that the jury found acosta and acosta only not guilty of participating in conspiracy activities within feet of a project.later,the district judge imposed the following prison sentences acosta,months on the count fournier,months on the count plus consecutive months on the gun count castillo,months on the count rodríguez,months on the count and consecutive months on the gun count and guzmán,life on the count plus consecutive months on the gun count.
their appeals raise a staggering number of issues for review,though not all require our extended attention.to make our opinion manageable,we sort the issues out person by person,highlighting only those facts needed to put things in perspective.and for anyone wishing to know our ending up front,we note that when all is said and done we affirm across the board.
public trial 
acosta starts things off by accusing the district judge of closing the courtroom to the public during the process.the judge action,he insists,denied him his sixth amendment right to a public trial.see const.amend.vi.the backstory,at least so far as the record discloses,may be swiftly summarized.
just before picking the jury,the district judge called counsel to sidebar.i been informed by my officer,the judge said,that the marshals informed him that three buses that looked like school buses had arrived here with persons who have saying,danny,we support you and we back you.danny is defendant guzmán.anyway,i not going to allow that,the judge added,and none of those persons are going to walk into the courtroom.they are going to be sent back,and they are going to be.guzmán counsel interrupted,saying,i do think that appropriate.i had no idea.send them back.at the risk of stating the obvious,context makes clear that counsel was calling the actions inappropriate,not the judge ruling.and while the judge did not blame the lawyers,he did stress that he would not tolerate any activity like that from any of the defendants.tell you r clients to behave,he continued,or else i going to exclude them from the courtroom,install a camera next to the holding cells,and let them watch the trial from there.very well,rodríguez lawyer said,followed immediately by the judge saying,i going to order the marshals to remove them from the court.
every criminal defendant has a sixth amendment right to a public trial a right designed to ensure a fundamentally fair process,since the public very presence there helps keep judges,prosecutors,and witnesses on their toes.see,waller georgia,d.but this right is not absolute and must be balanced against other important considerations in the administration of justice.see,id.at.for example,a judge may close the courtroom to all members of the public if he detects a compelling interest that needs protecting,considers sensible closure alternatives,ensures that closure is no broader than required,and makes findings sufficient to support his ruling.see,presley georgia,d adding that when a defendant objects to a closure but does not offer alternatives,the judge must think of some on his own owens united states,cir.on the other hand,a judge may order a partial courtroom closure partial,because only some members of the public are kept out if he pinpoints a substantial interest that needs protecting and then does the other things that we just listed.see,bucci united states,cir citing united states deluca,cir.
acosta is having a devil of a time explaining what type of closure happened here.first he says that the judge barred the public in general during this phase of the trial,not just guzmán supporters,apparently.backing off a bit,then he says emphasis ours that at the very least the judge barred defendants families.later still,he says that the judge may have barred his family,friends,and supporters hardly a kind of statement.and he says all this without citing to the record.
even pushing that failure aside,acosta can not overcome this problem the judge put the exclusion matter squarely on the table for all the defendants lawyers at sidebar,explaining what he intended to do with the wearers.each attorney had the chance to speak up.and attorneys for two of acosta codefendants did precisely that.but not acosta lawyer he said nothing,despite the judge placing the issue front and center and the other lawyers voicing their opinion on this weighty subject.fournier attorney peeped no words of protest either,which is a problem for him,as we shall shortly see.ultimately,then,given the particular facts of our case,we conclude that acosta lawyer had to know that he had to chime in on the exclusion issue as others had or else waive any claim.so his silence constitutes classic waiver,rather than forfeiture,which means that he can not challenge the judge ruling even as plain error.see,united states christi,cir souter,citing,among other cases,levine united states,d,which deems a issue waived if counsel knew about the exclusion and saw no disregard of a right but now peddles the argument as an afterthought on appeal.
alibi witness 
acosta also challenges the judge decision banning him from calling his wife as an alibi witness at trial.here is what happened.
shortly after the indictment issued,the government,relying on,demanded that each defendant give notice of any alibi defense that they intended to use.rule a provides that a request like that must state the time,date,and place of the alleged offense.and the version of the rule in effect at the relevant time said that if the defendant wishes to raise an alibi defense,he must within now days notify the government in writing of his intent to do so.and the government request here stated 
the defendant committed the charged offense throughout the years,and until july,during the day and night hours,in or within the pila public housing project within the ponce housing public housing project the josé gándara public housing project the portugues public housing project the los rosales public housing project and within the municipalities of ponce and juana díaz,puerto rico.
one of acosta,josé ríos santiago ríos,who later pled guilty to the count,objected to the request,claiming that it was too broad because it covered fourplus years,every day and night.if the government wants an alibi response,ríos wrote,it must list the dates and time showing when he supposedly was personally involved in the conspiracy charged,and not use the entire period covered in the indictment then and only then,he added,will notice be adequate under the rule.acosta neither filed his own objection nor joined ríos.eventually,the judge granted ríos objection,using language indicating that the ruling applied only to him order as to jose rios santiago grant ed.the government never amended its request.and acosta never mentioned during pretrial that he intended to call his wife as an alibi witness.
we to august,the thirteenth day of trial.a confidential informant named ulises martínez camacho martínez testified about his encounter with acosta at a drug point the coto laurel drug point on july.armed with recording equipment and following the police marching orders,martínez had journeyed there to buy drugs and ended up handing acosta for bags of crack.acosta grabbed the cash but never came back with the drugs.martínez immediately complained about what had happened to acosta brother,who in turn told defendant rodríguez who was also there at that time.ticked off that this guy meaning acosta had done this again,rodríguez handled the problem by making sure that martínez got what he had paid for.importantly,martínez had secretly caught nearly everything on audio and video tape everything except a shot of acosta,which acosta counsel brought out on.
after the judge recessed for the day,acosta lawyer said that he wanted to call his client wife as an alibi witness.she would testify that acosta had been with her on july,counsel explained,celebrating her birthday far from the coto laurel drug point.but prosecutors told the judge that they had given the defense copies of the july recording way back in august nearly years before trial.and one can hear people saying acosta name josé david or david on the recordings,prosecutors stressed.they also said that they had given the defense a transcript of the audio recording in october.and they noted that they had given the defense jencks act material regarding the july transaction on august,days before trial started and days before either martínez direct testimony or acosta attempt to spring the alibi witness on the prosecution.for those uninitiated in the intricacies of federal criminal procedure,the jencks act entitles a criminal defendant to the statement of a government witness after the witness has testified on direct examination.see a 
acosta counsel did not deny any of this.instead,he tells us,he tried to explain to the judge that,yes,prosecutors may have dropped off videos and transcripts of the july doings,but he did not learn that martínez would tie acosta to the tape until he got the jencks material about a week before trial.the judge was not impressed.you had all that information for such a long time,the judge found,yet you still did not give prosecutors the requisite notice so that they could investigate the alibi theory.i have to consider the rights of your client,the judge told acosta attorney.and i did,the judge said,reminding counsel too that he had ordered prosecutors to produce all jencks act statements well before the time that the government ha d to turn it over.having concluded that the defense had failed to comply with rule,the judge precluded acosta wife from testifying.see.e providing that a court may exclude the testimony of any undisclosed alibi witness if a party does not comply with the rule requirements.
looking to undo the judge ruling,acosta protests that he did not have to give advance notice of his alibi witness because the prosecution had given him an inadequate rule request.but even if wrong on this point,acosta contends that the judge should have used the power under rule d to let the alibi witness testify anyway,particularly since the exclusion robbed him of his constitutional rights to present a meaningful defense,or so he says neither argument works.
take the first one.at no time before dropping the bombshell midtrial did acosta object to the government rule request despite ríos objection and the judge ruling in ríos favor.under these circumstances,acosta has waived the argument.see,united states valerio,cir noting that arguments raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived united states meade,cir same.hoping to avoid this logic,acosta faintly intimates a slight whisper of a suggestion that ríos objection preserved the issue for all defendants.but he does not develop this piggyback theory,so we need say no more about that.see,united states zannino,cir holding that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
explaining the problem that sabotages acosta second argument that the judge should have plied his rule d power to excuse the disclosure requires a little more work on our part.we start with some basics.a defendant obviously has a right to offer witnesses in his defense,thanks to the supreme court reading of the sixth amendment see taylor,at see also united states portela,cir.but just as obviously,that right like most rights is not unlimited and may bow to other c ompeting interests.united states brown,cir citing taylor,at.among these are the integrity of the adversary process,the danger of unfairly skewing the function that lies at the epicenter of that process,and the efficient administration of justice.id.citing taylor again.also relevant are the willfulness or not of the violation,the relative simplicity of compliance,and whether or not some unfair tactical advantage has been sought.united states nelson rodriguez,cir quoting chappee vose,cir.not every factor applies in every situation,naturally.see chappee,at emphasizing that the supreme court has declined to cast a mechanical standard to govern all possible cases.and in the end,we give fresh review to the judge application of this standard,see nelson rodriguez,at,but with considerable deference to his factual determinations,see united states levy cordero,cir.
acosta effort to poke holes in the judge exclusion ruling first focuses on the willfulness factor because,he says,there is zero indication that counsel had acted willfully when he disclosed the alibi witness midtrial,the judge edict must fall.what dooms his theory is that we have never held that the exclusion sanction is available only when a party willfully violates rule.see nelson rodriguez,at.next he argues that we must reverse given how badly he needed his wife testimony to rebut martínez and so vindicate his constitutional right to mount an effective defense.but acosta had more than enough time to reveal his alibi witness before day of trial,as the judge supportably found after hearing prosecutors say how they had handed the defense incriminating july evidence recordings,transcripts,and reports,starting almost two years before the trial kicked off.add to that the lack of a credible excuse for not complying with rule and the fact that allowing the surprise witness to testify would have delayed this multidefendant trial to give prosecutors a chance to investigate the alibi,and it becomes clear that acosta argument is a.see generally williams florida,d noting that because an alibi defense is easily fabricated,the government interest in protecting itself against an eleventhhour defense is both obvious and legitimate,adding that defendants must know that a criminal trial is not a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played.
sufficiency of the evidence 
acosta contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction.to convict someone of that crime,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew about and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy,intending to commit the underlying substantive offense and proof may come from direct evidence or circumstantial evidence,like inferences drawn from members words and actions and from the interdependence of activities and persons involved.united states ortiz de jesús,cir quoting united states boylan,cir.of course,winning a sufficiency challenge is hard to do acosta must show that after viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most flattering to the prosecution,no rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.see,united states polanco,cir.and though we exercise de novo review,we can neither the evidence nor the jury credibility calls.id.
acosta pins his principal hope on convincing us that two government witnesses who helped seal his fate were unworthy of belief.this argument is hopeless.
the first witness is jayson serrano,a confidential informant who had grown up with defendant rodríguez.serrano testified that acosta was a drug runner for the coto laurel drug point rodríguez the person in charge at that drug point would get bundles of drugs from his combo colleagues and hand them over to acosta,who would then give them to sellers at the coto laurel locale early in his direct examination serrano named two sellers at the coto laurel drug point nicknamed wanda and pucho neither of whom were acosta.later,though,serrano did say that acosta was a seller there as well.he knew this because he had bought drugs from him several times.serrano also testified that he and acosta had met with combo leaders at rodríguez house.acosta tries to pour cold water on all this,noting that serrano is a convicted thief,former drug addict,and paid government snitch who could not keep his story straight about whether acosta was the seller.what acosta says may be proper argument for a jury,but it is not proper argument here,given that we must resolve all evidentiary and credibility conflicts in the government favor.see,polanco,at united states manor,cir.
the second witness that acosta targets is martínez,the same martínez involved in the july,incident discussed above where acosta agreed to sell martínez worth of crack but took off without handing over the drugs,and then defendant rodríguez fixed things by making sure that martínez got his crack.well,acosta says that that testimony shows only that he had preyed on hapless drug buyers,not that he was a conspiracy member.but his theory can not fly,given our standard of review which,again,requires us to choose from among competing inferences the one most compatible with the jury guilty verdict.see,polanco,at manor,at.and having done so,we believe a sensible jury could conclude that rodríguez helped martínez out because acosta was a drug seller in the combo conspiracy and rodríguez did not want any problems on his watch.like he did with serrano,acosta also harps on martínez status as a professional stoolie and former drug addict a credibility attack that fails,for the reason his attack on serrano failed.
the upshot is that acosta arguments misfire.so we trudge on.
drug quantity 
for his final salvo,acosta attacks the judge finding.as anyone familiar with this area of the law knows,sentence length in drug cases turns largely on the amount and type of drugs involved.section b a of title,for example,lists amounts of different drugs kilogram or more of heroin,kilograms or more of cocaine,for instance that lead to sentences of years to life unless death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance,which leads to sentences of years to life.acosta says,basically,that the judge relied on amounts rather than on amounts attributable to him personally or reasonably foreseeable by him a gaffe,he adds,that resulted in his getting a higher sentence.commendably,he concedes that he did not object on this basis below and so must prove plain error a famously difficult standard to meet,requiring him to show error,plainness,prejudice to the defendant,and the threat of a miscarriage of justice.united states torres rosario,cir accord united states eisom,cir.this is a standard he ultimately can not meet,it turns out.
even a quick look at the record reveals that the jury made individualized drug findings for each defendant beyond a reasonable doubt following the judge charge,the jury checked off lines indicating,for example,that acosta had conspired to possess and distribute kilogram or more of heroin,kilograms or more of cocaine,grams or more of crack,and less than kilograms of marijuana.in sentencing him on the count,the judge used the jury kilogram or more of heroin finding a finding that triggered a statutory prison range of years to life,see b a,all without offending alleyne united states,d,despite what acosta says.alleyne held that facts triggering application of a mandatory minimum sentence generally must be submitted to the jury and established beyond a reasonable doubt.see.at that is precisely what happened here working with the version of the federal sentencing guidelines the judge then pegged acosta level at and made no adjustments,either up or down.with a category of iii,acosta sentencing range was to months of imprisonment,the judge concluded.and after considering relevant sentencing factors,see a,the judge selected months the very bottom of the applicable guidelines range and obviously well within the statutory range of years to life.
given this set of circumstances,the bottom line is very simple the jury individualized findings still acosta cry that no individualized findings drove this part of the judge sentencing decision.ever persistent,acosta suggests that the evidence before the jury concerning what amounts he had handled or were reasonably foreseeable by him was iffy at best,an argument that certainly sounds like a sufficiency challenge.but the already high bar for plain error becomes even higher when dealing with an unpreserved claim which this is,requiring a criminal defendant to show a clear and gross injustice for reversal.united states pratt,cir.and significantly,acosta makes zero effort to explain how after taking the evidence and permissible inferences in a way he satisfies this standard.and that means that he has not lived up to his obligation to develop a sustained argument out of legal precedents,which leads to waiver of this issue.see town of norwood fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.
public trial 
like acosta,fournier first argues that the judge order violated the constitution guarantee.fournier claim is really just a variation on acosta and shares the same devastating waiver problem.so we soldier on.
in court identification 
fournier next claims that a witness identification of him occurred under circumstances so suggestive and unreliable as to deny him due process of the law.the background events are easily summarized.on the second day of trial,miguel lespier velázquez lespier took the stand as a government witness.possessing a bachelor degree in criminal justice,lespier was an early combo leader.eventually arrested and later indicted together with our five defendants for his role in this sordid affair,lespier pled guilty and agreed to help the government prosecute other conspiracy members.after he had given a downright chilling account of a combo killing spree,the prosecutor asked him who had supplied the guns.georgie mesón,lespier said.fournier sometimes goes by that name,everyone agrees,because he owned a sandwich shop called el mesón bypass.pistols,revolvers,and ak rifles are what fournier provided,lespier noted.and lespier said that he knew him.the prosecutor then asked him to identify fournier for the jury.but he could not,even after standing up and looking in the defendants direction.i do see fournier right now,he said.i know him,though,he stressed again.
later in a sidebar conference,the prosecutor told the judge that he believed that lespier could not make an identification because fournier had kept his head down and a podium had blocked lespier view.the solution,the prosecutor said,was to have the defendants move so that the witness could see them better.fournier lawyer objected,and the judge denied the request.
the following day,the prosecutor continued his direct examination of lespier.fournier attended combo meetings,lespier said.other key attendees included representatives from different housing projects like the portugués housing project that were part of the combo network.shifting gears,the prosecutor then asked him about defendant rodríguez.rodríguez belonged to the combo since and ran the coto laurel drug point,lespier said.and he identified rodríguez for the jury the person is wearing a polo shirt,white,lespier added after leaving the stand with the judge permission,of course to get a closer look.do you recognize any other person the prosecutor asked.lespier identified four of the defendants by their nicknames.what about the person in the coat,the prosecutor then asked,do you recognize that person objection,fournier counsel said.suggestive.after the judge overruled the objection,lespier stated,t hat georgie mesón,fournier,and then returned to the witness stand,where he continued testifying about fournier exploits including how fournier supplied combo cohorts with guns and cars to use in shootouts with combo foes.fournier even drove the getaway car following one gunfight,lespier said.
a defendant challenging an identification must show that the procedure used was unduly suggestive.see,united states espinal almeida,cir,cert.denied,d.but even if he does,the identification is still admissible if the totality of the circumstances indicates that it was nonetheless reliable.id.an identification is unreliable only when it poses a very substantial risk of irreparable misidentification.id.internal quotation marks omitted.for preserved challenges like fournier,we review the judge ruling de novo and his fact findings for clear error.see id.the judge in our case,however,made no fact findings on this issue.
here,fournier can not get to first base,because we do not believe that lespier identified him under suggestive conditions.consider the context.the prosecutor and lespier had been discussing rodríguez,not fournier,when the prosecutor asked him whether he could identify that person meaning rodríguez and tell the jury what that person had on.and the prosecutor quite neutral what about the person in the coat,do you recognize that person comment did not coach lespier into fingering fournier whom lespier knew anyway as the person wearing the coat.
undeterred,fournier plays up how lespier could not identify him in court the day before so,he argues,the prosecutor comment must have been suggestive.but even if we assume for argument sake that lespier made the identification under suggestive circumstances,fournier still can not get the result he wants.unlike us,the jurors here had seats for lespier identification.hearing his voice,seeing his eyes and facial expressions,and observing his body movements,they were perfectly positioned to spot any slight sign of uncertainty on his part when he did identify lespier.fournier attorney also had the chance to challenge the identification worth on.and because jurors have a superior vantage point for sizing up the whole picture,the reliability of testimony like this is normally a matter for them.see,united states jones,cir united states maguire,cir.working with the test,we have held time and again that only in extraordinary cases should identification evidence be kept from the jury.see jones,at quoting united states de jesus rios,cir see also espinal almeida,at citing united states rivera rivera,cir.nothing about this case screams extraordinary,however,so the judge identification ruling stands.
brady claims 
as everyone knows,prosecutors must turn over to the defense exculpatory evidence that is material either to guilt or punishment.see,brady maryland,d.the duty to disclose covers impeachment evidence too,even if the evidence is not inherently exculpatory.see,giglio united states,d.that is what the fifth and fourteenth amendments due process clauses require.see,haley city of boston,cir.
broadly speaking,there are two types of brady violations.see,united states gonzález gonzález,cir.the first occurs when the undisclosed evidence shows that prosecutors knowingly used perjured testimony or allowed false testimony to go uncorrected.see,united states agurs,d giglio,at see also gonzález gonzález,at citing giglio too,among others cases.for this violation,undisclosed evidence is material if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.agurs,at.the other type of brady violation occurs when prosecutors suppress evidence favorable to the defense,even if the evidence does not involve false testimony.id.at gonzález gonzález,at.for this violation,evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d.the reasonable likelihood and reasonable probability standards are synonymous.see gonzálezgonzález,at.
fournier makes an odd argument.bear with us now as we run through it.
testifying for the government on the eleventh day of trial,ernesto david vidró díaz vidró told the jury about how he had worked at fournier eatery,el mesón bypass,from until.during his time there,vidró saw some combo leaders guys named potro,bo,ramoncito,burrito meet with fournier at that locale two or three times a week.and on a couple of occasions he saw burrito and bo go into fournier office and take out clear plastic baggies containing what looked liked powdered cocaine.the duo would then go to an part of the restaurant and deck the cocaine drug slang that means to prepare the drug for distribution see united states garcía torres,cir.vidró also saw combo personnel score guns and cars there,thanks to fournier connections.
vidró was no angel either,by the way.he had pled guilty to conspiring from through to sell drugs at the pámpanos housing project pámpanos.prosecutors had handed the defense fbi reports on interviews with him concerning the pámpanos conspiracy,even though the reports involved a different drug organization and a different period than the ones involved here.
answering questions posed by fournier counsel on,vidró repeated that he had seen burrito decking at el mesón.vidró also said that he had never seen fournier dealing with drugs,though.were you aware if his son was dealing with drugs fournier counsel then asked.vidró replied that he knew nothing of the son ways until after he vidró had left el mesón bypass employ in.sometime between then and when he went to jail for the pámpanos drug conspiracy in,vidró explained,he learned that fournier son was dealing with us as part of that conspiracy.vidró also said that fournier had owned the drug point at portugués for a week.
on the next trial day,fournier counsel blasted prosecutors at sidebar for not disclosing evidence favorable to the defense namely,notes of local police officers who had interviewed vidró as part of the investigation.the notes,counsel said,indicated that vidró had mentioned fournier son drug dealings with potro,bo,and burrito but not fournier.a snippet from one of the undisclosed notes says george fournier son used to give the drug to these men,who would cut the drug at the little room of the el mesón business.so,counsel argued,vidró did not testify truthfully when he described fournier drug dealings with potro,bo,and burrito.the judge rebuffed the defense attacks,explaining that the notes involved a different conspiracy and that vidró testified that he had never seen fournier deal with drugs.
fournier presses the same brady argument on appeal,but with a twist.he now says that prosecutors knew that vidró had testified falsely.the government hints at the possibility that fournier did not preserve the challenge for appeal which if true would normally force us to review for plain error rather than abuse of discretion.see united states prochilo,cir.but because his challenge is easily rejected on the merits,we skip over any waiver question.see united states dávila gonzález,cir taking that very tack.
the investigative notes which again reflect that vidró had accused fournier son but not fournier of drug dealings with combo leaders during the pámpanos conspiracy sometime after but before are neither exculpatory nor impeaching in this case.to recognize the obvious,vidró statements to pámpanos investigators touch on a different conspiracy at a different time,and his telling them that fournier son gave drugs to persons who decked them at el mesón bypass in hardly lets fournier off the hook for allowing them to deck drugs there in.also and importantly,the notes do not come within a country mile of contradicting vidró testimony,which we remind the reader was that he had not seen fournier dealing with drugs.so we do not see how the notes had a reasonable chance of changing the verdict here.and because fournier has not shown that vidró had perjured himself,that aspect of his brady claim goes nowhere too 
fournier argues for the first time on appeal that we should analyze his disclosure claims under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.that argument is a nonstarter given prochilo,where we noted that our judicial superiors have thus far only evaluated brady disclosure claims under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,not the sixth amendment confrontation clause.see at citing bagley,at,and pennsylvania ritchie,d.
sufficiency of the evidence 
fournier insists that the evidence was too skimpy to support his conviction for conspiring to possess illegal drugs with intent to distribute.and that means,he argues at least implicitly,that the evidence was too skimpy to support his conviction of aiding and abetting the possession of guns in furtherance of a drug crime if he was not part of the drug conspiracy,the argument seems to go,then he did not commit a drug crime and so could not have aided and abetted the possession of weapons in furtherance of a drug crime.this sufficiency challenge which we of course review de novo and in the light most favorable to the government,see polanco,at misses the mark.
as we said earlier,to prove a charge like the one here,the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that a a conspiracy existed,b the defendant knew of it,and c he voluntarily participated in it,intending to commit the specified underlying crime.see ortiz de jesús,at.fournier thinks that prosecutors fell short of meeting requirements b and c,because,he says,there is no evidence either that he had known about the decking at el mesón bypass or that he had bought and sold drugs for the conspiracy.
but recall lespier testimony sketched in a way most flattering to the prosecution fournier had attended combo meetings,had given combo personnel guns and cars to take on combo rivals,and had taken part in a combo shooting binge.and recall too vidró testimony also presented in a way most agreeable to the government fournier had met with combo big shots at his sandwich shop,had given combo cabalists guns and cars,and had given them a safe place a secluded part of his restaurant to deck drugs too.on top of that,combo vips were not shy about flashing baggies of cocaine in his office,vidró added.in the light cast by this evidence,a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that fournier knew of and voluntarily joined the combo conspiracy with an intent to further its goals.and as for his specific complaints the jury was free to draw the commonsense inference that he knew about the decking happening right under his roof.also,being a drug seller or buyer is not the only way to participate in a drug conspiracy.see,united states avilés colón,cir united states portalla,cir.doing an ancillary task accounting,communications,enforcement,for example can suffice,if done to further the conspiracy objective.avilés colón,at emphasis added quoting united states garcía torres,cir see also portalla,at holding that the fact that the defendant himself did not peddle drugs,did not hold a leadership position within the conspiracy,and as a provider of peripheral services,the provision of cell phones designed to elude law enforcement detection was unaware of many details of the conspirators drug business,would not foreclose a reasonable jury from convicting him given that one of the conspiracy goals was the avoidance of police detection,which he obviously helped out with.this describes fournier situation to a and with his attack on the count foiled,his passing attempt to undo his conviction for aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime is a washout too 
courtroom seating 
fournier says through his pro se brief that court security officers during the trial sat him and his codefendants feet from counsel table and cutoff all communication with their lawyers actions,he adds,that infracted the sixth amendment.see,united states rodríguez durán,cir discussing a defendant sixth amendment right to consult with counsel at trial.his lawyer never complained about this below,and the record discloses no whisper as to what actually happened.consequently,we must dismiss these claims without prejudice to his litigating them if he desires in a proceeding.see,united states bucci,cir.obviously,nothing we have said or left unsaid should be considered as even a remote suggestion of how a petition like that might fare.
fournier also says again,through his pro se brief that having the defendants sit together during the trial deprived him of the presumption of innocence.review applies,because his lawyer made no mention of this below.see,torres rosario,at.that is probably because the argument is a clear loser under united states turkette,cir.there,we rejected the suggestion that a judge had offended the constitution by sitting the defendants alone in the first row of the courtroom spectators section a borderline frivolous claim,we said,because 
the defendants had to be seated somewhere,and from the start of the trial the jury knew that all of them were charged with conspiracy.if the jury received a suggestion of guilt by association,and their verdict belies this,it was the result of the conspiracy charge,not the seating arrangement.
id.at.ditto here.consequently,we see no error,plain or otherwise.
closing argument 
finally,fournier alleges also through his pro se brief several problems with the prosecution closing argument.because he did not object below,he must show plain error.see,united kasenge,cir united states kinsella,cir.but even then,reversal is justified only if the prosecution comments so poisoned the well that the trial outcome was likely affected.kasenge,at quoting united states henderson,cir.
undaunted,fournier condemns the prosecutor for saying that he had armed combo members with rifles,had owned the portugués drug point for a week,and had provided narcotics too.none of this crossed any line,however,because the record supports what the prosecutor said lespier had explained how fournier had given combo personnel ak rifles and had owned the portugués drug point for a week,and prosecutors could argue the inference based on his having owned that drug point.see,manor,at concluding that a defendant claim flopped because the prosecutor had enough evidentiary support to make the statement united states martínez medina,cir finding nothing objectionable with statements that appear reasonably supported by the record or are within the prerogative of the prosecution to characterize the evidence presented at trial and argue certain inferences to the jury.
next fournier excoriates the prosecutor for saying that an early combo member called yiyito whom we have not yet mentioned had worked at el mesón bypass in december,when in fact he had not.another combo member,burrito whom we have introduced already,had worked here during that period,the evidence shows.perhaps the prosecutor confused the two.but given how both yiyito and burrito were combo members,how the slight misstatement touched on an incidental matter,whether a combo member besides fournier had worked at el mesón bypass,how the judge had cautioned jurors that counsel comments were not evidence and that only their recollection of the facts counted,and how there was enough evidence of fournier guilt,we easily conclude that the remark did not prejudice fournier right to a fair trial.see,united states page,cir united states carrasquillo plaza,cir.
confession 
castillo lead argument is that the judge botched the case by not suppressing his allegedly involuntary confession.but the evidence presented at the suppression hearing which we are about to discuss fairly supports the judge conclusion that his confession was voluntary.
convening a hearing following castillo oral motion to suppress,the judge heard from one witness enrique rodríguez,a puerto rico police officer,who explained what went down on the heels of castillo arrest.agents at a local police office gave castillo an oral miranda warning sometime before noon while they were processing him castillo said that he understood his rights.later,officers gave him a form advising him of his miranda rights,and he signed it around later still,while the police were driving him to federal jail,officer rodríguez asked a castillo if something was wrong.responding,castillo confessed that he had worked at a drug point in the pila public housing project.
after the hearing,the judge found that castillo was twice mirandized before saying anything.also,the judge found that the police had not used any coercive tactics that would spoil the voluntariness of his confession.and so the judge denied castillo motion to suppress.
for obvious reasons,castillo spends considerable energy trying to convince us to reverse that ruling.we review de novo the judge legal conclusion about the voluntariness of the confession.see,united states boskic,cir.but we must accept the judge factfinding on the circumstances surrounding the confession unless clearly erroneous,see,because determining credibility,weighing the evidence,and drawing inferences from the evidence all fall within his province,see,united states valle,cir.
castillo argues that officers coerced him to confess in the car by not giving him food at any point before he spoke.there is simply no record support for that claim,however.true,officer rodríguez could not remember if anyone had offered castillo food or not.but he stressed that it is our regular practice to offer persons in castillo shoes something to eat.and he quickly added that castillo never asked him for food,telling defense counsel that the only thing that we talked about was what he admitted to me and nothing else.he never complained about anything,officer rodríguez said,and he looked normal too.the judge was entitled to believe the officer testimony,obviously.given all this,we can not brand the judge factfinding clearly erroneous.
surprisingly,castillo contends that the government did not prove when the agents mirandized him.and,he adds,the evidence contradicts the government theory that he had been mirandized before the confession.surprisingly is the right word,because the record officer rodríguez testimony which the judge could credit without committing clear error and castillo signed form shows that officers had twice mirandized him before he opened up to officer rodríguez.again,we see no clear error.
castillo,lastly,grumbles that he was arrested in the morning,without anyone taking him to a magistrate judge a line appearing in his brief,supported by no analysis explaining why any of that should matter for purposes of assessing the voluntariness of his confession.whatever point he is trying to make is waived.see,zannino,at deeming waived claims that lack coherence or developed argument.
the bottom line is that the judge did not slip in admitting castillo confession.
sufficiency of the evidence 
castillo makes a claim,arguing that the government did not prove that he both had knowledge of the drug conspiracy and had acted with an intent to further its objectives.but his admission that he had sold drugs at what the evidence showed was a drug point cuts the legs out from under this argument.enough said.
drug quantity 
at sentencing the judge calculated castillo sentence on the drug conspiracy count this way.using the sentencing guidelines edition,the judge noted that castillo was responsible for among other things kilogram or more of heroin.that amount which activated a statutory range of years to life,see b a resulted in a level of.after adding levels for conduct within feet of a facility,the guidelines level totaled,which,when against castillo category of i,produced a guidelines range of to months.but after accounting for the a factors,the judge imposed a month prison sentence a sentence months below the low end of the guidelines.
an unhappy castillo now accuses the judge of presiding over a process that flunked alleyne,hitting him with the full weight of the conspiracy drug doings instead of relying on individualized drug amounts determined beyond a reasonable doubt.because he débuts this claim here,our review is for plain error but no plain error rears its ugly head.
as we observed in discussing acosta sentencing challenge,the jury made individualized drug findings for each defendant,concluding when they got to castillo that he had conspired to possess and distribute kilogram or more of heroin,less than grams of cocaine,less than grams of crack,and less than kilograms of marijuana.and the jury particularized findings sap the strength from castillo alleyne argument.
hold on,says castillo,the jury did not have enough evidence to make that finding.this is an unpreserved sufficiency argument reminiscent of acosta.and like acosta it is a deadbang loser,for the same reason.he says not a word about how after considering the evidence and inferences in the light most sympathetic to the government he can clear the very high hurdle required for reversal,see pratt,at,which does not cut it,see town of norwood,at.
still hoping against hope for a reversal,castillo argues that the judge bungled the instructions by not focusing the jury attention on whether he and his codefendants had knowingly conspired to possess and distribute the drug types and quantities alleged in the indictment.hardly.getting down to the,we see that the judge told the jury that it could convict a defendant on the count only if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly and willfully conspired to possess and distribute the drug types and quantities as charged in the indictment.keeping in mind too the special verdict forms that required the jury to make personalized findings for each of the five defendants beyond a reasonable doubt,it is readily evident that castillo theory is a bad one.
rodríguez claims that a fatal variance existed between the drug conspiracy alleged in the indictment and the drug conspiracy proved at trial.to get his conviction reversed on this ground,rodríguez must show two things first,that a variance occurred,that the facts proved at trial differed materially from those alleged in the indictment and second,that the variance was prejudicial,that it affected his substantial rights.see,united states seng tan,cir.critically,there is no prejudicial variance if the indictment gave him enough details to prepare a defense and plead double jeopardy to prevent another prosecution for the same crime.see id.
our review of this claim is similar to a challenge and is assessed de novo,if properly preserved.see,united states dunbar,cir.the government floats the idea that maybe rodríguez did not say enough in the district court to preserve the argument for appeal.maybe,but because his challenge is a dud,we skirt the waiver question.
the gist of his theory is that the indictment exaggerated his participation in the drug conspiracy,linking him to three drug points while the trial evidence only linked him to one,the coto laurel drug point mentioned earlier in this opinion.going by the strict definition of the word,one could argue that proving fewer than all of the facts in an indictment but adding nothing new is not a variance at all.united states mueffelman,cir.yet omissions could so seriously distort the picture presented as to raise questions of unfair prejudice,making a variance analysis proper.id.to move the analysis along,we will assume without deciding that rodríguez can show a variance.still,he must show prejudice sufficient to justify reversal.this he has not done.things might be different if the indictment had not mentioned the coto laurel drug point or had masked its importance by putting undue emphasis on the other drug points.see id.at discussing the masking phenomenon.but the indictment did mention the coto laurel drug point specifically,explicitly,and repeatedly.and rodríguez counsel did try to discredit the charges at trial where she could challenging serrano,for example,regarding his knowledge of the history of the coto laurel drug point its ownership,how long it had been up and running.
the short of it is that the indictment gave rodríguez fair warning that the government viewed his coto laurel drug point ties as an important part of the overall conspiratorial scheme.and because he can not credibly claim surprise,the alleged variance does not merit reversal.see see also united states rodriguez,cir concluding that even if the evidence varied from the charges,the government proving that the defendant ran one of several drug points instead of the entire drug organization caused no prejudice,because the indictment gave him sufficient knowledge of the charges against him so that he could craft a defense 
sufficiency of the evidence 
rodríguez separately argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction on the gun count.to prove guilt here,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,first,that rodríguez knew to a practical certainty that someone would use or carry a firearm during and in relation to a offense or possess a firearm in furtherance of one and,second,that he willingly took some action to facilitate the firearm use,carrying,or possession.see,united states alveriomeléndez,cir united states negrón narváez,cir see also united states medina román,cir clarifying that knowledge meeting the practical certainty test will in many cases arise from such an intimate involvement in the enterprise that the requirement for an affirmative action to facilitate the crime inevitably will be met at bottom,rodríguez really trains his sights on one issue did prosecutors prove his facilitation perusing the evidence in a way most amiable to the government,see polanco,at,we answer yes.
earlier we discussed how lespier testified that rodríguez ran the coto laurel drug point.what we did not mention then is that lespier also testified that combo leaders like rodríguez used armed enforcers all the time.extraordinarily violent men no doubt,enforcers protected combo and beat down rival drug gangs work,with guns among the tools of their trade.see,united states correy,cir.being in charge at the coto laurel drug point meant that rodríguez had a hand in personnel decisions,bossing the help around with consequences or so a jury could find.for example,one enforcer,a person called gordo,lost his life defending rodríguez,lespier said.lespier also talked about seeing rodríguez main enforcer,miguel pacheco,at the coto laurel drug point.and like other enforcers,pacheco was packing heat.considered in the proper light,the evidence and reasonable inferences supply enough proof of rodríguez facilitation.see badamo united states,wl,at,cir per curiam unpublished table decision finding adequate evidence of facilitation where a the defendant was responsible for having another help out with a crime by posing as a police officer during a proposed robbery of a stash house,and b a jury could reasonably infer that a poser would have a gun on him,just like a real officer would 
drug quantity and role in the offense 
this brings us to rodríguez challenges to his month sentence for his conviction on the count.to understand his claims,some background is helpful.
the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt specific drug amounts attributable to rodríguez kilogram or more of heroin,kilograms or more of cocaine,grams or more of crack,and less than kilograms of marijuana.the first finding alone meant that he faced a statutory minimum sentence of years and a maximum of life.see b a.with the statutory range set,the judge had to make drug findings by a preponderance of the evidence,see united states rodríguez,cir,which is a standard,see united states vixamar,cir.and using the iteration of the guidelines,the judge found that rodríguez had been a leader of the coto laurel drug point and a leader in the combo.from this finding the judge concluded that rodríguez could have reasonably anticipated the amounts of drugs being distributed by the conspiracy each year,at least kilograms of heroin,kilograms of cocaine,kilograms of crack,and kilograms of marijuana,which is the equivalent of over kilograms of marijuana,the judge noted that led to an offense level of,the judge said,which he enhanced levels for conduct within feet of a publichousing facility and levels for rodríguez role as a manager or supervisor in the conspiracy.the result was an offense level of,which combined with his category of i to give him a guidelines range of life in prison.the judge then considered the a factors before settling on the month term.
rodríguez essentially thinks that the judge stumbled twice first by attributing drug quantities to him and then by imposing a level sentencing enhancement on him for his supposed role as a manager or supervisor in the conspiracy.spoiler alert we see no error.
absent individualized findings concerning the amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant,the quantities ascribed to the conspiracy as a whole can not automatically be shifted to the defendant.united states colón solis,cir.rodríguez concedes that the judge made particularized findings.he just believes that those findings are insupportable.our review is for clear error,see,e,united states correa alicea,cir,knowing that a finding is not clearly wrong simply because it strikes us as probably wrong rather,it must prompt a strong,unyielding belief,based on the whole of the record,that the judge made a mistake,toye in re,cir quoting islamic inv.of the gulf bah.harper in re grand jury investigation,cir accord united states cintrón echautegui,cir.
plenty of evidence supports the judge finding that rodríguez could have reasonably foreseen the amounts of drugs embraced by the conspiracy onetime combo leader lespier testified that rodríguez belonged to the combo and ran the coto laurel drug point.serrano testified that rodríguez got the drugs for that drug point from his combo counterparts at the pila housing project.the two were united,to use serrano word.another cooperating codefendant,elvin cartagena colón cartagena,whom we have not yet mentioned,saw rodríguez hand a combo leader a tall bundle of cash for drugs.still another cooperating witness,ediberto garcía román garcía,whose name we have not yet brought up,said rodríguez met with combo confederates to coordinate the drug supply for the coto laurel drug point.so rodríguez did not just know combo leaders.he was,as the judge found,a combo leader too who did drug business with combo members.and all of this was enough to satisfy the preponderance standard,despite what rodríguez says.
as for his challenge to the enhancement,see b,rodríguez again must show clear error,see united states garcia hernandez,cir.and again he can not.
an enhancement under this guideline proceeds in a sequence of two steps.id.first the sentencing judge must find that the underlying offense involved five or more persons including the defendant or was otherwise extensive.united states conley,cir.then the judge must find that the defendant managed or supervised one or more of the other participants in that activity.garcia hernandez,at.the standard of proof applies,not surprisingly.see,united states alicea,cir.
rodríguez does not contest the judge finding that the conspiracy involved at least five persons indeed,his counsel specifically waived that argument at oral argument,reserving his objection for the judge conclusion that he played a managerial or supervisory role in the scheme.but gobs of testimony from multiple witnesses support the judge finding.just from lespier and serrano testimony one can reasonably infer that rodríguez at a minimum controlled the criminal activity of a two enforcers one of whom,gordo,died protecting him b three drug sellers wanda,pucho,and acosta and c one drug runner acosta,who took the bundle of drugs rodríguez gave him and passed them on to the sellers.that will do.see,united states cruz rodríguez,cir discussing what it means to manage or supervise a person.desperately,rodríguez essentially argues that neither lespier nor serrano were credible.but the judge had a better vantage to assess the credibility of all involved.and we see no reason to reverse.see generally united states platte,cir noting that credibility determinations are part of the sentencing court basic armamentarium.the enhancement was justified.
car search 
guzmán berates the judge for not suppressing the fruits from the search of a car most notably an incredible amount of heroin.he is convinced that the traffic stop that led to the search was a pretext to allow the police to rummage inside the auto without a warrant,violating his reasonable expectation of privacy.and he is also convinced that the judge should have held an evidentiary hearing on the issue.the story behind all this is easily told.
guzmán had rented a chevy malibu but had let three others coconspirators,it turns out use it on the day of the search.the police arrested the trio after pulling the car over on a highway for a traffic violation and spotting what appeared to be heroin in the auto interior exactly where the record does not say.guzmán was not in the car.according to an officer at the scene,his department policy is that once law enforcers take custody of a car they must itemize its contents in front of the arrestees.and an inventory search of this auto turned up over baggies of heroin in the car trunk,along with other drugrelated paraphernalia.
calling the search and seizure illegal,guzmán argued below that none of this evidence could be used against him.he also insisted that his status meant that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy at stake in the search.he offered no affidavit or equivalent evidentiary material to support his suppression theory,however.and the judge denied the suppression motion,without holding a hearing or issuing a written decision.guzmán moved the judge to reconsider,but again failed to provide an affidavit.the judge denied that motion too.six months later,guzmán moved once more for reconsideration,this time supplying an affidavit swearing that he had loaned the car to his three friends and had told them not to open the glove compartment or the trunk and that u pon information and belief no traffic violation had occurred while his friends were in the rented auto.motion denied,the judge ruled.
in this venue,guzmán still champions as we just said his theories that the stop was pretextual and that the search compromised his reasonable expectation of privacy.nothing that he says on this score matters,however,and our de novo review,see united states de jesús viera,cir,leads straight to affirmance.the reason why is clear 
having arrested guzmán friends after seeing a baggie of suspected heroin in the car interior,officers could search the auto under two traditional exceptions to the warrant requirement exception and the exception.the first exception permits a warrantless search if it is reasonable to believe that the car has evidence of the offense of arrest.arizona gant,d see also polanco,at stressing how gant clarified that an auto search may come within this exception only in two very specific situations when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search the exception,or when it is reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of the arrest might be found in the auto internal quotation marks omitted.during oral argument before us guzmán lawyer tried to parry this point by challenging the lawfulness of the trio arrest.but he has no standing to do so,given that he himself was not one of the arrestees.see generally alderman united states,d noting that fourth amendment rights are personal rights which,like some other constitutional rights,may not be vicariously asserted.indeed,we asked guzmán lawyer for authority to back up her surmise.she had none.and our research turned up none.
the other exception holds that if the arrests are legal,then the police can take the car back to the barrack and search it pursuant to standard inventory procedures provided also that they do not act in bad faith or for the sole purpose of investigation.colorado bertine,d.once again guzmán lawyer wrangled with us over the legality of his friends arrests,without citing any pertinent authority.and once again guzmán argument falls apart on standing grounds,given that he himself was not among those arrested.so he can not challenge the propriety of the inventory search.see alderman,at.
but wait,says guzmán,surely the police did not have to take the car they could have called him to come get it instead.this line of argument is a dead end,however,because the existence of alternative means of dealing with the automobile,even less intrusive means,does not illegitimate the constables decision to remove it.united states rodriguez morales,cir.
as for his faulting the judge for not convening an evidentiary hearing an issue we review for abuse of discretion,see,united states allen,cir we note that guzmán had to satisfy an burden of showing that the police warrantless search did not come within any recognized warrant exception,id.at quoting united states calderon,cir,including the two we just mentioned.and this he did not do,for he alleged nothing definite,specific,detailed,and nonconjectural that could defeat application of either exception here.see id.quoting calderon,at.no surprise,then,that we see no abuse of discretion.
with that said,we turn to his next challenge.
sufficiency of the evidence 
guzmán asks us to declare the evidence inadequate to support his conviction.basically,his gripe is that nothing shows that he had taken some step to help another use,carry,or possess a firearm.the evidence was hardly overwhelming,as the government concedes.but viewed in the proper light,see polanco,at,we believe that there was enough to sink guzmán argument.
here is why.the jury heard from roberto pizarro orta pizarro about the time guzmán took his brother alberto to the house of a man named willie.willie was supposed to give the brothers guzmán the cash from that week heroin sales.like his brother,alberto was a combo member.and it was no secret that alberto had a gun on him.pizarro saw him with a revolver,actually.anyway,a suspicious car was in the area.and guzmán and the others asked pizarro to check it out.i told them i was not going to check any car,empty and by empty he meant unarmed.so pizarro asked for and got alberto pistol thin this evidence may be.but reading everything together with all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the government,we think there was enough for a levelheaded jury to find that guzmán had his brother tag along to make sure that he got his hands on the drug money without incident particularly when one remembers the other evidence showing how combo leaders used armed enforcers to help push their dirty business to the max.and so there was sufficient evidence of guzmán facilitation.see badamo,wl,at.
jury instructions 
guzmán next contends that the judge misinstructed the jury on the gun count.but because he never objected below,guzmán must run the gauntlet of review.see,united states griffin,cir.that requires him to show an error that was obvious and clear and that affected his substantial rights.id.even then,we need not reverse unless the error also seriously undermined the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see kinsella,at.
moving to the particulars of the present case,we see that the judge started off talking about the elements of the count,instructing the jury on the law of conspiracy,for example.then he charged the jury on the elements of the gun count,touching on how the law prohibits anyone from aiding and abetting the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime or possessing a firearm in furtherance of one.because the drug crime here was conspiracy to possess and distribute illegal drugs,the judge talked about the law of conspiracy some more.and then the judge explained the meaning of aiding and abetting.
for his first argument,guzmán says that the judge never told the jury that it could consider whether defendant aided and abetted a member in using or carrying firearms in relation to a drug crime only if it first determined that defendants had conspired to commit a drug crime.nonsense.the judge explicitly charged the jury that to find guzmán guilty on the gun count it would first have to find that the defendants committed the crime of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute the illegal drugs listed in the indictment.hardly the stuff of plain error,by any stretch of the imagination.
guzmán also calls out the judge for not telling the jury that to find guzmán guilty on the gun count it had to find that he had performed some affirmative act,had some stake or power over any firearm.reduced to essentials,what the judge told the jury was aiding and abetting means intentionally to help someone else commit the crime charged.and,he added,a defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting if someone else committed the charged crime,using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime or possessing a firearm in furtherance of one and the defendant consciously shared the other person knowledge of the charged crime,intended to help him,and took part in the endeavor seeking to mak e it succeed.there is no way to convey the idea to the jury,and what is necessary might turn on the circumstances of the case.see united states urciuoli,cir see also united states gonzalez,cir illustrating that point by noting that we have explicitly declined to require the shared intent language found in some of our opinions.but the judge discussion essentially mirrors the ones found in our cases.see,united states rodríguez lozada,cir united states garcía carrasquillo,cir united states rosario díaz,cir.and guzmán has not shown why the particulars of his case required the judge to phrase the concept any differently.so when you get right down to it,what the judge said does not come within shouting distance of plain error.
as a effort,guzmán lodges a double complaint against the judge conspiracy charge.for openers,he calls them unduly repetitive,noting that the judge discussed general conspiracy principles three times.he then sounds off about the charge placement,groaning that the second set of conspiracy instructions were read too close to the aiding and abetting charge.and all of this,he says,confused jurors into thinking that they could convict him of conspiring to possess firearms,rather than of aiding and abetting a firearm use or carry during and in relation to,or possession in furtherance of,a drug crime.we think not.
notably for present purposes,guzmán counsel candidly conceded at oral argument that the judge did not misstate the law of conspiracy.and having read the entire jury charge with care,see griffin,at telling us that this is what we must do,we can not buy the idea that the repetition must have by its sheer weight coaxed the jury to find against guzmán on the gun count.nor did we detect any defect with the instructions placement that might have befuddled the jury in deciding his fate on that count.nothing remotely resembling plain error here,to put it mildly.
napue violations 
convinced that prosecutors violated the constitutional rule against knowingly using perjured testimony,see napue illinois,d,and that there is a reasonable likelihood that that testimony affected the jury judgment,see united states mangual garcia,cir,guzmán blisters the judge for not granting him a new trial an issue that usually invites review,see gonzález gonzález,at.the point that he pushes here pivots on his belief that prosecutors let some cooperating witnesses lie on the stand about the benefits that they would get after testifying under plea and cooperation agreements.what makes this argument a is that it is not the one that he had presented below.
guzmán motion accused only cooperating witness garcía of telling whoppers about potential benefits.a former heroin seller at the pila housing project,garcía testified that he would give money from his sales to willie,who would in turn give it to guzmán.garcía explained that he had confessed to the police that he had participated in the conspiracy,a crime with which he was never charged.he also said that he was cooperating with prosecutors because he wanted to turn his life around.and he denied any agreement for prosecutorial leniency.guzmán motion speculated that garcía must have lied because it was highly unlikely that anyone would cooperate without an agreement.the judge found no napue violation.but guzmán has now shifted the focus of his attack from garcía to lespier and others whose testimony,produced under a plea and cooperation agreement,suggested that prosecutors had offered no benefits to secure their help.having switched tactics this way so late in the game,guzmán has waived the argument that he now seeks to pursue.see united states slade,cir emphasizing that a party is not at liberty to articulate specific arguments for the first time on appeal simply because the general issue was before the district court united states dietz,cir holding that a criminal defendant,unhappy with a judge ruling yet persuaded that his original arguments lacked merit,can not switch horses in hopes of locating a swifter steed see also united states charles,cir echoing points made by slade and dietz.
one last issue,and we are done.
statutory sentencing enhancement 
because of two prior drug felonies,guzmán got an automatic life sentence for his conviction on the count.see b a enhancing the mandatory sentence for a offense to life imprisonment if the defendant has two or more final convictions for a offense at the time he committed the crime for which he is being sentenced.not willing to take that sentence without a fight,guzmán argues as he did below that the two priors resulting from a pair signed plea agreements between him and the government were not separate criminal episodes,as b a has been read to require.see,united states de jesus mateo,cir martínez medina,at.in reviewing the judge decision,we decide de novo any underlying legal issues,see united states rivera rodríguez,cir,but check any fact findings for clear error,see united states fink,cir.
at sentencing the judge read each plea agreement statement of facts into the record.the first one said 
on or about to and october the defendant danny guzman correa was the supplier of heroin for the drug point located at the portugues and belgica wards in ponce,owned by orlando rosa rodriguez.
the second one said 
on or about and october the defendant danny guzman correa was one of the suppliers of heroin,cocaine and marihuana to orlando maldonado orengo,samuel arce leon and ignacio mendoza diaz who would later provide the same to ramona nieves santiago for further distribution at her drug point located at the rosaly residential in ponce,puerto rico.
the judge deemed the two separate criminal incidents.we see no error.sure,the pair overlapped a bit in time.but the second involved different coconspirators,a different locale,and a different mix of drugs than the first.as we have said,time and time again,an ongoing course of criminal conduct such as narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal episodes,each a discrete occurrence.united states lino,cir quoting de jesus mateo,at,in turn quoting martínez medina,at.plus,t he fact that all are related,part of a series,or part of a continuous course of criminal dealing,does not necessarily render them a single criminal episode.id.again quoting de jesus mateo,at,in turn quoting martínez medina,at,again.a contrary holding,we have stressed,would insulate the very career criminals the statute is designed to reach those continuously engaged in criminal conduct.martínez medina,at quoting united states maxey,cir.so it is here.consequently,the judge did not err in treating these convictions as distinct.
in a bid to undo his life sentence,guzmán says that certain calculations in the presentence report are far from reliable.but the jury decision to hold him responsible beyond a reasonable doubt for at least kilogram of heroin was enough to trigger the life sentence,when combined with his two priors,of course.and that means that we need not take up this issue.see,united states rivera ruiz,cir relying on united states tavano,cir.
final words 
for the reasons arrayed above,we conclude that our defendants were lawfully tried,convicted,and sentenced.affirmed.
