george washington,a resident of maine who also goes by the name anthony long,sold cocaine base to a police informant in lewiston,maine,on april,and again on april.
washington was charged with two counts of distribution of five or more grams of cocaine base,in violation of a and b b.washington nicholas blake,john brown,and alvin jackson were also charged with various violations of the federal drug laws they pled guilty.after a jury trial,washington was convicted of both counts the jury specifically found that the amount of cocaine base was five or more grams for each count.because washington had prior felonies on his record,including violent felonies and a prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,he was sentenced as a career offender,see,to concurrent prison terms of months on each count.this was the minimum guidelines sentence he could have been sentenced to life imprisonment.see b b.
washington appeals from his conviction and from his sentence.as to his sentence,he argues it should be vacated and remanded for resentencing in light of united states booker,d.the government has agreed to this remand,and so we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
this leaves washington challenges to his conviction.the challenges are of two kinds the first has to do with the evidence.washington argues that certain evidence was erroneously admitted and the error was so prejudicial as to deny him a fair trial.he also argues that the evidence,which in his view was not credible,was insufficient to support the conviction.second,washington attempts to reargue a complaint about the racial composition of his jury panel which he had presented pro se to the district court.a brief description of the case suffices to set the stage.
background 
washington was convicted upon the testimony of a government informant,toby white,to whom washington sold over grams of crack on two different days grams on the first occasion and grams on the second,as well as on the testimony of law enforcement agents and cooperating,audiotapes of the two transactions,and associated telephone calls.
the first transaction was on april,at knox street,apartment,in lewiston.there,while dea agent genese waited in the car,informant white purchased from washington grams of cocaine for.white had not met washington before.in fact,white had tried to buy cocaine earlier from alvin jackson,who had none,and who had turned to washington,by way of brown and blake,to provide a supply.washington and another man,whom white understood to be washington cousin,personally handed the cocaine to white.washington also gave white his phone number so white could contact him directly next time about buying drugs.washington and the cousin also told white that the next time the price would be.during this transaction,washington went by the name tony.white reported the details of the transaction to agent genese,including that he had obtained the cocaine from two black men and that the one who sold him the drugs was named tony.
the next time came soon,on april.white had called washington to buy more drugs,and they had agreed to meet on april at washington apartment at pierce street in lewiston.this time white purchased grams of crack cocaine from washington for.
the principal,but not sole,defense theory was that someone named tony may very well have sold the drugs,but that washington was not that tony.there was defense evidence that washington was in massachusetts on april and so he could not possibly have been the same tony who sold the drugs to white that day.but the prosecution had evidence that on april,shortly after the transaction,lewiston police officer wayne clifford visited washington apartment on a ruse.the man whom clifford recognized as anthony long came to the doorway,identified himself as anthony long,and confirmed that no other black man lived in the apartment or had stayed there that day.clifford made an identification of the man he saw that day as the defendant,washington.white,too,made an identification of washington as the man who had sold him cocaine.
washington and others were arrested on june.washington identified himself as anthony long when he was arrested.
the jury was played the audiotapes of the april and april transactions,as well as tapes of conversations between washington and white setting up the april deal.
washington focuses on the fact that the jury was also played audiotapes of eight telephone conversations between white and jackson that occurred on april,and.in these conversations,white and jackson discussed a potential drug deal,which ultimately came to be the april transaction.the two also engaged in casual conversation about a variety of other subjects.washington did not participate in these conversations and was not mentioned by either his real name or his alias.the prosecution did not intend to introduce the tapes of the april and conversations,but did so because the defense wanted the tapes in evidence 
the prosecutor said that she would not object to the admission of all the conversations,but she did object to a few sentences at the beginning of the first conversation.in the government view,this portion,in which white and jackson discuss women in a derogatory manner,was inflammatory,might offend the jurors,and should be excised.the defense objected to the redaction,but not to the playing of the tapes.on the contrary,defense counsel insisted that the calls of april,and between white and jackson be played in their entirety the defense stated that these calls demonstrated that white was deceitful and not credible he was a bad person and a poseur,and he should not be trusted in what he said.over defense counsel objection,the court redacted the sentences as to which the prosecution had objected.both sides stated that they had no further objections.
at trial,the slightly redacted tapes of the april,and conversations between white and jackson were played for the jury,with defense counsel interjecting expressly to say that he had no objection and t hat fine.
challenges to admission of evidence 
most of washington evidentiary objections were waived or forfeited one,described later,was preserved.
waived challenge to telephone calls 
it will be no surprise that we reject washington appellate claims of error based on those audiotapes which the defense had admitted into evidence for its own tactical reasons.washington now argues on appeal that the conversations between white and jackson leading up to the sale on april established an unsavory prejudicial tone which could not but damage washington before the jury.the tapes were admitted because washington trial counsel made a deliberate strategic choice that the tapes should be admitted to establish an unsavory tone,which would damage white,the government chief witness,before the jury.this is classic waiver,and we will not even consider the argument.see united states olano,d stating that there is no error where the deviation from a legal rule has been waived,and defining waiver as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right quoting johnson zerbst.united states mitchell,cir where defense affirmatively agreed to government proposed use of evidence,waiver occurred,and plain error review does not apply.
forfeited challenges to various evidence 
several other pieces of evidence now resurrected for appeal were also admitted without objection,and so the objections were forfeited.see olano,at.mitchell,at.these forfeited claims involve evidence of a prior arrest,statements of,and the tape recording of the april transaction.for this court to correct a forfeited error,there must be an error,it must be plain,it must affect substantial rights,and it must seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.olano,at.on appeal,washington invokes the plain error rule,to no avail.
washington argues that it was plain error to allow a police officer who had arrested him to testify about an earlier arrest and to explain that that arrest was for something other than the inspection sticker violation which caused the officer to stop washington car.the first reference to an arrest came during direct examination by the prosecution defense counsel did not object during direct examination,move to strike during cross examination or seek a limiting instruction.
washington asserts that officer clifford testimony about the arrest was prior bad acts evidence,and that it was impermissible under.b,which provides,in part,that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.such evidence may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of identity.id.prior bad acts evidence offered for these other purposes must be specially probative of an issue in the case without including bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.united states frankhauser,cir.even if the evidence has special relevance such as proof of identity,it is inadmissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.id.
the evidence of the stop and arrest was material to identity and was offered for precisely that purpose the jury heard that washington had been stopped and arrested under the name anthony long.officer clifford testimony connected washington not only to pierce street,but also to the name anthony long and its variant,tony.e vidence of prior bad acts may be probative even when it is relevant to an issue that the defendant does not contest,united states varoudakis,cir,and all the more so here,where washington defense was largely based on a claim of mistaken identity.
washington also argues on appeal that there was plain error in the admission of testimony about statements made by some of his.he argues that three portions of white testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay white testified that jackson told him he had no drugs at the moment and would find another source that to facilitate the april transaction,brown told agent genese that jackson was upstairs at knox street,that brown would go to knox street,apartment,and that genese should send jackson over there when jackson came down and that blake told white he would set up the deal with another 
under.d e,a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay.washington correctly notes that no conspiracy was charged.from this,he argues that the evidence was not admissible,although he concedes that some of these statements would have been admissible in the context of an alleged conspiracy.pinkerton united states.stating that acts in furtherance of a conspiracy are attributable to other members of the conspiracy for purposes of holding them responsible for the substantive offense.
but we have already rejected the argument that a pinkerton theory must be expressly charged in the indictment 
it is well established that the applicability of the exception to the hearsay rule is not conditioned on the presence of a conspiracy count in the indictment.rather,the statements of one partner in crime will be admissible against a confederate when made in furtherance of a joint criminal venture and when there is sufficient evidence independent of these statements to indicate the existence of such a venture.
ottomano united states,cir see also united states,cir united states campa,cir.this court has treated statements of joint venturers in a criminal scheme as equivalent to statements of for purposes of application of.d e.see,united states kaplan,cir united states fortes,cir it was not plain error to admit the statements of jackson,brown,and defendants in this statements of joint venturers in furtherance of the joint criminal venture of the april sale of cocaine base.
washington also challenges,on appeal,the admission of the tape of the april transaction itself washington arguments as to each statement are so factually sparse and so legally conclusory that they amount to is simply no sufficiently developed claim of error for this court to review.see united states zannino,cir.in any event,there was no objection at trial on the grounds of hearsay or unfair prejudice,so,at most,we review for plain error.we find none 
preserved challenge to testimony 
we turn last to the evidentiary challenge that washington did preserve he raised a hearsay objection to agent genese testimony that white told him on april that the name of the person from whom he had purchased cocaine was tony.we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to admit this evidence over the hearsay objection.see united states alzanki,cir.
under.d b,a prior statement by a witness is not hearsay if t he declarant testifies at the trial and is subject to concerning the statement,and the statement is consistent with the declarant testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.when defense counsel objected to genese testimony about white prior statement,the prosecution invoked this rule.specifically,the prosecution argued that in light of the previous of white,in which defense counsel had suggested that white was lying when he gave testimony on direct examination genese should be allowed to testify about white prior consistent statement.the district court agreed.
on appeal,washington argues that there was never an express or implied charge of fabrication as to whether it was tony who sold the cocaine to white the only aspect challenged was whether tony was in fact george washington.the district court agreed with the prosecution that there was a charge of fabrication which went to all of white testimony,including his testimony about the name of the drug dealer this was a fair interpretation of the.defense counsel had suggested that the entirety of white testimony on direct examination had been false,implying not only that white did not get a good look at the real drug dealer,but also that white was a habitual liar and that he had a motive to lie about anything and everything in order to please the dea.there was no abuse of discretion under.d in allowing genese to testify about white prior statement to the effect that one of the men who sold the cocaine was named tony.
challenge to sufficiency of the evidence 
washington argues that insufficient credible evidence supported the jury verdict finding him guilty on two counts of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.we treat as preserved washington claim that the evidence was insufficient as to both the april and april transactions we review de novo,see united states,cir,inquiring whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,united states casas,cir quoting united states henderson,cir.all reasonable evidentiary inferences are to be drawn in harmony with the verdict,and all issues of credibility are to be resolved in the light most favorable to the government.id.
the prosecution evidence has already been detailed,and it is more than adequate to support the conviction.washington argues that white was highly impeached and that the testimony of various witnesses was inconsistent in critical aspects,but the jury was entitled to believe the basic story testified to by each of the government witnesses.
as for white credibility,defense counsel had ample opportunity to,and did in fact,point out his receipt of government money and his history of questionable behavior.the jury nevertheless found white credible,and this plausible credibility determination can not be disturbed on appeal.united states,cir see also united states,cir rejecting defendant argument that the witnesses were bad people who should not be believed,where the jury was presented with substantial evidence of the criminal histories of those witnesses,including ample.the jury was also entitled to believe the other government witnesses version of the facts,at least in its core elements,at.the testimony of the cooperating was corroborated at trial,and washington has,at most,pointed out minor inconsistencies that fall far short of rendering the testimony facially incredible.see id.stating tha
