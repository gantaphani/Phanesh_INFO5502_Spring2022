john and jane doe the does appeal the district court order holding them in civil contempt for refusing to comply with grand jury subpoenas.the does contend that the district court erred in finding that the required records doctrine overrode their fifth amendment privilege against and required production of certain foreign bank records.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the underlying facts in this case are undisputed.the does are the targets of a grand jury investigation in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia seeking to determine whether they used secret swiss bank accounts to conceal assets and income from the internal revenue service irs and the treasury department.the grand jury received evidence that on june,john doe opened an account at the swiss investment bank clariden leu now credit suisse ag in the name of redacted corporation.he was the beneficial owner of the account,which was valued in excess of million at the close of.the account was managed by the swiss firm beck verwaltungen ag.when john doe closed this account in january,he transferred million to beck verwaltungen ag account at a different swiss private bank,bank sarasin.
on may,the does were served grand jury subpoenas requesting that they produce certain foreign bank account records that they were required to keep pursuant to treasury department regulations governing offshore banking.the subpoenas demanded production of 
a ny and all records required to be maintained pursuant to c.formerly for the past five years relating to foreign financial bank,securities,or other financial accounts in a foreign country for which you a financial interest in,or signature or other authority over and are required by law to file a report of foreign bank and financial account fbar.the records required to be maintained pursuant to formerly include records that contain the name in which each such account is maintained,the number or other designation of such account,the name and address of the foreign bank or other person with whom such account is maintained,the type of such account,and the maximum value of each such account during the reporting period.
the does timely moved to quash the subpoenas,citing their fifth amendment privilege against.the government opposed the motion,arguing that under the required records doctrine,the privilege does not apply to financial records that the does were required by law to retain.
after hearing argument,the district court denied the does motion to quash,finding that the required records doctrine overrode their fifth amendment privilege against,and ordered them to comply with the subpoenas.the does refused to comply,and pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,the district court held the does in civil contempt 
the does now appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court denial of a motion to quash a subpoena for an abuse of discretion in re grand jury subpoena john doe,cir.but i nsofar as the district court determination was based upon interpretations of law,we review those conclusions de novo.in re grand jury subpoena t,f d,cir.
the bank secrecy act the bsa or the act,regulates offshore banking and contains a number of recordkeeping and inspection provisions.among the purposes of the bsa is to require certain reports or records where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal,tax,or regulatory investigations or proceedings.section a of the act instructs the treasury secretary to require a resident or citizen of the united states to keep records,file reports,or keep records and file reports,when the resident,citizen,or person makes a transaction with a foreign financial agency.id.a.in furtherance of that statutory directive,the treasury secretary implemented regulations that require citizens and residents to disclose their foreign bank accounts,see,and that the records for such accounts be retained by each person having a financial interest in or signature or other authority over any such account for at least five years and be kept at all times available for inspection as authorized by law,id.these recordkeeping regulations were in effect at all times relevant to this case.
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.the supreme court has held that the privilege against bars the government from compelling a person to give testimony that incriminates him.fisher united states.because the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own compelled testimonial communications,the court has determined that it does not shield production of private papers voluntarily prepared or prepared by a third party.id.at.
the does contend that the required records,if it applies,renders the fifth amendment privilege not apply here and that the district court erred in finding otherwise.essentially,the does argue that w here documents are required to be kept and then produced,they are arguably compelled.in re,cir emphasis in original.the supreme court,however,has held that the privilege against does not bar the government from imposing recordkeeping and inspection requirements as part of a valid regulatory scheme.see shapiro united states,noting that the nature of documents and the capacity in which they are held may indicate that the custodian has voluntarily assumed a duty which overrides his claim of privilege.
in shapiro,the court required a wholesaler of fruit and produce to turn over certain records he was obliged to keep and maintain for examination pursuant to the emergency price control act epca,which was enacted during world war ii to prevent inflation and price gouging.id.at.the court determined that the epca represented a valid exercise of congress regulatory authority and that the recordkeeping provisions of the epca were essential to the administration of the statute objectives.id.at.further,the court reasoned that this required records doctrine applies not only to public documents in public offices,but also to records required by law to be kept in order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation,and the enforcement of restrictions validly established.id.at emphasis omitted.
the court revisited its decision in shapiro twenty years later in marchetti united states,and grosso united states.in holding that the required records doctrine was inapplicable to the circumstances before it in both cases,the court articulated three requirements derived from shapiro holding for determining the applicability of the required records doctrine.as summarized in grosso,those requirements are the purposes of the united states inquiry must be essentially regulatory information is to be obtained by requiring the preservation of records of a kind which the regulated party has customarily kept and the records themselves must have assumed public aspects which render them at least analogous to a public document.at.
this court has recognized that the foregoing three principles announced in grosso define the required records doctrine,see,united states webb,cir recognizing required records doctrine in context of regulation of interstate trucking,but has yet to address the applicability of the doctrine in the context of foreign bank records.we do so now and join the consensus of the courts of appeals to have considered the issue that the required records doctrine applies in concluding that records required to be maintained under the bsa fall within the required records doctrine we further conclude that all three requirements of the doctrine are met in this case.
in order to fall under the required records doctrine,the purpose of the recordkeeping must be essentially regulatory.grosso,at.we have held that a recordkeeping requirement is essentially regulatory if it is imposed in an essentially noncriminal and regulatory area of inquiry and is not directed to a selective group inherently suspect of criminal activity.webb,at internal quotation marks omitted.
