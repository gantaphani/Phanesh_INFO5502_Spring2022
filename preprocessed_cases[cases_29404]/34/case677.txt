appellee maria de los angeles rivera rangel rivera used her position as an executive assistant to the governor of puerto rico to help four ventura asilis ventura,angel ocasio ramos ocasio,joaquin arbona arbona,and edwin loubriel loubriel gain access to government officials and obtain expedited treatment of their government business.the contractors paid rivera for her assistance.
as a result of these arrangements,rivera was charged with one count of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion induced by fear of economic harm and under color of official right,in violation of the hobbs act,and one count of aiding and abetting the underlying offense,in violation of the hobbs act and rivera was tried before a jury and convicted on both counts.she then moved for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial.the district court granted rivera a judgment of acquittal and,if that judgment were reversed on appeal,a new trial.the government now appeals those rulings.we reverse and remand with the instruction that the jury verdict be reinstated and for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we present the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states llinas,cir.the facts are derived from testimony given during rivera trial.
in,ventura,a contractor who provided services to the government of puerto rico met ocasio,who at that time was the deputy chief of staff to the governor of puerto rico.ocasio told ventura that if he needed any help with his business dealings with the government,ocasio would be at his service.thereafter,ventura would call ocasio whenever he had difficulty obtaining government permits and ocasio would arrange meetings between ventura and those government officials who had authority to issue the permits ventura desired.in return,ventura paid ocasio to per year.this arrangement continued until ocasio left his government post in and set up a private consulting business that provided services to the government of puerto rico.at that point,ventura concluded that,to further his business interests,he would need the assistance of another government insider.
thus,in,acting on the suggestion of loubriel,a fellow contractor and friend,ventura sought out rivera,an executive assistant to the governor of puerto rico.rivera offered to help ventura gain access to government officials with authority to issue the permits his projects required.on several occasions in,ventura asked for rivera help,and she responded by calling government officials and arranging meetings between the officials and ventura or asking the officials to try to help him out.government officials were receptive to rivera because,as one official explained,she was the assistant to the governor,and they expect ed that all the calls that she made were on behalf of the governor.initially,rivera made no demand for payment from ventura for her assistance.
then,one evening in early,ventura ran into rivera at a supermarket across the street from his office and invited her back to his office.while there,rivera complained to ventura that she had too many expenses and that her salary was never enough for her to be able to meet her expenses.rivera said she hoped some friends could help her out.ventura testified that he interpreted rivera statements as a demand that she be paid for her continued assistance.ventura said that he agreed to pay rivera between and per month because he 
realized that having received a proposition from someone who had so much influence and so much power,to deny it would be putting at risk a lot of his ability to generate business w ith all the influence and power that she had,she had the power to help him and likewise she could have cause d him harm because she had access to all of the offices of the government 
soon thereafter,ventura and rivera began a romantic relationship,which lasted only a few months.that relationship had no impact on ventura and rivera business arrangement.
in early,ventura met with arbona,loubriel,and ocasio.at that time,rivera was independently helping all four contractors arbona explained to the other three that rivera had demanded that she be paid per month for her assistance.the contractors each agreed to pay rivera per month ventura later asked rivera whether he could deduct from the amount he had previously agreed to pay her each month.rivera refused,and from then on,ventura paid her to per month.
as a result of these activities,rivera was charged under the hobbs act with conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion induced by fear of economic harm and under color of official right,as well as aiding and abetting the underlying offense.after a jury found rivera guilty on both counts,she filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal and,in the alternative,a new trial.the district court awarded rivera a judgment of acquittal and,alternatively,if that judgment were reversed on appeal,a new trial.
the district court granted the judgment of acquittal based on its conclusion that,on the evidence produced at trial,rivera could not have been found guilty of the charged crimes,as she could not have been found to have committed extortion.the district court conditionally awarded rivera a new trial because it felt that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to support the verdict and had violated its obligations under brady maryland,d,which requires that the government disclose all evidence in its possession that is both material and exculpatory.
the brady violation was predicated on the government alleged failure to disclose a plea agreement it had entered into with ocasio.the district court reasoned that ocasio,who pleaded guilty shortly before trial,must have entered into a plea agreement because he met with government prosecutors prior to pleading guilty and the government moved for a downward departure at his sentencing hearing.the district court found the existence of a plea agreement despite ocasio insistence at trial that he had not entered into any such agreement,and affidavits of the government two trial prosecutors and a federal bureau of investigation fbi agent to that same effect 
the government now seeks review of the grant of the judgment of acquittal and the conditional new trial.
ii.judgment of acquittal 
we review the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.see united states hernandez,cir.in reviewing such a grant,we must consider all the evidence,direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution,drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict,and avoiding credibility judgments,to determine whether a rational jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.llinas,at internal quotation marks omitted.so long as the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record,it must be allowed to stand and the acquittal must be reversed.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court awarded the judgment of acquittal because it concluded that,on the evidence presented at trial,no rational jury could have found rivera guilty of extortion either through fear of economic loss or under color of official right.we disagree the evidence was sufficient to prove extortion under both theories.
under the hobbs act,whoever in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by extortion or attempts or conspires so to do shall be punished.a.t he government need only show a realistic probability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce in order to bring extortion within the reach of the hobbs act.united states,cir see united states hathaway,cir the hobbs act has been held to reach even those effects which are merely potential or subtle.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.extortion is defined as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of fear,or under color of official right.b.fear encompasses fear of economic loss,including the possibility of lost business opportunities.united states bucci,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,an individual commits extortion if he obtain
