opinion of the court 
in this consolidated appeal,defendants mohamad shnewer,dritan duka,eljvir duka,shain duka,and serdar tatar appeal various aspects of the convictions and sentences they received after a,jury trial concerning a plot to attack united states military bases in new jersey,pennsylvania,and delaware,particularly the united states army base at fort dix.the government presented extensive evidence of the plot,including dozens of recorded conversations among defendants and two confidential informants discussing violent jihad and plans to stage an attack weeks of testimony from the government confidential informants and the law enforcement agents who coordinated the government investigation videos of defendants training trips in the poconos,where they engaged in target practice propaganda videos advocating violent jihad,including attacks against american service members,which defendants viewed and discussed and video surveillance of a transaction in which two defendants purchased automatic and weapons for use in an attack.all defendants were convicted of conspiring to murder united states military personnel in violation of and.four of the five defendants were also convicted of various firearm offenses.
defendants raise numerous arguments on appeal.most significantly,they urge that their convictions should be reversed because they were based in part on evidence procured under a purportedly unconstitutional provision of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa and the district court improperly admitted certain statements against serdar tatar under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.in a joint,counseled brief and individual briefs that we permitted them to file pro se,defendants also raise a number of evidentiary and other issues concerning the conduct of their trial.because we conclude that their arguments lack merit and that judge kugler managed this extraordinarily complex trial in an exemplary way,we will affirm the district court judgments as to the conspiracy and most of the firearm offenses.for reasons we discuss in more detail below,we will vacate mohamed shnewer conviction on count,attempted possession of firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of c a.
shnewer,the duka brothers,and tatar are a group of young men who lived in new jersey and developed an interest in violent jihad,particularly attacks against the united states military.defendants,who had known each other since high school,came to the fbi attention after it received a copy of a video that was brought to a circuit city store in laurel,new jersey,for copying.the video dated from january and depicted the five defendants and others at a firing range in the pocono mountains,shooting weapons and shouting allah akbar and jihad in the states.
over the course of the next sixteen months,the fbi deployed two cooperating witnesses,mahmoud omar and besnik bakalli,to monitor defendants activities.the evidence presented at trial showed that,between january and may,defendants viewed and shared videos of violent jihadist activities,including beheadings,around the world they viewed and shared videos of lectures advocating violent jihad against they sought to acquire numerous weapons,including automatic firearms and grenades they returned to the poconos,where they again engaged in shooting practice they discussed plans to attack the united states military they conducted research and surveillance on various potential targets for such an attack in new jersey,pennsylvania,and delaware and they procured a map of the united states army base at fort dix to use in planning and coordinating such an attack.
with respect to the individual defendants,the evidence demonstrated the following 
mohamed shnewer is a naturalized american citizen who was born in jordan.he admired and sought to emulate the nineteen brothers,the september hijackers,osama bin laden,and the leader of al qaeda in iraq,abu musab.shnewer openly discussed and planned attacks on military targets in new jersey,pennsylvania,and delaware.along with omar,the government informant,he staked out the united states army base at fort dix,mcguire air force base,lakehurst naval air station,and the united states army base at fort monmouth in new jersey the united states coast guard base in philadelphia,pennsylvania and dover air force base in delaware.shnewer also considered attacking the federal government building at and arch streets in philadelphia and drove by the building to determine whether such an attack would be feasible.to accomplish an attack on these targets,shnewer proposed deploying a gas tanker truck as a bomb,using roadside bombs or missiles,and spraying military targets with machinegun fire.he sought to acquire ak machineguns from omar to use in such an attack.
dritan,shain,and eljvir duka are brothers who were born in albania.during the events that were the subject of the trial,they were in the united states illegally.in and,the dukas took at least two trips to the poconos to train for jihad by firing weapons,attempting to buy automatic weapons,discussing jihad,and watching violent jihadist videos.the dukas befriended government informant bakalli,a fellow albanian,and encouraged him to join them in avenging muslims who had been oppressed by the united states and israel.they viewed and praised a lecture,constants on the path to jihad,by anwar,the prominent cleric and proponent of attacks against the united states military,and videos depicting attacks on american soldiers by violent jihadists in iraq and elsewhere.in recorded conversations presented at trial,the dukas described beheadings depicted in the videos as just punishment for traitors.the dukas watched the beheading videos over and over again until they became inured to the spectacle.dritan told bakalli that,although at first he could take it,n ow i see it and it nothing,i do not care.i saw hundreds being beheaded.similarly,eljvir told bakalli that the beheadings were difficult to watch at first,but that n ow we can watch it no problem.
like shnewer,the dukas sought to acquire firearms to further their plans.they could not acquire weapons lawfully because they were in the country illegally,so they turned to the black market.by january,the three brothers told bakalli they had acquired a shotgun,two rifles,and a pistol,and they continued to look for opportunities to buy machineguns.
later that spring,dritan duka ordered nine fully automatic weapons ak and m from a contact of omar in baltimore.the fbi arranged a controlled transaction,and,on may,dritan and shain duka went to omar apartment to retrieve their weapons.after handing omar in cash,dritan and shain examined and handled four fully automatic machineguns and three semiautomatic assault rifles.they asked omar for garbage bags to conceal the weapons so they would look like golf clubs as they carried them out to the car.before they could get there,however,federal and state law enforcement officers entered omar apartment and arrested them.the entire transaction was captured on video by equipment installed in omar apartment by the fbi and was shown to the jury at trial.
serdar tatar is a lawful permanent resident in the united states who was born in turkey.tatar appears in the video of defendants january training trip to the poconos.after extensive discussions with omar about shnewer plan to attack fort dix,tatar agreed to help by providing omar with a map of fort dix to use in planning such an attack.regarding the overall plan to attack fort dix,tatar told omar in a recorded conversation,i in,honestly,i in.
all five defendants were arrested on may,after dritan and shain duka completed the controlled firearm purchase from omar.a superseding indictment,filed on january,charged defendants with 
count conspiracy to murder members of the united states military,in violation of all defendants 
count attempt to murder members of the united states military,in violation of all defendants 
count possession or attempted possession of firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of c a and c b ii dritan,eljvir,and shain duka

count possession of machineguns in violation of o dritan and shain duka and 
counts and possession of firearms by an illegal alien in violation of g dritan and shain duka counts eljvir duka count.
defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.after a jury trial,they were convicted and sentenced as follows 
defendants timely appealed the judgments entered against them.we have jurisdiction to review their convictions and sentences under and,respectively.
defendants fisa challenge 
defendants challenge their convictions on the ground that the government case was tainted by its reliance on evidence procured pursuant to the foreign intelligence surveillance act,or fisa,et,as amended by the patriot act the patriot act revised a provision of fisa,to require a national security officer to certify that a significant purpose,rather than the purpose,of surveillance the officer seeks to conduct under fisa is to obtain foreign intelligence information.compare a b with a b.before the patriot act amendment,courts routinely interpreted that provision to require certification that foreign intelligence collection was the primary purpose of a fisa search.see,united states duggan,cir the requirement that foreign intelligence information be the primary objective of the surveillance is plain from the requirements in as to what the application must contain.
defendants contend that fisa,as amended by the patriot act,violates the fourth amendment in two ways.they urge that fisa act significant purpose test does not appropriately balance individual privacy interests against the government interests in foreign intelligence gathering and,therefore,is unreasonable under the fourth amendment.defendants also argue that fisa unconstitutionally authorizes the government to conduct searches for criminal prosecution purposes that do not satisfy typical fourth amendment requirements.most significantly,they complain that t he requirements under fisa do not include probable cause of a crime being committed.appellants opening br.
defendants maintain that we must reverse their convictions because the government used unlawful evidence throughout the trial the evidence resulted in their convictions and,without that evidence,the government can not prove the charges against them.
aligning with all of the other courts of appeals that have considered this issue,however,we reject defendants constitutional challenge.we conclude that fisa amended significant purpose requirement is reasonable under the fourth amendment,and,therefore,that the government use of evidence in its case against defendants was lawful.we also observe that,even if we were to hold the statute unconstitutional,defendants still would not be entitled to have their convictions reversed.defendants argument for reversal depends on the assumption that,if fisa is declared unconstitutional,then the exclusionary rule would preclude the use of evidence in their case.not so.where,as here,the challenged search was conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on a duly authorized statute,the supreme court has held that the exclusionary rule does not preclude the admission of the fruits of the search 
fisa and the fourth amendment 
statutory background and structure 
fisa,as originally enacted in,empowered the chief justice of the united states to establish a special court now known as the fisa court,staffed by district court judges,with jurisdiction to hear applications for and grant orders approving electronic surveillance related to foreign intelligence.as relevant here,
fisa authorizes a judge on the fisa court to grant an application for an order approving electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information if there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,and that each of the facilities or places at which the surveillance is directed is being used,or is about to be used,by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.
in re sealed case,foreign per curiam quoting a.among other things,the statute defines a foreign power as a group engaged in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor,a,and an agent of a foreign power as a a non united states person,citizen or lawful permanent resident who engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefore sic,id.b c see also id.i defining united states person,or b any person who knowingly engages in sabotage or international terrorism,or activities that are in preparation therefor,for or on behalf of a foreign power,id.b c,i 
the relevant provision in this case,sets forth the elements of an application for such an order.sealed case,at.the original version of required a national security official in the executive branch typically the director of the fbi to certify that the purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information.id.quoting former a b.in,as part of the patriot act,congress revised that requirement so that it now requires the official to certify that a significant purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information.a b emphasis added.
b.the fourth amendment reasonableness requirement 
at its most basic level,defendants argument is that fisa significant purpose standard is unconstitutional because it allows the government to conduct electronic surveillance upon a lesser showing than the ordinary criminal requirement that searches conducted pursuant to a warrant must be supported by a reasonable belief that the target of the search has committed,or is about to commit,a crime.see berger new york,d probable cause under the fourth amendment exists where the facts and circumstances within the affiant knowledge,and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information,are sufficient unto themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.see also appellants joint opening br.citing and quoting berger and mayfield united states,d while that requirement certainly applies to searches that are conducted solely for law enforcement purposes,the fourth amendment is more flexible than defendants argument allows.specifically,the supreme court has indicated that the standards governing a warrant application may vary according to the governmental interest to be enforced and the nature of citizen rights deserving protection.united states district court keith,d.
the fourth amendment provides 
the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
the supreme court has explained that,i n cases in which the fourth amendment requires that a warrant to search be obtained,probable cause is the standard by which a particular decision to search is tested against the constitutional mandate of reasonableness.camara mun,d.in other words,the critical fourth amendment requirement,for purposes of this case,is that the statutory standard for obtaining a warrant must be reasonable.see united states abu jihaad,cir the benchmark for judicial review of the constitutionality of warrant requirements established by congress is reasonableness.
what is reasonable,in turn,depends on the nature of the search t o apply this standard,it is obviously necessary first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen.camara,at.so,for example,in the criminal context,where the objective of a search may be to recover specific stolen or contraband goods,a warrant to search for such goods is reasonable only when there is probable cause to believe that they will be uncovered in a particular dwelling.camara,at.but in the administrative context,where searches might be aimed at securing compliance with minimum physical standards for private property,id.at,the reasonableness of the warrant will not necessarily depend upon specific knowledge related to a particular property,id.at.it may be based,instead,on a judicial determination that the city has adopted a reasonable system of inspections and is not targeting citizens for irregular or malicious reasons,united states wen,cir describing camara.
the government interests in security and intelligence are entitled to particular deference.as the supreme court has explained,w here the risk against which the government seeks to guard is substantial,the need to prevent its occurrence furnishes an ample justification for reasonable searches calculated to advance the government goal.treasury emps.union von raab,d.thus,the court has indicated that mandatory,suspicionless searches of passengers and luggage at airports may be deemed reasonable so long as the search is conducted in good faith for the purpose of preventing hijacking or other like damage and with reasonable scope and the passenger has been given advance notice of his liability to such a search so that he can avoid it by choosing not to travel by air.id.at.quoting united states edwards,cir see also united states hartwell,cir holding airport checkpoint searches constitutional,in part because there can be no doubt that preventing terrorist attacks on airplanes is of paramount importance and such searches advance the public interest internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has not addressed the reasonableness of the standards set forth in fisa or of any searches conducted for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence,but it has specifically suggested that different probable cause standards for intelligence surveillance may be compatible with the fourth amendment.keith,at.as in the above examples,the key is whether such standards are reasonable both in relation to the legitimate need of government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens.id.at.thus,we must determine whether fisa significant purpose standard is reasonable given the government special interest in collecting foreign intelligence information.on that key question,we do not write on a blank slate.
c.the fourth amendment and foreign intelligence 
probable cause standards other than the typical requirement for belief regarding the commission of a crime have been determined to be appropriate and reasonable in the foreign intelligence context.the supreme court decision in keith provides a useful starting point in this area.while discussing the standards that apply to electronic surveillance for domestic security purposes,the court there observed that certain policy and practical considerations differentiate domestic security investigations from ordinary criminal investigations 
the gathering of security intelligence is often long range and involves the interrelation of various sources and types of information.
the exact targets of such surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in surveillance operations against many types of crimes 
often,the emphasis of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the government preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency.
keith,at.in sum,the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise than that directed against more conventional types of crime.id.
in light of these considerations,the court stated that congress may wish to consider protective standards for domestic security surveillance warrants that differ from those prescribed in ordinary criminal cases.id.in particular,it suggested that congress might judge that the application and affidavit showing probable cause for such surveillance should allege other circumstances more appropriate to domestic security cases.id.at.because the same policy and practical considerations highlighted by the keith court apply equally,or perhaps even to a greater extent,to foreign intelligence gathering,the court comments provide important guideposts for our analysis in this case.
after keith,several courts of appeals,including our own,have examined the fourth amendment application to electronic surveillance conducted under the guise of the president executive authority to collect foreign intelligence information.these courts almost uniformly have concluded that the important national interest in foreign intelligence gathering justifies electronic surveillance without prior judicial review,creating a sort of foreign intelligence exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.see,united states truong dinh hung,cir b ecause of the need of the executive branch for flexibility,its practical experience,and its constitutional competence,the courts should not require the executive to secure a warrant each time it conducts foreign intelligence surveillance.united states butenko,cir en banc holding,in light of the strong public interest in uninterrupted foreign intelligence collection,that the fourth amendment does not require prior judicial authorization of surveillance conducted and maintained solely for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information.see generally duggan,at summarizing foreign intelligence exception cases.
admittedly,fisa changed the landscape by instituting a procedure by which the executive branch could seek advance judicial review of,and procure a order for,electronic foreign intelligence surveillance.given the prevailing conclusion that the executive branch could conduct electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes without a warrant,it was perhaps predictable that the courts of appeals that have reviewed fisa,both before and since the patriot act amendments,all would conclude that fisa standards and procedures for authorizing foreign intelligence surveillance orders are reasonable under the fourth amendment.see abu jihaad,at wen,at united states damrah,cir united states johnson,cir united states pelton,cir united states cavanagh,cir duggan,at see also sealed case,at.
d.the fourth amendment and the primary purpose requirement for fisa searches 
defendants do not ignore all of this history.instead,they focus on the patriot act revision of what is now a b to require a national security officer to certify that a significant purpose,rather than the purpose which courts had interpreted to mean the primary purpose of the surveillance the officer seeks to conduct under fisa is to obtain foreign intelligence information.they urge that the patriot act amendment violates the fourth amendment by bringing the standard below this primary purpose threshold.in fact,however,the and act amendment foreign intelligence cases do not control this case.those cases do not establish the primary purpose requirement as a sine qua non of fisa constitutionality,and,even if they did,we would hold that application of the reasonableness test set forth above counsels a different result.
the notion of a primary purpose requirement arises in foreign intelligence surveillance cases.defendants,understandably,focus on united states butenko,cir en banc,in which our court held that the executive branch need not secure prior judicial authorization for foreign intelligence surveillance,but commented in dicta that,s ince the primary purpose of these searches is to secure foreign intelligence information,a judge,when reviewing a particular search after the fact must,above all,be assured that this was in fact its primary purpose and that the accumulation of evidence of criminal activity was incidental.that comment has little bearing here,however,because it arose out facts specific to butenko,not out of a reasoned analysis of what minimum standards would satisfy the fourth amendment see id.at.
the fourth circuit court of appeals has come closer to suggesting a link between a primary purpose requirement and the constitutionality of foreign intelligence surveillance.in united states truong dinh hung,cir,it explicitly balanced government and private interests under a series of different standards and concluded that the executive should be excused from securing a warrant only when the surveillance is conducted primarily for foreign intelligence reasons.id.at.but truong also does not control our analysis.it involved the scope of presidential authority to conduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance.abu jihaad,at.here,we consider the constitutionality of a program approved by congress that requires an executive officer to apply to the judicial branch for a order.these features distinguish our case from truong in important ways 
whatever purpose limits might be placed on the president authority to conduct warrantless surveillance to ensure that the exception does not extend beyond the constitutional ground for its recognition,it does not follow that the fourth amendment demands the same limitation when,as under fisa,the powers of all three branches of government in short,the whole of federal authority are invoked in determining when warrants may reasonably be sought and issued for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information.
fisa cases before the patriot act amendments often incorporated a primary purpose standard without much discussion or analysis,typically by assuming,or even asserting outright,that it was a statutory requirement.see,johnson,at affirming district court determination that fisa surveillance was lawful in part because it is clear that the primary purpose of the government fisa applications was to obtain foreign intelligence information,not to collect evidence for any criminal prosecution of appellants pelton,at rejecting defendant argument that fisa surveillance was conducted primarily for the purpose of his criminal prosecution,and not primarily for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information as required by b duggan,at the requirement that foreign intelligence information be the primary objective of the surveillance is plain not only from the language of b but also from the requirements in as to what the application must contain.those cases did not expressly link the primary purpose standard to an analysis of whether fisa satisfies the fourth amendment or consider whether fisa would be constitutional if it incorporated a lower standard instead,which is the question we face now.sealed case,at concluding that there was not much need for courts reviewing act amendment fisa cases to focus on the constitutional significance of the primary purpose test.
in all events,we do not believe that the fourth amendment compels a primary purpose test.the dispositive issue is whether the significant purpose test is reasonable.because we conclude that it is for the reasons set forth below,surveillance based on that standard satisfies the fourth amendment.
e.the significant purpose test is reasonable 
we agree with our sister courts of appeals and the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review that amended fisa significant purpose standard is reasonable under the fourth amendment,for three reasons.
first,the significant purpose standard reflects a balance struck by congress between the legitimate need of government for intelligence information and the protected rights of our citizens.keith,at.the legislative history reveals that congress was keenly aware that the patriot act amendment to what is now a b relaxed a requirement that the government show that its primary purpose was other than criminal prosecution.sealed case,at.by adopting the amendment,congress signaled its determination that the new standard was needed to promote coordination between intelligence and law enforcement officials in combating terrorism,acknowledging that,as a practical matter,these functions inevitably overlap while congress conclusion in that regard of course is not dispositive,nonetheless,the supreme court in keith suggested that congressional judgment has an important role to play in weighing government interests and determining reasonable protective standards related to intelligence.keith,at.we therefore view congress actions in this area with some additional measure of deference.
second,even leaving congress judgment aside,we conclude that fisa significant purpose standard is reasonable in light of the government legitimate national security goals.we are mindful of the high stakes involved and emphasize the supreme court admonition that w here,as here,the possible harm against which the government seeks to guard is substantial,the need to prevent its occurrence furnishes an ample justification for reasonable searches calculated to advance the government goal.von raab,at.see also id.at.approving second circuit court of appeals conclusion that w hen the risk is the jeopardy to hundreds of human lives and millions of dollars of property inherent in pirating or blowing up of a large airplane,that danger alone meets the test of reasonableness so long as the search is conducted in good faith for the purpose of preventing hijacking and other safeguards are in place quoting edwards,at.
replacing the primary purpose standard with a significant purpose test reasonably furthers the government national security goals.as other courts,and congress,have observed,the status quo ante proved difficult to administer in complex national security investigations,it was often difficult to say whether intelligence or law enforcement,or neither of them,was the primary objective and resulted in a rigid,artificial separation between intelligence and law enforcement investigations that prevented cooperation and,ultimately,imposed a cost on national security.abu jihaad,at see also sealed case,at,nn.
the significant purpose standard,which reflects a negotiated compromise between those in congress who wished to keep the law the same and officials in the executive branch,who wished to virtually eliminate the foreign intelligence standard,cong.rec,statement of dianne feinstein see also abu jihaad,at sealed case,at,alleviates those practical concerns by doing away with the problematic primary purpose test.it also retains key protections for individuals.in particular,the foreign intelligence surveillance court of review has held that the statute,as amended,require s that the government have a measurable foreign intelligence purpose,other than just criminal prosecution of even foreign intelligence crimes and excludes from the purpose of gaining foreign intelligence information a sole objective of criminal prosecution,even for foreign intelligence crimes.abu jihaad,at quoting sealed case,at see also sealed case,at t he fisa process can not be used as a device to investigate wholly related ordinary crimes.
finally,and importantly,fisa contains significant procedural safeguards against abuse.as amended,fisa requires a senior government official typically the director of the fbi,see sealed case,at to certify that obtaining foreign intelligence information is a bona fide purpose of the surveillance and the attorney general or a designee,see g to approve each fisa application.abu jihaad,at.that senior justice department officials must approve every fisa application gives us additional comfort that this process does not provide an end run around the more stringent fourth amendment standards that apply in ordinary criminal cases.
the statute also provides for appropriate,albeit limited,judicial review.an article iii judge sitting on the fisa court reviews every application,makes particularized findings concerning the application compliance with the statute requirements,and issues an order specifying the parameters of the government surveillance authority.see a,c.the fisa judge may demand further inquiry into the certifying officer purpose or perhaps even the attorney general or deputy attorney general reasons for approval of the application,and should deny the application if he or she conclude s that the government sole objective is merely to gain evidence of past criminal conduct even foreign intelligence crimes to punish the agent rather than halt ongoing espionage or terrorist activity.sealed case,at.these safeguards confirm that fisa significant purpose standard is reasonable under the fourth amendment.
evidence derived from a reasonable search is admissible in a criminal trial 
underlying defendants argument that fisa significant purpose test is unconstitutional is the notion that the government should not be allowed to introduce in a criminal prosecution evidence not gathered in compliance with the minimum procedural requirements the fourth amendment typically imposes on criminal investigations.while that notion may be appealing,it does not reflect the law.instead,it is clear that the government may use evidence derived from searches,searches not based on a reasonable belief regarding the commission of a crime that otherwise satisfy the fourth amendment reasonableness requirement to prosecute crimes.thus,in the administrative context,i nspectors lawfully on the premises may report any violations of law that they find.wen,at.likewise,the government may prosecute a defendant for possession of drugs uncovered in the course of a routine airport search.see hartwell,at see also id.at t he fruits of the search need not be suppressed so long as the search itself was permissible.
here,we have concluded that searches in the form of surveillance conducted pursuant to fisa significant purpose requirement are reasonable under the fourth amendment.accordingly,we join other courts of appeals in holding that evidence derived from duly authorized fisa surveillance is admissible in a criminal case.see wen,at holding that if,in the course of conducting surveillance,agents discover evidence of a domestic crime,they may use it to prosecute for that offense,even if the agents knew or may have known when they applied for the fisa order that they were likely to hear evidence of domestic crime see also duggan,at noting that otherwise valid fisa surveillance is not tainted simply because the government can anticipate that the fruits of such surveillance may later be used,as allowed by b,as evidence in a criminal trial and holding that the fact that domestic law enforcement concerns may also have been implicated in government decision to seek a fisa order did not eliminate the government ability to obtain a valid fisa order.
defendants are not entitled to relief because the fisa searches were conducted in reasonable reliance on a statute 
we are confident that fisa significant purpose test satisfies the fourth amendment.but even if we were not,we still would not overturn defendants convictions based on the government use of evidence at trial.supreme court precedent makes abundantly clear that,even if we were to conclude that amended fisa is unconstitutional,evidence derived from it would nevertheless have been admissible in the government case.
defendants argument for reversal depends in part on the theory that,if fisa violates the fourth amendment,evidence automatically must have been excluded see,appellants joint opening br.by holding fisa as amended by the patriot act unconstitutional the evidence used will be illegally obtained and prohibited to be used in trial against the appellants.but that is not necessarily so.see united states tracey,cir a determination that the fourth amendment has been violated does not necessarily require application of the exclusionary rule.the exclusionary rule precludes the admission of evidence tainted by a fourth amendment violation only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the rule.united states leon,d.because the rule is designed to deter police misconduct,id.at,it applies only where it will alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments,id.at.
the supreme court has ruled categorically that suppress ing evidence obtained by an officer acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a statute would not further the purposes of the exclusionary rule,even if that statute is later declared unconstitutional.illinois krull,d.therefore,even a defendant who can establish that evidence against him or her was procured under a statute that violates the fourth amendment is not entitled to have such evidence excluded from his or her criminal trial unless he or she can establish that the officer reliance on the statute was not objectively reasonable.krull,at,dissenting observing that,under the court decision today,no effective remedy is to be provided in the very case in which the statute at issue was held unconstitutional.
the fisa amendment defendants challenge was duly enacted by congress through the patriot act,and defendants have not argued on appeal that government officials did not reasonably rely on amended fisa in seeking the surveillance orders at issue in this case thus,under krull,the exclusionary rule plainly does not apply,and,even if we agreed with defendants that the significant purpose test is unconstitutional,we would be powerless to overturn their convictions on that ground.
statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy 
serdar tatar argues that the district court improperly admitted under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule two sets of statements made by dritan and shain duka about him.federal rule of evidence d e provides,in relevant part,that a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay.d e.tatar argues that the district court erred in finding that the relevant statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the first set of statements.although it abused its discretion in admitting the second set of challenged statements,its error was harmless in light of the other evidence of tatar participation in the conspiracy to kill united states military personnel,the only offense of which he was convicted.
the challenged statements and the district court rulings 
the first set of statements comes from an audio recording of a conversation among dritan duka,shain duka,and confidential informant besnik bakalli.dritan said that tatar wanted to join the military in america and wanted to kill them from inside.joint app.he told bakalli that tatar was very serious,just to get in and kill them and that he was a maniac,he sees ui like we are human by watching muslims get killed everyday ui.id.later,he said that,when tatar sought to join the military,t hat was the only thing on his mind that he kill american soldiers joint app.shain duka said,tatar not totally all there,like you supposed to be and that tatar was very funny but he not serious.joint app.
the district court accepted the government argument that these statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy because the dukas wanted to show bakalli that they were serious,to keep bakalli in the conspiracy,and to buck him up.joint app.after discussing other evidence in the record including tatar own admissions concerning tatar attempts to join the military,the district court concluded that these statements were akin to a present sense assurance to bakalli that this is a serious matter.we got these people lined up who are going to do serious things and i mean and look at serdar,he so serious about this,he wanted to join the military to get on the inside.joint app.
the second set of statements occurred later in the same conversation,when shain duka was discussing our group.shain said,our group was this sayed,that boy,the turk,serdani,tatar,me,dritoni,dritan,sulemaini,eljvir and that,b etween the six of us that hung out together,there was no motherf that could f with us.everybody feared us,we were bad.heading on the wrong path.joint app.the district court originally expressed some reluctance to admit these statements,saying,i do know what the context of that conversation is to be honest,but ultimately concluded that the statements were admissible because they were talking about an association that apparently the government contends continued through the length of the conspiracy.it shows that they been together as a group for some time.joint app.
rule d e analysis 
we review a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion,although our review is plenary as to the district court interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.united states riley,cir quoting marra phila.hous,cir.
as a threshold matter,we reject tatar argument,made in passing,that the statements do not qualify under the rule because they were made to a government informant,not an alleged coconspirator,appellants joint opening br,because no blanket rule forbids the admission of coconspirator statements made to informants.where coconspirators statements have been made to government informants and were intended to keep others abreast of developments and allay any fear they might have had,we have held that they satisfy the in furtherance of the conspiracy requirement.united states gibbs,cir bourjaily united states,d affirming court of appeals determination that telephone conversations between defendant coconspirator and fbi informant were made in furtherance of the conspiracy and admissible under rule d e.as far as dritan and shain duka were concerned,bakalli was involved in the conspiracy.therefore,as long as the statements satisfy the other requirements of rule d e,they were made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy,they are admissible.
tatar challenge focuses on whether the statements satisfy the in furtherance requirement.we have previously explained that s tatements between conspirators which provide reassurance,serve to maintain trust and cohesiveness among them,or inform each other of the current status of the conspiracy satisfy that requirement and are admissible so long as the other requirements of rule d e are met.united states weaver,cir quoting united states ammar,cir.the threshold for establishing that a statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy is not high t he in furtherance requirement is usually given a broad interpretation.id.at quoting gibbs,at.
applying these standards,we can not say the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the first set of challenged statements was made in furtherance of defendants conspiracy.the district court found that,in the context of the overall conversation,the first set of statements was intended to reassure bakalli and maintain trust within the conspiracy by illustrating for bakalli the seriousness of the conspirators intent.its analysis in that regard is reasonable,and tatar has not pointed to any specific dialogue or evidence that would undermine the district court conclusion.
the second set of statements is more problematic.the district court reasoned that the statements were evidence of the dukas association with tatar,but did not make any finding regarding how those statements furthered the conspiracy.the government offers a couple of arguments as to how these statements could be viewed as in furtherance of the conspiracy shain statements about the long duration and comradely nature of his and his brother association with tatar,dating to when they were high school students together,were designed to show bakalli that dritan and shain had a and reliable understanding of tatar proclivities,and thus could be counted on to accurately predict how far tatar would be willing to go to advance the lethal goals of the conspiracy,and even if dritan and shain were not then actively recruiting bekalli sic into the conspiracy,the statements furthered the conspiracy by tacitly warning bekalli sic not to expose it.consol.br.for appellee.we do not find either of those explanations convincing,especially because,as the district court observed,the transcript provides no broader context for that portion of the conversation.joint app.moreover,in our view,the relevance of the second set of statements was tenuous at best,and,in all events was clearly outweighed by the potential for prejudice inherent in the suggestion of tatar close association with the other defendants.see.the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.we therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in admitting them.
given our deferential standard of review,however,we must conclude that the district court abuse of discretion was harmless in the context of this trial.as we discuss below,the admission of the second set of statements does not undermine confidence in the verdict against tatar.see united states zehrbach,cir en banc an appellate court should not exercise its supervisory power to reverse a conviction when the error to which it is addressed is harmless,since,by definition,the conviction would have been obtained notwithstanding the asserted error.quoting united states hasting,d.we also observe that tatar has not argued on appeal that those statements were inadmissible under rule.
harmless error 
an error in an evidentiary ruling is harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not affect the result.united states friedman,cir quoting hill laeisz,cir.high probability means that we have a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendants.united states casseus,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that is the case here,where evidence other than the challenged statements amply supports tatar sole conviction for conspiracy to murder united states military personnel.more specifically,the government established,through evidence tatar does not challenge on appeal,that tatar participated in the conspiracy with the other defendants,that he knew of the agreement and intended both to join it and to accomplish its illegal objects.united states mckee,cir.
tatar knew of the agreement.tatar appeared in the video that the fbi discovered of defendants at the shooting range in the poconos.he discussed violent jihad with the other defendants and gathered with them to listen to and discuss anwar constants on the path of jihad,a lecture advocating violent jihad.see joint app.in a recorded conversation with government informant omar,tatar agreed to provide omar with a map of fort dix after omar explained that he needed the map as part of his plan to make this country pay the price for something they did to me.joint app.tatar understood and acknowledged the gravity of what omar proposed in a subsequent conversation,tatar specifically asked omar,w hat are you thinking of doing joint app.after omar responded by describing his surveillance of fort dix with shnewer,tatar said,this is nothing small.joint app.in addition to this evidence,the government also introduced the transcript of a recorded conversation between shnewer and omar,the admission of which tatar has not challenged on appeal,in which omar told shnewer that tatar was aware that omar and shnewer had made a plan on the basis that,in the future,we make an attack on fort dix.
tatar intended both to join the conspiracy and to accomplish its illegal objects.tatar plainly understood the implications of providing omar and shnewer with the map of fort dix.at one point,he said to omar,i getting involved in it,you understand i getting involved in it by giving you the maps.joint app.in a conversation discussing the planned attack on fort dix,tatar also told omar,i in,honestly,i in.joint app.finally,tatar expressed his decision to join the group in unequivocal terms,saying 
i gon na do it i gon na give it to you it does matter to me,whether i get locked up,arrested,or they take me away,it does matter.whether i die,do matter,i doing it in the name of allah.
joint app.omar testified at trial that,after all of this discussion,tatar actually gave him the fort dix map,confirming that he intended to help omar and shnewer carry out their attack.joint app.
given this direct evidence of tatar participation in the conspiracy,we do not view the admission of the challenged statements concerning tatar attempts to join the military to attack it from the inside,or his long association with the duka brothers,as significant.we note,further,that the admitted statements were mostly cumulative of other evidence the video from the poconos and numerous recorded conversations established that tatar socialized with the other defendants,and dritan duka challenged statement was not the only evidence that tatar had tried to attack institutions from the inside in a recorded conversation,tatar suggested to omar that you could do it from the inside and said that he had attempted to become a police officer in california for precisely that reason.joint app.therefore,we will not reverse tatar conviction based on the district court admission of the challenged coconspirator statements.
c.other issues 
in addition to the challenges discussed in detail above,defendants raised numerous other challenges to their convictions and sentences in their consolidated,counseled brief and in individual briefs we permitted them to file pro se.those challenges relate to 
the district court admission of jihadist videos,certain audio recordings,coconspirator statements made by shnewer,and evidence seized from tatar apartment 
whether the prosecution constructively amended the indictment or violated defendants fifth amendment rights during its closing argument 
whether the district court erred in failing sua sponte to strike a juror whose son was wounded in combat in iraq but who stated during voir dire that her son experience would not affect her judgment 
whether the prosecution improperly took inconsistent positions concerning the relationship between the duka brothers and government informant omar 
the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conspiracy charges against eljvir duka and serdar tatar 
the district court application of enhancements for terrorism and for targeting official victims to defendants sentences and its failure to consider the role of the government informants when determining defendants sentences 
the district court denial of defendants fifth request for a continuance of trial 
the restitution portion of shnewer sentence 
jury instructions 
ineffective assistance of counsel and 
whether,even assuming each of defendants challenges fails individually,all of the legal,factual,and procedural errors they have raised cumulatively deprived defendants of their right to a fair trial.
none of the evidentiary issues rises to the level of reversible error.the most significant challenge is made to the district court decision to admit videos of beheadings that defendants viewed and discussed at length as part of their overall preparations for jihad.defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the videos under federal rule of evidence because they were unduly prejudicial and lacked any probative value relative to the charges we disagree.the district court carefully considered the parties arguments determined that the video evidence explains or could explain if the jury accepts it,i should say,why the defendants would do what they charged with doing and required the government to sanitize the videos,replacing the actual beheadings with a rather antiseptic description of what happens to be delivered by a government witness at trial.based on the foregoing,the district court could not conclude that the probative value of the redacted videos is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in this case.id.
after reviewing the videos and the testimony that accompanied them at trial,we conclude that the district court reasonably assessed the videos relevance and probative value and took appropriate steps to mitigate their prejudicial impact we discern no error in the district court approach.abu jihaad,at identifying no error,let alone arbitrary or irrational error,in the district court decision to admit violent,videos to show defendant motive and intent in participating in a scheme to communicate information to be used in the destruction of a military ship where danger of prejudice was minimized by redactions and limiting instructions.
the district court approached each of the evidentiary issues before us on appeal with the same thoroughness and thoughtfulness it employed in analyzing the beheading videos.we find no abuse of discretion with respect to any of those issues and commend judge kugler for his handling of this lengthy and complicated trial.
we also reject defendants argument that the prosecution constructively amended the indictment during the rebuttal portion of its closing remarks.specifically,defendants urge that the prosecutor assertion that i t does matter if the object of the conspiracy was to kill a soldier in delaware,or in pennsylvania,or in iraq or afghanistan impermissibly broadened the superseding indictment which,they contend,charged only a conspiracy to attack military personnel at specified bases in new jersey,delaware,or pennsylvania.defendants did not raise this issue in the district court,so our review is only for plain error.united states vosburgh,cir.
an indictment is constructively amended when,in the absence of a formal amendment,the evidence and jury instructions at trial modify essential terms of the charged offense in such a way that there is substantial likelihood that the jury may have convicted the defendant for an offense differing from the offense the indictment returned by the grand jury actually charged.id.at quoting united states daraio,cir.that is not what happened here,because the challenged remarks did not refer to an element or essential term of the charged offense.the statutes under which defendants conspiracy charge arose,and,do not even refer to the place where the defendant intends to kill the federal employee,whether at a particular base in new jersey or somewhere in afghanistan,let alone define it as an element of the conspiracy or the underlying substantive offense 
at most,then,the prosecutor comments reflected a variance from the indictment.see united states mckee,cir distinguishing constructive amendments from variances see also vosburgh,at same.unlike a constructive amendment,a variance is a reversible error only where the defendant establishes that the variance prejudiced some substantial right.id.at quoting daraio,at.a variance that sufficiently informs the defendant of the charges against him and allows him to prepare his defense without being misled or surprised at trial does not prejudice the defendant substantial rights.id.here,defendants have not argued that the prosecutor comment surprised them or otherwise prevented them from presenting their case at trial in any way.accordingly,their argument that the prosecutor comment constitutes reversible error must fail 
having thoroughly reviewed each of the other issues presented in defendants myriad briefs,we conclude that they lack merit 
d.the attempted possession counts 
one week before oral argument in this case,the government informed us in a letter that it had discovered a legal error in the superseding indictment that was tried to the jury count,against dritan and shain duka and count,against mohamed shnewer,each charged a crime,namely,attempted possession of firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of c a the government explained that,because c does not contain an explicit attempt provision and there is no general federal attempt statute,attempted possession of firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of c a is not a legally cognizable crime.
the government also has informed us that it will not defend shnewer count conviction,as the indictment and verdict slip framed count solely as an attempt offense.accordingly,we will vacate shnewer conviction and sentence for count and remand so that the district court can dismiss count and remove or refund the associated special assessment.
at the same time,the government urges us to affirm the convictions of dritan and shain duka on count.that count differs from count because the indictment charged possession or attempted possession of seven specific firearms in furtherance of a crime of violence under c a,and therefore contained both valid and invalid theories of liability.the government argues that any charging error on that count was not plain and,in all events,was harmless under hedgpeth pulido,d per curiam,because its theory against dritan and shain on count at trial was that they actually possessed the seven specified firearms and the evidence established beyond any doubt that dritan and shain actually possessed those guns dritan and shain argue that we must vacate their convictions on count because the jury may have relied on the invalid attempt theory.
we first consider what standard applies to our review of this issue.the supreme court made clear in pulido that questions involving juries that are instructed on multiple theories of liability,one of
