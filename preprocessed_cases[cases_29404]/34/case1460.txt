john cioffi mussare,and a,william bruce,iii,were charged in an indictment with various drug and extortion crimes.they were convicted of one count of conspiring to distribute marijuana,as well as two counts of using extortionate means to collect an extension of credit in violation of.mussare appeals,raising various constitutional and evidentiary challenges to the extortion convictions he also appeals his sentence.we will affirm.
on january,clinton james taylor,bruce,and mussare met at an party in williamsport,pennsylvania.at some point during the evening,bruce and mussare expressed an interest in obtaining marijuana,and taylor indicated that his roommate,jim kane,might have some.on saturday,january,bruce and mussare accompanied taylor to his apartment.kane did not have any marijuana,but either taylor or kane suggested that they could get some if bruce and mussare provided the money.bruce then gave kane for the purpose of buying drugs.
kane gave the money to taylor,who used it to buy seven bags of heroin.kane and taylor intended to resell the heroin,make a profit,and use the proceeds to buy marijuana for bruce and mussare.it is unclear whether mussare and bruce knew of the heroin buying scheme,but they were present at the apartment when taylor left with the money and when he returned with the heroin.kane and taylor then consumed some of the heroin themselves,after which kane left to sell the remaining bags.mussare and bruce remained at the apartment,waiting for kane to return.kane was unable to sell the remaining bags of heroin,and did not return that night.mussare and bruce left sunday morning.
on sunday evening,mussare and bruce returned to the apartment for the marijuana.kane explained that he had been unable to sell the heroin,and informed mussare and bruce that he did not have the marijuana he owed them or the money they had given him.
on monday,january,mussare,bruce,and taylor were together at jason tortelli apartment.several other people were also there,including david shay.the group was drinking and smoking marijuana.at some point during the evening,shay and taylor were talking on the phone to shay girlfriend,stacy bardo.during that conversation,shay punched taylor and told bardo that he,bruce,and mussare had taylor and were looking for kane,because he owed them money.later in the evening,taylor was assaulted again,this time by bruce,who punched him in the face and kicked him repeatedly.
around on january,tortelli told his guests to leave.taylor,mussare,bruce,shay,and robert confer then went to taylor apartment to find kane.kane was not there.during the course of the night,taylor was tied up,kicked,burned with cigarettes,with a paintball gun,and beaten with various objects.the letters i m thief were burned onto his torso with a heated coat hanger.shay,mussare,and bruce all took part in the assault.taylor eventually offered to call his mother to obtain the money.
the next morning,mussare and bruce took taylor back to tortelli apartment,where taylor called his mother,told her that he had been beaten,and asked her for so that he could pay the people who had beaten him mussare accompanied taylor to his mother house,where taylor told his mother that mussare had nothing to do with what happened and obtained the money from her.taylor mother also gave mussare five dollars in gas money for helping her son.taylor gave mussare the rest of the money after they returned to the car,and mussare dropped taylor off at home.
taylor eventually told his parents what had really happened.they took him to the emergency room for treatment and called the police.the police searched taylor apartment and found evidence of the assault.
a grand jury sitting in the middle district of pennsylvania returned a indictment against bruce,mussare,and shay,charging them with controlled substance offenses and extortion offenses.shay began to cooperate with the government,and on april,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment against mussare and bruce only.the five count superseding indictment charged mussare and bruce with conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and marijuana to persons under years of age aiding,abetting,and attempting to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute it to persons under years of age aiding,abetting,and attempting to possess heroin with the intent to distribute it to persons under years of age conspiracy to collect a debt through extortionate means and using extortionate means to collect a debt.
a jury returned a verdict acquitting bruce and mussare of the heroin charges,but convicting them of the charges and conspiracy to possess marijuana.at the sentencing hearing,mussare objected to the government request for an upward departure based on permanent bodily injury,arguing that the departure should only be for serious bodily injury.the district court rejected this argument and found that bruce and mussare had inflicted permanent bodily injury on taylor.mussare was sentenced to months in prison and three years of supervised release.this appeal followed.
mussare first argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction under section.review of a verdict for sufficiency of the evidence is plenary.united states rosario,cir.we will reverse a jury verdict for insufficiency of the evidence only when the record contains no evidence,regardless of how it is weighted,from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states anderson,cir citation omitted.
section provides 
a whoever knowingly participates in any way,or conspires to do so,in the use of extortionate means 
to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit,or 
to punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
an extension of credit is defined to mean to make or renew any loan,or enter into any agreement,tacit or express,whereby the repayment or satisfaction of any debt or claim,whether acknowledged or disputed,valid or invalid,and however arising,may or will be deferred.because of the disjunctive or,if the extortionate collection of a debt involves a loan,there is no additional requirement that the parties agree to defer repayment of the loan.
the statute does not define the term loan.the term is generally defined as d elivery by one party to and receipt by another party of a sum of money upon agreement,express or implied,to repay it with or without interest.black law dictionary ed.
mussare argues that the evidence is not sufficient to show that he and bruce loaned any money or in any other way extended any credit to taylor and kane.but taylor testified i to borrow from mussare,and it was given to jim kane,and then given to me to buy heroin with.app.at.he also testified that he understood that the money was to be repaid,either in cash or marijuana.id.at.mussare argues that the jury acquittal on the charges of conspiracy to possess heroin establishes that the jury rejected taylor testimony characterizing the transaction as a loan.however,it would not be inconsistent for the jury to acquit mussare on the possession of heroin charge,but still believe that the transaction was a loan.it does not appear that there was any evidence that mussare and bruce sought the heroin for themselves or even agreed to the heroin buying scheme they simply wanted marijuana.alternatively,even if inconsistent,there is no requirement that a jury verdict be consistent.see united states powell,d.we will not interpret the jury acquittal on the heroin charge as a rejection of taylor testimony,and that testimony clearly provides evidence that the transaction was a loan.
we also observe that,even if a reasonable jury could not find that a loan existed,it nevertheless could reasonably conclude that there was an agreement to defer repayment of the debt kane and taylor owed to bruce and mussare.taylor received the money on saturday,january.bruce and mussare remained at kane apartment until sunday morning,while kane and taylor each left the apartment,first to purchase heroin and then to try to sell it for profit.bruce and mussare left the apartment sunday morning,but returned that evening for
