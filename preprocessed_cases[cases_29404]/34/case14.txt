petitioner,without being placed in custody or receiving miranda warnings,voluntarily answered some of a police officer questions about a murder,but fell silent when asked whether ballistics testing would match his shotgun to shell casings found at the scene of the crime.at petitioner murder trial in texas state court,and over his objection,the prosecution used his failure to answer the question as evidence of guilt.he was convicted,and both the state court of appeals and court of criminal appeals affirmed,rejecting his claim that the prosecution use of his silence in its case in chief violated the fifth amendment.
held the judgment is affirmed.
justice alito,joined by the chief justice and justice kennedy,concluded that petitioner fifth amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege in response to the officer question.
a to prevent the privilege against from shielding information not properly within its scope,a witness who desires the protection of the privilege must claim it at the time he relies on it.minnesota murphy.this court has recognized two exceptions to that requirement.first,a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.griffin california.petitioner silence falls outside this exception because he had no comparable unqualified right not to speak during his police interview.second,a witness failure to invoke the privilege against must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.see,miranda arizona,and.petitioner can not benefit from this principle because it is undisputed that he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and was free to leave at any time.
b petitioner seeks a third exception to the express invocation requirement for cases where the witness chooses to stand mute rather than give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating,but this court cases all but foreclose that argument.a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.see roberts united states.and the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incriminate the witness.see murphy,supra,at.for the same reasons that neither a witness silence nor official suspicion is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege,they do not do so together.the proposed exception also would be difficult to reconcile with berghuis thompkins,where this court held in the closely related context of silence that a defendant failed to invoke his right to cut off police questioning when he remained silent for hours and minutes,at.
petitioner claims that reliance on the fifth amendment privilege is the most likely explanation for silence in a case like his,but such silence is insolubly ambiguous.see doyle ohio.to be sure,petitioner might have declined to answer the officer question in reliance on his constitutional privilege.but he also might have done so because he was trying to think of a good lie,because he was embarrassed,or because he was protecting someone else.not every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt,but neither is every possible explanation protected by the fifth amendment.petitioner also suggests that it would be unfair to require a suspect unschooled in the particulars of legal doctrine to do anything more than remain silent in order to invoke his right to remain silent.but the fifth amendment guarantees that no one may be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,not an unqualified right to remain silent.in any event,it is settled that forfeiture of the privilege against need not be knowing.murphy,at.
c petitioner argument that applying the express invocation requirement in this context will be unworkable is also unpersuasive.the court has long required defendants to assert the privilege in order to subsequently benefit from it,and this rule has not proved difficult to apply in practice.
justice thomas,joined by justice scalia,concluded that petitioner claim would fail even if he invoked the privilege because the prosecutor comments regarding his precustodial silence did not compel him to give testimony.griffin california,in which this court held that the fifth amendment prohibits a prosecutor or judge from commenting on a defendant failure to testify,should not be extended to a defendant silence during a precustodial interview because griffin lacks foundation in the constitution text,history,or logic.see mitchell united states,thomas,dissenting.

genovevo salinas,petitioner texas 
on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas 
justice alito announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion in which the chief justice and justice kennedy join.
without being placed in custody or receiving miranda warnings,petitioner voluntarily answered the questions of a police officer who was investigating a murder.but petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioner shotgun.petitioner was subsequently charged with murder,and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer question suggested that he was guilty.petitioner claims that this argument violated the fifth amendment,which guarantees that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
petitioner fifth amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege against in response to the officer question.it has long been settled that the privilege generally is not and that a witness who desires its protection must claim it.minnesota murphy,quoting united states monia.although no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege,quinn united states,a witness does not do so by simply standing mute.because petitioner was required to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it,the judgment of the texas court of criminal appeals rejecting petitioner fifth amendment claim is affirmed.
on the morning of december,two brothers were shot and killed in their houston home.there were no witnesses to the murders,but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a car.police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene.the investigation led police to petitioner,who had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed.police visited petitioner at his home,where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway.he agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.
petitioner interview with the police lasted approximately one hour.all agree that the interview was noncustodial,and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read miranda warnings.see miranda arizona.for most of the interview,petitioner answered the officer questions.but when asked whether his shotgun would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder,app,petitioner declined to answer.instead,petitioner l ooked down at the floor,shuffled his feet,bit his bottom lip,cl e nched his hands in his lap,and began to tighten up.at.after a few moments of silence,the officer asked additional questions,which petitioner answered.ibid.
following the interview,police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants.prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders,and he was released.a few days later,police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings.on the strength of that additional evidence,prosecutors decided to charge petitioner,but by this time he had absconded.in,police discovered petitioner living in the houston area under an assumed name.
petitioner did not testify at trial.over his objection,prosecutors used his reaction to the officer question during the interview as evidence of his guilt.the jury found petitioner guilty,and he received a sentence.on direct appeal to the court of appeals of texas,petitioner argued that prosecutors use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the fifth amendment.the court of appeals rejected that argument,reasoning that petitioner prearrest,silence was not compelled within the meaning of the fifth amendment.the texas court of criminal appeals took up this case and affirmed on the same ground.
we granted certiorari,to resolve a division of authority in the lower courts over whether the prosecution may use a defendant assertion of the privilege against during a noncustodial police interview as part of its case in chief.compare,united states rivera,with united states moore,cadc.but because petitioner did not invoke the privilege during his interview,we find it unnecessary to reach that question.
the privilege against is an exception to the general principle that the government has the right to everyone testimony.garner united states.to prevent the privilege from shielding information not properly within its scope,we have long held that a witness who desires the protection of the privilege must claim it at the time he relies on it.murphy,at quoting monia,at.see also united states ex rel.vajtauer commissioner of immigration.
that requirement ensures that the government is put on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be,see hoffman united states,or cure any potential through a grant of immunity,see kastigar united states.the express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with evaluating a fifth amendment claim a contemporaneous record establishing the witness reasons for refusing to answer.see roberts united states,a witness may not employ the privilege to avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not to give hutcheson united states,declining to treat invocation of due process as proper assertion of the privilege.in these ways,insisting that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege assures that the government obtains all the information to which it is entitled.garner,supra,at.
we have previously recognized two exceptions to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege,but neither applies here.first,we held in griffin california,that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.that exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an absolute right not to testify.turner united states,black,dissenting see united states patane,plurality opinion.since a defendant reasons for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so,requiring that he expressly invoke the privilege would serve no purpose neither a showing that his testimony would not be nor a grant of immunity could force him to speak.because petitioner had no comparable unqualified right during his interview with police,his silence falls outside the griffin exception.
second,we have held that a witness failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.thus,in miranda,we said that a suspect who is subjected to the inherently compelling pressures of an unwarned custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege,at,and.due to the uniquely coercive nature of custodial interrogation,a suspect in custody can not be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege unless he fails to claim it after being suitably warned.murphy,supra,at.
for similar reasons,we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it need not be affirmatively asserted.garrity new jersey,public employment.see also lefkowitz cunningham,public office lefkowitz turley,public contracts.and where assertion of the privilege would itself tend to incriminate,we have allowed witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence.see,leary united states,no requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing so would have revealed income from illegal activities albertson subversive activities control,members of the communist party not required to complete registration form where response to any of the form questions might involve them in the admission of a crucial element of a crime the principle that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official compulsion denies him a free choice to admit,to deny,or to refuse to answer.garner,at quoting lisenba california.
petitioner can not benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary.as petitioner himself acknowledges,he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and was free to leave at any time during the interview.brief for petitioner internal quotation marks omitted.that places petitioner situation outside the scope of miranda and other cases in which we have held that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege.the dissent elides this point when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that c ircumstances,rather than explicit invocation,trigger the protection of the fifth amendment.post,at opinion of breyer.the critical question is whether,under the circumstances of this case,petitioner was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the fifth amendment.he was not.we have before us no allegation that petitioner failure to assert the privilege was involuntary,and it would have been a simple matter for him to say that he was not answering the officer question on fifth amendment grounds.because he failed to do so,the prosecution use of his noncustodial silence did not violate the fifth amendment.
petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the invocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands mute and thereby declines to give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating.our cases all but foreclose such an exception,which would needlessly burden the government interests in obtaining testimony and prosecuting criminal activity.we therefore decline petitioner invitation to craft a new exception to the general rule that a witness must assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.murphy,at.
our cases establish that a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.in roberts united states,for example,we rejected the fifth amendment claim of a defendant who remained silent throughout a police investigation and received a harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate.in so ruling,we explained that if the defendant believed that his failure to cooperate was privileged,he should have said so at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.at.see also united states sullivan,vajtauer,at a witness does not expressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.
we have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incriminate the witness.thus,in murphy we held that the defendant answers to his probation officer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to invoke the privilege,at.in reaching that conclusion,we rejected the notion that a witness must put the government on notice by formally availing himself of the privilege only when he alone is reasonably aware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.at quoting roberts,supra,at,brennan,concurring.see also united states kordel,
petitioner does not dispute the vitality of either of those lines of precedent but instead argues that we should adopt an exception for cases at their intersection.thus,petitioner would have us hold that although neither a witness silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse the express invocation requirement,the invocation requirement does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of official suspicions.for the same reasons that neither of those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege,we conclude that they do not do so together.a contrary result would do little to protect those genuinely relying on the fifth amendment privilege while placing a needless new burden on society interest in the admission of evidence that is probative of a criminal defendant guilt.
petitioner proposed exception would also be very difficult to reconcile with berghuis thompkins.there,we held in the closely related context of silence that a defendant failed to invoke the privilege when he refused to respond to police questioning for hours and minutes,at slip,at.if the extended custodial silence in that case did not invoke the privilege,then surely the momentary silence in this case did not do so either.
petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish berghuis by observing that it did not concern the admissibility of the defendant silence but instead involved the admissibility of his subsequent statements.post,at opinion of breyer.but regardless of whether prosecutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows,the logic of berghuis applies with equal force a suspect who stands mute has not done enough to put police on notice that he is relying on his fifth amendment privilege 
in support of their proposed exception to the invocation requirement,petitioner and the dissent argue that reliance on the fifth amendment privilege is the most likely explanation for silence in a case such as this one.reply brief see post,at breyer,dissenting.but whatever the most probable explanation,such silence is insolubly ambiguous.see doyle,ohio.to be sure,someone might decline to answer a police officer question in reliance on his constitutional privilege.but he also might do so because he is trying to think of a good lie,because he is embarrassed,or because he is protecting someone else.not every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt,but neither is every possible explanation protected by the fifth amendment.petitioner alone knew why he did not answer the officer question,and it was therefore his burden to make a timely assertion of the privilege.garner,at.
at oral argument,counsel for petitioner suggested that it would be unfair to require a suspect unschooled in the particulars of legal doctrine to do anything more than remain silent in order to invoke his right to remain silent.tr.of oral arg.see post,at breyer,dissenting michigan tucker,observing that virtually every schoolboy is familiar with the concept,if not the language of the fifth amendment.but popular misconceptions notwithstanding,the fifth amendment guarantees that no one may be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself it does not establish an unqualified right to remain silent.a witness constitutional right to refuse to answer questions depends on his reasons for doing so,and courts need to know those reasons to evaluate the merits of a fifth amendment claim.see hoffman,at 
in any event,it is settled that forfeiture of the privilege against need not be knowing.murphy,at garner,supra,at.statements against interest are regularly admitted into evidence at criminal trials,see fed.rule of evid.b,and there is no good reason to approach a defendant silence any differently.
finally,we are not persuaded by petitioner arguments that applying the usual express invocation requirement where a witness is silent during a noncustodial police interview will prove unworkable in practice.petitioner and the dissent suggest that our approach will unleash complicated and persistent litigation over what a suspect must say to invoke the privilege,reply brief see post,at opinion of breyer,but our cases have long required that a witness assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.that rule has not proved difficult to apply.nor did the potential for close cases dissuade us from adopting similar invocation requirements for suspects who wish to assert their rights and cut off police questioning during custodial interviews.berghuis,at slip,at requiring suspect to unambiguously assert privilege against to cut off custodial questioning davis united states,same standard for assertions of the right to counsel.
notably,petitioner approach would produce its own problems,as this case vividly illustrates.when the interviewing officer asked petitioner if his shotgun would match the shell casings found at the crime scene,petitioner did not merely remain silent he made movements that suggested surprise and anxiety.at precisely what point such reactions transform silence into expressive conduct would be a difficult and recurring question that our decision allows us to avoid.
we also reject petitioner argument that an express invocation requirement will encourage police officers to unfairly tric k suspects into cooperating.reply brief quoting south dakota neville.petitioner worries that officers could unduly pressure suspects into talking by telling them that their silence could be used in a future prosecution.but as petitioner himself concedes,police officers have done nothing wrong when they accurately stat e the law.brief for petitioner.we found no constitutional infirmity in government officials telling the defendant in murphy that he was required to speak truthfully to his parole officer,at,and we see no greater danger in the interview tactics petitioner identifies.so long as police do not deprive a witness of the ability to voluntarily invoke the privilege,there is no fifth amendment violation.
before petitioner could rely on the privilege against,he was required to invoke it.because he failed to do so,the judgment of the texas court of criminal appeals is affirmed.
it is so ordered.
thomas,concurring in judgment 
genovevo salinas,petitioner texas 
on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas 
justice thomas,with whom justice scalia joins,in the judgment.
we granted certiorari to decide whether the fifth privilege against compulsory prohibits a prosecutor from using a defendant silence as evidence of his guilt.the plurality avoids reaching that question and instead concludes that salinas fifth amendment claim fails because he did not expressly invoke the privilege.ante,at.i think there is a simpler way to resolve this case.in my view,salinas claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege because the prosecutor comments regarding his precustodial silence did not compel him to give testimony.
in griffin california,this court held that the fifth amendment prohibits a prosecutor or judge from commenting on a defendant failure to testify,at.the court reasoned that such comments,and any adverse inferences drawn from them,are a penalty imposed on the defendant exercise of his fifth amendment privilege.ibid.salinas argues that we should extend griffin rule to a defendant silence during a precustodial interview.i have previously explained that the court decision in griffin lacks foundation in the constitution text,history,or logic and should not be extended.see mitchell united states,dissenting opinion.i adhere to that view today.
griffin is impossible to square with the text of the fifth amendment,which provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.a defendant is not compelled to be a witness against himself simply because a jury has been told that it may draw an adverse inference from his silence.see mitchell,supra,at scalia,dissenting t he threat of an adverse inference does not compel anyone to testify.indeed,i imagine that in most instances,a guilty defendant would choose to remain silent despite the adverse inference,on the theory that it would do him less damage than his testimony carter kentucky,powell,concurring n othing in the clause requires that jurors not draw logical inferences when a defendant chooses not to explain incriminating circumstances 
nor does the history of the fifth amendment support griffin.at the time of the founding,english and american courts strongly encouraged defendants to give unsworn statements and drew adverse inferences when they failed to do so.see mitchell,supra,at scalia,dissenting alschuler,a peculiar privilege in historical perspective,in the privilege against hemholz et eds.given griffin indefensible foundation,i would not extend it to a defendant silence during a precustodial interview.i agree with the plurality that salinas fifth amendment claim fails and,therefore,concur in the judgment.

on writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas 
justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan join,dissenting.
in my view the fifth amendment here prohibits the prosecution from commenting on the petitioner silence in response to police questioning.and i dissent from the court contrary conclusion.
in january,houston police began to suspect petitioner genovevo salinas of having committed two murders the previous month.they asked salinas to come to the police station to take photographs and to clear him as a suspect.app.at the station,police took salinas into what he describes as an interview room.brief for petitioner.because he was free to leave at that time,app,they did not give him miranda warnings.the police then asked salinas questions.and salinas answered until the police asked him whether the shotgun from his home would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder.at.at that point salinas fell silent.ibid.
salinas was later tried for,and convicted of,murder.at closing argument,drawing on testimony he had elicited earlier,the prosecutor pointed out to the jury that salinas,during his earlier questioning at the police station,had remained silent when asked about the shotgun.the prosecutor told the jury,among other things,that a n innocent person would have said,what are you talking about i did do that.i was there.app.but salinas,the prosecutor said,did respond that way.ibid.rather,h e would answer that question.ibid.
the question before us is whether the fifth amendment prohibits the prosecutor from eliciting and commenting upon the evidence about salinas silence.the plurality believes that the amendment does not bar the evidence and comments because salinas did not expressly invoke the privilege against when he fell silent during the questioning at the police station.ante,at.but,in my view,that conclusion is inconsistent with this court case law and its underlying practical rationale.
the fifth amendment prohibits prosecutors from commenting on an individual silence where that silence amounts to an effort to avoid becoming a witness against himself.this court has specified that a rule of evidence permitting commen t by counsel in a criminal case upon a defendant failure to testify violates the fifth amendment.griffin california,internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states patane,plurality opinion turner united states,black,dissenting.and,since it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his fifth amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation,the prosecution may not use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.miranda arizona,emphasis added.
particularly in the context of police interrogation,a contrary rule would undermine the basic protection that the fifth amendment provides.kastigar united states,the privilege usually operates to allow a citizen to remain silent when asked a question requiring an incriminatory answer to permit a prosecutor to comment on a defendant constitutionally protected silence would put that defendant in an impossible predicament.he must either answer the question or remain silent.if he answers the question,he may well reveal,for example,prejudicial facts,disreputable associates,or suspicious circumstances even if he is innocent.see,griffin,supra,at kassin,inside interrogation why innocent people confess,am.trial advoc.if he remains silent,the prosecutor may well use that silence to suggest a consciousness of guilt.and if the defendant then takes the witness stand in order to explain either his speech or his silence,the prosecution may introduce,say for impeachment purposes,a prior conviction that the law would otherwise make inadmissible.thus,where the fifth amendment is at issue,to allow comment on silence directly or indirectly can compel an individual to act as a witness against himself very much what the fifth amendment forbids.pennsylvania muniz,definition of testimonial includes responses to questions that require a suspect to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief.and that is similarly so whether the questioned individual,as part of his decision to remain silent,invokes the fifth amendment explicitly or implicitly,through words,through deeds,or through reference to surrounding circumstances.
it is consequently not surprising that this court,more than half a century ago,explained that no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.quinn united states.thus,a prosecutor may not comment on a defendant failure to testify at trial even if neither the defendant nor anyone else ever mentions a fifth amendment right not to do so.circumstances,not a defendant statement,tie the defendant silence to the right.similarly,a prosecutor may not comment on the fact that a defendant in custody,after receiving miranda warnings,stood mute regardless of whether he claimed his privilege in so many words.miranda,supra,at.again,it is not any explicit statement but,instead,the defendant deeds silence and circumstances receipt of the warnings that tie together silence and constitutional right.most lower courts have so construed the law,even where the defendant,having received miranda warnings,answers some questions while remaining silent as to others.see,hurd terhune,united states may,united states scott,united states canterbury,grieco hall,united states ghiz.but see,united states harris.
the cases in which this court has insisted that a defendant expressly mention the fifth amendment by name in order to rely on its privilege to protect silence are cases where the circumstances surrounding the silence unlike the present case did not give rise to an inference that the defendant intended,by his silence,to exercise his fifth amendment rights and the questioner greeted by the silence again unlike the present case had a special need to know whether the defendant sought to rely on the protections of the fifth amendment.see ante,at explaining that,in such cases,the government needs to know the basis for refusing to answer so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be or cure any potential through a grant of immunity citation omitted.these cases include roberts,rogers,sullivan,vajtauer,and jenkins all of which at least do involve the protection of silence and also include cases emphasized by the plurality that are not even about silence namely,murphy and garner.
in roberts and rogers,the individual refused to answer questions that government investigators in roberts and a grand jury in rogers asked,principally because the individual wanted to avoid incriminating other persons.roberts united states,rogers united states,and.but the fifth amendment does not protect someone from incriminating others it protects against.in turn,neither the nature of the questions nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the fifth amendment,while knowledge of any such tie would have proved critical to the questioner determination as to whether the defendant had any proper legal basis for claiming fifth amendment protection.
in sullivan,the defendant silence consisted of his failure to file a tax return a return,he later claimed,that would have revealed his illegal activity as
