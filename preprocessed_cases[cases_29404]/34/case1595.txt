over the course of more than three decades,thomas creighton shrader harassed and intimidated and later her husband,causing them to fear for their safety and that of their children.he stands convicted after trial of two counts of stalking through the use of a facility of interstate commerce and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.shrader raises multiple issues in this appeal,including the vagueness of the stalking statute and the length of his sentence.accepting his contentions,however,would undermine congress efforts to protect people like and from precisely the sort of terrifying conduct that took place in this case.we therefore affirm.
starting sometime around,while still a high school student in mcdowell county,west virginia,began a relationship with shrader.over time he became increasingly demanding and possessive,repeatedly appearing uninvited at house.this led her to break off the relationship in after approximately two years.when she did so,the defendant threatened to kill two nephews if she did not continue seeing him.around the same time,the defendant physically assaulted at her workplace,choking her in an elevator.
on july,the defendant confronted while she was at home with her mother,geneva miller,and a family friend,rusty adams.refused to leave with the defendant.twenty minutes later,he returned to her home with a rifle.entering the house,he shot and killed rusty adams in a side room.he next shot geneva miller,who died ten days later of gangrene contracted in her wound.ran out of the house,fleeing across the street to the home of her neighbor,john kowaleski.shrader continued shooting and wounded kowaleski in the arm.the defendant was subdued and arrested,and was charged in west virginia state court with two counts of first degree murder in violation of and one count of unlawful wounding in violation of.
shrader pled guilty to these charges on january,and was sentenced to concurrent life sentences with a recommendation of mercy on the murder charges as well as an additional year of incarceration for the wounding offense.approximately a year later,shrader escaped from prison.and her younger sister were taken into protective custody by the state police.shrader was recaptured and sentenced to an additional year of imprisonment for the escape.
during his incarceration,shrader continued to contact.he sent approximately fifteen to twenty letters to her at the bank where she worked,repeatedly referencing his murder of friend and mother,and causing to feel severely threatened.in,the defendant filed a lawsuit against in mercer county,west virginia,alleging that had breached a promise to marry him and seeking in damages from her.
by this time,had married.in,they moved to texas,severing all ties with west virginia,and took a variety of additional precautions to ensure their safety and anonymity.this did not deter shrader,who wrote letters to father,and sister,asking whether family was involved in witchcraft,whether had ever had an abortion,and requesting recent pictures of.he alleged in these letters that he pled guilty to the murders in to cover up a conspiracy between himself and,and threatened that he would convict of rusties death.in,shrader was released from prison on parole,and was released from parole in.
beginning on august,shrader made a series of phone calls to the unlisted number of texas home.speaking with,he identified himself and said,i need to talk to your kids before we die.she denied having children,but shrader identified them by name.called,but the local police were unable to help her,even though made clear that she was living in terror.the defendant called back at least four times that evening.he spoke with as well as,proclaiming to him that is my god and i would have done anything for my god,and telling that he had obtained their contact information in texas through a freedom of information act request for letters mailed by the parole board notifying of shrader parole hearings.
as a result of these calls,became afraid for her children to leave their home.began sleeping with a loaded shotgun under the bed,prepared to defend his family.shrader persisted,obtaining a photograph of daughter from the website myspace,and attempting to call her as well.shrader also showed his friend carol miller aerial photographs of home in texas,commenting about where he could covertly observe the home from across the street.he also formulated a plan to send underwear to daughter with the intent to anger 
on october,received a ups package addressed to his wife at their texas home.inside was a page letter from shrader.in the letter,shrader warned that she had to read it for her own good or do read and face the consequences blindly.he reiterated his delusion that the murders of rusty adams and geneva miller were part of a plot hatched by your plan did work and it cost the life of your mother.he claimed that had aborted their child,wishing for god to take one of your children live in an accident to show me that you did have an abortion.shrader described how he almost killed in graphic detail 
you have failed to realize that the only reason after everything fell apart at your house that day,i did not shoot you in the back that day as you ran down the middle of the road for kowalski house.was because i was so deeply in love with you and believed you felt the same for me.even though while standing on the front porch of the house i had the rifle raised and the cross hair of the scope were dead center between your shoulder blades.heart,lungs,sternum and some ribs.
and he warned about possible physical violence against her be smart also realize i have never laid a finger on you or hurt you physically.in fact i could have,like i told you earlier in this latter,while you were running down the road.or on the morning that i escaped from the mcdowell county jail.finally,he closed the letter with threats about the future,claiming that it time to face the piper.he concluded that from the date you receive this,i am allowing two weeks or days to pass before i initiate my next step.
understandably terrified,and contacted the fbi,which secured a criminal complaint against shrader and a warrant for his arrest.on november,fbi agents went to the home that shrader shared with his aunt,elizabeth jones,to execute the arrest warrant.shrader was alone at the house when the agents arrived.he informed special agent terry schwartz that there were firearms in the home,but refused to consent to a search of the premises to recover them.while several agents took the defendant into custody,agent schwartz and other officers awaited jones return.two hours later,she arrived,and consented to the search.in the dining room of the home,officers found a cabinet containing two shotguns and a rifle.
shrader was ultimately charged with two counts of stalking via a facility of interstate commerce in violation of one alleged that he targeted and the other that he targeted and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.the counts were severed and two separate trials were held,first on the firearms charge and subsequently on the two stalking counts.
prior to the firearms trial,shrader moved to suppress the firearms found in the house,arguing that the agents violated the supreme court decision in georgia randolph,d,by soliciting consent from his aunt after he had been arrested even though he already refused permission for the search.the district court denied the motion,finding that randolph required the defendant to be present at the time his aunt consented in order to object to the search,and that there was no evidence to suggest that the agents intent was to extraordinarily render defendant away from the scene to violate his fourth amendment rights.
at the close of the firearms trial,shrader requested that the court instruct the jury that t he mere proximity of the firearms to shrader goes only to the firearms accessibility and not to the dominion or control which must be proven in order to establish possession of the firearms.the district court instead instructed the jury that e vidence of the mere proximity of the firearms to shrader may establish only the firearms accessibility.however,the proximity of the firearms to shrader may also help to establish dominion and control depending on the inferences you draw from the evidence presented in the case.shrader counsel again objected,but was overruled,and shrader was convicted on july.
shrader filed a wide variety of motions prior to his stalking trial.first,he moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that was unconstitutionally vague.the district court disagreed,finding that the plain terms of the statute,which incorporate a specific intent requirement,were enough to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited.second,shrader filed a motion to elect,seeking to compel the government to proceed on only one of the stalking counts and arguing that the indictment was multiplicitous because the stalking statute unit of prosecution is the course of conduct that the defendant engaged in.again the district court disagreed,finding that the unambiguous terms of the statute define the unit of prosecution as the person,and that the same course of conduct could be prosecuted twice if the government could show two different mens rea on the part of a defendant to target two different victims.
on august,the defendant was convicted of both counts in the stalking trial.prior to his sentencing,shrader objected to the pre sentence report recommendation that he be sentenced under the armed career criminal act acca,e,due to his prior convictions for murder,wounding,and escape.the government conceded that the escape did not qualify as a felony under the acca,because it was not subject to a penalty of greater than one year.as to his other crimes,shrader conceded that they met the statutory definition of violent felonies,but disputed that they had been committed on different occasions,as the acca requires.in response,the government offered evidence that had been admitted at the stalking trial,including the testimony of and the defendant letter.shrader disputed the use of this evidence,arguing that it was not approved under the supreme court decision in shepard united states,d.the district court disagreed,finding that because the issue is not whether the crimes of conviction are violent crimes but whether or not they occurred on occasions separate from one another,shepard was inapplicable.finding that the evidence showed that the two murders and the wounding were indeed separate occasions,the district court sentenced shrader as an armed career criminal to months in prison followed by five years of supervised release.this appeal followed.we address each of the six issues that shrader raises in turn.
shrader first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the firearms recovered from the house he shared with his aunt.he contends that her consent to a search of their shared home was invalid because he had previously refused to consent to the search.when examining the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court legal determinations de novo and its factual conclusions for clear error.united states branch,cir.because the district court denied the defendant motion,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.id.
it has long been established that when the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent,it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant,but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over the premises.united states matlock,d.indeed,so long as the investigating officers reasonably though erroneously believe that the person who has consented to their entry is a resident of the premises,evidence obtained in such a search will not be suppressed.illinois rodriguez,d.
shrader does not dispute that his aunt had authority to consent to the search.he further acknowledges that her consent was voluntarily given.instead,he relies on the supreme court holding in georgia randolph,d,which held that a physically present inhabitant express refusal of consent to a police search is dispositive as to him,regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.id.at.
but shrader has failed to satisfy a key requirement of randolph he was not physically present to object to his aunt consent.the supreme court made clear that to defeat a cotenant consent,the defendant must be both present and objecting.id.at.the court decision is replete with references to the requirement that the defendant be standing at the door and expressly refusing consent at the time the police solicit entry from the cotenant.id.at see also id.at cotenant consent is invalid over the express refusal of consent by a physically present resident id.at search is invalid if a potential defendant with in objecting is in fact at the door.
of course,police may not seek to exploit this rule by remov ing the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.id.at.but there is no evidence that the police did so in this case.they went to the house for the express purpose of executing a valid warrant for shrader arrest,so his subsequent arrest and removal from the premises can not be considered a pretext for later seeking consent from his aunt.indeed,shrader concedes that there was no evidence in this case that the officers who took shrader away after his arrest did so to defeat his fourth amendment rights.appellant br.at.
shrader urges us,however,to expand the holding of randolph and conclude that his earlier refusal vitiates his aunt later consent,even though he was absent from the premises.physical presence may not be dismissed as a mere function of the facts of randolph,however.that presence reflected the widely shared social expectations that informed the court ruling.randolph,at.the court noted that a caller standing at the door of shared premises would have no confidence that one occupant invitation was a sufficiently good reason to enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying,stay out.id.at see also id.at t he wishing to open the door to a third party has no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail over a present and objecting.the court plainly gave careful thought to the scope of the physical presence requirement that it articulated 
w e are drawing a fine line if a potential defendant with in objecting is in fact at the door and objects,the permission does not suffice for a reasonable search,whereas the potential objector,nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy,loses out.this is the line we draw,and we think the formalism is justified.id.at.
this case falls squarely on the permissible side of the line.because shrader was absent from the premises,and there was no evidence that he was arrested for the purpose of nullifying his refusal to consent to the search,his aunt consent provided adequate permission for the police to search the house,notwithstanding his earlier objection.
in so holding,we join the seventh and eighth circuits in adhering to the clearly drawn rule of randolph and giving effect to the supreme court explicit requirement that the defendant be physically present to dispute his cotenant consent.see united states henderson,cir united states hudspeth,cir en banc.we decline to adopt the more expansive view of the ninth circuit which permits a defendant refusal to operate indefinitely,barring some objective manifestation that he has changed his position and no longer objects.united states murphy,cir.this latter approach raises practical problems.how broadly is constructive knowledge of a suspect prior refusal to consent to be imputed to other officers must a suspect expressly indicate that he has changed his mind in the future,or may that be assessed from the totality of the circumstances is there some point at which the passage of time renders a prior objection inoperative the murphy interpretation of randolph would involve courts in such questions,diverting attention from the basic social expectations that underlie not only the opinion in randolph,but the larger corpus of fourth amendment jurisprudence.careful observance of the requirement that an objecting cotenant be physically present thus not only shows fealty to the supreme court precedent,but also focuses police and courts on the customary norms that form the basis for this area of law.
at the close of the firearms trial,shrader challenged the district court refusal to give his proposed instruction to the jury with respect to his constructive possession of a firearm.the evidence at trial demonstrated that the firearms were located in a cabinet with a glass front in a dining room directly adjacent to the defendant bedroom.photographs showed that the gun cabinet was but a few feet from the entrance to shrader bedroom,visible through the open doorway.
moreover,the testimony of shrader cotenant,his aunt elizabeth jones,indicated that the firearms were under shrader control.jones lived in the house only.she testified that she was scared to death of guns she was even reluctant to look at them during her,and that she was unaware of whether the cabinet had a lock because she did mess with it.she explicitly stated that she never handled the guns and had even attempted to obscure the front of the gun cabinet with a cardboard box so she did not have to see the guns.she testified that she believed it was shrader who had obtained the weapons and brought them into the house and that it was just his hobby.
shrader counsel had requested that the court charge the jury that mere proximity of the firearms to shrader goes only to the firearms accessibility and not the dominion or control which must be proven in order to establish possession of the firearms.the court instead instructed the jury that e vidence of the mere proximity of the firearms to shrader may establish only the firearms accessibility.however,the proximity of the firearms to shrader may also help to establish dominion or control depending on the inferences you draw from the evidence in the case.
we review the district court refusal to give a proffered instruction for an abuse of discretion.united states lighty,cir.in order to conclude that the district court erred in refusing to give the requested charge,the defendant proposed instruction must be correct not substantially covered by the court charge and dealing with some point in the trial so important,that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to conduct his defense.united states passaro,cir.in assessing these factors,we may not minutely parse the district court words rather we consider whether taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge,the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.united states rahman,cir.
shrader contends his proposed instruction draws from united states blue,cir,in which we held that this court requires more evidence of dominion and control than mere proximity of the defendant to a firearm.id.at.but while we have held that proximity alone is not conclusive on the question of dominion and control,we have never held it to be irrelevant.on the contrary,we have repeatedly affirmed the right of juries to consider proximity as a part of their analysis of a defendant constructive possession.see,united states kimbrough,cir a could infer appellee possession of the gun from its presence in the basement where he lived.united states shorter,cir t he fact that the firearms and marijuana were found in shorter home permits an inference of constructive possession.
here,the district court instruction accurately stated the law,indeed more so than shrader proposed instruction.it would not fairly characterize our cases to inform the jury as shrader requested that mere proximity of the firearms to shrader goes only to the firearms accessibility and not the dominion or control emphasis added.that might leave jurors with the impression that once they had determined that the defendant had access to a firearm,they were to disregard its proximity in assessing his control over it.while proximity by itself is not enough,the nature of the proximity can be quite pertinent to what type and amount of additional evidence is required.thus,the district court accurately informed the jury that proximity alone goes only to accessibility,but when viewed in light of the remaining evidence in the case,can form part of the tableau that justifies a conviction based on constructive possession.
in addition,this court recently considered in united states herder,cir,whether a defendant in a constructive possession case was entitled as of right to a mere proximity instruction.in that case,the defendant,like shrader,relied on blue to request an instruction that mere proximity of contraband to an occupant is insufficient to establish constructive possession.id.at.the district court refused,and we affirmed,holding that so long as the instructions actually given to the jury plainly required proof of knowledge and control,the jury could not have erroneously convicted the defendant on the basis of proximity alone.id.at citing united states hendricks,cir united states vasquez,cir united states rojas,cir.
the district court here repeatedly emphasized the need for the jury to find knowing possession beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict.first,it accurately stated the law and defined knowing possession t he united states must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm.knowingly means voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.second,it applied that definition to the requirement of dominion or control a person who,although not in actual possession,knowingly has both the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing is then in constructive possession of it.finally,the district court emphasized the need to prove dominion or control t he united states must produce either direct or circumstantial evidence showing beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant ownership,dominion,or control over the firearms.in short,as in herder,there was no risk that the jury drew such impermissible inferences that it convicted shrader on the basis of proximity alone.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give shrader proposed instruction.
as to his stalking convictions,shrader argues that is unconstitutionally vague.the statute contains three important elements.first,the defendant must possess either the intent to kill,injure,harass,or place under surveillance with intent to kill,injure,harass,or intimidate,or cause substantial emotional distress to a person in another state,a,or the intent to place that person in reasonable fear of the death of,or serious bodily injury to that person,a member of the immediate family of that person,or a spouse or intimate partner of that person,id.b.second,the defendant must pursue that intention through a course of conduct,defined as a pattern of conduct composed of or more acts,evidencing a continuity of purpose,id,that makes use of a facility of interstate commerce,id.finally,the defendant conduct must in fact cause substantial emotional distress to the intended victim or place that person in reasonable fear of the death of,or serious bodily injury to any of the persons described above.id.
shrader contends that the first element of the statute is vague because the operative terms harass or intimidate are not explicitly defined.he similarly argues that the second element is vague because the statute fails to specify whether all acts in the required course of conduct must be committed with the specific intent of instilling fear.
we review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.united states sun,cir.a statute is impermissibly vague if it either fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado,d.in assessing these standards,perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required.ward rock against racism,d.instead,we consider whether a statute prohibitions are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary co
