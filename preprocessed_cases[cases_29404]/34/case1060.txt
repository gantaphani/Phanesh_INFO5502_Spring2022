jose erbo appeals his conviction in the united states district court for the southern district of new york baer,following a jury trial,for racketeering activities,c,conspiring to violate racketeering laws,in violation of d,conspiring to commit and committing murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a,using and carrying firearms in connection with the murders and conspiracies to commit murder,in violation of c,and conspiring to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute powder cocaine and crack,in violation of,a,b a,and.
erbo raises numerous challenges to his conviction and sentence,all but one of which we address in a summary order affirming the district court.in this opinion we address erbo contention that the admission of autopsy reports against a defendant who has had no opportunity to the author of the reports violates the defendant rights under the confrontation clause as articulated by the supreme court in crawford washington,d.because we conclude that autopsy reports are not testimonial within the meaning of crawford and,thus,do not come within the ambit of the confrontation clause,we find no constitutional error in the admission of the autopsy reports.
background 
from at least until,erbo led a violent cocaine distribution organization in new york city known as tito crew.erbo and other members of tito crew distributed large amounts of crack and cocaine and committed multiple murders.on february,the government charged erbo and others in a indictment,which included charges of racketeering as well as murder,and conspiracy to commit murder,in aid of racketeering.in september,he was convicted on weapons charges in the dominican republic and sentenced to imprisonment.upon his completion of that sentence in april,the dominican republic surrendered erbo to the united states pursuant to an extradition request.he subsequently pled not guilty,and trial commenced on may.
in order to establish the manner and cause of death for each of erbo victims in the charged homicides,the government offered nine autopsy reports through the testimony of james gill,an employee of the office of the chief medical examiner of new york medical examiner office.gill had not conducted any of the autopsies detailed in the reports.erbo,therefore,objected to the admission of the reports on the grounds that they were inadmissible hearsay and violated his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment.the district court admitted the autopsy reports over that objection,concluding that the government had established a proper foundation for their admission as business records.using the recorded observations in the autopsy reports,gill testified before the jury as to the causes of death of the nine victims.
on may,the jury found erbo guilty of the following i one count of racketeering,in violation of c ii one count of conspiracy to violate racketeering laws,in violation of d iii three counts of conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a iv three counts of murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a and v three counts of using and carrying a firearm in connection with a crime of violence,in violation of c and and vi one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute powder cocaine and crack,in violation of,a,b a,and.the district court sentenced erbo principally to six consecutive terms of life imprisonment,to be followed by a mandatory and consecutive term of imprisonment.
in this opinion,we address erbo argument that the district court erred in admitting the autopsy reports.although erbo does not challenge the district court determination that the autopsy reports were business records,he maintains that their admission violated his sixth amendment rights because he had no opportunity to the medical examiners who prepared them.well before crawford was decided,we considered this precise question in united states rosa,cir,and,guided in part by ohio roberts,d,we found no confrontation clause violation.erbo contends,however,that neither the result nor the rationale of rosa survives the supreme court decision in crawford.after erbo appealed,but before briefs were submitted to this court,crawford held that the confrontation clause prohibits the admission of,testimonial statements against a criminal defendant,unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant.crawford,at.the government argues erbo suffered no sixth amendment violation because the autopsy reports,like all business records,are nontestimonial.based in part on this court decision in united states saget,cir,erbo counters that the district court admission of the autopsy reports violated his right to confrontation because the reports,regardless of their classification as business records,contain testimonial statements and he had no opportunity to the medical examiners who prepared them we hold that the sole relevant inquiry under the confrontation clause is whether the autopsy reports are testimonial,and because we hold they are not,the district court properly admitted them into evidence.
discussion 
i.the confrontation clause analysis,before and after crawford 
the confrontation clause states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.prior to crawford,standards of reliability demarcated the boundaries of the confrontation clause protections.specifically,in ohio roberts,d,the court held that an statement of an unavailable hearsay declarant is constitutionally inadmissible unless it bears adequate indicia of reliability.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.it went on to hold that t o meet that test,evidence must either fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.crawford,at.quoting roberts,at.thus,under the roberts line of cases,a ny statement was constitutionally admissible so long as it fell within an exception to the hearsay rule or,if that exception was not firmly rooted,the court found that the statement was likely to be reliable.saget,at.
crawford,however,substantially alter ed the existing confrontation clause jurisprudence,saget,at,announcing a per se bar on the admission of a class of statements the supreme court labeled testimonial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to the declarant regarding the statement.crawford,at.united states stewart,cir united states logan,cir.crawford per se bar applies regardless of whether the testimonial statement falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.saget,at citing crawford,at.the court reasoned that the least where the statements are not intend to leave the sixth amendment protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence,much less to amorphous notions of reliability.crawford,at.see also id.at.dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.rather,w here testimonial statements are at issue,the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the constitution actually prescribes confrontation.id.at.
this being said,an open question remains in light of analysis of the admissibility of statements that are determined to be nontestimonial.in the wake of crawford this court assumed,and several of our sister circuits held,that the roberts reliability analysis continued to govern the admissibility of nontestimonial statements.see summers dretke,cir united states hinton,cir united states brun,cir united states franklin,cir horton allen,cir saget,at see also mungo duncan,cir suggesting that under roberts,nontestimonial hearsay deemed unreliable is barred by the confrontation clause.the supreme court,however,in davis made clear that the right to confrontation only extends to testimonial statements,or,put differently,the confrontation clause simply has no application to nontestimonial statements.see davis washington,d holding that the limitation with respect to testimonial hearsay is so clearly reflected in the text of the confrontation clause that it must mark out not merely its core,but its perimeter.
it is through this new lens,crawford as explicated by davis,that we must examine the admissibility of the autopsy reports.turning this lens on rosa,it becomes clear rosa the demands of confrontation are satisfied by the reliability of the proffered not survive crawford in rosa,we ruled simply that autopsy reports are admissible against a defendant who had no opportunity to the medical examiner who prepared them.rosa,at citing roberts,at.in reaching this decision,which preceded crawford,we did not ask whether autopsy reports were testimonial.instead,we based our decision on the reports reliability,reasoning the reported observations in autopsy reports bear sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the demands of the confrontation clause.id.at.now,after crawford and davis,indicia of reliability play no role in the confrontation clause analysis.rather,the inquiry under the confrontation clause is whether the statement at issue is testimonial.if so,the confrontation clause requirements of unavailability and prior apply.if not,the confrontation clause poses no bar to the statement admission.whether the admissibility of nontestimonial evidence also turns on an analysis of its reliability based on requirements rooted outside the rules of evidence,the particular guarantees of trustworthiness attendant to autopsy reports such as those at issue here and in rosa make it unnecessary to resolve that question in this case 
ii.crawford and the scope of testimonial evidence 
the crawford court declined to spell out a comprehensive definition of testimonial.crawford,at,but it did offer a number of observations that suggest the contours of that definition.first,the court noted that both the historical background and text of the confrontation clause indicate that the principal evil at which it was directed was the mode of criminal procedure,and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.id.at.according to the court,the sixth amendment and,presumably the term testimonial as well,must be interpreted with this focus in mind.id.at.consistent with that approach,the court suggested that an,overheard remark would not be testimonial under the sixth amendment because it bears little resemblance to the abuses the confrontation clause targeted.id.at.along the same lines,the court indicated that a statement produced through the i nvolvement of government officers and with an eye towards trial is testimonial because it presents a unique potential for prosecutorial fact borne out time and again through a history with which the framers were keenly familiar.id.at.
second,the court stated that v arious formulations of th e core class of testimonial statements exist ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,id.at,quoting brief for petitioner at extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions,id.at.quoting white illinois,d thomas,concurring and statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,id.at.quoting brief for of criminal def.lawyers et as amici curiae at.importantly,while noting that these three formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the clause coverage at various levels of abstraction around it,the court found it unnecessary to endorse any of them,because some statements qualify under any definition,davis.at quoting crawford,at.
third,the court provided several concrete examples of testimonial and nontestimonial statements.whatever else the term testimonial covers,it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing,before a grand jury,or at a former trial and to police interrogations.crawford,at.the court reasoned that t hese are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the confrontation clause was directed.id.in contrast,the court stated that m ost of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not example,business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.id.at.
relying on this final example,the government argues that crawford specifically excludes business records from the definition of testimonial.while this argument has superficial appeal,the supreme court several examples of what constitute testimonial statements and this court subsequent discussion of that same issue requires us to probe why it is that a business record,such as the autopsy reports at issue here,is not also testimonial and subject to the confrontation clause.at the outset,we acknowledge that several courts have rejected arguments similar to the government,characterizing crawford reference to business records as dicta and requiring a determination of whether the statements in the business records are testimonial.see,state crager,ohio app d,refusing to adopt a per se exclusion of all business records from scrutiny under crawford people mitchell,th,d,stating that the crawford court did not intend that all documentary evidence which could broadly qualify in some context as a business record automatically be considered.
iii.the autopsy reports are admissible as business records 
we disagree with these courts,however,holding instead that testimonial statements within the meaning of crawford and davis would not qualify as business records under fed.evid.stated differently,we hold that a statement properly admitted under fed.evid.can not be testimonial because a business record is fundamentally inconsistent with what the supreme court has suggested comprise the defining characteristics of testimonial evidence 
we look first to the definition of a business record.rule of the federal rules of evidence defines a business record as 
a memorandum,report,record,or data compilation,in any form,of acts,events,conditions,opinions,or diagnoses,made at or near the time by,or from information transmitted by,a person with knowledge,if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum,report,record or data compilation.
fed.evid.we know that because rule requires business records to be kept in the regular course of a business activity,records created in anticipation of litigation do not fall within its definition.see certain underwriters at lloyd,london sinkovich,cir noting that it is well established that documents made in anticipation of litigation are inadmissible under the business records exception.this court has further construed rule to exclude records in criminal cases containing observations made by police officers or other law enforcement personnel.see rosa,at citing united states oates,cir.
because business records can not be made in anticipation of litigation or include observations made by law enforcement personnel,they bear little resemblance to the abuses the confrontation clause targeted.crawford,at.see also id.at.stating that the principal evil at which the confrontation clause was directed was the mode of criminal procedure,and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.crawford itself suggests that the very same characteristics that preclude a statement classification as a business record are likely to render the statement testimonial.see id.at.describing as testimonial,statements produced through the i nvolvement of government officers and made with an eye towards trial.indeed,t he essence of the business record exception contemplated in crawford is that such records or statements are not testimonial in nature because they are prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted business and are by their nature not prepared for litigation.people durio,misc d,quoting crawford,at.see also united states,cir holding that a document ana
