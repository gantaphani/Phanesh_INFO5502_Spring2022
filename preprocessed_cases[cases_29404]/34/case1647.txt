lorenzo wilson appeals from his conviction for conspiracy to kidnap,in violation of c and,his sentence of life imprisonment for that offense,and the district court order denying his motions for a new trial.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
wilson,kenneth jamal lighty,and james everett flood,iii,were charged in a bill of indictment with kidnapping resulting in the death of eric hayes,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of a and count i,conspiracy to kidnap,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of c and count ii,and three counts of using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of c and counts iii,iv,and v,respectively.
wilson case was severed from the joint trial of lighty and flood because of statements wilson made implicating them.following a jury trial,wilson was convicted of count ii,conspiracy to kidnap,but acquitted of the other charges.wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.in their separate trial,lighty and flood were found guilty on all counts.flood was sentenced to life imprisonment on the kidnapping conviction and a year consecutive sentence on the remaining counts,while lighty received the death penalty for the kidnapping conviction and a consecutive year sentence on the remaining counts the parties noted separate,timely appeals,which were subsequently placed in abeyance pending the district court resolution of motions by wilson and lighty for a new trial.after a joint evidentiary hearing,the district court denied those motions,and both wilson and lighty noted timely appeals from those orders as well 
because the cases of wilson,lighty,and flood overlap in significant respects,not only in the underlying facts and evidence presented at the respective trials,but also in two of the legal issues raised,this opinion refers to or quotes without citation from our decision in lighty and flood appeal,united states lighty,and.a more detailed factual summary is contained in lighty.briefly,though,the evidence adduced at wilson trial showed the following.
on the evening of january,eric hayes also known as eazy and his friend,antoine forrest,were on eighth street,washington,when two men in a dark lincoln continental exited the vehicle and asked if they could purchase drugs.hayes walked with the men toward an alley in order to complete the transaction.after several minutes,forrest approached the alley and observed that one of the men from the lincoln was holding hayes at gunpoint over the front hood of the vehicle.the second man from the vehicle approached forrest,brandishing a firearm.forrest fled the scene,and when he returned a short time later,hayes,the other two men,and the lincoln were gone.
earlier in the evening,eugene scott also known as yogi went to his girlfriend apartment about a block from where hayes was later kidnapped.scott vehicle was stolen in front of his girlfriend apartment building.after reporting his car stolen to the police,scott went to the block of keating street,in the hillcrest heights area of temple hills,maryland.he observed an older model vehicle speeding down the street,which came to a screech ing halt,and its doors opened.scott started walking in the opposite direction when he heard a voice or voices from the vehicle saying,yogi is this him,shut up,and w hat the scott testified that he did not respond and left the scene.
at approximately the same evening,michael davis and robert smith,who both lived in the block of hillcrest parkway in temple hills,maryland,observed a dark lincoln continental parked at the end of that street adjacent to vacant land.davis saw the front passenger and rear passenger exit the vehicle and forcibly pull a man,later identified as hayes,out of the back passenger area of the vehicle.hayes was protesting no or do while on his knees,and then fell over after davis heard what sounded like two gunshots.davis testified that after the shots were fired,the passengers of the vehicle reentered the vehicle on the passenger side and the vehicle departed.smith also testified that he saw hayes being shot that evening.smith was located further away from the vehicle than davis location.smith saw two individuals exit from the passenger side of the vehicle,and heard gunshots,after which one person reentered the vehicle on the passenger side.smith and davis separately approached the area where hayes body lay,and placed calls to report the incident.telephone records introduced into evidence showed a call placed at reporting hayes body.police subsequently retrieved two caliber shell casings from the scene.
between and,did not own a cell flood cell phone at least seven times to communicate with his girlfriend,krystal phauls.wilson instructed phauls to meet him on iverson street in heights,a location less than two miles from where hayes was shot.phauls and her friend melissa coles drove to iverson street in phauls vehicle,and picked up wilson,lighty,and as the final telephone call between flood and phauls cell phones ended approximately.
the three men sat in the back seat of phauls vehicle.lighty,seated in the middle,held a pair of nike shoes and had blood on his.the men talked about having done something bad or killed someone.at their direction,phauls drove to the block of keating street,the same location where scott had earlier seen an older model vehicle and heard voices asking him is this him.the men got out of the vehicle,looked at the ground,and one of them said something about blood.phauls then dropped lighty off at an apartment complex in hillcrest heights and returned to her home coles departed,and phauls and wilson went to dinner.
on returning to phauls home after dinner,wilson told phauls that he had driven flood vehicle when he,lighty,and flood grabbed the boy eazy on street.wilson assured phauls he had not killed the boy,and said lighty had shot him.as phauls and wilson spoke,a black pager went off.wilson looked at it,said,the guy was lying,his name is eazy,and phauls saw that the screen said eazy on it.
the next day wilson telephoned phauls and told her to turn on the television.she did so,and the news was reporting hayes murder.phauls asked wilson if he had done it,and wilson again told her he had only driven the vehicle,and that lighty had shot hayes.
wilson also told his friend that he had participated in the hayes kidnapping.cw testified wilson said he was riding with lighty and flood and someone else and that the men road up street and lighty got out of the car,and asked a guy for some drugs or something.when the guy went and got the drugs or whatever,when he was coming back towards lighty,lighty snatched him,pulled out his gun,made the dude get in the car,and they pulled off.
on january,less than one month after the hayes kidnapping and murder,lighty and wilson were involved in a shooting on afton street in temple hills,maryland the afton street shooting,which resulted in the death of antoine newbill.over wilson objection,the government introduced evidence of the afton street shooting,including wilson confession to cw to having participated in the event,eyewitness testimony regarding the shooting,and ballistics evidence regarding the firearms used in the shooting.that evidence is described in greater detail below and in the lighty opinion.
lighty was arrested on the evening of january.at the time of his arrest,he was carrying a caliber handgun.phauls testified that wilson told her of lighty arrest and that he said lighty had been arrested with the gun that he used to kill the two boys with.cw also testified that after lighty was arrested,wilson told him the handgun lighty had been arrested with had a body or two on it from afton street and eighth street.
brett mills,an fbi firearms examiner,analyzed the two caliber shell casings recovered from the hayes murder scene,a caliber shell casing recovered from the afton street shooting scene,and the handgun seized from lighty at the time of his arrest.based on his analysis,mills was able to conclude that the shell casing recovered from the afton street shooting was fired by lighty caliber handgun to the exclusion of all other firearms.mills also concluded that the two caliber shell casings recovered from the hayes murder scene shared numerous rifling characteristics in common with shell casings from lighty caliber handgun.however,he could not conclude to the exclusion of all other firearms that lighty handgun had fired the shell casings recovered from the hayes murder scene.similarly,while bullets retrieved from hayes body were consistent with and possessed similar rifling characteristics to bullets fired from lighty gun,mills could not make a definitive conclusion that lighty handgun had fired those bullets 
laron locke,a medical examiner,examined lighty caliber handgun and concluded that one of the abrasions found on hayes matched the barrel portion of lighty handgun and that another patterned abrasion matched the clip release of the handgun.locke concluded these abrasions were consistent with hayes being struck by lighty caliber handgun.
on appeal,wilson raises four issues relating to the conduct of his trial and sentencing hearing,three of which warrant discussion first,he asserts the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce evidence of an unrelated afton street the trial.second,he contends the government violated his due process rights by making certain prejudicial statements during closing argument.third,wilson claims he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the district court improperly relied on a written statement he made to investigators.we address each issue in turn.
wilson first argues the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce evidence of the afton street shooting,which he maintains should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence b as evidence of other wrongs or acts solely to prove wilson bad character.we review the district court admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion.united states.basham,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or irrationally,fails to consider recognized factors constraining its exercise of discretion,relies on erroneous factual or legal premises,or commits an error of law.united states delfino,cir.
prior to trial,wilson moved in limine to exclude evidence of the afton street shooting.the district court denied the motion without prejudice,concluding that wilson statements that lighty had been arrested with the firearm used in both the hayes and afton street shootings was enough to get the afton street shooting evidence in.and it not even a b issue at that point.it strictly a matter of an important part of the first crime being identified two,three weeks later in another context.
as noted earlier,both phauls and cw testified at trial that wilson told them the caliber handgun in lighty possession when he was arrested had been used to kill two males,one of whom was hayes.during the course of cw testimony,the government elicited additional information regarding the afton street shooting.cw testified that wilson told him that he and a couple of guys went to afton street and started shooting at a crowd of guys down there in order to confront a man known as.according to what wilson told cw,they pulled up,wilson window was rolled down and he started firing at.wilson claimed to have two guns in his hand,and cw recalled that wilson thought one of them was probably a or a,and the other one was probably a.
thomas hart,one of the afton street shooting victims,then testified that he,newbill,and a man known as were standing on the street when a ford taurus drove by and shots were fired at them from the front passenger side and the rear of the car.was not injured.hart was shot in the foot,the arm,and the chest,and newbill died as a result of gunshot wounds he received.
after cw and hart testimony,but before the introduction of other evidence regarding the afton street shooting,wilson renewed his objection to the admission of any evidence of the afton street shooting.the district court again overruled the objection,but gave the following limiting instruction 
you have heard testimony about the shooting of anthony newbill on afton street.you are instructed that wilson,the defendant in this case,is not charged with that offense and you may not consider that evidence to indicate that wilson has a propensity to commit crimes or is otherwise a bad character.
the evidence of the newbill murder may be considered by you in this case only insofar as it may indicate wilson knowledge of the weapon used in the hayes kidnapping and wilson presence and involvement in the hayes kidnapping.
the government then called marlon hines,who lived off of afton street and was in his home the day of the shooting,as a witness.hines described hart,newbill,and entering his home after the gunshots were fired.newbill told hines he could not catch his breath and that he thought he was shot.hines testified that newbill died in his hines home shortly thereafter.hines also described an incident a day or two before the shooting.he and newbill were driving together on afton street when hines observed,wilson,lighty,and another man engaged in a heated argument.
mills,the fbi ballistics expert,testified concerning similarities between the caliber shell casings retrieved from the scene of the afton street shooting and the hayes murder ballistic evidence.in addition,he testified that the caliber handgun lighty had on his person at the time of his arrest conclusively matched shell casings retrieved from the scene of the afton street shooting.
during the final jury instructions,the district court reiterated its limiting instruction with regard to the afton street shooting evidence 
now you heard testimony about the shooting of anthony newbill on afton street.you are instructed that the defendant,lorenzo anthony wilson,is not charged with that offense in this case.you may not consider that evidence to indicate that wilson has a propensity to commit crimes or is otherwise a bad character.
the evidence of the newbill murder may be considered by you in this case only insofar as it may indicate the defendant knowledge of the weapon that was used in the eric hayes kidnapping and insofar as it may indicate the defendant presence at and involvement in eric hayes kidnapping.
wilson challenges the admission of all of the afton street shooting evidence at his trial he contends this evidence is classic propensity evidence and should have been excluded under rule b and rule.he asserts evidence of the afton street shooting was not necessary to provide context to wilson statements connecting lighty caliber handgun to the afton street shooting and hayes shooting because those statements are only relevant to the extent they showed wilson knowledge of the firearm use in hayes murder.wilson further asserts that the afton street shooting evidence was not necessary to establish identity because the identity of hayes shooter lighty was not in dispute during wilson trial.lastly,he contends the afton street shooting evidence was unfairly prejudicial because it placed wilson at the center of a shooting wholly unrelated to the hayes murder.accordingly,he contends the evidence impermissibly invited the jury to infer that wilson was more likely to have participated in the hayes kidnapping based on his role in this other crime.
federal rule of evidence b states,in relevant part 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident 
importantly,rule b is an inclusive rule,admitting all evidence of other crimes or acts except that which tends to prove only criminal disposition.united states young,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have adopted a test for assessing the admissibility of evidence under rule b it must be relevant to an issue other than character it must be necessary to prove an element of the crime charged it must be reliable and it must be admissible under rule,in that the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.united states queen,cir see also united states hines,cir test applies to acts occurring after the charged conduct.
rule b does not limit the admission of evidence of acts intrinsic to the crime charged.united states chin,cir.other acts are intrinsic when they are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.e vidence is inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense if it forms an integral and natural part of the witness accounts of the circumstances surrounding the offenses for which the defendant was indicted.united states edouard,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the afton street shooting evidence was not admissible as an intrinsic act because it was not inextricably intertwined to hayes kidnapping and murder that evidence was not an integral and natural part of any witness account of the circumstances surrounding hayes kidnapping and murder.the only connection between the two shootings occurred in cw testimony relating wilson statements that the caliber handgun in lighty possession at his arrest had been used to kill two men,one of whom was hayes although some of the information regarding the afton street shooting may have been a natural part of cw explanation of what wilson statement meant,it was by no means an integral part of cw testimony.the salient evidence at the trial was cw testimony about wilson knowledge of what firearm had been used to shoot hayes.cw protracted explanation of the second shooting to which wilson referred,which included wilson confession to participating in the afton street shooting,a description of that event,and cw identification of the individuals involved in the earlier confrontation,was not integral to his testimony regarding wilson statements connecting lighty gun to the two shootings.any integral part of cw testimony about the afton street shooting ended once he recited wilson statement that the same gun was used in both instances.
the testimony of hart,hines,and the law enforcement personnel was even more tangential than cw testimony.their testimony did not connect the afton street shooting and the hayes kidnapping and murder because no connection existed.the events occurred at different times,at different places,and involved completely different motives.these witnesses provided absolutely no testimony about the hayes kidnapping and murder.
the afton street shooting evidence was not inextricably intertwined with the government case against wilson for the hayes kidnapping and murder.see united states stephens,cir holding that evidence that acted together to create and register a website patterned after the official red cross website was not intrinsic to the charged crimes of identity theft and wire fraud stemming from the creation and use of a website patterned after the official salvation army website united states eckhardt,cir holding that evidence of uncharged threatening telephone calls made during were not inextricably intertwined with the charged offense of making threatening phone calls between and because the defendant crime could be fully presented via the interstate phone calls he made during the charged time frame.
we now turn to whether the afton street shooting evidence was admissible into evidence under the test for rule b.queen,at.the government posits that the afton street shooting evidence was relevant and necessary because it explained and substantiated wilson two bodies statements to phauls and cw,and thus showed wilson knowledge,intent and identity as a participant in the hayes kidnapping and murder.assuming,without deciding,that wilson statements make the afton street shooting evidence relevant,we conclude that the admission of this evidence was not necessary to prove an element of the crime charged the admission of the afton street shooting evidence was therefore error.
evidence is necessary where,considered in the light of other evidence available to the government,it is an essential part of the crimes on trial,or where it furnishes part of the context of the crime.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the only information from the afton street shooting evidence probative to wilson participation in the charged offenses was his knowledge that lighty caliber handgun had been used to shoot hayes.wilson knowledge that lighty weapon had also been used in an unrelated shooting does not add anything to that evidence.moreover,because the government had lighty caliber handgun,it ballistics evidence supporting the conclusion that the firearm had indeed been used in the hayes kidnapping and,as discussed below,the government had wilson confessions to phauls and cw admitting his participation in the hayes kidnapping and murder,as well as a host of other circumstantial evidence showing that he participated in that offense.it can not be said,then,that the afton street shooting evidence was necessary to the government case against wilson.there was simply nothing about the afton street shooting evidence that was an essential part of the crimes on trial,particularly in view of the mountains of b evidence introduced at trial.compare united states mccallum,cir finding other acts evidence unnecessary where government presented extensive physical and testimonial evidence on the same issue,with united states dizenzo,cir finding other acts evidence necessary where that evidence furnished more dependable proof than sparse intrinsic evidence.because the afton street shooting evidence fails the necessity requirement for admissibility under rule b,we need not analyze the remaining requirements,as the district court abused its discretion as a matter of law in admitting the evidence.
however,whether this error requires reversal of the judgment depends upon whether admission of the afton street shooting evidence was harmless error.where error is founded on a violation of rule b,the test for harmlessness is whether we can say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states madden,cir quoting united states nyman,cir.this inquiry is not whether,absent the improperly admitted evidence,sufficient evidence existed to convict.id.rather,the inquiry is whether we can say that we believe it highly probable that the error did not affect the judgment.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
having reviewed the record of wilson trial,we conclude with fair assurance that the admission of the afton street shooting evidence did not affect the judgment against him.the evidence of wilson participation in the conspiracy to kidnap hayes was overwhelming.wilson confessed to his role in the kidnapping to two individuals,phauls and cw.their testimony about wilson confession was substantially the same,and was consistent with other evidence in the record.wilson admitted to phauls and cw that he drove flood vehicle during the course of the kidnapping,which began when lighty grabbed someone named eazy on eighth street.during wilson confession to phauls,a text pager started to ring,and did not own a at it,said,t he guy was lying,his name is eazy,and phauls observed that the name eazy was scrolling across the screen.forrest corroborated that hayes had been kidnapped off of eighth street,that hayes nickname was eazy,and that hayes owned a pager.wilson said that lighty shot hayes,and that lighty had been arrested with the firearm he used to shoot hayes.ballistics evidence indicated the caliber handgun lighty possessed at the time he was arrested shared numerous rifling characteristics with the firearm used to shoot hayes.
in addition to testifying about wilson confession,phauls also provided a account of wilson actions later on the evening of hayes death.phauls and her friend coles testified that wilson called phauls in the time frame of the kidnapping and asked her to pick him up off of iverson street.wilson did not own a cell phone,and phauls did not know flood or recognize the calling number.telephone records confirmed that numerous telephone calls were placed between phauls and flood cell phones at,and on the night of the hayes kidnapping and murder 
upon arriving at iverson street as the call was ending,phauls and coles observed lighty,flood,and wilson walking away from a house on iverson street neither woman knew flood,but he was introduced by his nickname junebug.the women observed that lighty carried a pair of nike shoes that matched the description of the shoes hayes was wearing the evening of his murder in addition,lighty had blood on his.while in the car,lighty,flood,and wilson discussed having done something bad or killed someone.at wilson direction,phauls drove to the same block of keating street where scott had earlier seen an older model car pull up and voices inquire,i s this him when phauls stopped her vehicle,the three men exited the car and checked the ground for blood.
against this evidence,we are confident wilson conviction was not substantially swayed by the errant admission of the afton street shooting evidence.two additional factors lend further support to this conclusion,the jury instructions and limited use of the evidence.the district court issued two cautionary instructions limiting how the jury was to use the afton street shooting evidence.those instructions expressly informed the jury that it could not infer from the afton street shooting evidence that wilson had a propensity to commit crimes or is otherwise a bad character.in addition,the instructions informed the jury that the evidence was relevant only to establish wilson presence and involvement in hayes kidnapping and murder.during her closing argument,the assistant united states attorney ausa referred to the afton street shooting on three separate,but brief,occasions during a closing argument that spans almost sixty pages of trial transcript.and on two of those occasions,she reminded the jury of the limited context in which the jury should consider the afton street shooting,connecting the evidence to wilson two bodies statement and the forensics evidence which tended to support the veracity of that statement.the government use of the afton street shooting evidence was thus brief,and directed the jury attention to a very narrow conclusion to be drawn from it.
as we recognized and cautioned with regard to lighty,the admission of evidence of an uncharged murder is undoubtedly prejudicial.see,chin,at.even assuming some information about the afton street shooting was relevant or provided context to cw testimony,the testimony of hart and hines,which detailed the afton street shooting and its aftermath,was not.moreover,none of the afton street shooting evidence was necessary to prove an element of the charged crime.however,given the strength of the government case and the extensive evidence of wilson guilt,the ausa limited use of the evidence during the trial,and the court cautionary instructions to the jury,we are satisfied that the erroneous introduction of the afton street shooting did not affect the jury verdict 
wilson next contends the district court erred in allowing the government to make improper statements during closing argument,and thereby denied him a fair trial.he points to three statements made by the ausa that he asserts misstated the law of conspiracy in describing what wilson did to help make this crime succeed,the ausa recounted phauls testimony from wilson in the minutes,seconds of hayes death to get him with his out of there.the ausa also noted that c are agents of one another,and explained that was why the jury hear d all the testimony about the acts of the other people in this case.you heard about flood acts.what did he do afterward he drove by the crime scene,according to tynika marshall,right.and in rebuttal,the ausa described phauls and coles testimony that they picked up lighty,flood,and wilson and that one of the men directed them to keating street.acknowledging that coles testimony as to which man directed phauls to drive to keating street differed during the trial and at the grand jury,the ausa argued i t does matter.they lighty,flood,and wilson are.wilson argues these statements wrongly suggested that he could be convicted of conspiracy to kidnap based on actions that occurred after hayes had been killed and thus misstated the law of conspiracy,thereby depriving him of substantive due process and his right to a fair trial 
consistent with supreme court precedent,we have recognized that a prosecutor improper argument may so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.united states wilson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether remarks by the prosecutor during closing argument violate a defendant due process rights,the court must consider whether the remarks were,in fact,improper,and,if so,whether the improper remarks so prejudiced the defendant substantial rights that the defendant was denied a fair trial.id.an assessment of prejudice requires the court to consider the degree to which the prosecutor remarks have a tendency to mislead the jury and to prejudice the accused whether the remarks were isolated or extensive absent the remarks,the strength of competent proof introduced to establish the guilt of the accused whether the comments were deliberately placed before the jury to divert attention to extraneous matters whether the prosecutor remarks were invited by improper conduct of defense counsel and whether curative instructions were given to the jury.united states scheetz,cir.
read in context,the ausa statements do not satisfy this high burden and did not deny wilson a fair trial.wilson argument takes these statements out of context,isolating them not only from the ausa surrounding remarks,but also from the other crimes for which wilson was being tried.although wilson was only convicted of conspiracy to kidnap,he was tried on four additional charges,all of which were substantive criminal offenses.indeed,the first two of the foregoing statements wilson challenges occurred while the ausa was reviewing theories of liability the pinkerton and aiding and abetting relevant to the substantive,i,charges.the ausa statements were not misstatements as to the law of conspiracy because they did not address how wilson could be held liable for participating in the conspiracy.in describing the pinkerton theory,the prosecutor noted that the doctrine made sense because c oconspirators are agents of one another and that was why the jury heard evidence about what the other members of the conspiracy did.next,the ausa addressed liability as an aider and abettor,and described that under that theory wilson could be convicted of a substantive offense committed by a principal if he had willfully and knowingly sought by some act to make the crime succeed.the crime the ausa referred to was not conspiracy,but rather the substantive offenses delineated in counts i,iii,iv,and v.in fact,the ausa specifically excluded the conspiracy charge from her description,noting her reference was not the conspiracy charge,because that kind of a different legal concept.contrary to wilson argument,the ausa did not assert that events were sufficient to convict wilson of the conspiracy to kidnap 
the third statement wilson challenges is the ausa explanation for a purported inconsistency in the testimony about which passenger told phauls to drive to keating street.the ausa stated that it did not matter which man told phauls where to drive because the men were.the comment does not,as wilson contends,improperly argue that he could be guilty of conspiracy based on events after hayes death.rather,the ausa statement responded to wilson closing argument drawing attention to the inconsistency and suggested a reason short of fabricated testimony to explain it.the ausa fleeting mention of the men being was not the focus of her discussion at that time,as she immediately turned to an explanation of how individuals often recollect details of the same events differently.
the ausa closing arguments did not misstate the law of conspiracy or otherwise mislead the jury,nor did it prejudice wilson trial so as to deny him due process.accordingly,there was no error by the district court.
wilson next contends that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing because his sentence was based,in part,on what he contends was an involuntary,and therefore inadmissible,statement he made to civilian investigators.approximately eighteen months after the hayes kidnapping,fbi agent joseph bradley and prince george county police department detectives sean chaney and michael straughan,questioned wilson at schofield barracks,honolulu,hawaii,where wilson was then stationed with the united states army.prior to interrogating him,the investigators read aloud to wilson an advice of rights form that informed wilson,inter alia,of his right to remain silent.they then had wilson read aloud the paragraph describing waiver of rights in order to ascertain that wilson read and understood english.wilson signed the form indicating that he understood his rights he then proceeded to answer the investigators questions and set forth his account of the hayes kidnapping and murder in a statement written statement or statement.
prior to trial,wilson moved to suppress the written statement,arguing it was involuntarily made.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court held that the statement was voluntarily made and admissible at trial.despite the court ruling,the government elected not to introduce the written statement into evidence against wilson at trial based on its belief that portions of the statement were untruthful 
during the sentencing hearing,the parties disputed what offense level the conspiracy conviction constituted under the sentencing guidelines.if wilson was held responsible for a conspiracy to kidnap resulting in hayes death the offense level would be higher than if he was simply held responsible for a conspiracy to kidnap.the parties disagreed as to the extent of wilson role in the conspiracy to kidnap and what evidence the district court could consider in resolving this dispute.both the government and wilson referred to the written statement in order to bolster their respective positions,with the government contending it showed wilson involvement throughout the conspiracy,and wilson contending it showed he only played a limited role late in the course of the conspiracy.
the district court referred to the written statement as part of its explanation for concluding wilson could be held responsible for hayes death and that the offense level should be set at the higher level.the court observed that it did not accept everything the defendant says in the written statement as gospel on this.the things that are clearly incriminating to him,i inclined to accept.the other items in which i find him incriminated are really supplied by other people.expounding on this view,the court stated 
i think wilson clearly was trying to position himself to be out of the murder when he gave the statement,but he the government says,he stepped directly into the conspiracy when he did that but the reality is that all these people are telling different stories i mean they all trying to pass the buck here in terms of where they are.
wilson asserts the district court erred in relying on the written statement during sentencing because it was involuntarily made as a matter of law.he contends he could not waive his right to remain silent,as he was under a direct military order to answer the investigators questions.relying on two united states court of military appeals states dohle,and united states duga,he asserts that when a superior commands a subordinate to answer a question,the subordinate may rightly be regarded as having been deprived of his freedom to answer or to remain silent.he further contends the civilian investigators separate warning of wilson constitutional rights had no effect on that military order requiring him to make a statement because a civilian can not countermand a military order.
we review the district court factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.united states perkins,cir.
wilson argument lacks merit.the two cases he relies on,dohle and duga,are inapposite,addressing a military accused rights under article of the code of military justice rather than his constitutional right to remain silent.moreover,they involve the rights of a military accused when he is questioned by other members of the military rather than when he is questioned by investigators,as occurred here.dohle,at w e hold that where a person subject to the code requests a statement from an accused or suspect over whom the questioner has some position of authority of which the accused or suspect is aware,the accused or suspect must be advised in accordance with article.duga,at.neither case supports the broad proposition wilson advances regarding the legal capacity of a member of the military to waive his constitutional right to silence in questioning by civilian authority.wilson does not cite did we other authority that would support the broad proposition he advances.
the record supports the district court conclusion that wilson statement was voluntarily made after the civilian authorities informed wilson of his constitutional right to remain silent.at the hearing on the motion to suppress,wilson testified that he believe d he was being ordered to speak to the men that were in that room that day.however,the district court concluded that wilson testimony was not credible,and its determination was not clearly erroneous.no other evidence in the record supports wilson testimony or the conclusion that wilson commanding officer ordered him not just to show up at the interview,but also specifically to provide a statement to the investigators.
moreover,the circumstances surrounding the interview show that the civilian authorities informed wilson of his right to remain silent,and he voluntarily waived that right.agent bradley and officer chaney testified that wilson was not handcuffed prior to or during the interview no military personnel were present during the interview.both described wilson as being eager to tell his side of the story,and that agent bradley had to stop wilson from speaking in order to mirandize him prior to speaking with him.agent bradley read wilson the fbi version of the advice of rights word for word.in addition,at agent bradley request,wilson read the waiver of rights paragraph aloud.wilson then signed the advice of rights form,spoke with the investigators,and provided the written statement.on this record,the district court did not err in determining wilson knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent.accordingly,the written statement was admissible,and the district court did not err in using it in determining wilson sentence.
wilson contends the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on evidence and a separate alleged violation.federal rule of criminal procedure authorizes motions for a new trial based on such evidence,permitting district courts to vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.such motions should be awarded,sparingly,as a jury verdict is not to be overturned except in the rare circumstance when the evidence weighs heavily against it.united states smith,cir quoting united states perry,cir.
we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.perry,at.in so doing,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the district court rather,we must determine whether the court exercise of discretion,considering the law and the facts,was arbitrary or capricious.united states fulcher,cir quoting united states mason,cir.
wilson moved for a new trial based on an alleged brady violation.he asserts the government unlawfully withheld a copy of police notes summarizing lighty statements to the police following his january,arrest at the time of his arrest,lighty was in possession of a firearm the police notes indicate that lighty stated he shot the one time in the air during the newbill shooting.wilson posits that he was entitled to the police notes as brady material because lighty statement contradicted cw testimony that wilson told him he had shot the during the newbill shooting.wilson asserts that in addition to using the statement to impeach cw testimony,he could have used lighty statement to argue against the admission of ballistics evidence connecting the to the newbill and hayes shootings.he contends that lighty statement takes the out of wilson hands and without being able to make that connection,the government would not have been able to introduce evidence that the was used during the newbill shooting and was consistent with the weapon used during the hayes kidnapping.
the district court denied wilson motion for a new trial,explaining that lighty statement did not exculpate wilson in any way and was not favorable to him in the brady sense.it does tend to show that he not guilty of conspiracy to kidnap.supp.in addition,the court noted there were no corroborating circumstances of the trustworthiness of lighty statement and the result would not have been different had this statement been made available to wilson at his trial.supp.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying wilson motion in brady,the supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.in order to prove that the government failure to tender certain evidence constitutes a brady violation,the burden rested on wilson to show that the undisclosed evidence was favorable to him either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching material to the defense,prejudice must have ensued and that the prosecution had materials and failed to disclose them.united states stokes,cir.
lighty statement is not brady material because it is neither exculpatory nor material evidence is exculpatory and favorable if it may make the difference between conviction and acquittal had it been disclosed and used effectively.united states bagley.evidence is material if it is likely to have changed the verdict.moseley branker,cir.
lighty statement fails on both fronts because it has no bearing on wilson participation in the hayes kidnapping and therefore provides no information relevant to the offense wilson was convicted of to kidnap hayes.the statement does not contradict any of the evidence introduced to prove wilson participation in the hayes conspiracy.moreover,lighty statement does not diminish the relevance of cw testimony that wilson stated the caliber handgun had two bodies on it,thereby establishing wilson knowledge that this firearm had been used in both the newbill and hayes shootings.at most,lighty statement places the in lighty hands at some point during the newbill shooting that evidence is not inconsistent with wilson participation in the conspiracy to kidnap hayes.and it is also consistent with cw testimony about wilson confession regarding the newbill shooting because cw testimony on who shot which firearm was equivocal,from what i recall,i think one of the two guns cw fired during the newbill shooting was probably a or a,and the other one was probably a.emphasis added.even had wilson possessed lighty statement at trial,it simply can not be said that it would have effectively made a difference in the verdict against wilson.
accordingly,lighty statement was neither exculpatory nor material,and it does not constitute brady material.for this reason,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying wilson motion for a new trial based on the government failure to turn over the statement to wilson prior to trial.
wilson also moved for a new trial on the basis of evidence in the form of testimony from as well as cw recantation of parts of his trial testimony regarding lighty and wilson.the district court held a joint evidentiary hearing to determine the nature of this evidence and consider both lighty and wilson motions for a new trial.the evidence presented at that hearing is discussed in greater detail in the court opinion in lighty at section.
briefly synopsizing that testimony,in july,jm was arrested on felony gun charges.jm was a frequent informant for law enforcement officials,and at the time of his arrest he the first concerning the hayes kidnapping and murder alleging that tony mathis rather than wilson,lighty,and flood was the responsible party jm testified that on the evening of hayes murder he and a friend were walking down iverson street when they saw a few people standing by a vehicle with its trunk open.he identified mathis and other individuals he recognized,but he did not see lighty or wilson,both of whom he knew.as he approached mathis,jm saw there was a body in the trunk and decided to leave the area.a few days later,jm saw mathis and confronted him about acting stupid and wilding out when he saw him the evening of january.mathis responded by stating,you know,niggers think it sweet.they think they can just holler at a baby mother and get away with it.jm took this to mean mathis was upset about hayes trying to holler at mathis baby mother,so he set him up and killed him.jm acknowledged,however,that mathis never told him he kidnapped or murdered hayes.when questioned about lighty and wilson participation,jm testified,your honor,i not saying that lighty or wilson was a party to what ultimately happened.i just know what i saw that night.they were there.and i know that tony mathis had motive,all the motive in the world,to commit the crime.
in february,cw was interviewed by lighty counsel and signed a declaration recanting parts of his trial testimony against lighty.he claimed that he had lied about lighty confessing to the shooting because he was facing serious charges.in the written statement cw signed at the time of this interview,he stated,the only other person who was rumored to be involved in this case who spoke to me about it directly was tony mathis.because cw asserted his fifth amendment rights,he did not testify at the evidentiary hearing.george steel,a private investigator for lighty counsel,was present during cw interview and testified regarding the circumstances surrounding the statements.steel testified that cw said he was recanting because it was the right thing to do and not because of any threats he had received as a result of his trial testimony.when asked whether cw made any comments recanting the testimony he gave against wilson,steel stated,i do remember making that conclusion or asking any questions about that.
after considering this evidence and hearing the parties arguments,the district court denied wilson motion.in reaching its decision,the district court reiterated the proper standard for a motion for a new trial and concluded that the new evidence did not satisfy wilson burden to meet that standard.the court noted many reasons to doubt jm testimony,including the length of time that had passed before he came forward,the similarity between his testimony and previous testimony he had provided as an informant in unrelated cases,and discrepancies between jm testimony and prior statements he had made regarding what he claimed to have seen.moreover,in light of the overwhelming evidence against wilson presented at trial,the district court concluded that jm testimony would not have made a difference in the outcome of the trial.
with regard to cw recantation,the district court determined that cw extensive prior statements had greater credibility and corroborating evidence than his current recantation.the court also noted threats cw had received as a result of his testimony at the trials and the significant fact that mathis had died in the intervening period between cw trial testimony and recantation.
in determining whether a new trial should be granted on the basis of newly discovered evidence,the court uses a test 
a the evidence must be,in fact,newly discovered,discovered since the trial b facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the movant c the evidence relied on must not be merely cumulative or impeaching d it must be material to the issues involved and e it must be such,and of such nature,a
