appellant israel ernesto palacios homie was convicted by a jury of a number of crimes arising from his involvement in the street gang la mara salvatrucha,otherwise known as ms.specifically,the jury found him guilty of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise,in violation of d conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c and murder resulting from the use of a firearm in a crime of violence,in violation of j.he raises various challenges to these convictions on appeal,focusing on the district court admission of certain testimony and the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and the violent crimes in aid of racketeering act vicar.finding palacios arguments unpersuasive,we affirm.
we begin our discussion with an overview of the history,organization,and structure of ms,to which palacios belonged.we then set forth the facts underlying palacios convictions,followed by a description of his indictment and trial.
ms is a transnational gang formed by el salvadorian immigrants in los angeles,california in the originally organized to protect its members from being preyed upon by other gangs in southern california,ms grew into a larger organization characterized by intimidation and violence.enhancing its reputation for violence became the gang primary purpose.ms eventually expanded into central america,mexico,canada,and other areas of the united states.in addition to los angeles,ms strongholds in this country include metropolitan washington,including northern virginia and southern maryland long island,new york houston,texas boston,massachusetts and north carolina.this case involves ms activities in and around prince george county,maryland.
although ms members are affiliated with their counterparts throughout north america,the gang is organized into smaller subgroups or cliques that operate locally.each clique has its own leadership,conducts its own meetings,and is permitted to create rules in addition to but not in place of the rules of the broader gang.cliques are run by a leader,known as the first word a gang member who assumes the role of second in command,known as the second word and a treasurer or secretary.clique leaders gather periodically at regional meetings led by bosses,known as ranfleros.at these meetings,clique leaders share information about law enforcement activities in their areas,settle arguments,and discipline members who have violated gang rules.ranfleros also relay directives from top ms leaders who reside outside the united states.
the gang utilizes uniform rules,regulations,and throughout the many territories in which it is located.for example,the method of initiation into the gang is the same throughout its various iterations a prospective ms member is beaten for seconds to signify the beginning of a new,more brutal lifestyle.united states ayala,cir.gang members are required to fight and,if possible,kill members of rival gangs.those who have been initiated into ms may not assist law enforcement,and they are prohibited from using numbers or colors associated with rival gangs.ms members are required to attend local clique meetings and pay dues.these dues are used for,among other things,sending money to gang members in other countries,financing attorneys for gang members who have been arrested,and buying weapons or other equipment for the use of the gang.cliques maintain discipline by imposing from a short beating a to death a green light in response to violations of gang rules.ms cliques also have an internet presence and have been known to post information on websites such as my space.
the primary ms clique involved in this prosecution is known as the langley park salvatruchas lps.palacios lps and operated as its second word and,subsequently,as its first word.trial testimony indicated that,as relevant to this appeal,palacios helped orchestrate the murder of nancy diaz during the time he was second word of lps.
palacios and roberto argueta buda who was lps first word at the time heard rumors that diaz,a female friend of lps members,had been fraternizing with rival gang members.the two investigated whether the rumors were true,questioning suyapa chicas palacios girlfriend at the time,about whether diaz had been spending time with members of rival gangs.chicas confirmed that she had heard the same rumors.sometime thereafter,argueta and palacios brought up the issue of diaz supposed interactions with rival gangs at an lps clique meeting.as the conversation proceeded,palacios and the other lps leaders determined that diaz needed to be killed and began planning her death.at the conclusion of the meeting,argueta issued a final order that diaz should be killed.palacios was involved in the discussion throughout and stood by argueta side as he issued the order.
lps members jesus canales fantasma and jeffrey villatoro magic carried out the order to kill diaz.on october,canales and villatoro drove diaz and her friend alyssa tran to a cemetery near langley park,maryland,informing the two women that they were going to drink together.instead,once inside the cemetery grounds,canales and villatoro fell behind the two women.tran heard a gunshot from behind and felt villatoro pull her to the ground.villatoro then shot tran in the face.when canales discovered tran had not perished from the gunshot wound,canales stabbed her twice in the chest.tran somehow survived the attack and began searching for diaz.when tran found diaz,the latter was dead.
in august,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maryland indicted palacios and others on various charges arising from their participation in ms.on june,the grand jury returned a fourth superseding indictment charging palacios with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity,conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,murder in aid of racketeering,assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering,two counts of use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,and murder resulting from the use and carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.
prior to trial,the parties entered into a discovery agreement.the agreement provided,in relevant part 
the government agrees that it will provide reasonable notice of the existence of alleged other crimes,wrongs or acts committed by palacios pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of evidence,along with copies of all physical and documentary evidence believed by the government to fall within the ambit of rule b which the government intends to introduce at trial in its.the government acknowledges its continuing duty to disclose rule b evidence as it is recognized as such after the time period in which the government has provided rule material.
the government made several pretrial disclosures regarding evidence and testimony it intended to introduce.on may,nine weeks before trial,the government sent a letter to palacios attorney indicating that it planned to introduce evidence of an attempted robbery in which palacios was involved in,an alleged attack on rival gang members for which palacios was arrested in,and a shooting in which palacios was involved in.on june,six weeks before trial,the government sent another letter disclosing its intention to introduce evidence regarding,inter alia,two robberies in which palacios participated in and a incident during which palacios fired gunshots at rival gang members.all of these incidents were related to palacios participation in ms.
in response to these letters,palacios moved to exclude these matters from trial or,in the alternative,to require the government to amend the indictment to include them as charged overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy.during a june,hearing on the motion,the district court noted 
t hey do have to charge in an indictment every act they allege a defendant participated in i told the government they needed to give notice well in advance,and they did it at least a month to two months in advance and gave the relevant information to palacios.
it further stated that this information was not b evidence,but rather evidence of events that the government was using as part and parcel of the conspiracy.the district court noted that the government is not required in a conspiracy case to give advance notice of any discrete acts it contends were part of the conspiracy.it concluded by stating that t he government has done in this case what i directed them to do in terms of advance preparation,and i am not going to prevent them from using this evidence on the ground of the timing of the disclosure.it therefore denied palacios motion.
palacios trial began on july,and lasted until august.as pertinent to this appeal,the government called as witnesses sergeant george norris of the prince george county police department former ms member wilbur garcia martinez palacios former girlfriend suyapa chicas and alirio osorio,a former lps member who later became a government informant.
sergeant norris testified both as an expert witness and a fact witness.based on his training and experience investigating ms as part of the prince george county police department gang unit,norris provided expert testimony on the gang development,organization,policies,practices,and symbols.he also provided lay testimony about events he personally observed while investigating ms cliques.the district court permitted norris to testify in both capacities,but it required the government to indicate when it was transitioning from norris expert opinion to his personal observations.
garcia martinez testified primarily about statements palacios made to him when the two were incarcerated together.in,garcia martinez pleaded guilty to participating in the same broader ms conspiracy that palacios was charged with participating in.around january,garcia martinez and palacios were placed in the same prison cell for a period of approximately two months at a supermax facility in baltimore,maryland.garcia martinez testified that,at some point during that time,palacios told garcia martinez that,if palacios were found guilty but later released from prison,he would come back and return to kill all the snitches.
chicas testified extensively about her knowledge of palacios involvement in ms.she provided information about a number of criminal acts palacios committed during his time as a member of the gang some of which were charged in the indictment and others of which were not.she specifically provided information about the operation of the lps clique,as well as about the murder of nancy diaz.
osorio also testified about palacios involvement in diaz murder,as well as about his observations regarding the structure and organization of the lps clique.the substance of this testimony tracked the facts discussed in section 
at the close of the government evidence,palacios filed a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court denied the motion.
on august,the jury found palacios guilty of conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise,conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,murder in aid of racketeering,use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,and murder resulting from the use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence palacios filed a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial on august,both of which the district court denied.
on november,the district court sentenced palacios to life imprisonment,followed by a consecutive sentence of months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
palacios raises five arguments on appeal,which fall into two broader categories challenges to the district court admission of certain witness testimony and challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.we discuss palacios specific claims falling within each category in turn.
with respect to the admission of evidence,palacios first argues that the district court abused its discretion by permitting sergeant george norris to testify as an expert,contending that through his testimony,norris acted as a conduit for testimonial hearsay,thereby violating palacios rights under the confrontation clause.second,palacios asserts that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his prior bad acts,claiming that the government failed to give adequate notice of its intent to introduce such evidence.third,palacios argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony of palacios cellmate garcia martinez,contending that garcia martinez acted as an agent of the government when he discussed ms with palacios.appellant br.
we review for abuse of discretion a trial court decision concerning the admissibility of evidence.united states summers,cir.we will not find that a district court abused its discretion unless its ruling was arbitrary and irrational.id.quotation marks omitted.we review de novo,however,an evidentiary ruling implicating the confrontation clause.id.
we first consider palacios contention that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the expert testimony of sergeant norris.palacios argues that norris testimony contained inadmissible hearsay and that norris use of such hearsay violated palacios rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,as interpreted by crawford washington,d.we disagree.
federal rule of evidence allows an expert witness to base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware of or personally observed.this includes inadmissible evidence including hearsay i f experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject.see also united states leeson,cir holding that a district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting expert testimony based on hearsay when it had been sufficiently established that such hearsay statements were the type of information reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.
under crawford,testimonial hearsay raises special concerns,however,because it implicates a defendant constitutional rights.see united states johnson,cir.crawford established that the confrontation clause bars the admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify,and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for.at.the supreme court has not provided a definitive definition of testimonial,but a statement procured with a primary purpose of creating an substitute for trial testimony is the quintessential example of testimonial hearsay.michigan bryant,d.although crawford forbids the introduction of testimonial hearsay as evidence in itself,we have recognized that it in no way prevents expert witnesses from offering their independent judgments merely because those judgments were in some part informed by their exposure to otherwise inadmissible evidence.johnson,at.the touchstone for determining whether an expert is giving an independent judgment or merely acting as a transmitter for testimonial hearsay is whether an expert is applying his training and expertise to the sources before him,thereby producing an original product that can be tested through.id.
applying this test,we rejected a claim identical to the one before us in united states ayala,cir.ayala involved the same ms conspiracy we here,and similar to palacios,the appellants in that case claimed that the district court admission of the expert testimony of sergeant norris and two other law enforcement officials violated their confrontation clause rights because the testimony relied in part on interviews with unnamed declarants.id.at.we held that no crawford violation had occurred,observing 
as an initial matter,it is unclear whether the interviews these experts relied on were even testimonial,given that the record is rather bare about the circumstances in which they were conducted.but even if we assume that each expert did rely on testimonial statements,that fact alone does not offend the confrontation clause because the experts did not act as mere transmitters and in fact did not repeat statements of particular declarants to the jury.instead,they offered their independent judgments,most of which related to the gang general nature as a violent organization and were not about the defendants in particular.these judgments resulted from many years of observing the gang,studying its methods,and speaking with its members.given that each expert was subject to about his judgment,we find no error in the admission of their testimony.
here,sergeant norris explained the bases for his expertise regarding ms.these included extensive gang culture training,interactions with other law enforcement officers who specialize in gangs,personal observation through surveillance and executing search warrants,and h undreds and hundreds,if not thousands of interviews with ms members and victims of ms gang violence.as in alaya,the record before us is unclear as to whether these interviews were testimonial.see at.palacios,in fact,makes no assertion that they were.assuming at least some of the interviews norris conducted produced testimonial hearsay,however,norris did not specifically reference any of these interviews during his expert testimony,nor did he make any mention of palacios in particular.rather,he used these interviews,along with the other sources of his extensive knowledge about ms,to form an independent opinion about the gang history,operation,structure,practices,and symbols.norris was available for regarding this opinion.as such,we reiterate our position in alaya that the admission of norris testimony was not a crawford violation,even if his expert opinion was based,in part,on testimonial hearsay.
the second circuit decision in united states mejia,cir,upon which palacios relies,does not alter the analysis.in that case,the second circuit held that a police officer expert testimony violated rule and the appellants sixth amendment rights by repeating on the stand testimonial statements made by individuals during custodial interrogations.id.at.we distinguished this case in johnson by noting that it turned upon the fact that the expert simply passed along an important testimonial fact he learned from a particular interview,which did not require him to apply any independent expertise.at.the expert testimony in mejia was thus unlike the expert testimony in johnson and in this case in which the expert appl ied his expertise,derived over many years and from multiple sources to provide an independently formed opinion.see johnson,at.we therefore find palacios claim to be without merit 
palacios next contends that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to introduce evidence of alleged prior bad acts by palacios without notice to the defense.appellant br.this argument fails.as we explain,the evidence introduced by the government that palacios refers to as prior bad acts does not implicate other crimes,wrongs,or acts governed by federal rule of evidence rule b.given that the testimony to which palacios points was not governed by rule b,the government was under no obligation to disclose any of this information and none of the authorities to which palacios points suggest otherwise.
palacios claims that the district court improperly allowed the government to introduce evidence of his prior bad acts a phrase that typically refers to evidence governed by rule b.see,e,united states chin,cir.
the rule b inquiry,however,applies only to evidence of other acts that are extrinsic to the one charged.acts intrinsic to the alleged crime do not fall under rule b limitations on admissible evidence.evidence of uncharged conduct is not other crimes evidence subject to rule if the uncharged conduct arose out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense,or if evidence of the uncharged conduct is necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.
united states basham,cir quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.it is well established that when seeking to prove a conspiracy,the government is permitted to present evidence of acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy even though they are not all specifically described in the indictment.united states janati,cir.evidence that does not fall within the purview of rule b is admissible if it is relevant meaning having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.and it is not required to be excluded by the constitution,statute,or federal rule.
here,palacios claims that certain testimony of three government witnesses improperly referenced his prior bad acts without prior disclosure.specifically,palacios contends that the district court erred by allowing suyapa chicas to testify about a robbery she saw palacios commit with another ms member,palacios firing of a gun in the direction of members of a rival gang,and two conversations palacios had with her about nancy diaz.palacios also contends that the district court improperly allowed alirio osorio to testify about meetings in which palacios and other ms members discussed the murders of diaz and others.finally,palacios claims that the district court improperly permitted wilbur garcia martinez to testify about palacios possession of a gun and about palacios claim that he would kill all the snitches.
all of this testimony,however,is express proof of the conduct for which palacios was indicted or otherwise necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial not evidence of other bad acts.see basham,at quotation marks omitted.any discussion of diaz is directly related to the murder in aid of racketeering and conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering charges included in the indictment.and the remaining testimony to which palacios draws our attention,such as the description of the robbery,relates to palacios participation in ms and can be properly characterized as acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see janati,at.for these reasons,we agree with the district court conclusion that palacios characterization of this evidence as prior bad acts is incorrect,and we find that the government was under no rule b disclosure obligations.
palacios points to three additional sources that he claims required the government to disclose the evidence prior to trial federal rule of criminal procedure,the discovery agreement between the parties,and certain statements of the district court.we agree with the district court that none of these sources required disclosure.
generally,criminal defendants do not have a constitutional right to discovery,absent a statute,rule of criminal procedure,or some other entitlement.united states uzenski,cir.rule imposes upon parties an ongoing duty to disclose additional evidence or material discovered before or during trial if the other party previously requested,or the court ordered,its production.c.rule also provides,however,n or does this rule authorize the discovery or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses.id.at a.
palacios contention that rule required the government to disclose the evidence to which he points before trial is incorrect.rule a expressly states that the government is not required to disclose the statements of government witnesses.see also united states cole,cir we decline to carve an exception from rule a prohibition for statements of government witnesses that happen to contain statements made by a defendant.palacios citation to rule c is also of no avail,as he did not request,nor did the district court order,the government to disclose any such evidence prior to trial.
we also find palacios contention that either the pretrial agreement or the district court statements required disclosure to be without merit.as discussed,the pretrial agreement merely stated that the government would provide reasonable notice of the existence of alleged other crimes,wrongs,or acts committed by palacios pursuant to rule b which the government intends to introduce at trial and this evidence was not governed by b.finally,our review of the hearing to which palacios draws our attention,detailed above,provides no indication that the district court issued any instruction to the government regarding disclosure that the g
