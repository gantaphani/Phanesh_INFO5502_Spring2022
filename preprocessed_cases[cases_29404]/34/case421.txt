this appeal hinges on a disputed evidentiary ruling.the tale is tawdry,but quickly told.
on december,a federal grand jury in the district of rhode island handed up a indictment against four men,including quoc nguyen,charging violations of.count alleged that the foursome had conspired to collect a gambling debt from one tommy nguyen no relation to the appellant using extortionate means,while count alleged that each of the four men had committed the substantive offense beating tommy nguyen to facilitate the debt collection.
the appellant case was severed.his three codefendants were tried first a jury convicted them on both counts in a joint trial.we affirmed their convictions and sentences.see united states anh,cir.
the appellant was tried separately.the government evidence included testimony from tommy nguyen whom we hereafter shall call tommy for ease in exposition and two,a law enforcement officer account of an alleged confession attributed to the appellant,and corroborative exhibits,photographs,cancelled checks,and telephone records.
this evidence in cumulation showed that tommy a nail salon in west warwick,rhode island.in or around april of,he placed wagers totaling on several basketball games.the bets were made with a georgia bookmaker through a middleman in ohio.
there was evidence indicating that one of tommy friends was responsible,as between them,for nearly of the aggregate amount wagered.but there was no evidence that the bookmaker either had approved this arrangement or had dealt directly with the friend.
the total amount wagered was lost.hot on the heels of this debacle,tommy received a telephone call from codefendant van anh.the caller informed him that the time had come to pay the piper.minutes later,anh appeared at the nail salon along with two other men.they demanded the money.tommy sparred for time,and anh agreed that he could pay the debt in installments.
about ten days later anh,codefendant khong nguyen the appellant brother,and a third man appeared at the nail salon and received from tommy.a week or ten days after that,anh and khong nguyen collected another on account.
the same pair journeyed to the nail salon on june,bent on collecting a third installment.tommy gave them a check for with the payee line left blank.anh subsequently cashed that check.
on june,tommy met anh and khong nguyen by prearrangement at a providence club.he gave anh an check with the payee line left blank.that check was later cashed at a georgia bank.
tommy seemingly believed that these payments satisfied his share of the gambling debt.others saw the matter differently anh soon called tommy and insisted upon payment of the balance.when tommy demurred,anh stated that he knew where tommy worked and that tommy could not run.anh then announced that he would send someone to collect what was owed.
around on july,tommy stepped out of the nail salon to smoke a cigarette.three men were lurking nearby the appellant,his brother,and codefendant thinh cao.the men made it plain that they had come to collect the balance of the indebtedness.tommy replied that he already had paid what he owed and retreated inside the nail salon.
tommy left the shop about half an hour later.the three collectors surrounded him and threatened that if he did not pay they would take care of him.at this juncture,tommy talked to anh on a cell phone,but anh remained adamant he warned that tommy had better square the account.tommy again refused,and a beating ensued.
the attack was quick but vicious.after knocking tommy to the ground,the men kicked and pummeled him.witnesses attested that the appellant participated in administering the beating.tommy eventually broke free,but not before he had sustained severe and painful injuries.
once tommy had escaped,the assailants fled.they were subsequently apprehended,identified by the victim and the other,and detained.
a law enforcement officer testified that,later the same night,the appellant waived his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,and acknowledged his involvement in the events of july.in his oral confession,the appellant related that he had gone with the other two men to the nail salon to collect a gambling debt.he admitted that he personally had asked tommy for the money that when tommy refused to pay,he and his brother had pushed tommy to the ground and that they may have slapped tommy around.
the appellant testified in his own defense.he repudiated the alleged confession and,instead,told a somewhat different story.he claimed that he did not know either anh or the victim prior to july that he and his brother set out late that afternoon for a connecticut casino that khong nguyen and tommy were acquaintances that he and khong stopped by the nail salon so that khong could pay tommy a social visit and that,after their arrival,a fight broke out between the quondam friends.
the appellant denied any purposeful involvement in the altercation although he admitted that he had pushed tommy in an effort to keep his balance after fisticuffs had begun.he did not learn until later,he said,that the point of the detour was to collect a gambling debt.
the jurors largely credited the government witnesses they convicted the appellant on the substantive extortion count while acquitting him on the conspiracy count there was no evidence of any involvement on his part at any time other than on july.the district court imposed a incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal ensued.
this is a appeal.the appellant assigns error to a single evidentiary ruling the district court decision to exclude his proposed use on of a prior felony conviction attributable to the victim.that assignment of error implicates rule of the federal rules of evidence.accordingly,we start with the structure of that rule.
as an initial matter,rule provides that if certain conditions are met a trial court may admit evidence that a witness has been convicted of a is,a crime punishable by more than one year in prison f or the purpose of attacking the character for truthfulness of that witness.a.rule b supplies a key limitation on rule a.that limitation reads in pertinent part 
evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction unless the court determines,in the interests of justice,that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.
b.in short,rule b is a rule of exclusion that bars the admission of a stale felony conviction for impeachment purposes in the absence of a particularized showing that its probative value substantially outweighs its potential for unfair prejudice.see,united states meserve,cir united states,cir.given the tenor of rule b,common sense suggests that felony convictions more than ten years old should be admitted only sparingly and in especially compelling circumstances.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence ed.
against this backdrop,we turn to the application of rule in this instance.tommy had a prior conviction dating back to may,he received a sentence.the appellant trial commenced on june.pointing to the lapse of more than ten years between the date of the conviction and the commencement of the trial,the government moved in limine to foreclose any reference to tommy prior conviction.although the government conceded that the prior conviction was for a felony,it argued that the passage of time rendered the conviction subject to the stringencies of rule b.
the appellant countered by moving in limine to bar the government from using his own prior felony convictions in he simultaneously opposed the government motion in limine,arguing among other things that the court should treat the various convictions as a package and allow either all or none to be introduced.
the district court held a hearing to consider the in limine.during that session,the from his suggestion of a package deal anent all the prior not identify any specific facts or circumstances showing that the probative value of tommy earlier conviction overbalanced its unfairly prejudicial effect.at the end of the hearing,the cou
