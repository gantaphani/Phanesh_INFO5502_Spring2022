henry anderson appeals from the judgment,dated june,of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.
anderson trial.
henry anderson was convicted on march,after a jury trial in new york supreme court for the county of kings,justice norman george presiding.specifically,anderson was convicted of one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree,penal law the first count one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree,penal law the second count and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree,penal law the third count.the court dismissed anderson conviction on the third court as a lesser inclusory count.
this was anderson second trial arising from charges that he and an accomplice sold heroin to an undercover police officer in brooklyn,new york on may.the first trial resulted in a hung jury after four days of deliberation.
the conduct of the jury in the second trial was,to say the least,atypical.a verdict was finally accepted by the court after three days of deliberations.on the second day of deliberations,one juror,juror,was excused after she sent a note to justice george,which the judge read into the record as follows 
the court counsel,with regard to the latest note from the jury,which has been shared with counsel and marked court exhibit number and which states,given the fact that i am only one juror,at this point i am being treated as a prisoner.i have served my duty and need to return to my three children one five months old with a flu.we are and will be in a deadlocked position indefinitely,underscore.i need not want to leave to care for my children and will never try to be a juror again in life,because my rights as a citizen do not matter in the spite of the law.

juror was excused with the consent of the parties and justice george then directed the jury to begin deliberations anew with an alternate juror.
on the morning of the third day of deliberations,the jury returned with a verdict convicting anderson on the first and second counts,but acquitting him on the third count.shortly before rendering this verdict,the jury had requested,and received from justice george,an explanation of the elements of conviction under the third count.trial transcript at.
during polling of the jury,the following colloquy took place between juror and the court 
the clerk juror number,is that your verdict you must answer so the court reporter can take down your answer.i repeat it.juror number,is that your verdict

trial transcript at.
after the jury exited,justice george denied defense counsel motion for a mistrial.trial transcript at.after a recess,and in response to another motion by defense counsel,justice george announced that,should the jury return with the same verdict the court will rule that such a verdict is repugnant and the court will,without necessity of counsel having to make the argument outside the presence of the jury,take the appropriate action to send the jury back to reconsidering counts and and to render an appropriate,consistent verdict.trial transcript at.
shortly thereafter,the jury in fact returned with the same verdict,and was polled without incident.but justice george immediately rejected the verdict,explaining to the jury that it could not convict on the second count,which requires possession with intent to sell,and acquit on the third count,which requires only possession.justice george then directed the jury to continue its deliberations.trial transcript at.
the jury once again returned shortly,and announced a verdict convicting anderson on all three counts.the jury was polled,unanimously endorsed the verdict,and was released.but defense counsel urged the court not to accept the verdict 
mullady your honor i object to the verdict.jurors and hesitated and cried.
the court i sorry,i ca hear you.
mullady i object to the taking,the court taking of the verdict.jurors and were crying and hesitant in their answers,and number two was barely audible to me.i object to the taking of the verdict.

trial transcript at.
anderson the respondent does not juror and juror both independently approached defense counsel immediately after the trial in the hallway outside of the courtroom.later the same day,justice george reconvened court,with counsel for both sides present,and stated that we received a report that two jurors were down in central jury and had expressed a desire to talk with the court,speak with the court o nly one juror is present now.so i going to ask that juror to come in and tell us what is on her mind.trial transcript at.the juror still present was juror the juror who had left was juror.juror testified under oath,and was questioned by justice george.we reproduce her testimony in full,omitting only juror actual name 
the court juror,you served as a juror in the case which we just recently completed that being the people of the state of new york against henry anderson.and i received word that you wanted to speak with me.
the court okay.
juror i feel i that i was pushed into the testimony that i gave.
the court the testimony 
juror not the testimony,the verdict that i gave.
the court and who pushed you 
juror the whole group i felt threatened by them.one time a guy almost got in a fight.they was always yelling at me.i felt afraid they would listen to my evidence,what i said.when i asked things to be listened to they said that they did want to listen to it that it would just be for me.i have a letter right here,where i was gon na send it in to you to come home yesterday they told me that i was gon na leave,they were gon na allow me to leave and i was afraid.
the court anything else 
juror also,today when we came up with our verdict there were five court officers at the door as well as this young lady in the green jacket.they had no right near our door.somebody came up,they were leaving i caught her jacket.also i was just speaking to the lawyer and assistant district attorney miss guzman or guzeman was standing there,listening.
also,there was testimony that i had asked for and it was not read back in the manner that i had asked for it.so there could have been a change of mind or not,there was no way my mind could have been made,it was not read back in the manner it was asked for.
the court any testimony that was requested by a note of the jury,the court had read back,unless the jury subsequently sent a note saying disregard it.there were a number of notes that had that indication that they no longer requested that testimony,and i did not have that testimony read back for that reason.
juror but what happened,your honor,there was no better way to put exactly what i needed requested.everytime you read it,you said we needed to word it differently this is why we did that.
i knew exactly what i needed to hear,it was written on the first piece of paper,about stoney it was written the way i wrote it.you kept sending it back,of course they are going to write it differently,because they did hear what i heard.and i was trying to get something across what i heard.of course they are going to write it differently,i not the one writing it.
the court okay.is there anything else you want to say 
juror not at this moment,but that i did find him guilty,that i was pushed into it.not even intimidated,i felt threatened for my life.
the court all right.thank you very much.
trial transcript at.
no request was made by counsel for any other questions to be asked of juror,nor did counsel request to directly examine her.the young lady in the green jacket has not been otherwise identified in the record before us.immediately after juror brief testimony,justice george told defense counsel to make any motion you deem is appropriate under the circumstances.the court will take no further action.trial transcript at.
the letter to justice george referred to by juror has been preserved.it is dated march,and states in full as follows 
juror.i would like to go home i feel that i no going to change my mine and i live within blocks of the crime.my life might be in a major danger.if i do give the correct plea.also i have children the ages and at home whom i have not contacted and have know idea where they are located.
iii.relief 
defense counsel subsequently made a motion to set aside the verdict.the motion was supported by affidavits of jurors and,made in their own handwriting,and dated march,and march,respectively.although not explicitly attested to in the motion,it appears that each of the affidavits was solicited by defense counsel.
juror affidavit gives a description of each of the jury three days of deliberation.march,is said to have been a disaster with jurors arguing in the jury room as if they wanted to hit each other,juror claims that on march other jurors were telling me you got to change your answer we want to go home and that i was getting afraid because they were getting angry,that i must be stupid to not know what is going on and my conscience i was still saying not guilty.juror writes as follows with respect to her decision to vote for conviction on the final day of deliberations 
i hope you gon na say guilty today because i tired of being here everyone was yelling there opinions,and everytime two words illegible mine everyone would scream again i was nervous and stressed out with everybody yelling so i first went along with everybody.but then i felt guilty for doing what i did because that was on my conscience.they pressured me to change my vote because we are not going anywhere.i change my vote because i was afraid and pressured,i only yrs old and i never been on a jury,and they were hollering and calling me names.i could take the pressure i just wanted to get away.
juror affidavit does not identify the individual jurors involved in these exchanges.after the verdict,juror asserts that immediately after the jury was discharged,i went to the phone and when i came back from using the phone i saw henry lawyer and stopped him to tell him that i was sorry i voted not guilty and that i was pressured to say guilty,juror concludes her affidavit by declaring that i giving this sworn statement because i believe my verdict was not guilty and i was forced to say guilty.
juror begins her affidavit by declaring that i giving this sworn statement because my vote was not guilty from the beginning.the rest of the affidavit reads as follows 
they were screaming at me they did want me to have the read backs.they also told me i was not going home.on the second day i wanted to see the judge or sent a note to the judge.i was force to make up anything on a letter in order to get away from the threats.i wrote out a note to send to the judge and they would sent they said we gotten rid of one trouble maker,that you are going to stay until the end.i then ask them to send out a note for me and the said no.at this point i did know what to do.one juror was in my face trying to fight me and i was afraid.three court officer came and escorted him out.when he was out they were still deliberating.this happen day two.we were sequestered day for the night during dinner they told me make sure that you say guilty.day three was the worst.
they were yelling and screaming no one wanted to listen to me.they did to hear my reasoning for not guilty.the voting process was rush because they wanted.they were not paying attention to whether i raised my hand or not they said lets go they did even want to order lunch.once i and said i do know to they plea they one word illegible became irate when i said i do know i was hoping the judge would alarm and see that something was wrong ask what it was.he did he sent us back and everyone became irate out of controlled.i one word illegible and wanted to leave because i was afraid.the court told to just have a cigarette.once i went to go and have a cigarette.i saw leaving the door as well as a court clerk.i felt then i really did have a chance.i was by the juror not to tell the judge.i still hesitated on the last verdict.when were discharged first thing i did was look for henry lawyer to tell him and the judge.i did talk to the lawyer right away and talk to the judge a little later under oath.
as with juror affidavit,juror identifies no individual jurors who yelled at her,or who otherwise acted aggressively toward her.we presume that the troublemaker she refers to is juror,the juror who was released by consent of the parties.
in a order,dated may,justice george denied the motion to set aside the verdict.he first asserts that i t is well settled that a jury verdict may not be impeached by a juror affidavit or testimony absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances see,people brown,people spencer.justice george then concludes that i t appears that this is a case of jury afterthought and the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the alleged misconduct impaired his right to a fair trial.
anderson conviction was upheld by the appellate division,second department,with one dissent.in a memorandum opinion,dated april,the court succinctly concluded that the appeal was without merit because the defendant does not raise an issue of improper influence on the jury,but rather seeks to impeach the verdict by delving into the tenor of the jury deliberative process.people anderson.the dissenting judge,however,favored remitting to the trial court for further investigation into the conduct of the jury.because juror and had alleged the occurrence of actual intimidation,rather than mere divisive deliberations,the dissenting judge concluded that the record implicates issues beyond the mere tenor of deliberations that should not have been summarily resolved.id.at ritter,dissenting.in an order,dated july,the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.people anderson.
iv.habeas relief 
on february,anderson filed a pro se petition in the district court for the eastern district of new york for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.judge block described his initial review of the petition as follows troubled by the allegations of jurors and,the court appointed counsel and ordered that an evidentiary hearing be held to flush out precisely what transpired in the jury room so that the court may ascertain whether the petitioner constitutional rights have been violated.anderson miller,d.
judge block held the evidentiary hearing on december,which was continued on january and february.nine jurors and a court officer testified,and were questioned both by counsel and by judge block.
juror was the initial witness.her testimony may fairly be called confusing.the following passage,in which juror recounts her desire to leave what she perceived to be a dangerous situation,proves the point 
the court you wanted to leave for what purpose 
the witness because i asked,requested for the judge to send back papers.every time we requested he sent back half a sheet.what the judge would do,he would send it back.it was already a hostile environment,your honor.because he did send the papers back,they thought we would have to sleep out another night.they became even more hostile and more verbally abusive,you know.i sure you read in the affidavit there was a gentleman that came over to attack me.
the court verbal abuse is one thing,being put in fear 
the witness i was in fear.excuse my language,excuse me,they said they would fuck me up,physically hurt me.i ca say to you they physically touched me,but they threatened my life.
hearing transcript at.later,juror testified that another juror,whom she could not now identify,raised his hand to her in a manner she took to be a gestur e to physically hurt someone.hearing transcript at.
the papers referred to by juror are apparently readbacks of testimony.juror testified that she made requests for readbacks and that her requests were recorded exactly by the jury foreperson and delivered to justice george.hearing transcript at.on the other hand,juror was emphatic that unspecified other jurors would allow me to send a note to justice george requesting to be relieved from further deliberations.hearing transcript at.and juror was equally insistent that,o n the end,she voted to convict because she felt physically intimidated.hearing transcript at.on the other hand,however,juror testified that she would say and could not remember whether any other juror had been subjected to intimidation.hearing transcript at.
also testifying on the first day of the evidentiary hearing was juror,the juror who was excused by justice george on the second day of deliberations.as already noted,juror asked to be excused because her infant child was ill,but she also asserted in her note to justice george requesting to be excused that she expected the jury to be in a deadlocked position indefinitely.at the evidentiary hearing,juror testified that there was some agitation among jurors during deliberations,but that this was limited to d ebating,but no threats.hearing transcript at.in particular,juror did not recall anyone threatening juror.hearing transcript at.she also stated that,but for the illness of her child,she would not have asked to be excused.hearing transcript at.
five other jurors briefly testified on the first day of the evidentiary hearing.all of them denied that intimidation or actual violence played any role in the jury deliberations.their testimony can be summed up in an exchange between anderson counsel and one of them 
q.how did people disagree with each other 
a.how do you characterize disagreements people said no,you wrong.i do see it that way.the evidence says this.the evidence says that.there was general disagreements.
q.did people raise their voice 
yeah,i would say yeah.
q.did people shout 
shout i think maybe a voice was raised once or twice.you want to define that as shouting,i do know.i would say yeah,to my recollection maybe a voice was raised.
q.did anyone treat a fellow juror in a way that you would think you thought was not respectful 
to the best of my recollection,no.
hearing transcript at.
also testifying on the first day of the evidentiary hearing was the court officer assigned to guard the jury.she testified that she could recall but a single incident when discord among the jurors reached a level where she thought her intervention was called for.and this was not a particularly serious incident 
q.during those three days was there ever an occasion when you felt compelled to go into the jury room 
can you describe what happened then 
a.the jurors,i guess,were deliberating but it got loud.i could hear voices.so,i knocked on the door and told them to stop deliberating.i went in and two jurors were arguing,you know,like jurors do,but loud.i asked them would they take a break,would they like to take a break and they did.that what happened.
q.did anybody look like they were ready to strike one of the other 
no,they were right in each other face yelling,you know.
q.did you feel compelled to step in them 
hearing transcript at.
at the continuance of the evidentiary hearing on january,testimony was received from the foreperson of the jury.she succinctly stated that she never refused to pass a note to justice george,that no threats were made by any juror against another,and that the level of discord on the jury never went beyond the raising of voices.hearing transcript at.called back to the stand,juror emphatically testified that the foreperson refused to forward her request to be excused to justice george and that everybody said i was leaving.hearing transcript at.
when the evidentiary hearing was continued on february,testimony was taken from juror,the other juror besides juror who had submitted an affidavit stating that she did not freely vote to convict anderson.as with juror,juror testimony is awash with ambiguity.the following exchange is typical 
q.one final question,juror,was the verdict that you rendered in the case,was that the verdict of your conscience based on the evidence or was it it something other than that 
a.it was basically mostly on the evidence.
the court i sorry 
the witness on the evidence.
the court the verdict you rendered was on the evidence 
the witness most of it.
the court well,was your decision based upon the evidence in the case or was it based upon your fear 
the witness it was on my fear.
the court you would not have rendered the same verdict otherwise,is that what you are saying 
the witness yes.
hearing transcript at.
during questioning by counsel for the respondent,judge block later made another attempt to elicit how juror decided to vote in favor of conviction 
q y ou said that you were never threatened 
right,i was threatened,i was just afraid.
q.in fact,you said no one else in that jury room was threatened is that correct 
i do really know what they were thinking.
the court you talk about threatened,i do know whether you talking about physical threats or verbal threats my sense is that you were not threatened physically 
the witness right.
the court that nobody said,i going to hit you 
the witness right.
the court but the tone of the voices and everything that was happening and the jurors wanted to go home and saying i want to get out of here,you felt you had to go along with that because you were fearful that something would happen to you physically even though you were not physically threatened is that correct 
the witness yes.
hearing transcript at.
judge block subsequently issued an extensive opinion denying habeas relief.he sets forth his finding as to the central factual issue on this appeal as follows 
the court credits the testimony of juror she was candid,direct and believable accordingly,the court finds that,as juror testified,no juror,including juror,was physically threatened in the jury room.in so finding,the court does not credit the testimony of juror that other jurors threatened to fuck her up and physically hurt her.this testimony was inconsistent with the testimony of juror,her fellow juror,who had the same interest in impeaching the verdict,and all the other witnesses at the hearing.the court finds that jurors and subjectively felt pressured into rendering guilty verdicts,but that there was no factual basis to conclude that they were objectively subject to threats of physical harm.
anderson miller,d at.
applying the law to this finding,judge block held that a juror subjective perceptions can not trigger constitutional concerns.id.at.thus,even though juror and might have experienced severe emotional distress within the jury room,and immediately after the guilty verdict was rendered,judge block held that anderson was tried in conformance with the constitution.because we agree judge block was correct,we affirm.
discussion 
standard of review.
we review a district court denial of a habeas petition de novo,but we are bound to accept the district court factual findings save for clear error.see ortega duncan,cir.but the respondent asserts that our review is further constrained by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.codified at,inter alia.pursuant to d,this court may not grant a habeas petition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim,resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.that is,we can not grant habeas relief where a petitioner claim pursuant to applicable federal law,or the constitution,has been adjudicated on its merits in state court proceedings in a manner that is not manifestly contrary to common sense.
the parties disagree as to whether or not anderson claim that his trial violated the standards of the sixth amendment to the constitution was considered during state court proceedings.the district court did not decide this question and we hold that it is unnecessary for us to do so because even applying the more permissive standard of de novo review,we do not believe that anderson petition can succeed.
ii.did the district court correctly deny anderson petition 
general limitations upon judicial review of a jury deliberations.the centrality of the jury to our system of justice,and to our criminal justice system in particular,can not be emphasized too often.writing with a degree of enthusiasm for which he is not usually associated,blackstone asserted that trial by jury ever has been,and i trust ever will be,looked upon as the glory of the english law.and,if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property,how much must that advantage be heightened,when it is applied to criminal cases commentaries on the laws of england.
in our own country,f rom the earliest possible date,english colonists in the american wilderness enjoyed trial by jury in criminal cases.leonard levy,origins of the bill of rights.and although the jury proper province was a central issue of jurisprudential debate at the time of the american revolution,no one suggested that anything other than trial by jury in criminal cases should be the norm.thus,e very state that framed a constitution during the revolutionary era secured trial by jury.no other personal right received protection from the constitutions of so many states.id.at.see generally shannon stimson,the american revolution in the law.
the sixth amendment provides that criminal defendants shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.but it has recently been asserted that,to an extent almost forgotten in contemporary legal and political discourse in america,the jury is what the bill of rights as a whole was intended to be about 
juries,guaranteed in no fewer than three amendments,were at the heart of the bill of rights.the fifth amendment safeguarded the role of the grand jury the sixth the criminal petit jury and the seventh,the civil jury indeed,the entire debate at the philadelphia convention over whether to add a bill of rights was triggered when george mason of virginia picked up on a casual comment from another delegate that no provision was yet made for juries in civil cases.between the close of the philadelphia convention and the opening of the first congress,five of the six state ratifying conventions that advanced suggested amendments put forth two or more proposals.
akhil reed amar,the bill of rights see also creating the bill of rights the documentary record from the first federal congress,helen veit,kenneth bowling charlene bangs bickford,collecting amendments proposed by state ratifying conventions.
professor amar has also emphasized that the jury was not solely viewed as a means toward protection of the rights of criminal defendants,it was seen as a vital task of citizenship for jurors themselves 
for the framers,the criminal jury was much more than an incorruptible fact finder.it was also,and more fundamentally,a political institution embodying popular sovereignty and republican.through jury service,citizens would learn their rights and duties,and actively participate in the governance of society.
akhil reed amar,the constitution and criminal procedure.shortly after this passage,professor amar quotes from the very same passage of alexis de tocqueville democracy in america,which has been relied upon by this court in dealing with the specific issue concerning juries with which the instant case is concerned the extent to which a jury internal deliberations should be free from judicial review.we have said as follows in a case involving a civil jury 
the american jury system,alexis de tocqueville observed,is as direct and as extreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as universal suffrage.accordingly,the sanctity of the jury room is among the basic tenets of our system of justice.inquiries into the thought processes underlying a verdict have long been viewed as dangerous intrusions into the deliberative process.they undermine the finality of verdicts and invite fraud and abuse.we thus prevent jurors from impeaching their verdict to guard the jury special place in our democratic heritage.
attridge cencorp div.of dover techs.int,cir kaufman,quoting alexis de tocqueville,democracy in america,phillips bradley,vintage.
here we arrive at the dilemma presented by anderson petition.it is absolutely clear that the sixth amendment provides that a ny criminal defendant being tried by a jury is entitled to the uncoerced verdict of that body.lowenfield phelps,d.our circuit stated seventy years ago that questions of jury coercion strike at the root of the right to a trial by jury.no person may lawfully be convicted by a jury unless every juror actually agrees that upon the evidence and the law of the case that person is guilty.if a verdict of guilty is returned for any other reason,it is a perversion of the constitutional guaranty to a jury trial.pleva,cir.
on the other hand,as we have already noted by quoting attridge,there are universally recognized reasons for shielding jury deliberations from review.these were set forth by the supreme court at least as long ago as 
l et it once be established that verdicts solemnly made and publicly returned into court can be attacked and set aside on the testimony of those who took part in their publication and all verdicts could be,and many would be,followed by an inquiry in the hope of discovering something which might invalidate the finding.jurors would be harassed and beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.if evidence thus secured could be thus used,the result would be to make what was intended to be a private deliberation,the constant subject of public the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference.
mcdonald pless.
this principle is established in the federal rules of evidence.fre b broadly prohibits accepting into evidence juror testimony regarding the course of a jury deliberations.although the argument is significantly more muted on this appeal,the respondent argued before the district court that fre b served as a virtually absolute bar upon all judicial review of jury deliberations.during the evidentiary hearing,the respondent made a very stunning reply to a hypothetical posed by judge block 
the court so if you have twelve jurors and eleven pulled out a weapon and pointed collectively at the twelfth person head and said vote guilty or we shoot,you would say that the federal court can not inquire into that you do seriously mean that 
ross yes,i do.i know know you think that outrageous,but yes,i do.
the court no.i think nine other people in washington would also think that was outrageous.there has to come a point in time when the constitution is violated even during the deliberation process.a 
hearing transcript at.
in his decision denying anderson petition,judge block made the following declaration regarding the applicability of fre b to anderson petition 
the court research has not disclosed any reported case concerning the question of whether testimony of physical threats made by jurors against a fellow juror during deliberations is barred by the strictures of rule b.because the court has found that no jurors were physically threatened,the court need not address this issue.the court notes,however,that if rule b precluded hearing juror testimony when there are credible allegations that a juror safety was threatened by fellow jurors,it would raise serious constitutional concerns with respect to a defendant right to a fair trial.
anderson,d at.
although we affirm judge block holding that the issue need not be addressed,we also take this opportunity to state our agreement with his concerns regarding the scope of fre b preclusion of juror testimony.indeed,in a case relied upon heavily by the supreme court in tanner,d,we upheld the rule that possible internal abnormalities in a jury will not be inquired into except in the gravest and most important cases.dioguardi,cir quoting mcdonald,at.first emphasis in original second emphasis added,cert.denied,d.in tanner,the court specifically
