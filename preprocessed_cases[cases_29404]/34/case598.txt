given that the central issue in this appeal is the validity of certain wiretaps obtained by the government,we begin by describing the relevant facts of martinez conviction,including the history of the wiretaps.
a.the original investigation leading to martinez 
an initial investigation by the drug enforcement administration dea targeted two men,known as hercules and pachito.electronic surveillance used during this investigation the pachito wires intercepted communications with a dominican male identified only as gallo.in november,after authorization for the pachito wires expired,the dea persuaded hercules to cooperate with authorities.hercules provided the dea with information about his activities in massachusetts,including information that hercules and pachito had supplied hundreds of kilograms of cocaine to gallo.
the dea investigation of gallo commenced in.through physical surveillance,the dea identified gallo as martinez.with hercules assistance,the dea placed consensually recorded calls to martinez,and recorded and monitored a meeting between martinez and hercules.at the meeting,the two discussed different prices per kilogram of cocaine however,a deal was never consummated.
during the same time dea in new hampshire apprehended an individual referred to as,one of martinez cocaine customers,also agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials.told the dea that he had been purchasing approximately one kilogram of cocaine from martinez every three weeks since february.also identified an individual known as lulu,luis melendez,as martinez partner in the drug business.

b.the martinez wiretaps 
contemporaneous with their use of hercules and,the dea agents used a number of traditional law enforcement investigative physical surveillance,pen registers,and telephone toll some effect.meanwhile,the dea rejected the use of other search warrants,grand jury subpoenas,and witness fear that they could compromise the investigation.as detailed in the affidavits in support of the three wiretaps at issue here,the dea asserted that traditional investigative techniques were incapable of meeting the dea goals for the martinez investigation.these goals included identifying martinez current source s for his supply of cocaine,his other,and major customers learning how martinez was disposing of the proceeds from his operation locating additional stash locations and understanding the use of stash locations.a federal judge approved the three wiretaps.
c.the suppression motion and trial 
as a result of the wiretap investigation,martinez and ten were charged on may,in a indictment with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,and to distribute,cocaine,in violation of a and.searches executed the following day at the homes of the defendants pursuant to search warrants uncovered cocaine and other controlled substances,money,and paraphernalia used to cut and prepare cocaine for distribution.in subsequent proceedings,martinez moved to suppress the electronic surveillance evidence obtained from the three wiretaps on the ground that dea special agent samuel masiello masiello affidavits in support of the wiretaps on the three cellular telephones used by martinez did not satisfy the necessity requirement of c the district court denied the motion to suppress for the reasons stated in the government memorandum.on february,following an jury trial,martinez was found guilty.the verdict included a finding that the conspiracy had involved five or more kilograms of cocaine.
sentencing 
the presentence report psr concluded that martinez was responsible for kilograms of cocaine and kilograms of marijuana,yielding a base offense level of.the psr also recommended that martinez should receive a upward adjustment because of his supervisory role in the offense,pursuant to ussg,resulting in a total offense level of.because he fell within criminal history category ii,the psr calculated martinez guideline sentence range to be months to life.martinez was also subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of years pursuant to b a.
martinez was sentenced on december.he did not contest the psr calculations,and he did not move for a downward departure or advance an argument for leniency.the district court accepted the guideline recommendation in the psr in its entirety.the district court then sentenced martinez to a term of months of imprisonment,the bottom of his applicable guideline range,and five years of supervised release.martinez did not object to the sentence.
legal background 
martinez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained by the three title iii wiretaps.the statutory requirements for a title iii wiretap,set forth in et,include what is commonly referred to as the necessity requirement.in an application for a title iii wiretap,the government must include a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.c.in united states,cir,we held c to mean that the statement should demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable,good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in such a statement,i t is not necessary to show that other methods have been entirely unsuccessful.id.
the court authorizing the title iii wiretap must satisfy itself that the government has used normal techniques but it has encountered difficulties in penetrating a criminal enterprise or in gathering the point where given the statutory preference for less intrusive techniques wiretapping becomes reasonable.united states,cir.on appeal,the sufficiency of the government statement proffered to satisfy the necessity requirement is reviewed under a substantially deferential standard.in united states santana,cir,we stated that w hen reviewing the government showing of necessity,our role is not to make a de novo determination of sufficiency as if we were the issuing judge,but to decide if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made.id.at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted.
martinez arguments 
defendant challenges the use of wiretap evidence in this case on two grounds.first,he argues that a fair reading of the affidavits reveals that the statements of necessity are largely boilerplate and do not relate specifically to the martinez investigation.second,defendant claims that the government has manufacture d necessity by defining its investigative goals so broadly and so generally that a wiretap could be obtained in any drug investigation.we analyze these assertions in turn.
boilerplate 
martinez says that the affidavits are too general,they do not specifically relate the request for title iii surveillance to the specific case at hand.this characterization of the affidavits is inaccurate.the masiello affidavits describe in detail the dea use,or consideration and rejection,of eight traditional investigative techniques physical surveillance
