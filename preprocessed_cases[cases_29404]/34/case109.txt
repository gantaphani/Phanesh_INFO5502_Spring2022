charles adams,an unabashed opponent of the tax laws,advances two discrete claims of error regarding his convictions on charges of conspiracy and tax evasion.one claim,which raises a question of first impression at the federal appellate level,implicates the lawfulness of a premises search conducted by armed agents of the internal revenue service irs.the other claim challenges the district court jury instructions.after careful consideration,we reject his claims and affirm the judgment below.
this appeal arises out of the same indictment and trial discussed in united states floyd,cir,and we assume the reader familiarity with that opinion.against this backdrop,we offer only a sketch of the relevant proceedings.
the defendant,along with several other persons,was indicted in.the charges with which we are concerned include one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states by obstructing the collection of payroll taxes and two counts of tax evasion see.during the pretrial proceedings,the defendant moved unsuccessfully to suppress evidence obtained in a search of his home.
before the jury,the defendant principal defense centered on his claim of a subjective belief that he was not liable for any of the taxes implicated in his case.see cheek united states,d.the jury rejected that defense and found the defendant guilty on all three counts.the district court imposed a month term of immurement.this timely appeal followed.
in this venue,the defendant assigns error to the district court denial of his motion to suppress and to its handling of his defense.we address these assignments of error sequentially.
we start with an explication of the material needed to place the suppression issue into perspective.on march,a magistrate judge issued a warrant that authorized the search of the defendant home in wrentham,massachusetts.four days later,armed irs agents executed the warrant and seized evidence that the government later used against the defendant.
during pretrial skirmishing,the defendant moved to suppress this evidence.pertinently,he asserted that the search was unlawful because the manner of its execution was not authorized by statute.the defendant based this assertion on,which deals with the a uthority of internal revenue enforcement officers.
the defendant argument takes the following shape.subsection a of the statute,which deals with irs enforcement of laws pertaining to alcohol,tobacco,and firearms,explicitly allows agents enforcing those laws to carry guns.see a.subsection b,which deals with irs enforcement of other tax laws,contains no similar grant of explicit permission to carry guns.the defendant posits that the absence of any such explicit permission in subsection b indicates congress intent to prohibit irs agents enforcing those laws from carrying firearms.see united states hern√°ndez ferrer,cir discussing principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.and because the agents who searched his home were armed and not investigating any offense involving alcohol,tobacco,or firearms,the defendant argues that the search was unlawful and the evidence seized should therefore be suppressed.
the defendant theory is a novel one,and the district court was skeptical of it.in the end,the court elected to detour around the statutory construction question.instead,the court assumed a statutory violation but held that suppression was not an appropriate remedy.this prudential approach makes eminently good sense as we recently wrote,d iscretion is often the better part of valor,and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.united states gonzalez,cir.thus,we too assume without deciding that the agents who executed the search of the defendant home violated u.because they were armed.
suppression of evidence is strong medicine,not to be dispensed casually.the question of whether exclusion of evidence is an available remedy for a particular violation is a question of law and,therefore,is subject to de novo review.see united states garcia hernandez,cir united states leahey,cir.in conducting this inquiry,we remain mindful that t he exclusionary rule was not fashioned to vindicate a broad,general right to be free of agency action not authorized by law,but rather to protect certain specific,constitutionally protected rights of individuals.united states hensel,cir accord united states henry,cir.the cases in which the supreme court has approved a suppression remedy for statutory violations are hen teeth rare,and i n those cases,the excluded evidence arose directly out of statutory violations that implicated important fourth and fifth amendment interests.sanchez llamas oregon,d.we conclude,therefore,that statutory violations,untethered to the abridgment of constitutional rights,are not sufficiently egregious to justify suppression see united states thompson,cir collecting cases.
the defendant resists this conclusion.he contends that the performance of the search by armed agents constituted an unreasonable intrusion into his dwelling.this contention lacks force.
whatever intrusion may have occurred was not of constitutional dimension.while the defendant assuredly had a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his home,see,georgia randolph,d payton new york,d,that interest is protected in the first instance by the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment a requirement that was fully satisfied in this case.the defendant has not challenged the validity of the warrant,and the warrant authorized the agents to enter the home and conduct the search.
we add,moreover,that the fact that the agents were armed had no impact either on the scope of the search or on the extent of the evidence collected.indeed,the record here does not show the slightest connection between the alleged statutory violation and the avails of the search.so viewed,the supposed violation was not a but for cause of procuring the evidence.the constitution was not implicated and suppression was,therefore,unwarranted.see hudson michigan,d united states thomas,cir.
the defendant seeks to reboot his argument in two ways.both maneuvers are futile.
to begin,the defendant draws an analogy between a violation of section and a violation of the rule.the rule generally requires law enforcement officers acting under a warrant to announce their presence and purpose,including by knocking,before attempting forcible entry.united states sargent,cir.however,the supreme court has held that because a violation of the rule has nothing to do with the seizure of the evidence,the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.hudson,at.seen in this light,the analogy does nothing to aid the defendant cause.
the defendant second maneuver his reliance on our decision in united states leahey is equally unavailing.there,agents violated a publicly announced irs procedure by eliciting evidence from the defendant without warning her that they were conducting an investigation into possible criminal tax fraud.see leahey,at.we determined that the irs had promulgated the procedure for the purpose of promoting uniform conduct among its agents and protecting taxpayers rights in the wake of the supreme court decision in miranda arizona,d.see leahey,at.because the agency had purposefully announced the procedure to the public,it could be reasonably expected that taxpayers would rely on the agents compliance with the procedure in their dealings with the irs.the agents failure to comply thus implicated the defendant due process rights.see id.at.we emphasize,moreover,that there was a strong connection between the violation of the procedure and the gathering of the disputed evidence.consequently,suppression of the evidence was an appropriate anodyne.see id.at.the situation at hand is at a considerable remove from the situation in leahey.here,there is no inkling that the statute was enacted to protect taxpayers constitutional rights and in addition,the defendant constitutional rights were in no way offended by the manner in which the search warrant was executed.for these reasons,leahey is inapposite.
to say more about this claim of error would serve no useful purpose.we conclude,without serious question,that the dist
