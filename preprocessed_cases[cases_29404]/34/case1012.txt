following a jury trial,wilner desinor,jason dent,and daquan major were convicted of,inter alia conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of crack cocaine,in violation of and b a engaging in a narcotics conspiracy resulting in murder,in violation of e a engaging in a narcotics conspiracy while engaging in a conspiracy to murder,in violation of and e a and using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense and during a crime of violence,in violation of c a.the district court for the eastern district of new york david trager,judge,sentenced all of the defendants to months of imprisonment or more.
on appeal,defendants challenge their convictions and sentences,arguing that the district court erred in failing to charge the jury on error infected the jury instruction on the nature of the relationship between the drug conspiracy and the murder the evidence was insufficient to prove the requisite relationship beyond a reasonable doubt and the district court erred in imposing excessively long sentences.all but one of defendants arguments lack merit.we conclude that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence of months on desinor for the discharge of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime,because it made no finding that a discharge had occurred.we therefore vacate that portion of desinor sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
background 
desinor,dent,and major were members of a violent gang,known as the cream team,that sold crack cocaine at the marlboro housing project in brooklyn.led by dent,the cream team sold drugs primarily behind building of the marlboro houses and in a nearby area called the stores.a rival drug organization led by kijuanne thompson,known as yanni,sold crack cocaine in the vicinity of building of the marlboro project.the cream team frequently used intimidation and violence to protect its territory and obtain drug proceeds.for example,in the summer and fall of,major threatened to kill a teenager working for yanni if he continued to sell crack cocaine behind building,dent stabbed a member of yanni organization who was supposed to be in cream team territory,and desinor struck a woman for not meeting a payment deadline for crack that she had purchased on credit.
against this backdrop,according to trial testimony by cream team member jason jones,on march,yanni held dent brother joseph in a,with a gun to his head,and demanded dent whereabouts.yanni subsequently fired shots at joseph,but missed him.joseph immediately reported these events to dent and other members of his gang.cream team member naequan clarke testified at trial that he,dent,and major grabbed handguns and started toward building to retaliate but stopped when they noticed a police presence.
the next morning,on march,dent saw yanni cousin,ramel flowers,leaving building and,according to testimony by cream team member james mealey,shot at him because flowers was aligned with yanni and had been looking suspiciously at dent from the building.clarke testified that later that evening,after cream team members saw yanni and several others in front of building,dent told his crew to arm themselves and then to light up building two to support the cream team,defend the cream team and members of the cream team.major and clarke retrieved several guns and distributed them to members including themselves,desinor,dent,and jones.
clarke and jones entered building.jones later testified that dent had ordered them to shoot yanni or any member of his crew that they saw.clarke testified only that the plan was to look for yanni in the lobby and to leave if he was not there.clarke and jones decided to begin their search for yanni at the top floor and to work their way down.dent and major stayed outside as bait,while desinor remained in the nearby bushes as a lookout.as clarke and jones descended the stairs from the fourth or fifth floor with their guns drawn,they saw flowers burst through the door into the stairwell on the third floor.when flowers reached for what clarke and jones thought was a gun,clarke fired four or five shots until his handgun jammed,but his shots missed flowers.at that point,clarke pulled jones in front of him and told jones to shoot flowers.jones fired once with his shotgun and hit flowers,who died in the hospital.clarke later testified that he had first motioned to flowers to leave but opened fire when he thought he saw flowers reaching for a gun.
on june,armed with a search warrant,police searched the apartment where the cream team kept money,receipts,guns,bullets,and drugs seized the items kept there and arrested dent and other cream team affiliates.
at trial,a jury found dent,major,and desinor guilty of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fifty or more grams of crack cocaine count one,in violation of and b a engaging in a narcotics conspiracy resulting in murder count two,in violation of e a engaging in a narcotics conspiracy while engaging in a conspiracy to murder count three,in violation of and e a and using a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense and during a crime of violence count four,in violation of c a.dent and major were also convicted of unlawful use of a firearm causing death count five,in violation of j,and major was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm count six,in violation of g.pursuant to pinkerton united states,defendants convictions on counts two,four,and five were predicated on the liability of their,clarke and jones,for the murder of flowers.see app.at instructing the jury that the reasonably foreseeable acts of any member of the conspiracy in furtherance of the common purpose of the conspiracy are deemed,under the law,to be the acts of all of the members,and all of the members are responsible for such acts.
the district court sentenced desinor to three concurrent terms of months imprisonment on counts one,two,and three,and a consecutive prison term on count four dent to four concurrent terms of months imprisonment on counts one,two,three,and five,and a consecutive prison term on count four and major to four concurrent terms of months imprisonment on counts one,two,three,and five,one concurrent term of months on count six,and a consecutive term of months on count four.this appeal followed.
discussion 
defendants challenge their convictions on count two engaging in a narcotics conspiracy resulting in murder on the ground that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on.major also contends that the district court erred in its jury charge regarding e a requirement that the flowers murder be related to the drug conspiracy.defendants further argue that the evidence was insufficient to prove this element of e a beyond a reasonable doubt.finally,desinor challenges his consecutive sentence for discharging a firearm on the ground that the district court failed to make a finding that any discharge occurred.
jury charge on 
defendants first argue that because clarke and two men directly responsible for the murder of ramel shot flowers in,a properly charged jury could have found that there was no murder or intentional killing to provide the basis for defendants convictions on count two engaging in a narcotics conspiracy resulting in murder.in other words,because defendants convictions on count two were based on the pinkerton theory of liability,a successful claim as to clarke and jones would have eliminated the predicate murder upon which pinkerton liability for all defendants under count two was based.defendants contend that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the availability to clarke and jones of this defense,as defendants had requested.

in support of their claim that clarke and jones killed flowers in,defendants point to clarke and jones testimony that they shot flowers because they thought he was reaching for a gun and were afraid that he was going to shoot them.as clarke put it,i reacted because i did want to be shot.in response,the government argues that clarke and jones have no right to because they were the initial aggressors in the conflict,and it is the law in this circuit that an aggressor in a conflict resulting in death may not claim.deluca lord,cir.
as the defense asserted at trial,there was at least minimal evidence that,even if they were the initial aggressors,clarke and jones withdrew and attempted to communicate their withdrawal from the conflict with flowers before flowers reached for his gun.clarke testified on direct examination that when flowers burst into the third floor stairwell,i put my hand up to my lips.tell him to be quiet i told push him away,like,go ahead.but he stood there.started reaching for a gun.on,clarke testified that he motioned to flowers to leave so he would get out of the area because he was going to let him go,at which point flowers started to reach for a gun.clarke further testified that he motioned for flowers to shut up and be quiet to tell him,go ahead,and mind his business i push him away,and he claimed that he had no intention of shooting flowers at that time because the plan was just to shoot yanni.
the government counters that the record does not adequately demonstrate that clarke and jones withdrew and communicated this withdrawal to flowers because clarke hand gesture to flowers was ambiguous and was made while clarke was still holding his gun.see appellee br.at arguing that clarke gesture alone did not necessarily convey to flowers that his life had been spared,and that there were signs to the contrary as well.
we stated in united states thomas that i t has long been accepted that one can not support a claim of by a necessity to kill.the right of homicidal is denied to slayers who incite the fatal attack,cir omissions in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted penal law b providing that the justification of is not available to an initial aggressor.only in the event that he communicates to his adversary his intent to withdraw and in good faith attempts to do so is he restored to his right of.united states taylor,internal quotation marks and citation omitted penal law b providing an exception whereby an initial aggressor may claim if the actor has withdrawn from the encounter and effectively communicated such withdrawal to such other person but the latter persists in continuing the incident.
in this case,it is undisputable that clarke and jones were the initial aggressors when they entered building armed,respectively,with a handgun and a shotgun,for the purpose of killing yanni and possibly other members of his crew.defendants argue,however,that the two men shot flowers in after they indicated their desire that he leave and after he drew a weapon on them.
we need not decide whether,to warrant a jury charge,there was enough evidence that clarke and jones withdrew from the encounter with flowers and adequately communicated that withdrawal to him.this is because,in the context of this case,for a justification to be available,the shooters had to have withdrawn from the confrontation with flowers and communicated that fact,and the dangerous situation they had created by setting out to kill yanni or his affiliates had to have dissipated.even if the evidence unequivocally demonstrated that clarke and jones had done the first of the two,they failed to show that at the time the violent encounter with flowers occurred,the dangerous situation that they had created by entering building armed and with the purpose of killing yanni or his associates had ended.
because the law pertaining to is a matter of federal common law,see united states butler,cir noting that the justification defense has been developed by drawing on common law,we find it appropriate to look to state court decisions for guidance on the novel question we now address,see wallace united states.drawing on,inter alia,state court decisions in fashioning federal doctrine thomas,at citing state statutory and case law on.those decisions suggest that a defendant who initiates a violent crime,such as an armed robbery,that results in a fatal shooting may not claim absent a showing that,at the time the shooting occurred,the dangerous situation created by the initial crime had dissipated.see,gray state,alaska holding that the defendant,an armed robber,had forfeited his right to claim because the perilous situation created by the armed robbery continued to exist at the time the shooting occurred,and that w here,as in this case,the defendant commits a felony which includes an immediate threat of violence,he has created a situation so fraught with peril as to preclude his claim of to any act of violence arising therefrom.the loss of this right holds even if the defendant,in good faith,withdraws from the immediate confrontation and communicates that withdrawal.see,state owen,idaho,overruled in part on other grounds by state shepherd,idaho.as long as the defendant remains engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of the crime that he initiated,he can not be excused for taking the life of his antagonist to save his own.in such a case it may be rightfully and truthfully said that he brought the necessity upon himself by his own criminal conduct.id.at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as evidence that the dangerous situation created by a defendant initial crime persisted,courts in armed robbery cases have cited the fact that the defendant was still inside the robbed premises at the time of the shooting and that his gun was always in his hand,prepared to shoot.see,gray,at concluding,based in part on these facts,that the defendants were still engaged in the armed robbery at the time of the shooting state diggs,as long as a person keeps his gun in his hand prepared to shoot,the person opposing him is not expected or required to accept any act or statement as indicative of an intent to discontinue the assault.internal quotation marks and citation omitted owen,at the deceased was not required to accept the defendant command to stand still and let me out of here,as conclusive of his intention to abandon the.he was still being menaced by the flaming gun in the defendant hand see also state shockley,utah,s o long as the defendant kept his gun in his hand prepared to shoot,the victims were neither expected nor required to construe and accept any act or statement of his as an intent on his part to discontinue the assault and surrender himself as a prisoner.
from this body of law,we conclude in this case that before defendants could obtain a jury instruction on,they must offer evidence from which a jury could find not only that clarke and jones had demonstrably withdrawn from the immediate confrontation with flowers,but also that the dangerous situation created by their initial undertaking to kill yanni no longer existed.defendants have not met that burden.there is no doubt that clarke and jones entered building,armed with loaded guns,for the purpose of killing yanni and possibly other members of his crew.it makes no difference whether,as clarke testified,the plan was just to shoot yanni,or,as jones claimed,dent had ordered them to shoot yanni or any member of his crew that they encountered.when they encountered flowers in the stairwell,they had already created a dangerous situation,by virtue of their active participation in a conspiracy to commit murder.owen,at w hen these men entered the store,both armed with loaded guns,for the avowed purpose of robbery,they bargained for violence.and because the risk of just such an encounter was precisely what made their conduct so dangerous,the shooting was an act of violence arising therefrom.gray,at.
there was no evidence whatsoever that at the time clarke and jones shot flowers,the dangerous situation had abated or that clarke and jones had lowered their guns.indeed,clarke testified that at the time he gestured to flowers,he st
