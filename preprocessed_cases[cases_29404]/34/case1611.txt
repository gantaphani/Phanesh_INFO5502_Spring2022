a jury convicted phillip offill on one count of conspiracy to commit securities registration violations,securities fraud,and wire fraud,in violation of,and nine counts of wire fraud,in violation of.the indictment alleged that offill had participated in a pump and dump securities scheme,which was designed to evade securities registration requirements,artificially inflate the value of securities,and then realize a gain by selling them at the inflated value to the public.the district court sentenced offill to months imprisonment,a downward variance sentence.
on appeal,offill contends that the district court erred during trial by admitting opinion testimony of two experts and two lay witnesses for the government denying his request for a multiple conspiracy instruction and admitting evidence of subsequent acts not charged in the indictment.offill also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence,arguing,among other things,that the district court impermissibly imputed to him the gain resulting from the entire conspiracy when calculating the applicable offense level under.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in march david stocker,a securities lawyer in phoenix,arizona,retained phillip offill,a lawyer and securities specialist who had earlier worked for the securities and exchange commission,to advise him on how to issue free trading unrestricted stock without the need of filing a registration statement.stocker represented companies for whom the securities registration process was too costly.offill explained to stocker that he could use rule of regulation d of the securities act of and an analogous texas state law,texas administrative code tac,to create stock and avoid any requirement of registration.more specifically,offill advised stocker that rule and tac provided an exception to registration requirements when the stock is sold to an accredited investor who purchases the stock with investment intent.as offill explained,an accredited investor was a person with a net worth of million or a business owned by persons each with a net worth of million,and investment intent was generally demonstrated by holding a stock for a period of at least one year.
under the working arrangement between stocker and offill,offill orchestrated stock issuances with stocker during the period from april through august,and offill,through investment entities he controlled,served as the initial accredited investor in those transactions.stocker and offill produced legal opinion letters and stock subscription agreements for the transactions,asserting that the registration exemptions of rule and tac applied to the transactions that offill,as an accredited investor,had paid for the stock that the entity that offill controlled had purchased the stock with investment intent that offill had no present intention of selling the stock and that the transactions were not part of a scheme or plan to evade registration requirements.at offill suggestion,stocker included a statement in his opinion letters noting that stocker was not providing an opinion as to the stock purchasers status as underwriters.for each transaction,offill also created documents permitting stocker to transfer the shares.
offill received as compensation for his work on each of the transactions,for a total of.
many of the statements in the legal opinion letters and stock subscription agreements were in fact untrue.with respect to some of the stock issuances,offill and stocker devised a pump and dump scheme designed to artificially inflate stock prices and then sell the stock to the public for gain.in connection with each of these stock issuances,as well as other stock issuances,despite the representations in the subscription agreements that offill had purchased the stock with investment intent,offill in fact never paid for the stock.moreover,he allowed stocker to transfer the shares to coconspirators within days of the initial issuance,for public sale thereafter.under the pump and dump scheme,after offill and stocker distributed the stock to to create a secondary market,other conspirators,serving as promoters,organized marketing campaigns to increase the value of the shares through spam,press releases,and faxes that contained false information about the issuing companies.the conspirators also manipulated the price of the shares by coordinating their trading activities to limit the supply of available stock.once the stock reached a sufficiently high price,the conspirators dumped their shares by selling them to the public,providing the conspirators with a gain of millions of dollars.some of the proceeds of these sales were deposited in brokerage accounts associated with offill.
in count i of the indictment,offill was charged with participating in the illegal issuances of stock of nine companies emerging holdings,one issuance,massclick,one issuance china score,one issuance ecogate,one issuance media international concepts,one issuance vanquish productions,one issuance custom designed compressor systems,one issuance auction mills,two issuances and avl global,two issuances.count i also charged offill with conspiracy to artificially manipulate the stock prices of emerging holdings,massclick,and china score.the remaining nine counts charged offill with committing wire fraud in connection with his role in the stock issuance of emerging holdings.
following trial,a jury found offill guilty on all counts.the district court sentenced offill to months imprisonment on the conspiracy count and to months imprisonment for each of the wire fraud counts,all to run concurrently.the court enhanced the sentences on the wire fraud counts under because the conspiracy had gained more than million as a result of the illegal conduct.although the resulting sentencing guidelines range provided for to months imprisonment,the district court imposed a downward variance sentence of months imprisonment in order to avoid creating too great a disparity between offill sentence and the sentences of some,who had cooperated with the government.
this appeal followed.
offill contends first that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of two expert witnesses presented by the government steve thel,a professor of securities law at fordham university,and denise crawford,the commissioner of the texas state securities board arguing that their testimony included inadmissible legal conclusions and improperly addressed offill intent.offill claims that the experts testimony wrested the obligation to instruct the jury from the trial court and told the jury how to decide this case.
before trial,the government identified thel and crawford as experts on general securities law concepts and practice,including securities registration,exemptions from registration,restricted and unrestricted securities,and the functioning of markets.the government notice to offill about the anticipated testimony from these witnesses was detailed,outlining specifically each subject the government intended to cover with each witness.offill filed a motion in limine to preclud e the government expert witnesses from offering legal conclusions at trial and to instruct any government expert that testifies that he or she may not discuss the legal consequence of offill alleged conduct or the conduct of his alleged.ruling on offill motion,the district court stated that what the government had proposed to ask the witnesses would be admissible but,as offill had requested,the court imposed limits on the proposed testimony.the court stated 
in the response i think the government has properly drawn the line in stating that they will not ask for any expert witnesses to give opinions as to conduct being illegal manipulation,or that a party has acted unlawfully,or that an entity or individual is liable,and will not ask any question which goes to the intent of offill.
the court recognized that the government could present the witnesses testimony by way of hypothetical questions 
to talk about the functioning of the securities markets,the ordinary practices and procedures,the rationale behind those policies and procedures and the regulations that apply.these hypotheticals can at times get a little close to the line if,obviously,tailored specifically to the conduct here.
finally,the court pointed out that the line between proper and improper questions is not always clear and that counsel for offill should preserve objections at trial,stating 
certainly,brehm or watson,if you believe you are listening to a hypothetical that is about to clearly require an answer that goes over the line,there is no restraint in my ruling from you making objections at any time you believe that line has been crossed.
during trial,offill interposed no objection to the questioning of either thel or crawford.had any of the questions been improper and had offill objected,the court would have had the opportunity to regulate the testimony in light of the objection,directing the government to rephrase or avoid the objectionable question.for this reason,when no objection is made,we normally review objections raised for the first time on appeal under the plain error standard,set forth in federal rule of criminal procedure b.see united states mciver,cir.
offill did,however,describe objections to potential questions in his motion in limine,which ordinarily would preserve for appeal the right to review clear and definitive rulings made by the district court on the motion.see united states lighty,cir.but in this case the court rulings were general,and for that reason,the court invited offill specifically to object during trial with respect to questions that offill believed crossed the line.
in these ambiguous circumstances,the parties understandably dispute the appropriate standard of review to be applied.we need not,however,resolve the dispute because we reject each of offill assignments of error with respect to these expert witnesses testimony.
offill contends first that professor thel and commissioner crawford improperly gave opinions on the scope and meaning of specific legal terms and standards,including the meaning of the term underwriter the criteria for securities registration the aspects of spam that would qualify such as a general announcement and the criteria under tac for when investors can sell shares.he argues that this testimony crossed the line drawn in adalman baker,watts,cir,abrogated on other grounds by pinter dahl,d,for defining admissible testimony.in adalman,the court affirmed the district court exclusion of an expert witness in a securities case,reflecting an understanding that when an expert testimony directly concerns the ultimate issue in the case,the risk that the testimony will hinder the jury deliberations is especially heightened.the court noted that even though an expert may testify to an ultimate fact,and to the practices and usages of a trade,we think care must be taken lest,in the field of securities law,he be allowed to usurp the function of the judge.id.at quoting marx diners club,cir.
federal rule of evidence permits an expert to give opinions on scientific matters,technical matters,or matters involving other specialized knowledge so long as the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue emphasis added.the touchstone of the rule is whether the testimony will assist the jury.focusing on that criterion,we have held that it does not help the jury for an expert to give testimony that states a legal standard or draws a legal conclusion by applying law to the facts,mciver,at,because it supplies the jury with no information other than the witness view of how the verdict should read,weinstein federal evidence a ed.determining when legal conclusions would be helpful to the jury must also take into account the role that the judge has in instructing the jury on the law.we have noted,for example,that when a witness gives an opinion about the meaning of a specialized legal term,the witness is giving a legal conclusion that is better handled by the judge and,coming from the witness,will be of little assistance to the jury.
nonetheless,we have also noted that when the legal regime is complex and the judge determines that the witness testimony would be helpful in explaining it to the jury,the testimony may be admitted.see united states barile,cir.indeed,courts and commentators have consistently concluded that expert testimony that ordinarily might be excluded on the ground that it gives legal conclusions may nonetheless be admitted in cases that involve highly technical legal issues.see,united states bilzerian,cir particularly in complex cases involving the securities industry,expert testimony may help a jury understand unfamiliar terms and concepts peckham cont l cas.ins,cir expert testimony on proximate causation in insurance law was properly admitted because experts could reasonably be expected to shed some light in a shadowy domain weinstein federal evidence a ed expert testimony may be helpful if the case involves a specialized industry.
we conclude that the specialized nature of the legal regimes involved in this case and the complex concepts involving securities registration,registration exemptions,and specific regulatory practices make it a typical case for allowing expert testimony that arguably states a legal conclusion in order to assist the jury.the jury in this case needed to understand not only federal securities registration requirements but also the operation of several obscure texas code provisions and their relationship with the federal regime.to be sure,the ultimate responsibility for instructing the jury on the law belonged to the district court,but we can not conclude that in these circumstances the district court abused its discretion by concluding that the expert testimony presented in this case would assist the jury.indeed,we find it difficult to imagine how the government could have presented its case against offill without the assistance of expert testimony to explain the intricate regulatory landscape and how securities practitioners function within it.
offill argues in addition that the testimony of professor thel and commissioner crawford invaded the province of the jury in suggesting offill liability.our review,however,does not confirm that this occurred in any direct sense.barile,at excluding an expert conclusion that specific k submissions did not contain materially misleading statements united states scop,cir excluding expert testimony that an investment house had in fact conducted manipulative and fraudulent scheme marx,excluding expert testimony as to the meaning of particular contractual terms at issue in the case and whether the party had complied with those terms.instead,professor thel and commissioner crawford gave testimony on the general operation of securities law,even though the areas of testimony were directly relevant to the conduct with which offill was charged,allowing the jury to determine the law applicability to offill.see bilzerian,at expert testimony properly admissible where testimony was general background on federal securities regulation and the filing requirements of schedule.
finally,offill contends that it was an abuse of discretion to allow the government to use hypothetical questions in obtaining professor thel and commissioner crawford testimony on rebuttal.specifically,offill argues that professor thel and commissioner crawford gave opinion testimony addressing offill intent,in violation of federal rule of evidence b.that rule prohibits an expert witness from testifying with respect to the mental state or condition of a defendant as to whether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged.the rule provides that such intent is an ultimate issue for the jury alone to decide.in particular,offill objects to professor thel testimony,given in rebuttal to offill testimony,when professor thel stated
