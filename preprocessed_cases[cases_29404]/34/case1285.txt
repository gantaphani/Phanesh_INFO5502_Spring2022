defendants mellon financial corporation mfc and various entities appeal the district court order granting howley summary judgment on his claim for benefits under mfc displacement program.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
howley was employed for many years by a subsidiary of mfc known as buck consultants.he was therefore eligible for,and participated in,mfc displacement program.that program is a welfare benefit plan subject to the requirements and protections of the employee retirement income security act of erisa.
the displacement program provides benefits to an employee of mfc or its subsidiaries whose employment ceases due to technological change or another business reason not related to individual performance.these benefits include severance pay,and perhaps more importantly,continued eligibility to participate in and receive benefits under other mfc benefit plans,including pension plans.
the displacement program states that it is intended to help displaced employees bridge the gap between periods of employment or retirement income.an employee is therefore ineligible for displacement benefits if employment with an mfc subsidiary is terminated due to mfc sale of that subsidiary to a company that provides comparable employment.this sale of business exception applies when 
the employee employment with an mfc subsidiary is affected by mfc sale of a business to another employer where the terms of the sale,contract or transfer provide for employment of the employee by another employer and mfc determines such determination being made in mfc sole discretion that the position to be provided to the affected employee 
does not involve a significant change in responsibilities from those assigned to the employee immediately prior to the sale or transfer 
unless otherwise provided in the terms of the sale,contract or transfer,is at a location within a thirty mile radius of the employee location immediately prior to the sale or transfer or 
initially provides base salary and incentive compensation opportunities which,in the aggregate,are reasonably similar to those provided by the participating mfc company immediately prior to the sale or transfer.
effective on may,mfc sold buck to affiliated computer systems,acs.the contract of sale provided that acs would continue the employment of approximately buck employees,including howley,and that this employment would initially 
i not involve a significant change in responsibilities from those assigned to the particular transferred employee immediately prior to the transfer of such employment,ii offer employment at a location within a mile radius from the principal work location of such transferred employee immediately prior to the transfer of such employment,and iii provide base salary and incentive compensation opportunities which,in the aggregate,are reasonably similar to those provided to such transferred employee immediately prior to the transfer.
the next morning,may,at approximately,acs informed howley and other former buck employees that it was terminating their employment effective june.
howley filed a claim for benefits under mfc displacement program,but his claim was denied by the program manager who concluded that the aforementioned sale of business exception applied.she explained that the exception did not take into account the details of the job actually provided,but instead turned on the details of the job to be provided,as set forth in the contract of sale.she stated 
the determination of whether the sale of business exception has been satisfied in a particular instance must be made immediately prior to the closing sometimes referred to as a snap shot evaluation.that is,the sale of business exception is satisfied if,immediately prior to the closing,the buyer has agreed to continue employment on the terms specified by the exception 
purportedly using this snap shot approach,the program manager concluded that the sale of business exception applied because howley job duties,pay and location were unchanged immediately following the closing.
howley appealed the program manager decision to the program administrator,who affirmed the initial denial.like the program manager,the program administrator stated that the details of the employment acs actually provided to howley were not relevant for purposes of displacement program benefits.she explained that the program manger had thus correctly applied the sale of business exception on a snap shot basis,evaluating only the buyer representations in the sale agreement,and not taking into consideration the realities of that employment thereafter.because howley position at acs was for the same responsibilities,was at the same base salary and incentive compensation level and within thirty miles of the same location as his position at mfc immediately prior to the closing date of the sale,the program administrator agreed that the exception applied,and that howley was ineligible for displacement benefits.
howley brought suit in federal court,asserting claims for benefits and for unlawful discrimination under erisa,as well as several related state law claims.during discovery,it came to light that certain buck managers had helped plan his eventual termination by acs prior to the sale.these managers provided acs with the names of employees,including howley,whom they believed could be terminated immediately after the closing without causing harm to the business.thus,these managers knew,prior to the sale closing,that howley would never be a bona fide employee of acs.see.
upon completing discovery,howley moved for partial summary judgment on his claim for benefits,and defendants for summary judgment on all claims.the district court granted howley motion and denied defendants motion 
the court explained at the outset of its analysis that because the plan language gave mfc discretion in interpreting its terms and making benefit decisions,the court was required to review its decision deferentially.however,the court also recognized that because mfc both sponsored and administrated the displacement program,it operated under a conflict of interest.therefore,in accordance with precedent,pinto reliance standard life insurance,cir,the court applied a heightened arbitrary and capricious standard of review.
in addressing the merits of howley claim for benefits,the court relied heavily on the evidence,revealed during discovery,that buck had helped plan howley termination prior to the sale closing.the district court accordingly reasoned that,even under the snap shot approach used by the program administrator,howley had not received a bona fide offer of employment.because immediate termination is not a job offer that satisfies the requirements of the sale of business exception,the court held that mfc had abused its discretion in denying howley claim.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to e and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard that the court should have applied.smathers.emp.health welfare plan,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett.
under a b,a participant in an erisa benefit plan denied benefits by the plan administrator may sue in federal court to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch.when the administrator has discretionary authority,we review only for abuse of that discretion.of course,if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.id.quoting restatement second of trusts,comment d.
an administrator decision constitutes an abuse of discretion only if it is without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.abnathya roche,cir.
defendants challenge the district court decision on two primary grounds.first,they argue that the district court erred by applying a heightened standard of review.based on the supreme court recent decision in metropolitan life insurance glenn,they contend that an administrator conflict of interest does not result in heightened scrutiny of a decision to deny benefits.rather,it is just one factor to be considered in evaluating whether that decision constituted an abuse of discretion.second,defendants argue that when reviewing an administrator decision for abuse of discretion,a court may only consider the evidence that was before the administrator when it made the contested decision.accordingly,they insist that the district court erred by considering the evidence that buck managers helped plan howley termination prior to the sale to acs.although we agree that the district court erred in both regards,it is nonetheless clear,for reasons we set forth below,that mfc abused its discretion in denying howley claim for benefits.
defendants first argument is plainly correct.as we recently discussed in estate of schwing lilly health plan,prior to the supreme court decision in glenn,we had held that firestone required courts to adopt a sliding scale standard of review,in which the level of deference we accorded to a plan administrator would change depending on the conflict or conflicts of interest affecting plan administration,cir.however,following glenn,we acknowledged 
our sliding scale approach is no longer valid.instead,courts reviewing the decisions of erisa plan administrators in civil enforcement actions brought pursuant to a b should apply a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review across the board and consider any conflict of interest as one of several factors in considering whether the administrator abused its discretion.
id.emphasis added.therefore,as defendants argue,mfc conflict of interest does not alter the standard of review for evaluating its decision to deny howley benefits.rather,that conflict is merely one factor to be considered in evaluating whether mfc decision actually constituted an abuse of discretion.
defendants next argue that the district court erred by considering evidence outside of the administrative record.it is true that courts generally must base their review of an administrator decision on the materials that were before the administrator when it made the challenged decision.materials that the parties failed to put before the administrator are not usually relevant to the inquiry of whether the administrator abused its discretion.thus,under most circumstances,the record for review of erisa benefits denial is the record made before the plan administrator,and can not be supplemented during litigation.kosiba merck,cir.
however,this rule is not without exceptions.a court may certainly consider evidence of potential biases and conflicts of interest that is not found in the administrator record.see also burke pitney bowes.disability plan,cir t he district court may consider evidence outside the administrative record to decide the nature,extent,and effect on the process of any conflict of interest.internal quotation marks omitted.the necessity for this exception is obvious.a plan participant may be unaware of information relating to an administrator conflict until well after the administrative process has ended,and a conflicted administrator,especially one whose has been affected by that conflict,is not at all likely to volunteer that information.to allow an administrator the benefit of a conflict merely because it managed to successfully keep that conflict hidden during the administrative process would be absurd.
although we adopted this exception prior to the supreme court decision in glenn,it remains equally appropriate after glenn.glenn directs a court to consider a conflict of interest as a factor in its analysis,and to afford that factor greater importance,perhaps determinative importance,where the evidence suggests a greater likelihood that it affected the decision to deny benefits.at.for this legal standard to be meaningful,courts plainly must be willing to consider evidence relating to the nature,extent,and effect on the process of any conflict of interest revealed during the litigation process.burke,at.
here,the evidence considered by the district court was certainly relevant to assessing the extent of mfc conflict of interest,and by inference,the effect of that conflict on its process.this evidence shows that while mfc was negotiating acs continued employment of buck employees under terms that seemingly mirrored the requirements of the sale of business exception,its subsidiary was helping acs plan the immediate termination of of those employees.this arrangement would have financially benefitted mfc in two ways.first,it allowed mfc to avoid paying displacement program benefits to buck employees by making it appear that their employment would continue uninterrupted at acs.second,it made the acquisition of buck more appealing to acs,because acs knew that it could immediately slash costs by eliminating of the employees it had agreed to employ.the existence of such a perfectly orchestrated to ensure that mfc would not have to pay,directly or indirectly,the cost of certain promised surely evidence that a reasonable could deem relevant to whether mfc conflict of interest affected its decision to deny howley claim.
nonetheless,the district court afforded more weight to this evidence than is appropriate when deciding a motion for summary judgment.see nolan heald,cir holding that a court considering evidence outside of the administrative record because of its relevance to a conflict of interest must still construe that evidence in favor of the party for the purposes of summary judgment.it is uncontested that buck managers colluded with acs to plan howley termination in advance of the sale.however,it is not clear from the record why they did so,or at whose behest.moreover,mfc has denied any knowledge of,or involvement in,its subsidiary actions.accordingly,there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding mfc role in this duplicity.the district court erred in resolving this dispute in howley favor at this stage in the proceedings 
under these circumstances,we would normally remand so that the district court could evaluate howley claim in the first instance using these correct legal standards.however,notwithstanding the district court errors,we think it clear on this record that the denial of howley claim for benefits constituted an abuse of discretion.see fairview twp.epa,cir it is well settled that we can affirm the district court on any basis which finds support in the record.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,remand would only waste judicial resources and delay a decision on the merits.
in determining whether an administrator interpretation of a plan is reasonable,we consider the following factors 
whether the interpretation is consistent with the goals of the plan whether it renders any language in the plan meaningless or internally inconsistent whether it conflicts with the substantive or procedural requirements of the erisa statute whether the relevant entities have interpreted the provision at issue consistently and whether the interpretation is contrary to the clear language of the plan.
moench robertson,cir.construing all facts in defendants favor,and thus affording negligible weight to mfc conflict of interest,we conclude that its decision still fails by a majority of these measures,and was an abuse of its discretion.
as we have discussed,mfc displacement program is designed to help displaced employees bridge the gap between periods of employment or retirement income.when mfc sells a subsidiary,but ensures that the subsidiary employees will be provided comparable employment by the buyer,there is no gap to bridge.consequently,the program does not pay those employees benefits.consistent with this underlying purpose,the sale of business exception has two primary requir
