lori kennedy filed a complaint under title vii against her former employer,villa catherine,alleging that it engaged in religious discrimination and retaliation against her.after the district denied catherine motion for summary judgment,catherine filed this interlocutory appeal,contending that the plain language of a,the religious organization exemption,bars kennedy claims.in answering the question that is properly before us,we agree with catherine and,accordingly,reverse the district court decision.
catherine is a religious organization which operates a facility in emmitsburg,maryland it conducts itself under the direction of the daughters of charity,a religious order within the roman catholic church,and maintains its facility in accordance with catholic principles by engaging in numerous religious exercises.for instance,prayers are read over the intercom several times a day,the facility holds catholic mass on wednesdays,and communion is available daily.in addition,a crucifix is displayed on the wall of every resident room.statues of the virgin mary,jesus,and catherine patron saint catherine laboure adorn the facility landscape.catherine provides new employees with a handout entitled catherine nursing center mission,vision,and values,which explains that catherine nursing center is a family of faith rooted in the loving ministry of jesus as healer,and in the catholic tradition of service.at.likewise,the employee handbook affirms catherine catholic identity.
against this backdrop,catherine employed kennedy from to as a geriatric nursing assistant.kennedy is a member of the church of the brethren and,as a matter of religious principle,wears modest garb that includes long and a cover for her hair.at.at some point during kennedy employment,the assistant director of nursing services informed kennedy that her attire was inappropriate for a catholic facility and that it made residents and their family members feel uncomfortable.kennedy informed the assistant director that her attire was a function of her religious beliefs and that she would not change it.thereafter,kennedy employment was terminated on may.
in response,kennedy filed this action,alleging claims under title vii for religious harassment,retaliatory discharge,and discriminatory discharge on the basis of religion.catherine immediately moved for summary judgment arguing that as a religious organization it is exempt from title vii reach as to claims of religious discrimination.the district court agreed with catherine that kennedy claim for discriminatory discharge was barred but concluded that her religious harassment and retaliation claims are cognizable under title vii.catherine requested that the district court certify the order for interlocutory appeal under b,noting the potential effect of the ruling.the district court granted the request,and a panel of this court subsequently granted catherine petition for permission to appeal 
on appeal,catherine argues that the plain language of a,the religious organization exemption,makes clear that title vii does not apply to claims for religious harassment and retaliation against religious organizations we review such questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states ide,cir.our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil.if the statute is unambiguous,our inquiry into congress intent is at an end,for if the language is plain and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,we need not inquire further.william gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.i n looking to the plain meaning,we must consider the context in which the statutory words are used because w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.ayes united states dep t of veterans affairs,cir quoting united states morton.
with this legal framework in place,we turn to the issue before us.
title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of,inter alia,an individual religion.a.title vii also includes a retaliation provision that makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.a.title vii is not without bounds however,and has long included an exemption for religious organizations in certain circumstances.specifically,a provides that 
this subchapter of title vii shall not apply to a religious corporation,association,educational institution,or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation,association,educational institution,or society of its activities.
section a does not exempt religious organizations from title vii provisions barring discrimination on the basis of race,gender,or national origin.importantly,as originally enacted,the exemption applied only to personnel decisions related to carrying out an organization religious activities.see bishop of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints amos.the revised provision,adopted in,broadens the exemption to include any activities of religious organizations,regardless of whether those activities are religious or secular in nature.thus,t he decision to employ individuals of a particular religion under a and e has been interpreted to include the decision to terminate an employee whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent with those of its employer.hall baptist mem l health care,cir.
as catherine notes,the exemption for religious organizations provides that the subchapter,that is,shall not apply with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion.the district court determined that the term employment was synonymous with what it termed employment decisions like hiring and firing.at.on appeal,kennedy presses this reading of the statute,conceding that a bars her discriminatory discharge claim but contending that the exemption does not reach harassment or retaliation claims.
this narrow reading of employment is simply incompatible with the actual language of a.first,as in all statutory construction,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.bilski kappos,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.today,as at the time a was originally enacted,employment means the relationship between master and servant and the state of being employed.black law dictionary see also merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining employment as activity in which one engages or is employed or the act of employing the state of being employed associated contractors of america,houston chapter,enforced,cir e mployment connotes the initial act of employing as well as the consequent state of being employed.as the second circuit has explained 
in instances where congress uses as employment that have accumulated settled meaning under the common law,courts generally infer,unless the statute indicates otherwise,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms,the conventional relationship as understood by agency doctrine.
barfield new york city health hosps,cir quoting nationwide mut.ins.darden.this definition,which covers the breadth of the relationship between the employer and employee,clearly indicates that a should not be limited to hiring and firing decisions.
the use of the term employment elsewhere in title vii buttresses this conclusion.congress used the term employment in the operative section of title vii,labeling as unlawful the failure or refusal to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment on discriminatory grounds.a emphasis added.again,the term employment in this section encompasses more than hiring or firing if the term were so limited,the second clause would be superfluous.see los angeles of water power manhart,internal quotation marks omitted noting that the clause terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces congress intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment.moreover,there is a presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute.brown gardner.employment,as used throughout title vii,simply covers a much broader understanding than mere hiring and firing.indeed,if congress had intended to limit a to hiring and firing it could have copied the first clause from a,exempting religious organizations from title vii with respect to the decision to hire or to discharge an individual of a particular religion.it did not,and instead chose the broader term employment.
kennedy harassment and retaliation claims both arise from her state of being employed.in addition,the subchapter referred to in a includes both a,which covers harassment and discriminatory discharge claims,and a,which covers retaliation claims.see a retaliation meritor sav.bank vinson,holding harassment is discrimination on the basis of the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment under a.thus,kennedy three claims discharge,harassment,and retaliation all arise from the subchapter covered by the religious organization exemption,and they all arise from her employment by catherine.see saeemodarae mercy health,d,holding retaliation claim fell within the exemption because the retaliation provision is within the same subchapter lown salvation army,d,same.
this conclusion conforms with the purpose behind the exemption as well 
congress intended the explicit exemptions to title vii to enable religious organizations to create and maintain communities composed solely of individuals faithful to their doctrinal practices,whether or not every individual plays a direct role in the organization religious activities.
little wuerl,cir.thus,in little,a catholic school was permitted to decline to renew a teacher contract when she remarried permission to employ persons of a particular religion includes permission to employ only persons whose beliefs and conduct are consistent with the employer religious precepts.id.
in sum,if congress had wished to limit the religious organization exemption to hiring and discharge decisions,it could clearly have done so.instead,it painted with a broader brush,exempting religious organizations from the entire subchapter of title vii with respect to the employment of persons of a particular religion.this exemption reflect s a decision by congress that the government interest in eliminating religious discrimination by religious organizations is outweighed by the rights of those organizations to be free from government intervention.id.
further,a contrary interpretation of employment would lead to nonsensical results.kennedy admits that catherine could fire her for her religion without any recourse but,by first asking if she would consider changing her clothing before terminating her,by giving her the opportunity to keep her job catherine would suddenly open itself up to the strictures of title vii.such an approach can not be squared with congress desire in the first instance to permit a cooperative,accommodative approach to workplace discrimination.see alexander gardner denver,noting c ooperation and voluntary compliance were selected as the preferred means for achieving the equality of employment opportunities by eliminating discrimination.instead,kennedy view of the statute would counsel religious organizations to immediately discharge an employee over any religious issue rather than consider some attempt at compromise to permit the employee to remain employed 
in his dissent,judge king insists that we should not decide this appeal.the district court a panel of this court comprised of judge agee,judge motz,and judge king two members of this panel and as noted above both parties,agree that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.however,judge king now declares we should not hear it.noting that he was on the panel that granted permission to appeal,judge king states that after full briefing and oral argument he has decided that action was improvident.dissent op.at.in his view,because it is far from clear that kennedy has stated a viable title vii claim,dissent op.at,we should dismiss the appeal and wait for the district court to determine whether kennedy has stated and can prove her claims,dissent op.at.to our knowledge,there is nothing in the record before us now that was unavailable at the time certification was granted,and the parties do not address much less oppose the propriety of the certification in their briefs.
we disagree with judge king for several reasons.first,the requirements of b are clearly satisfied in this case.that provision provides that certification by a district court is appropriate if the district court order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.both requirements are met in this case.we are faced with a pure question of law and our resolution of it terminates the case.it was thus properly within our discretion to permit the appeal.nothing has changed since we granted permission to appeal which causes b to be inapplicable.
second,there is no doctrine counseling courts to avoid ruling on legal issues involving undisputed facts that are before them.to the contrary,that is the crux of article iii power and exercising such authority does not create an advisory opinion.courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them.colorado river water conservation dist.united states.thus,even the supreme court has answered legal questions posed in b orders before the factual development of the record has occurred.see,e,sumitomo shoji america,avagliano,noting that sumitomo moved to dismiss title vii case on ground that statute did not apply to its actions w ithout admitting the alleged discriminatory practice,and that the circuit court accepted an interlocutory appeal under b denying the motion to dismiss.
third,we are fully cognizant of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.see snyder phelps,cir shedd,concurring,affirmed on other grounds.in fact,as noted supra note,we are actually applying that doctrine in this case to avoid reaching catherine first amendment argument.however,judge king reliance on some form of statutory avoidance simply has no place in this case.indeed,if the district court in this case had,for instance,granted catherine motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim without addressing title vii religious exemption,we nonetheless would be free on appeal to affirm on the statutory basis without considering the merits.see,pitt county,cir noting we are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by the district court to support its decision,but we may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.judge king proposed course would lead to an anomalous result we could address the statutory issue even if the district court declined to do so,but we should not address it when as here it is the only issue properly before us.
finally,judge king approach would also waste judicial resources by mandating that we remand a case which he believes lacks any substantial merit for further proceedings and possibly costly discovery.this waste of judicial resources would not be limited to this case because judge king approach would counsel district courts to refrain from dismissing cases on statutory legal grounds when it is possible that the party will lose on the merits at some indeterminate point in the future.as we have noted before,r epetitive hearings,followed by additional appeals,waste judicial resources and place additional burdens on district and appellate judges while also siphoning those resources from more worthwhile cases.doe chao,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
because the plain language of a exempts religious organizations like catherine from kennedy claims of religious discrimination,the district court erred in denying catherine motion for summary judgment.we therefore reverse the district court order and remand with instructions to enter judgment in favor of catherine.

i must respectfully dissent from the majority decision because it unnecessarily settles a novel and complex statutory issue,thereby contravening the fundamental principle of judicial restraint.in one fell swoop,the majority interprets the a exemption to shield religious organizations from every title vii claim alleging either religious harassment or retaliation for opposing such harassment.rather than solve the difficult problem of whether the exemption stretches that far,i would decertify and dismiss this b interlocutory appeal,leaving the district court to answer the much simpler questions of whether kennedy has adequately pleaded or can forecast sufficient evidence to prove a title vii violation.if not,catherine would be entitled to dismissal or summary judgment,and the issue of the exemption reach would be moot

kennedy alleged three claims against catherine under title vii religious harassment,retaliatory discharge for opposing such harassment,and discriminatory discharge premised on her religion.catherine filed an answer to the complaint and,before the parties had completed any discovery,moved for summary judgment asserting that the a exemption for religious organizations precludes all of kennedy claims regardless of their merits.in response,kennedy conceded that her discriminatory discharge claim was barred by the exemption but opposed the motion as to her harassment and retaliation claims.the district court denied summary judgment as to those two claims,concluding that the exemption did not apply.see kennedy villa catherine,d.nevertheless,the court granted catherine request for certification of a b interlocutory appeal.see kennedy villa catherine,cv.june,the certification order

within ten days of the certification order entry,catherine filed in this court a petition for permission to appeal,which we granted by order of july.although i was a member of the panel that granted the petition,i am now convinced with the benefit of full briefing and oral argument that our action was improvident.accordingly,as further explained below,i would dismiss the appeal and await additional district court proceedings.
notwithstanding the possible applicability of the a exemption,it is far from clear that kennedy religious harassment and retaliation claims can survive a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss or a rule motion for summary judgment.as of yet,the parties have not conducted discovery,but the viability of kennedy claims can be gauged from the operative first amended complaint of december,the complaint
