this appeal challenges the denial of defendant joseph aitoro motion to suppress evidence and the validity of the sentence imposed after the defendant entry of a guilty plea and subsequent conviction.we find no error in the court denial of the motion to suppress or the court factual findings at sentencing,but vacate the sentence imposed and remand the case for resentencing in light of united states booker,d.
on the evening of july,several officers with the boston police department bpd were conducting a field investigation in the area on the border between roxbury and dorchester known as grove hall the officers were stationed in the area around the intersection of maple and cheney streets,a location described by the district court as a high crime area with frequent drug selling activity.on the night in question the weather was clear and the streets and intersection were well lit by street and building lights.two officers,james rattigan and john conroy,were positioned on the roof of a building overlooking the intersection,equipped with binoculars for surveilling the street below and with a for communicating with the officers on the street.three more officers were positioned on cheney street,watching two teenagers sitting on a stoop down the block.other officers had distributed themselves around the area.
just after ten,appellant joseph aitoro and one deshawn williams walked down maple street in the direction of cheney street.the two men spotted the three officers on cheney street,who had gotten out of their car in order to interview the teenagers they had been observing aitoro and his companion appeared quickly to recognize the three men as police officers.officer conroy,from up on the roof,heard one of the two men exclaim oh shit,and the pair then did an abrupt and sprinted in the reverse direction up maple street.
both men were wearing loose shirts that partially obscured the officers view of their waists from the roof,but as they turned to run,officer rattigan saw aitoro grab at the waist of his pants,where rattigan saw a bulge that he thought was a gun.although williams had his hands in front of him and rattigan could not see his precise movements,rattigan perceived williams also grabbing at his waist,and suspected that he,too,was reaching for a gun.rattigan radioed supporting officers with instructions to stop the fleeing men,warning that they might be armed.officer martin conley and other officers in a van nearby saw aitoro and williams,who by then had slowed to a walk,and stopped them.conley frisked aitoro and felt a pistol jammed into his pants at the waist.a second officer frisked williams and found he too was carrying a gun.the officers arrested aitoro and williams.
aitoro was held in a suffolk county jail until october,when he was released on bail.the record reveals little about aitoro activities or whereabouts over the course of the next several months,but on may,a team of officers from the bpd,along with agents from the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms,and explosives atf,executed a search warrant at an apartment in dorchester.there they found aitoro asleep in bed,along with two loaded firearms,additional ammunition,three bags of cocaine base,six bags of heroin,and a bag of marijuana.they again arrested aitoro.
on june,aitoro was charged in an indictment with one count of possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon under g stemming from the seizure of the gun from aitoro person in july a second count of the same stemming from the seizure of the two firearms from the room in which aitoro was found in may two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance under a,one each for the cocaine base and the heroin seized from the dorchester apartment and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense under c.a superceding indictment handed down by a grand jury on july,reiterated the charges against aitoro and added deshawn williams as a codefendant under another charge 
aitoro moved to suppress the pistol found on his person in july as the fruit of an unconstitutional search he argued that the officers who stopped him on that july night lacked grounds to suspect him of wrongdoing,or,if they had rightfully stopped him,lacked grounds to frisk him.the district judge denied the motion,finding that aitoro exclamation at the sight of the police,his subsequent flight,his grabbing at his waist,and the fact that the incident took place in an area known for a high incidence of crime gave the police reason to stop aitoro and sufficient concern for their safety to justify the frisk.
under a plea agreement,aitoro pled guilty to the and narcotics charges,reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motions and change his plea if successful.his trial on the charge of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense resulted in an acquittal by a petit jury in january 
at sentencing,the court determined that aitoro merited a criminal history category of v.the court calculated aitoro base offense level under the drug quantity guideline,ussg,and found that aitoro had possessed grams of cocaine.aitoro challenged the drug quantity finding,highlighting an apparent disparity between earlier and later recorded weights of the drugs the police had seized.the record contained three documents indicating the weight of the drugs as measured at various times after aitoro arrest.the first was an inventory taken of aitoro possessions at the time of his arrest in may.that inventory was produced by the atf,and documented the seizure,among other items,of 
narcotics heroin,qty,mea grams,plastic sandwich bag containing two separate bundles of suspected heroin 
narcotics crack cocaine,qty,mea grams,plastic sandwich bags containing suspected crack cocaine 
narcotics marijuana,qty,mea grams,plastic sandwich bag containing suspected marijuana 
according to the atf documents,after being stored for six weeks by the atf,the drugs were sent to a massachusetts drug laboratory for analysis.a second document,a receipt given by the state lab to the atf when the lab received the drugs,listed 
six glassine bags of grams 
three white rock grams 
one green leaf grams 
these weights were identified as gross weight s on the receipt,indicating that they were the combined weights of the drugs themselves and the bags holding those drugs.the lab analyst who processed the heroin weighed the contents of only one of the six glassine bags of heroin but did not weigh the marijuana.he did calculate the precise net weight of the cocaine seized.his worksheet describing his analysis of the cocaine base listed a gross weight of grams and a net weight of grams.
aitoro contended that the lower weights indicated on the atf inventory cast too much doubt on either the reliability of the later weights or the identity of the earlier and drugs to support a finding that the later figures were accurate measures of the drugs with which aitoro had been found.the district court disagreed,finding that the drugs weighed in the state lab were the drugs seized from aitoro room,and that the state lab weights were accurate.the state lab figure for the cocaine base became the basis for a base offense level of under ussg.
the district court then imposed a upward adjustment for possessing a firearm in close proximity to controlled substances under ussg b and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under ussg a b.these adjustments produced a total offense level of.the guidelines sentencing range that resulted was for a sentence of between and months.the court,sentencing before the decision in booker,took the guidelines as binding and imposed a sentence of months,the low end of the guidelines range.it did so despite noting that aitoro had a long arrest record and after giving him a warning that he needed to reform.it observed that aitoro was obviously intelligent,was an engaged participant in his own defense,accepted responsibility for his crime,and had a grandmother who loved him and a daughter for whose upbringing he was responsible.aitoro raised no constitutional objection to his sentence.he now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress and challenges his sentence.
aitoro presses five questions on appeal.he argues that the july was unconstitutional and that the gun found on his person should have been suppressed that the case should be remanded for resentencing under booker,as interpreted by united states antonakopoulos,cir and united states heldeman,cir that the government presented insufficient evidence to support a finding by a preponderance that aitoro possessed more than five grams of cocaine base and that in any event the quantity of drugs in his possession had to be found by a jury and beyond a reasonable doubt and that the terms of aitoro supervised release should be interpreted to permit aitoro probation officer to administer a maximum of three drug tests during the supervised release period.we take each argument in turn.
aitoro first challenges the district court denial of his motion to suppress the gun found during the july,arguing that the police lacked grounds for both the stop and the search.when reviewing a district court determination that evidence must or need not be suppressed on fourth amendment grounds,we review the district court factual determinations for clear error.united states mckoy,cir citing united states cruz,cir.we review de novo the legal question whether a particular set of facts justified a warrantless search or seizure.id.
an officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop when he or she has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.id.citing terry ohio,d united states romain,cir.after a valid terry stop,a for weapons is also permissible where the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others.id.quoting romain,at.whether the stop and the frisk were reasonable is evaluated in the context of the totality of the circumstances and demands a practical,commonsense approach.united states jones,cir quoting united states sowers,cir.we have little difficulty concluding that both the stop and the frisk of aitoro were proper.
our conclusion as to the initial stop is dictated by the supreme court decision in illinois wardlow,d.wardlow turned primarily on two factors the defendant presence in an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking and the defendant headlong flight the moment he noticed the police.wardlow,at.see also united states scott,cir an individual flight from police combined with other observations by a police officer may support reasonable suspicion sufficient for detention under terry.citing wardlow.this case would be closer to the outer bounds of wardlow had the surveilling officer not heard one of the two fleeing men cry oh,shit before turning to run,but in light of that exclamation the officer had all the more reason to think that the men had seen the police officers and were attempting to evade apprehension.furthermore,when the officers on the ground encountered aitoro and williams a few minutes after they took flight,they noticed them looking warily over their shoulders,as if concerned about pursuers.that observation could reasonably have further heightened the officers suspicion that the two men had run in order to avoid police detection.
aitoro attempts to distinguish his case by noting that in wardlow,the police were specifically on the lookout for customers and scouts for drug traffickers looking for approaching police,and that in that context,the fact that the defendant in wardlow was spotted carrying a bag made him,aitoro contends,a particular target for suspicion.this was because the bag might have led the police to believe that he was participating in drug trafficking.aitoro claims that he was doing nothing that would have singled him out as a participant in drug trafficking,which was here,as in wardlow,the reason for the neighborhood reputation as a area and the reason the police were in the area in the first place.but aitoro exclamation and his apparent reaching for his gun gave the police at least as much additional basis for suspicion of involvement in narcotics trafficking here as the wardlow defendant bag gave the police in that case 
aitoro also raises a question about the factual predicate for the district court legal conclusion.he suggests that the district court conclusion that aitoro recognized the officers in question as police officers was dubious because the officers were not in uniform and were standing perhaps feet from the corner when aitoro and williams came around the bend.the reasonableness of a search entails an objective inquiry into the search from the perspective of the searching officers,however,so what is relevant is not whether aitoro actually perceived the officers as police officers,but whether the officers reacted reasonably on seeing him flee.
aitoro finally contends that,even if the stop itself was permissible,the concomitant search of his person was not.this argument is unavailing.when an officer sees a bulge in a detainee clothing and reasonably believes that bulge to be a concealed weapon,under the right circumstances the officer will have license to search the detainee.here,the bulge that the officer observed in aitoro waistband,when viewed in light of the other details surrounding the encounter,aitoro flight from the police and the fact that the neighborhood was known for a high incidence of crime permitted a reasonable inference that appellant was armed and dangerous.united states proctor,cir see also united states trullo,cir frisk incident to a stop was justified by officer concern that bulge in defendant clothing was a weapon.aitoro makes a second argument based on the fact that one of the officers on the roof radioed to the officers on the ground to tell them to apprehend aitoro and his companion and to warn them that he had a gun,and that the frisking officer had not seen the bulge that was thought to be a gun firsthand.aitoro implicitly questions whether it was reasonable for the officer on the ground to rely on the warning of the officer on the roof,but his argument fails.the police may rely on information from other members of their force and respond accordingly.romain,at p olice officers are not limited to personal observations in conducting investigatory activities citing adams williams,d.under the circumstances of the stop,and given warning that aitoro likely had a gun,the detaining officer was justified in frisking him,and the gun found during the frisk need not have been suppressed.
booker remand 
we next address the question of remand in light of booker,because our decision to remand the case has some effect on how we approach the other questions aitoro has raised.the trial court erred in sentencing aitoro because it understood the sentencing guidelines as binding and sentenced aitoro accordingly.see antonakopoulos,at.booker subsequently excised the portions of the federal sentencing act that mandated sentencing within a calculated guidelines range,and we now review sentences imposed before booker by assessing the probability that a different sentence would have been imposed had the district court understood the guidelines as advisory.where a defendant has made an argument to the district court that it should not consider itself bound by the guidelines,the burden is on the government to demonstrate the harmlessness of the booker error,united states,cir,but where the defendant has not preserved such an objection,we review for plain error,and the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that the district court,freed of mandatory guidelines,would have given him a lower sentence.antonakopoulos,at.we are not overly demanding as to proof of probability where,either in the existing record or by plausible proffer,there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.heldeman,at.because aitoro did not preserve a booker objection below,we apply this plain error analysis.
we believe there is some chance that the court might have imposed a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.to begin with,the district court sentenced aitoro to the minimum sen
