opinion of the court 
this case comes to us on appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of andrew and deirdre jointly the ms.the district court concluded that the delaware county office of mental health and mental retardation the county had violated part c of the individuals with disabilities education act idea and the rehabilitation act ra by denying the ms twin sons services in their natural environment,and granted the ms compensatory education and attorney fees.the county appealed,claiming that the ms did not put forth evidence proving that the services required under the idea were discontinued for the period in question or that the services were not provided in an appropriate environment,and that the ms failed to prove an ra violation.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the idea claim and reverse its grant of summary judgment on the ra claim.
and are brothers and fraternal twins who were born on november.the ms are their parents.in,both twins were presenting with significant speech and communication delays and functioning at levels significantly below their peers.based on these problems,the county determined that they were eligible for early intervention ei services in accordance with part c of the idea,and assembled a team to develop an individualized family service plan if sp for each boy.after it was determined that the speech services the twins received were not effective in the home,the ifsp team determined that services could better be rendered in a program as the boys needed social interaction with peers and adults.therefore,the team and the parents filled out a justification for services form,which authorized the boys speech services to be provided at a center for children run by the cerebral palsy association of delaware county cades both parties agree that the center is a segregated environment as it does not provide services for children who are not disabled.
as part of their ifsps,both and used the picture exchange communication system pecs.the pecs provides a way for children with speech delays to communicate through the use of icons.both boys received pecs services.in march of,requested that the twins be allowed to attend a pecs summer camp.the request was denied and the ms sent the twins to the camp at their own expense.
in the meantime,on january,requested that the ei services which were currently provided at the cades center be provided in a typical setting.she told the county that she had found a location,faith,where the boys could have a classroom setting that included involvement with children.the county denied that request,stating that delaware county could not provide that service as it did not have a contract to provide services at faith.therefore,on january,the ms enrolled the twins at faith at their own expense.while there is a dispute as to whether the boys continued receiving certain ei services somewhere other than faith,the county agrees that it did not provide ei services at faith between january and june.the county records indicate that requested services at faith on at least two other occasions,april,and may.eventually,the county sent someone to observe the boys at faith.mindy glassberg,the boys primary pecs therapist,testified that she observed the boys on april and may,at request.the county records indicate that it sent someone from cades to observe the boys at faith in late may.on june,the county informed the ms that the cades observer believed that two,units per month of speech services would be appropriate at faith.while had been hoping for more frequent services,she agreed to begin with the two hours per month.shortly thereafter,the boys began receiving ei services at faith.
in july,the ms requested that a new pecs therapist replace glassberg.the ms claim that during the transitional period between therapists that followed,and were not provided the pecs services required by their ifsps.the county did not dispute that there were missing pecs service hours.
based on their disputes with the county over the twins ei services,the ms brought two different due process claims against the county.initially,after the county denied request that it pay for her sons attendance at the pecs summer camp,the ms brought a due process claim against the county seeking compensation for the boys attendance.after a hearing on june,june,and july,the hearing officer determined that,while attendance at the camp might be beneficial for the boys,it was not necessary.the boys were making appropriate progress under their ifsps as written without attendance at the camp.because there was general agreement between the ms and the county that the ifsps were appropriate,and because there was no strong evidence suggesting the boys were required to attend the camp,the hearing officer denied the ms claim for compensation for the pecs summer camp.
the ms appealed the decision to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania in addition to seeking compensation for the twins attendance at summer camp,the ms also made a claim for the missing pecs service hours,which had not been briefed before the hearing officer.the district court ruled that the county erred in failing to fund the camp for,but not for.as to the missing service hours,the district court found that the ms had not exhausted their administrative remedies and,therefore,dismissed the claims without prejudice so that the ms could return for a decision at the administrative level.
in january,the ms returned to the administrative level seeking compensatory education for the pecs hours that were missed during the therapists transition and seeking relief because the twins were not provided ei services in their natural environment for the first five months they were at faith.the ms also made a claim under the ra.all evidence and additional briefing was to be submitted to the hearing officer by may.the ms submitted a brief on may and additional exhibits on may.the county did not submit any information.based on the evidence before her,the hearing officer ruled as to each twin individually.
the hearing officer made the following findings of fact.she determined that both children suffered from developmental delays that resulted in their approval for ei services under the idea.both children had speech services transferred to the cades center so as to receive services in a program.this was necessary because the cades program maximized interaction with peers and adults and provided a structured environment in which to engage in activities with other children and adults.after the twins began attending faith,the ms expressed concerns that the boys were not interacting at an appropriate level and requested that someone from the county come observe the boys at faith.it took at least two months for someone to observe the twins at faith.as to the missing pecs hours,the hearing officer determined that the county failed to provide approximately nineteen hours of pecs services to and five hours of pecs services to 
based on these factual findings,the hearing officer made the same legal determinations as to each boy except for finding that each was entitled to a different number of missing pecs hours.the hearing officer first determined that there was no dispute that the boys were deprived of pecs services while they were clients of the county.finding that the most common remedy under part b of the idea for deprivation of services is compensatory education,the hearing officer found that this was also an appropriate remedy under part c and ordered the county to provide with units of compensatory education services and to provide with nineteen units of compensatory education services.
the hearing officer next addressed the ms natural environment claims.the hearing officer determined that natural environment under part c of the idea included faith,as it was an environment where typical,children would be found.concluding that the natural environment requirement under part c of the idea was analogous to the least restrictive environment requirement under part b of the idea,the hearing officer found that it was the county burden to show that the twins were educated in their natural environment.she found that the county had failed to show that it had provided the boys with services in their natural environment.the hearing officer ultimately awarded the ms in tuition reimbursement for each child for the time spent at faith without the services,but did not award compensatory education for the five months that services were not provided in the natural environment the hearing officer did not address the ms ra claim.the county did not appeal the hearing officer decision.
following the decision,the county paid the tuition reimbursement ordered by the hearing officer,but the ordered compensatory education for the missing pecs hours was not provided,as the parties could not agree as to how to make up those hours.after the county refused to pay attorney fees that the ms had requested by letter,the ms filed a complaint in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on august.
the ms complaint sought attorney fees under the ra,the americans with disabilities act ada and,the relief they were due under the hearing officer opinion,and additional relief not granted by the hearing officer.the ms complaint alleged that the hearing officer had found in favor of their children on the natural environment claim,but did not provide compensation for the services listed on the ifsp that were not provided when the children were at faith.in addition,the ms maintained that b of the ra provided an additional basis for recovery,including the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action under the ra.
following service of the complaint,the parties filed for summary judgment.based on the motions,the district court entered judgment in favor of the as to the ms claim that the hearing officer agreed with them on their natural environment claim but failed to provide compensation,the district court agreed,finding that the services that had been provided to the twins at the cades center prior to their enrollment at faith had ceased as of january.the county has not argued here,nor did they argue before the h earing o fficer,that the prescribed services were actually provided between january and june,such as if,for example,the children attended both cades and faith at the same time.it,therefore,awarded the ms compensatory education.as to the ms claim under the ra,the district court simply stated that i have found that the plaintiffs claim for five months of compensatory education for the missing supplemental services was valid.as the prevailing parties in a rehabilitation act case,plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney fees.the district court found that the county could not be held liable under.
following this initial decision,entered on january,the district court allowed the parties to provide additional briefing on the issue of attorney fees.following the receipt of briefs on the issue,the district court again determined that the ms could recover attorney fees.while part c of the idea does not provide for the recovery of attorney fees,the district court stated that attorney fees were recoverable under b of the ra.however,the district court ruled that the only fees which were recoverable were those expended in bringing the appeal to the district court and not those costs that resulted from bringing the claims which were successful at the administrative level.the district court therefore awarded the ms approximately in attorney fees.
this timely appeal followed.

two of the claims in this case arise under part c of the idea,et.based on a congressional finding that there was an urgent need to enhance development for toddlers with disabilities and help families meet the needs of their toddlers with disabilities,congress passed part c of the idea to encourage states to create statewide programs to provide for developmentally delayed and disabled toddlers.under part c of the idea,ifsps are developed with the consent and cooperation of toddlers families.id.at a.the ifsp contains a statement of the child present levels of development,goals to be achieved for the child and the child family,and the services necessary to meet the stated goals.bucks county of mental retardation demora,cir citing d.services provided under part c include family training and counseling,physical and occupational therapy,speech therapy,special instruction,and social work services.e.these services are to be provided,whenever possible,in the child natural environment.id.g.as under the part b of the idea,parents who are dissatisfied with their toddler ifsp or services may file a due process claim against the state entity responsible for providing the services.id.
the county claims that the district court made two errors when finding in the ms favor on their idea due process claim.it argues that the district court inappropriately put the burden of proof on the county,as the defendant,to prove that services continued while the twins were at faith,and that the district court improperly found that services were not provided in the twins natural environment.
the county first contends that the district court improperly placed the burden on it to prove that appropriate services were provided to the twins.in its opinion,the district court stated that the county failed to prove that any services were provided to the twins while they were at faith,as would have been the case if,for example,the twins had continued attending cades in addition to faith.this,the county argues,impermissibly required it to bear the burden of proving the provision of services rather than requiring the ms to prove the absence of services.
we begin our analysis of the appropriate burden of proof with the language of the statute.under part c of the idea,an aggrieved party may bring an action in a district court to resolve its grievance 
any party aggrieved by the findings and decision regarding an administrative complaint shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint in any state court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the united states without regard to the amount in controversy.in any action brought under this paragraph,the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings,shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party,and,basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence,shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.
a section does not contain any indication of which party bears the burden of proof when a claim is brought.
as we have no case law directing the appropriate burden under part c of the idea,we turn to relevant case law under part prior to,most courts agreed that,at the due process hearing,the state or county providing services to individuals eligible under the idea bore the burden of proving that it was providing appropriate services.ramsey bd.of,cir.however,that changed with the supreme court decision in schaffer weast,d.the supreme court made very clear that it was speaking only of the burden of other words which party loses if the evidence is closely not of the burden of party bears the obligation to come forward with the evidence at different points in the proceedings.id.at.because of the presumption that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the essential elements of his claim,and finding nothing in the language of the idea to suggest otherwise,id.at,the supreme court held that the burden of persuasion lies with the party seeking relief.id.at.therefore,when the school district challenges an individualized education plan iep under part b,the burden lies with it.when the parents challenge the iep,the burden lies with them.we see no reason why the burden of persuasion would lie with a different party under part 
in addition to bearing the burden of persuasion,the party challenging an administrative decision faces the additional hurdle of overcoming a presumption that the hearing officer findings were correct.although a district court may make its own findings of fact by a preponderance of the evidence and look at evidence outside the administrative record,it is required to give the administrative decision due weight.shore reg l high,at citing bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch,westchester county rowley,d.under this standard,f actual findings from the administrative proceedings are to be considered prima facie correct,and i f a reviewing court fails to adhere to them,it is obliged to explain why.id.quoting sch.dist.of city of newark,cir.in the case before us,these standards interact in an unusual fashion.in most cases under the idea,a party challenging an administrative decision will need to challenge the findings of the hearing officer.however,in this case,the hearing officer factual determinations were favorable to the it was only her failure to provide appropriate compensation and her failure to address the ms ra claim that the ms challenged.therefore,while the ms bore the burden of persuasion at the district court level,the county was bound by the hearing officer determinations unless it could provide specific evidence as to why those findings were incorrect.with this in mind,we turn to the district court finding regarding the provision of services.
in her decision,the hearing officer made several factual findings.she determined that the twins were not provided services at faith prior to the time the county sent people to observe them.months went by before the county even agreed to observe the twins at faith s let alone provide services there although faith s was the twins natural environment.the district court had to give due weight to that decision.however,the hearing officer did not explicitly find that the county failed to provide services to the twins at a location other than faith,such as cades.therefore,the district court statement that t he county has not argued here,nor did it argue before the h earing o fficer,that the prescribed services were actually provided between january and june,such as if,for example,the children attended both cades and faith at the same time,was made based on its own review,not by giving due weight to the hearing officer determination.
in their papers before the district court,the ms argued that the county failed to provide the twins with special instruction for the first five months that they were in the natural environment.they further alleged that each twin is entitled to compensatory education for missing special instruction that was identified on each one ifsp but which was not delivered from the point the county stopped delivering the service until such time as the team developed a new ifsp.each twin was denied hours of special instruction from january until june hours each.in support of this contention,the ms pointed to the fact that requested that services currently provided at the cades center be transferred to faith,subsequently enrolled her children in faith,and then twice requested that services be provided at faith.this,the ms argue,allows for a reasonable inference that the twins were not being provided services anywhere.the county countered merely by stating that the ms did not provide sufficient evidence that services were not provided.it never argued that services actually were provided.in its opinion,the district court faulted the county for failing to argue that services were provided or provide any evidence of the continuation of services.the county argues that this improperly shifted the burden of proof.
however,we need not decide whether under these a party opposes summary judgment simply by claiming a lack of proof rather than by disputing a material district court improperly placed the burden on the defendant.the ms did not need to prove that services stopped entirely in order to prove their claim.just as a state agency may violate part b of the idea by providing services but failing to do so in the least restrictive environment,kingwood twp.bd.of,cir,when an agency provides ei services but fails to provide them in the natural environment without appropriate justification,that agency violates part c of the idea.see g d ii.as the ms claim rests on the fact that services were not delivered at faith,a fact the county admits,any error the district court may have made by requiring the county to prove that it provided services elsewhere was harmless 
the question we are left with,then,is not whether there was sufficient evidence to show that services were stopped altogether,but whether the district court appropriately found that the county had violated the idea by not providing ei to the twins at faith.in other words,we must address whether faith is the kind of natural environment contemplated by the idea.
we again begin with the language of the statute.part c of the idea provides money to states that develop and implement a comprehensive,coordinated,multidisciplinary,interagency system that provides early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families.b.those services are to be provided,when possible,in the child natural environment.id.g.the child natural environment includes the home and community settings in which children without disabilities participate.b.the regulations further define natural environment as settings that are natural or normal for the child age peers who have no disabilities.id.examples of such natural environments include the home,child care centers,or other community settings.id.if services will not be provided in a natural environment,the ifsp must include a justification.id.d ii.
in the present case,the hearing officer determined,and the district court agreed,that the twins were denied access to special instruction in their natural environment.as the county did not appeal the decision of the hearing officer,it appears that it is bound by that decision.however,even if it was not bound by that legal determination,its claim would still fail.at this stage,the county argues that natural environment does not include preschools.it turns first to the language used to describe natural environment as support.citing to note of,the county states n atural environments have been described by the legislature as including home,child care centers and community settings,not preschools.this argument reads the list of natural environments too narrowly.note to reads 
however,for these and other eligible children,early intervention services must be provided in natural environments,the home,child care centers,or other community settings to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the child.
emphasis added.clearly this list of examples is not exclusive,hence the natural environments can encompass more than simply homes and child care centers.
in fact,the regulations define natural environment much more broadly than the list provided in note to.natural environments are settings that are natural or normal for the child age peers who have no disabilities.id.the question is whether faith was a normal setting for a child the twins age without disabilities.the twins ifsp team determined that both boys required a structured environment that provides a balance of adult direction and child centered activities and modification s to maximize communication and interaction with peers and adults.parents looking to encourage their child interaction with peers and adults and engage their child in activities would likely enroll their child in a day care or preschool.therefore,faith is precisely the kind of natural environment contemplated by the idea 
the county also argues that the hearing officer comparison between the natural environment requirement in part c of the idea a
