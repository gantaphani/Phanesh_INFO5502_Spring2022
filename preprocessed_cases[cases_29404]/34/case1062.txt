marcus mosby appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york richard arcara,chief judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.mosby contends that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of appellate counsel when,on direct appeal,his counsel failed to raise a suppression issue arising under the fourth amendment and the new york state constitution.the state trial court ruled that mosby lacked standing to challenge his warrantless arrest because he did not live in the house where he was arrested,and denied his motion to suppress a confession and photo identification that ultimately led to his murder conviction.because the underlying suppression issue,when considered in accordance with the attenuation analysis of brown illinois,d,lacks merit,we conclude that appellate counsel omission did not prejudice mosby.consequently,we affirm.
background 
on april,witnesses observed an assailant known only by the nickname florida shoot and kill two men on bloomingdale street,in rochester,new york.five days later,rochester police officers conducted an unrelated buy and bust operation,in which mosby sold a bag of crack cocaine to a police informant,with an undercover officer present.the drug deal took place through the window of a house at costar street,two miles from the site of the homicides.four uniformed police officers arrived shortly thereafter,without a warrant for mosby arrest.they knocked at the front door of the house,which was answered by mosby son.the child informed them that his father was upstairs,sleeping.after four or five attempts to coax him downstairs,the uniformed officers entered the house and took mosby into custody.the undercover officer then identified mosby as the person he had observed selling cocaine earlier,and mosby was placed under arrest.
while mosby was waiting in a police car outside the house,a passing neighbor,lanna pulley,noticed him in the car and asked an officer what was happening with florida.according to the arresting officers report,pulley told police that mosby had been living at costar for the past two months.
on hearing the nickname florida attributed to mosby,the arresting officers contacted investigators working on the bloomingdale street homicides.later that evening,the police presented a photo array including mosby photo to four different witnesses to the homicides.all four identified mosby as the shooter.after being read miranda warnings,mosby declined an attorney,and the police questioned him about the homicides.mosby ultimately confessed,and the police prepared a written statement which he reviewed and signed after midnight,on the same night as his arrest.he was subsequently indicted,tried,and convicted on homicide charges 
prior to trial,mosby moved to suppress the confession and photo identifications on the ground that his warrantless home arrest violated the fourth amendment.mosby claimed that he had been living at costar street for at least two months.the trial court held that mosby did not have standing to assert a fourth amendment claim since he was merely a casual visitor with a transient presence at costar and thus had no legitimate expectation of privacy there.accordingly,the court denied mosby suppression motion.
at trial,mosby testified that he shot the two individuals in.the four eyewitnesses testified,identifying mosby as the gunman.his confession was admitted during the state rebuttal case.the jury convicted mosby on two counts of murder in the second degree,and the court sentenced him to consecutive terms of years to life.
on direct appeal,mosby attorney did not challenge the adverse suppression ruling.the only issue he raised was that,during,the prosecutor improperly impeached mosby by asking him about details in his trial testimony that did not appear in the statement he had given to the police.the appellate division rejected this argument,and the new york court of appeals denied mosby leave to appeal.people mosby.
mosby then filed an application for a writ of coram nobis seeking to vacate his conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise several issues,including the trial court suppression ruling.the appellate division summarily denied the application.see people mosby.subsequently,mosby filed a habeas corpus petition asserting the same claim as his coram nobis petition,which the district court denied.we granted a certificate of appealability limited to the issue of whether failure to raise the suppression issue on direct appeal constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court decision to deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo,and its factual conclusions for clear error.see gersten senkowski,cir doe menefee,cir.mosby petition is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa 
we have held that in light of strickland washington,d,a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim necessarily invokes federal law that has been clearly established by the supreme court within the meaning of aedpa.sellan kuhlman,cir see williams taylor,d recognizing the strickland test as clearly established law for purposes of aedpa.although the appellate division summary rejection of mosby coram nobis petition did not mention mosby federal claim,it nonetheless constituted an adjudication on the merits.see sellan,at.thus,as the district court recognized,we must apply aedpa highly deferential standard in reviewing mosby ineffective assistance of counsel claim.see eze senkowski,cir acknowledging that the heavy burden of showing ineffective assistance is enhanced by the hurdle posed by the highly deferential review accorded state court adjudications under aedpa citations omitted.
to establish ineffective assistance under strickland,mosby must show that his appellate counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he was prejudiced by the deficient representation.strickland,at.to demonstrate prejudice,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.because mosby ineffective assistance claim is based on counsel failure to raise fourth amendment issues,he must also show that his fourth amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence.kimmelman morrison,d see also laaman united states,cir.
under d,our inquiry is not whether the appellate division rejection of mosby ineffective assistance claim was incorrect,but whether,in light of strickland,it was objectively unreasonable.see sellan,at williams,at,for the court,pt.ii an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application.to be objectively unreasonable,a state court application of clearly established federal law must involve s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error.sellan,at internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.mosby suppression claim 
warrantless arrest 
to determine whether the fourth amendment claim underlying mosby ineffective assistance argument has merit,we begin with the state trial court ruling that mosby did not have standing to challenge his warrantless home arrest.this ruling turned on the factual determination that mosby did not live at costar,and thus had no legitimate expectation of privacy there.in payton new york,the supreme court observed that nowhere is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than in an individual home,and held that,absent exigent circumstances or consent,the police must obtain a warrant before entering a suspect home to make a routine felony arrest,d.
in cases subsequent to payton,the supreme court has held that the zone of fourth amendment protection against warrantless arrests,despite probable cause,can extend beyond one own home for example,even an overnight guest in the home of another may have a legitimate expectation of privacy sufficient to invoke the protection.minnesota olson,d.
in ruling on the suppression motion,the trial court acknowledged that both payton and olson applied,but held that mosby was a transient presence at costar,who had no legitimate expectation of privacy there.the trial court relied mainly on the testimony of pulley,the neighbor who identified mosby as florida.according to the court,pulley did not say that mosby was an overnight guest at the apartment on the evening before his arrest.the court also noted that there was no evidence that mosby had keys to the house,received mail there,or paid rent,and that,on the night of his arrest,mosby told police that he lived at a different address.
the trial court ignored or mischaracterized evidence in the record that supported mosby assertion that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy at costar.the arresting officers report,for example,included pulley statement that mosby had been staying at costar for the past two months.this was confirmed during the suppression hearing,both on of an officer and by pulley herself.mosby aunt also testified that mosby had been living at costar street at the time of the arrest and that he kept his belongings there.
regardless of whether costar was his permanent residence,the record before the trial court established that,at the time of his arrest,mosby had a legitimate expectation of privacy there,and,at the very least,his suppression claim presented a highly compelling issue for appeal.applying payton and its progeny to facts in the record,we believe that the trial court had no reasonable basis to conclude that mosby presence at costar was more fleeting than even that of an overnight houseguest.united states fields,cir s ociety recognizes as legitimate the expectation of privacy possessed by an overnight though he has at best a fleeting connection to his host home.concluding that mosby had standing,however,is only a preliminary step toward establishing that the fourth amendment claim underlying his petition is meritorious.mosby still must demonstrate that the subsequent confession and photo identification should have been suppressed.
attenuation 
evidence obtained from an unlawful search or seizure is generally subject to exclusion as fruit of the poisonous tree.see wong sun united states,d townes city of new york,cir.however,e ven in situations where the exclusionary rule is plainly applicable,the supreme court has declined to adopt a per se or but for rule that would make inadmissible any evidence which somehow came to light through a chain of causation that began with an illegal arrest.united states ceccolini,d quoting brown illinois,d see also wong sun,at.the relevant constitutional question is whether the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.ceccolini,at.internal quotation marks omitted 
the attenuation doctrine allows introduction of evidence obtained after an unlawful arrest when the causal link between a fourth amendment violation and a subsequent confession,identification,or other form of evidence is so long or tortuous that suppression of the evidence is unlikely to have the effect of deterring future violations of the same type.united states singh,cir kearse,dissenting.in brown illinois,the supreme court enumerated four factors relevant to an attenuation analysis the administration of miranda warnings t he temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession the presence of intervening circumstances and particularly,the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.at.see kaupp texas,d per curiam snype,at.
as a matter of federal law,mosby fourth amendment claim would almost certainly fail before even reaching a full attenuation analysis.in new york harris,d,the supreme court held that,where the police have probable cause to arrest a suspect,the exclusionary rule does not bar the state use of a statement made by the defendant outside of his home,even though the statement is taken after an arrest made in the home in violation of payton.such a statement is not the product of being in unlawful custody.neither is it the fruit of having been arrested in the home rather than someplace else.id.at.as a result,the court found that it was not necessary to apply the brown factors,since attenuation analysis is only appropriate where,as a threshold matter,courts determine that the challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal government activity.id.citation omitted hudson michigan,d.
applying this logic here,mosby confession at the station house can not be deemed a product,for fourth amendment purposes,of any payton violation that may have occurred however,ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment is not limited to failures to raise meritorious federal claims.failure to raise a valid state law claim on appeal may also constitute ineffective assistance,so long as the relevant standards under strickland are met.see claudio scully,cir sellan,at.
the supreme court decision in new york harris harris ii reversed a prior decision of the new york court of appeals,people harris,harris i,on federal constitutional that the evidence at issue in the case need not be suppressed.the supreme court remanded the case to the court of appeals,which reinstated the prior outcome.people harris,harris iii.harris i had applied brown to a custodial confession by a suspect who had been arrested in violation of payton,and found that the confession was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal arrest.despite the supreme court disposition of the fourth amendment issue,the court of appeals on remand applied the new york state constitution right to counsel to find that custodial statements obtained following an arrest in violation of payton must be suppressed unless the taint resulting from the violation has been attenuated.harris iii,at.the brown attenuation analysis it had utilized in harris i,the court concluded that the causal connection between the illegal arrest and defendant statement in the police station was not sufficiently attenuated from the payton wrong because of the temporal proximity of the arrest and the statement,the absence of intervening circumstances and the purpose and flagrancy of the police misconduct.id.at.
thus,while mosby fourth amendment suppression claim appears to lack merit under harris ii,on direct appeal he might have been able to demonstrate that his confession and the photo identifications should have been suppressed under new york state law on the strength of harris iii.
mosby confession 
indeed,both parties concede that harris iii governs our analysis of mosby confession.accordingly,to evaluate attenuation in the context of a custodial confession following a warrantless home arrest,we apply the brown factors.see supra harris iii,at.all four of miranda warnings,temporal proximity of the arrest and statement,intervening circumstances,and the purpose and flagrancy of the official that the link between mosby arrest and confession was sufficiently attenuated so as not to require suppression.
the police did not begin questioning mosby about the bloomingdale street homicides until approximately five hours after his arrest and following miranda warnings.new york courts have found custodial statements given after miranda warnings and similar passages of time sufficiently attenuated to break the causal chain from an unlawful arrest.see,people divine,four hours people santos,six hours people russell,five hours people folks,seven or eight hours.
in addition,there were significant intervening circumstances between the warrantless arrest and the notably,pulley spontaneous appearance and reference to mosby as florida.while his arrest might,in some sense,have been a cause of his encounter with pulley outside the house,this is not sufficient to justify exclusion.see hudson.at b causality is only a necessary,not a sufficient,condition for suppression.ceccolini,at.pulley appearance,in other respects,was entirely unrelated to mosby warrantless arrest,and was not a product of it for fourth amendment purposes.harris ii,at.moreover,her unexpected statement connected mosby to an entirely different crime from th
