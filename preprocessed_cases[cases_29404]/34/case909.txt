the government appeals from an order entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york mckenna,to suppress inculpatory statements made by while in custody.we affirm the order of the district court on the ground that the initial interrogation conducted by an investigator aware of the obvious need for a miranda warning,followed minutes later by a second,interrogation by the same investigator,on the same subject matter,under similar circumstances and with no explicit curative language amounted to a deliberate,interrogation technique designed to undermine the defendant miranda rights.
background 
in march,the united states postal service suspected william capers,employed as a mail handler,of stealing money orders from express mail envelopes.postal inspectors decided to conduct a sting operation targeting capers.in december,inspectors planted two express mail envelopes in the facility where capers worked.one envelope contained cash,and the other contained two money orders and was equipped with an alarm device.the alarm was set to trigger automatically in the event the envelope with the money orders was opened and its contents removed.
having planted the envelopes in a mail container,postal inspectors hoti,del giudice,moon,and chow conducted surveillance of capers throughout the day.at approximately,capers noticed the envelopes for the first time.approximately two hours later,capers and juan lopez,a fellow employee,entered a trailer holding mail containers and briefly disappeared from the inspectors view.less than one minute later,the alarm in the envelope sounded,and the postal inspectors rushed into the trailer to apprehend both capers and lopez.the inspectors handcuffed both suspects.inspector hoti instructed capers to follow him into a supervisor office.inspectors del guidice and moon also entered the office.they instructed capers to sit in a chair,still handcuffed,while the three inspectors stood around him.none of the inspectors gave capers a miranda warning.
according to the testimony of del giudice,hoti said to capers 
something like,look,you know,talk to me or do talk to me,i do care but i telling you right now or i tell you that i going to do my best to make you go away,and i just want you to know.and i been watching you all day.i know everything that you did tonight.
hr g tr.hoti then asked capers where the contents of the express mail envelope were located.capers gestured toward his right side pants pocket,and hoti asked capers what was in his pocket.capers replied the money orders.hr g tr.hoti asked for capers permission to grab them,and when capers said yes,hoti removed the money orders from capers pocket.hr g tr.hoti asked capers if the money orders belonged to him,and capers said no.hr g tr.capers told hoti that he got the money orders from the express mail envelope.hr g tr.hoti also questioned capers about the cash that had been planted in the other express mail envelope,but capers stated that he did not know anything about it.the entire questioning took less than five minutes.regarding the lack of a miranda warning,hoti testified that he did not read capers his rights because he was in a hurry to track down the missing money orders so that they did not get lost in the large facility and because he needed to question lopez,who was held handcuffed outside the supervisor office to determine his level of involvement in the crime.
del giudice and moon then escorted capers to a van to transport him to another postal service facility the bronx domicile for further questioning.they waited in the van for approximately to minutes while the other inspectors located the alarm device from the opened envelope.in the van,del giudice engaged capers in conversation primarily about capers automobile.capers remained handcuffed throughout this time,which included to minutes of waiting and minutes of driving to the bronx domicile.
when they arrived at the bronx domicile,the inspectors placed capers in an interview room and handcuffed him to the chair in which he sat.del giudice and moon remained with him,engaging him in further conversation,and gathering relevant personal information from capers for their paperwork.at one point,capers asked del giudice about the possibility of being fired,and del giudice told him that it in your best interest to tell the truth when inspector hoti comes down.be honest.it always better if you honest.hr g tr.
capers and the two postal inspectors waited for approximately to minutes until hoti entered the room.hoti then advised capers of his miranda rights.hoti made no reference,however,to the statements capers had already made during the initial interrogation.hoti explained in his testimony,i do remember the specific question and its sequence,and i do see a need to say what did you do with the contents of this express mail when i already have the answer to that.so i would not have asked that same question.hr g tr.capers signed a postal service warning and waiver of rights form,and hoti proceeded to question capers about the events of the evening,specifically asking about what he did with the express mail envelopes earlier that night.capers verbally confessed to taking the money orders.when hoti asked him to provide a written statement,capers replied by asking,what in it for me hr g tr.hoti told capers there nothing i can promise you,and then ended the questioning.hr g tr.
capers was indicted in march,charged with one count of theft of mail matter by a postal employee,in violation of.he moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made both before and after receiving the miranda warning,and on march,the district court entered an order suppressing the statements.the district court found that t he government has not shown that defendant relinquished his right to remain silent voluntarily with a full awareness of the rights being waived and the consequences of doing so.united states capers,cr,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted.although the district court found that the postal inspectors did not have the specific intent to circumvent capers miranda rights,it did find their interrogation tactics deprived capers of a genuine right to remain silent,id.at.the united states filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court determination regarding the constitutionality of a miranda waiver de novo.united states carter,cir.in doing so,we review a district court underlying factual findings for clear error.id.
ii.miranda and the interrogation technique 
the issue before us is whether hoti and the other postal inspectors deliberately deprived capers of the rights to which he is entitled under miranda arizona.the government argues that the defendant was given an effective miranda warning prior to making voluntary inculpatory statements,and therefore the statements he made following the warning should not have been suppressed by the district court.capers argues that the rule that the supreme court announced in missouri seibert,and that this court further clarified in carter,requires us to conclude that the postal inspectors interrogation in this case constituted a deliberate violation of capers miranda rights.
the purpose of the miranda warning is to ensure that the person in custody has sufficient knowledge of his or her constitutional rights relating to the interrogation and that any waiver of such rights is knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.carter,at.the supreme court,in oregon elstad,and seibert,has twice addressed situations like this one in which a suspect in custody confessed without having received a miranda warning,subsequently received a miranda warning,and then confessed again.
elstad involved a situation in which a suspect made a statement while two police officers were at his home investigating a robbery.at the time he had not received a miranda warning.elstad,at.the officers transported the suspect to a police station where they gave him a miranda warning prior to obtaining both an oral and written confession.id.at.at trial,the defendant moved to suppress the postwarning confessions on the ground that the statements made at the police station only came about as a result of the first inadmissable statement made at his house.id.at.the supreme court ultimately rejected the fruit of the poisonous tree argument,see wong sun united states,and held that t hough miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed,the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made,elstad,at.the court reasoned that the police did not employ any coercive tactics to elicit either confession and that the defendant made his postwarning confession voluntarily.id.at.the court concluded that the dictates of miranda and the goals of the fifth amendment proscription against use of compelled testimony are fully satisfied in the circumstances of this case.id.at.
whereas elstad involved a effort by the police to administer a proper miranda warning,seibert addressed the use of a interrogation strategy designed to elicit a waiver and confession after the defendant had already confessed before he was given miranda warnings.in seibert,the police department had a policy of withholding miranda warnings until an arrestee confessed and then reading the arrestee miranda warnings and asking for a waiver prior to eliciting a second confession.seibert,at plurality opinion the police in seibert employed this strategy when they arrested the defendant for setting a fire that killed a teenager.id.at.after taking the defendant into custody and deliberately withholding miranda warnings,the police elicited a confession.id.at.the police then gave the defendant a break after which they provided her miranda warnings,obtained a signed waiver of rights,and a second confession.id.at.a majority of the court admonished against the use of this technique and held that this strategy violated miranda.id.at id.at kennedy,concurring.
the seibert plurality concluded that u pon hearing warnings only in the aftermath of interrogation and just after making a confession,a suspect would hardly think he had a genuine right to remain silent,let alone persist in so believing once the police began to lead him over the same ground again.id.at plurality opinion.the plurality focused on whether the midstream miranda warning was effective,and questioned whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function effectively as miranda requires and advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture.id.at.writing for the plurality,justice souter laid out five factors to be weighed when analyzing the effectiveness of the warning the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation,the overlapping content of the two statements,the timing and setting of the first and second interrogation,the continuity of police personnel,and the degree to which the interrogator questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.id.at.
the plurality voted to suppress the second confession because,unlike in elstad,the unwarned interrogation was systematic,exhaustive,and managed with psychological skill.id.at.applying the five factors,the plurality focused on the facts that both phases of questioning occurred while the suspect was clearly in custody there was no advice given to the suspect that her first statement was inadmissible the same police officer conducted both interrogations in the same location with only a to minute break between the two and references to the earlier confession fostered an impression that the further questioning was a mere continuation of the first interrogation.id.the plurality ultimately concluded that t hese circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.id.at.
justice kennedy agreed with the plurality conclusion that the postwarning statements should be suppressed,but he believed the plurality test cut too broadly,id.at kennedy,concurring,because it applied in instances of both intentional and unintentional interrogations,id.at.under justice kennedy approach,the first question would be whether law enforcement officers used a deliberate strategy in a calculated way to undermine the miranda warning,id.at,and to obscure both the practical and legal significance of the admonition when finally given,id.at.if the answer to that question were no,then the suppression analysis would be governed by the voluntariness standard set forth in elstad.id.if the answer were yes,however,the next question would be whether any curative measures were taken to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect situation would understand the import and effect of the miranda warning and of the miranda waiver.id.justice kennedy provided two examples of such curative measures a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the miranda warning because it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn and an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement.id.reasoning that the police had used a deliberate interrogation technique and that no curative steps had been taken,justice kennedy concluded that the postwarning statements were inadmissible.id.
in carter,this court joined the eleventh,fifth,ninth,third,and eighth circuits in applying justice kennedy approach in seibert,holding that seibert lays out an exception to elstad for cases in which a deliberate,strategy was used by law enforcement to obtain the postwarning confession.carter,at.united states street,cir united states courtney,cir united states williams,cir united states kiam,cir united states hernandez,cir.but see united states heron,f d,cir justice kennedy concurrence is not controlling.in carter,law enforcement agents recovered a large bag of drugs after searching a restaurant owned and operated by the suspect.id.at.approximately minutes after the search concluded,an agent noticed the suspect sitting outside the restaurant and,in a casual fashion,asked him about a brown substance found in the bag of drugs.the agent asked if the substance was heroin,and the suspect replied,no,it bad.id.at.the agent then asked,bad what,to which the suspect replied,bad coke.id.the agent later testified that he asked the suspect about the drugs solely out of curiosity.id.approximately minutes later,after the defendant was given a miranda warning and after he signed a miranda waiver form,a different agent conducted a formal interrogation and elicited a full confession.id.at.the latter agent had no knowledge of the suspect previous statement about the brown substance and did not learn about it until shortly before the trial commenced.id.the defendant moved to suppress the second confession on the grounds that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his miranda rights.id.at.
analyzing t he factual differences between carter case and seibert,id.at,we determined that the agents in carter did not deliberately use a interrogation strategy designed to circumvent miranda for three reasons there was almost no overlap between the suspect first statement and his subsequent confession different officers questioned the suspect at different locations the first outside the store that was being searched and the second in an interrogation room,and the second officer was not aware of the suspect previous inculpatory statement and the postwarning questioning was not a continuation of the prewarning question.id.at.accordingly,applying elstad,we determined that carter postwarning statement was made knowingly and voluntarily,and it was properly admissible at trial.id.at.
here,in a decision that predated carter,the district court found that capers did not give his warning statement voluntarily with a full awareness of the rights being waived and the consequences of doing so.capers,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.for that reason,it suppressed capers statement.in so doing,the district court rejected justice kennedy approach in seibert,explaining that justice kennedy concurring opinion can not reasonably be taken to be the law of the land,because it did not represent the majority opinion of the supreme court.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in a footnote to its decision,the district court remarked that if justice kennedy seibert concurrence represented the law,suppression would be denied.capers,wl,at n.the district court based this statement,which under the circumstances constituted dictum,on its understanding that justice kennedy test turned on the subjective intent of the police,id.at,coupled with the district court own determination that the inspectors in this case did not have the specific intent to evade miranda,id.at.
our intervening decision in carter,however,requires a different analysis.under carter,we must address whether the officers employed a deliberate,strategy,predicated upon violating miranda during an extended interview,seibert,at,and if so,whether specific,curative steps,were taken to obviate the violation that occurred.
iii.deliberateness 
in seibert,because the record was clear that the interrogating officers intentionally and purposefully employed a technique in which they had been instructed,id.at,justice kennedy had no reason to explore how a court should determine when a interrogation strategy had been executed deliberately.wrestling with the problem we now address,the ninth circuit has stated 
as an initial matter,we note that justice kennedy did not articulate how a court should determine whether an interrogator used a deliberate strategy 
for example,justice kennedy opinion is silent as to what,if any presumptions apply or which party bears the burden of proving or disproving deliberateness.
united states williams,cir.
in constructing a method to determine deliberateness,the ninth circuit in williams looked to whether objective evidence and any available subjective evidence,such as an officer testimony,support an inference that the interrogation procedure was used to undermine the miranda warning.id.at.following on the ninth circuit guidance,the test articulated by the eleventh circuit to determine deliberateness relies upon the totality of the circumstances including the timing,setting and completeness of the prewarning interrogation,the continuity of police personnel and the overlapping content of the pre and statements.united states street,cir quoting williams,at.the fifth circuit articulation of when deliberateness may be inferred also relies upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogations 
t here was nothing in the circumstances or the nature of the questioning to indicate that coercion or other improper tactics were used.all evidence suggests that nunez was calm and cooperative,and the agents did not act with aggressiveness or hostility.the district court stated that the defendant initially had done nothing more than voluntarily respond to questions as to his name,place of birth,and immigration status.
united states,cir 
in our court opinion in carter,at,without expressly stating that we were doing so,we similarly analyzed objective factors.in the context of the interrogation that took place there,we needed only to consider three factors to conclude that the interrogating officers did not deliberately employ a interrogation procedure there was no overlap between the suspect first and second statements different officers questioned the suspect at different locations,and the second officer was not aware of the suspect previous inculpatory statement and the postwarning questioning was not a continuation of the prewarning question ing.carter,at.
these considerations,while determinative of the analysis of deliberateness on the facts presented in carter,are by no means the only factors to be considered when seeking to divine whether the officers actions are sufficiently indicative of a deliberate circumvention of miranda to require that a defendant statements must be suppressed.we recognize the wisdom of justice souter observation that the intent of the officer will rarely be as candidly admitted as it was in seibert,where the interrogating officer testified not only that he was trained to execute a interrogation procedure but also implied that the tactic is taught nationwide.seibert,at.in light of the above,we join our sister circuits in concluding that a court should review the totality of the objective and subjective evidence surrounding the interrogations in order to determine deliberateness,with a recognition that in most instances the inquiry will rely heavily,if not entirely,upon objective evidence.seibert,at kennedy,concurring a multifactor test that applies to every interrogation may serve to undermine th e clarity of miranda.
recognizing the inherent difficulty in proving deliberateness,and also conceding that determining the officer state of mind at the time of the interrogation can be difficult,we turn to the unsettled question of which party bears the burden of proving deliberateness or absence thereof.united states ollie,f d,cir.for the following reasons,we hold that the burden rests on the prosecution to disprove deliberateness.
w hen a confession challenged as involuntary is sought to be used against a criminal defendant at his trial,he is entitled to a reliable and determination that the confession was in fact voluntarily rendered.lego twomey.accordingly,courts place upon the government the burden to prove that a defendant confession was voluntary.see,colorado connelly.the question of deliberateness,while distinct from voluntariness,will nonetheless be dispositive of a defendant challenge to the voluntariness of a confession garnered from a interrogation procedure.see united states stewart,cir.the eighth circuit,which also places the burden on the government to disprove deliberateness,cautioned that while the law generally frowns on requiring a party to prove a negative,the supreme court has consistently required the government to prove the admissibility of a confession against a criminal defendant,ollie,at.see also brown illinois,requiring the government to show that a confession was not the fruit of an earlier illegal arrest connelly,at requiring the government to show that defendant miranda waiver given during an alleged psychotic episode,was knowing and voluntary.
indeed,the supreme court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights tague louisiana.in tague,the court held since the state is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which the interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation,the burden is rightly on its shoulders.id.guided by tague,we are mindful that evidence of deliberateness or lack thereof is similarly in the hands of the government,and we are further persuaded that the party seeking to introduce the confession should remain responsible for showing that it was not obtained through a subterfuge.
with respect to the quantum of proof necessary,we are mindful that miranda may impose a heavy burden upon the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against,and that in order to satisfy that burden a high standar d of proof is applicable.berghuis thompkins,lexis,june,sotomayor,dissenting.nonetheless,w henever the state bears the burden of proof in a motion to suppress a statement that the defendant claims was obtained in violation of our miranda doctrine,the state need prove waiver only by a preponderance of the evidence.connelly,at.we apply the preponderance standard to miranda challenges in recognition that miranda is an exclusionary rule aimed at deterring lawless conduct by police and prosecution,and that imposing a higher burden of proof would do little to mitigate prosecutorial overreaching while at the same time concealing troves of probative evidence from the eyes of the jury.twomey,at.for similar reasons,we hold that the government must meet its burden of disproving the deliberate use of a interrogation technique by a preponderance of the evidence.
looking to the totality of the circumstances in the case before us,the evidence proffered by the government to show that capers was not the subject of a deliberate,interrogation is outweighed by subjective and objective evidence to the contrary.hoti testified that he delayed issuing a miranda warning because his mindset was on,one recovering evidence,a s well as determining if the two of them or both of them or only one of them had any role to play in committing the crime.hr g tr.hoti testified that he was concerned about losing the money orders in the very,very large facility because the money orders were about the size of a dollar and the defendants could toss them,hide them and y ou have a real,real tough time finding them in this large facility like that with all the packages and other types of mail.hr g tr.as to making a determination about defendant lopez,hoti testified that i f i could determine fairly quickly that,in fact,he had no role to play in that crime,i need to take those cuffs off and basically cut him loose.hr tr.when asked whether he was in a position to read capers his miranda warnings before asking him about the money orders,hoti replied absolutely.hr tr.
the district court concluded from this testimony that hoti purpose in delaying a miranda warning was not to undermine capers fifth amendment rights,but rather to prevent the loss or concealment of the currency and money orders that the express mail envelopes contained,and to ascertain whether lopez was involved in the crime,so that he could be freed or not.id.at citation omitted.neither of these reasons,however,justifies delaying a miranda warning once it is obvious that a suspect is in custody.there is no exception to miranda that allows a delay in giving miranda warnings in order to preserve evanescent evidence.neither is there an exception to miranda that permits delaying the warnings in order to ascertain whether a suspected may be entitled to release.indeed,we agree with the williams court in its observation that 
o nce a law enforcement officer has detained a suspect and subjects him to interrogation there is rarely,if ever,a legitimate reason to delay giving a miranda warning until after the suspect has confessed.instead,the most plausible reason is an illegitimate one,which is the interrogator desire to weaken the warning effectiveness.
at.the only legitimate reason to delay intentionally a miranda warning until after a custodial interrogation has begun is to protect the safety of the arresting officers or the of which was an issue here.see,united states newton,cir recognizing this narrow exception to the miranda rule.
inexperience,while not a legitimate excuse for postponing a miranda warning,nevertheless may save a confession from exclusion under seibert.see united states naranjo,cir implying that an inadvertent miranda omission,or a rookie mistake,should not warrant seibert scrutiny.in the case before us,however,sufficient subjective evidence was adduced to rule out the officers inexperience as well as raise significant doubts as to whether a mistake had been made.the district court found it clear from hoti testimony and from his experience in law enforcement that his failure to mirandize capers was not an accident.the district court explained inspector hoti did not merely forget to give defendant miranda warnings inspector hoti had served as a new york city police officer for some three years,and as inspector del giudice testified,postal inspectors are trained to provide miranda when there is a custodial interrogation.capers,wl at.indeed,hoti explicitly testified that he absolutely was in a position to inform capers of his miranda rights once capers was confined to the supervisor office.hr g tr.the arrest of capers did not occur out of the blue,as it might were hoti driving to work and witnessed a crime in progress,or were he responding to a radio call reporting a crime in progress.capers arrest was the culmination of a investigation into capers suspected criminal activity.in surveiling capers and determining when to give the order to his team to descend on capers and lopez,therefore,hoti had time to think through what procedural steps he would need to take following arrest in order to build his case for prosecution.because,as the district court found,hoti had sufficient experience to know that a miranda warning was unquestionably necessary in connection with capers interrogation,the corollary to that finding must also obtain.hoti was experienced enough to know that in this case there was no valid reason to delay a miranda warning until after questioning a suspect in custody.
the district court found that there was no evidence that inspector hoti had the specific intent to use the questioning technique to undermine capers miranda rights.capers,wl at.the dissent endorses this finding,arguing that there is nothing suspicious about the reasons put forth by inspector hoti.dissent at.considering the totality of the circumstances,however,we find inspector hoti proffered reasons for delaying the miranda warning to lack not only legitimacy,but also credibility.inspector hoti explained that he delayed informing capers of his miranda rights because hoti had to determine if lopez was involved in the scheme,and if he was not,release him.if capers had told inspector hoti during the initial interrogation that lopez had nothing to do with the scheme,would inspector hoti,who had just witnessed the two men enter a storage container and the envelope alarms subsequently sound,then have released lopez on his own recognizance we consider such a conclusion dubious.with respect to hoti claim that he did not want to lose the money orders and cash in the large postal facility,this assertion is belied by the testimony of the arresting officers that capers and lopez were detained almost directly after the envelope alarm sounded and were found either still in the storage container,or in that immediate vicinity.in light of the above,as well as objective evidence discussed below,the district court finding that there was no evidence of a deliberate,interrogation tactic at work was clear error.capers,wl at.
the dissent asserts that the test used by the majority to determine whether inspector hoti deliberately utilized a interrogation technique effectively undermines the subjective test established by justice kennedy because it ignores subjective evidence showing that the inspector did not deliberately utilize a technique,and instead relies exclusively on the objective factors listed in the seibert plurality opinion.dissent at.this conclusion misreads our analysis and conflates justice kennedy test with that articulated by justice breyer in his concurring opinion in seibert.at breyer,concurring courts should exclude the fruits of the initial unwarned questioning unless the failure to warn was in good faith.citations omitted.by contrast,our analysis considers the subjective evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in the context set forth by justice instructive but not automatically dispositive.justice kennedy concurrence in seibert does not advocate a test whereby a deliberate interrogation will be found only when a law enforcement officer admits to executing such a strategy.nor does this test envision blind,unquestioning reliance on the testimony of arresting and interrogating officers.to the contrary,because justice kennedy test seeks to exclude only those statements that are the result of deliberate and calculated police strategies to undermine miranda,a searching and penetrating inquiry of the officer testimony and proffered reasons for delaying miranda warning is therefore necessary to determine when these strategies are being employed.
the dissent asserts that the above consideration gives absolutely no weight to the inspector testimony that his reasons for not immediately advising capers of his miranda rights were to prevent the loss or concealment of the currency and money orders that the express mail envelope contained and to ascertain whether lopez was involved in the crime.dissent at.the dissent argues that judge mckenna witnessed inspector hoti testimony and was therefore better able to assess his credibility.dissent at.although appellate courts do not have the opportunity to observe witness testimony and are,therefore,precluded from making credibility determinations,in light of the clear inconsistency between inspector hoti stated reasons for delaying miranda warnings and the objective and subjective evidence constituting the remainder of the record bearing on this point,it is clear the district court determination that there is no evidence inspector hoti had the specific intent to use the questioning technique with the purpose of first obtaining unwarned incriminating statements in order,in a subsequent warned interrogation,to obtain similar incriminating statements,capers,wl at,afforded blind and absolute weight to the testimony of the arresting officers and ignored all the other relevant evidence which we here announce must also be considered if justice kennedy test is to have any meaning outside of the unique and circumstances of seibert,the district court unidimensional analysis can not be determinative of the outcome in this case.
objective evidence also leads us to conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that capers was not subjected to a interrogation.first,there is considerable overlap between the statements elicited from the defendant during the first and second interrogation.hoti initial interrogation of capers resulted in a confession and there remained little,if anything,of incriminating potential left unsaid.capers,wl,at quoting seibert,at plurality opinion.the circumstances surrounding the two sessions of the interrogation,including the nature of the respective environs in which the interrogation took place and the continuity of the cast of interrogating officers,was indicative of a deliberate interrogation.while the location of the interrogation sessions changed,the first taking place in a room at the post office and the second in the domicile,the inquisitorial environment of the questioning was consistent.
unlike in carter,the initial conversation between capers and hoti was in no way casual.see,at.it began with hoti opening statement to capers that i going to do my best to make you go away,and i just want you to know.hr g tr.capers was handcuffed throughout the process.on the facts presented,the district court correctly concluded,and we agree,that hoti initial questioning was indeed a formal interrogation.see capers,wl,at concluding that capers was in custody from the moment he was handcuffed.
between the two phases of the interrogation,hoti fellow inspectors engaged capers in small talk,and advised him that it was in his interest to tell the truth when hoti arrived.capers continued to be handcuffed throughout the process.the second phase of the interrogation also opened with a hostile remark,namely hoti observation that capers was one of the most laziest employees i ever seen,at finding that there was no evidence of a deliberate attempt to employ a strategy because,inter alia,the agents did not act with aggressiveness or hostility.in combination with the miranda warning,the inspectors clearly established that this second encounter was not a casual conversation.for the most,part there was also continuity in the officers present at both interrogations.during the first interrogation hoti asked the questions,while del guidice and moon were present in the room.the second interrogation,at the outset,involved the same three inspectors with hoti again asking the questions and del giudice and moon remaining silent.
finally,the temporal proximity of the pre and interrogations,along with the continuity of caper custody,reasonably leads to the conclusion that the latter was a continuation of the former.only minutes separated the two interrogation sessions.and while not carried out to the degree it was in seibert,at least to some extent the latter session was essentially a using information gained during the first round of interrogation.see carter,at.accordingly,the government has not produced sufficient objective evidence to meet its burden to dispel a conclusion that hoti conduct amounted to a deliberate question first interrogation tactic designed to undermine capers exercise of his miranda rights 
iv.curative measures 
deliberateness having been established,we must next consider whether any curative measures intervened to restore the defendant opportunity voluntarily to exercise his miranda rights.see seibert,at kennedy,concurring p ostwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made.as noted,justice kennedy provided two examples of potential curative measures a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the miranda warning,and an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement.id.based on the facts before us,we can not say that any such curative measure occurred such that it rendered effective the miranda warnings given to capers before the second interrogation.
as discussed,although approximately minutes passed between the first and second interrogations,the two rounds of questioning bracketed one continual process.del giudice and moon were with capers throughout the minutes,engaging in small talk and advising capers to tell the truth.despite the different locations of the interrogation sessions,both occurred while capers remained in handcuffs and in settings that clearly established the authoritative nature of the questioning.there is little meaningful difference between the circumstances surrounding capers two interrogation sessions,and there was certainly no substantial break that would have restored his miranda rights.
moreover,despite hoti knowledge that capers first statement would be inadmissable in court,he never alerted capers to that fact.capers,wl,at.hoti continued his line of questioning without dispelling capers probable assumption that he had already incriminated himself based on his first confession.hoti revealed as much in his testimony.when asked whether he posed some of the same questions at the bronx domicile as he had asked earlier in the supervisor office,hoti replied that he did not see the need to ask the same questions for which he already had answers.hr g tr.by the same token,hoti did build on capers admission of theft in the original session by structuring the second interrogation session to elicit a description of how capers went about stealing the money orders.capers thus had no reason to know that his first broad confession could not be used against him when,only minutes later while still in close custody,he actually waived his miranda rights on these facts,there were no measures taken to cure the inspectors use of the deliberate,interrogation strategy.because on the objective and subjective evidence we are left to conclude that the inspectors employed a strategy to circumvent the defendant miranda rights and because there were no curative measures to ensure that the defendant was not misled with regard to his rights prior to his second confession,capers waiver of his miranda rights was invalid.the district court,therefore,properly suppressed his confession.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court decision to suppress the defendant statements.
i respectfully dissent.my colleagues claim to follow this court previous decision in carter united states,cir,and by extension justice kennedy concurring opinion in missouri seibert,both of which require the district court to determine an interrogating officer subjective intent for failing to warn a suspect of his miranda rights.but the novel test crafted by the majority,which examines whether the interrogating officer reasons would be deemed legitimate under miranda and its progeny,instead makes subjective evidence virtually irrelevant in nearly every interrogation case.as such,the majority decision undermines justice kennedy controlling opinion in seibert and replaces it with the objective effectiveness test proposed by the seibert plurality opinion.
a more faithful application of justice kennedy seibert concurrence requires a conclusion that capers statements are admissible based on the district court factual after a thorough review of all of the inspector hoti did not deliberately utilize a interrogation technique.the majority improperly undertakes a de novo review of the district court factual findings rather than reviewing them using the traditional clearly erroneous standard.the majority suggests that a de novo review is made necessary by its purported construction of a novel totality of the circumstances test for determining whether an interrogating officer purposefully utilized a interrogation technique.but this new test is entirely consistent with the one used by the district court to find that inspector hoti did not deliberately use such a technique,and therefore provides no basis to review the district court factual findings de novo.
moreover,even if de novo review is appropriate in this case,i would still disagree with the majority decision to suppress the confession because the government has met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that inspector hoti did not intend to utilize a interrogation technique.to the extent that the majority finds that any of the district court factual findings were clearly erroneous,the majority misapplies the clearly erroneous standard by making credibility determinations regarding witness testimony.such credibility determinations,while never appropriate for an appellate court to make,are particularly inappropriate where,as here,there is nothing in inspector hoti testimony that is either contradicted by the record evidence or inherently unbelievable.
because a proper review of all the evidence including the subjective evidence establishes that inspector hoti did not deliberately utilize a interrogation technique to circumvent miranda,the voluntary statements made in response to the interrogation should not be suppressed.
this case involves a suspect who made a statement in response to questions from an interrogating officer prior to being warned of his miranda rights,and then later made additional statement after being warned of his miranda rights.the supreme court has twice considered cases of this in oregon elstad,and again in missouri seibert.
in oregon elstad,two officers went to the home of michael individual they suspected of robbing a neighbor a warrant for his arrest.while there,one of the officers had a brief conversation with the suspect without warning him of his miranda rights.at.the officer apparently failed to issue the warnings because it was not clear to him whether the suspect was in custody at the time.id.at.during the conversation,the officer asked the suspect whether he knew the individual whose house had been robbed,to which the suspect responded by making an incriminating statement.following that statement,the suspect was arrested and transported to the station house.approximately one hour later,the same two officers who had arrested the suspect at his home advised him of his miranda rights,and then proceeded to take a full statement from him.id.at.
the supreme court found that,although the initial unwarned statement was inadmissible,the later postwarning statement was admissible because it was voluntarily made.according to the court,t hough miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed,the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.id.at.
the issue of pre and confessions again came before the supreme court in missouri seibert.in that case,the court was confronted with the intentional use of a interrogation technique where officers in the rolla,missouri police department had been trained to withhold miranda warnings until after interrogating and drawing out a confession,seibert,at plurality opinion,in order to get a confession the suspect would not make if he understood his rights at the outset,id.at.the court produced several opinions,none of which garnered the support of a majority of the justices.writing for four justices,justice souter found that the statements were inadmissible even though they were voluntarily made within the meaning of elstad because the tactic effectively threatens to thwart miranda purpose of reducing the risk that a coerced confession would be admitted,and because the facts here do not reasonably support a conclusion that the warnings given could have served their purpose id.at.
justice souter plurality opinion sets forth an objective test from the perspective of the suspect being interrogated,whereby a court deciding the admissibility of statements that followed inadmissible statements should determine whether it would be reasonable to find that in these circumstances the warnings could function effectively as miranda requires.id.at.the plurality described effectiveness as whether the warnings effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture and whether they reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even if he had talked earlier.id.according to the plurality,a court should perform this inquiry in all cases where the admissibility of statements is challenged based on the lingering effects of an inadmissible interrogation.id.this test would be performed in addition to the elstad inquiry into whether the statements were knowingly and voluntarily made.
the plurality then listed several objective factors that a court should consider when determining whether the warning could function effectively.these factors included the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation,the overlapping content of the two statements,the timing and setting of the first and second,the continuity of police personnel and the degree to which the interrogator questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.id.at.
justice kennedy,writing separately in an opinion joined by justice breyer,agreed with the plurality that the statements should be suppressed,but suggested a different test for determining their admissibility.in contrast to the plurality objective test,justice more on the conduct of law a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case,such as we have here,in which the interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the miranda warning.id.at kennedy,concurring.according to justice kennedy when an interrogator uses this deliberate,strategy,predicated upon violating miranda during an extended interview,postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded absent specific,curative steps.id.at.if the court finds that the interrogator did not deliberately use a strategy,then the admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of elstad.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,justice kennedy rejected the majority purely objective test,which was to be applied in cases of both intentional and unintentional interrogations,as cut ting too broadly.id.at.instead,justice kennedy felt that a court should only consider whether the miranda warning was,in justice kennedy words,whether curative measures are taken before the postwarning statements are made in cases where the interrogator intentionally used the technique.id.at.in cases where the interrogator did not intentionally use a technique to undermine miranda,justice kennedy felt that the effectiveness test should not be applied.id.
despite the fragmented nature of the decisions in seibert,both the supreme court and this court precedents make clear that justice kennedy concurring opinion controls.when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.marks united states.in seibert,justice kennedy opinion,which provided the fifth vote for suppressing the statements made by the defendant,controls because it provides a narrower exception to elstad than the test proposed by the plurality.whereas the plurality suggested that all cases where a interrogation took place should be reviewed for the objective effectiveness of the miranda warning,justice kennedy concurring opinion holds that such a review should only take place in cases where the interrogator intentionally used a technique to circumvent miranda.the tests suggested by the plurality and justice kennedy diverge in cases where the interrogator unintentionally performed a interrogation.in those cases,justice kennedy concurring opinion states that the elstad inquiry into whether statements were knowingly and voluntarily made still controls,whereas the plurality opinion states that the effectiveness test should also be applied.because the test stated in justice kennedy concurring opinion applies the effectiveness was approved for use in at least some circumstances by a majority of the a narrower set of cases than the test stated in the plurality opinion,marks dictates that it be considered the controlling opinion from seibert 
even more importantly for our purposes,this court has already held that justice kennedy concurring opinion in seibert is the controlling opinion.in united states carter,cir,decided after the district court issued its decision in the case at bar,this court stated we now join our sister circuits in holding that seibert lays out an exception to elstad for cases in which a deliberate,strategy was used by law enforcement to obtain the postwarning confession.id.at.although the district court did not have the benefit of guidance from this court when it considered the question of which opinion from seibert controls,carter has since definitively answered that question.
my colleagues do not dispute that,justice kennedy concurring opinion in seibert clearly controls in this circuit as well as most other circuits that have decided the.the majority writes under carter,we must address whether the officers employed a deliberate strategy,predicated upon violating miranda during an extended interview,and if so,whether specific,curative steps were taken to obviate the violation that occurred.majority op.at quoting seibert,at kennedy,concurring.
having recognized that justice kennedy concurring opinion in seibert controls,this case should be easily resolved based entirely on the district court factual findings.instead,the majority goes astray by reviewing the district court factual findings de novo incorrectly applying the applicable test on de novo review,and doing so in a way that undermines justice kennedy controlling seibert opinion.
in judge mckenna thorough and opinion below,he stated that t here is no evidence that inspector hoti had the specific intent to use the questioning technique with the purpose of first obtaining unwarned incriminating statements in order,in a subsequent warned interrogation,to obtain similar incriminating statements.united states capers,wl,at.based on his finding of a lack of intent,judge mckenna concluded i f justice kennedy seibert concurrence represented the law,suppression would be denied.id.at.under the test established in justice kennedy seibert opinion,the above factual finding is sufficient to determine that suppression should be denied,as the district court rightly noted.
the district court factual findings made at a suppression hearing should not be overturned unless they are found to be clearly erroneous.united states ansaldi,cir.the trial court is in a unique position to evaluate witnesses credibility,united states davis,cir,and is thereby better positioned than an appellate court to make the necessary factual findings.
in this case,the district court considered the testimony from the interrogating determined that he testified credibly with regard to his reasons for not giving defendant miranda warnings prior to questioning him at the bronx dmu when he said 
again,the importance to me in understanding this facility,i did not want to lose any of the evidence,i did not want to lose any of the evidence in the case.obviously the importance of it,to recover that evidence as quickly as i can.secondly,i have another individual that yes,he cuffed outside of the office,lopez.if i could determine fairly quickly that,in fact,he had no role to play in that crime,i need to take those cuffs off and basically cut him loose.
capers,wl,at quoting tr.the district court found that this testimony supported a finding that inspector hoti did not deliberately utilize a interrogation technique,id.at,and further determined that the objective evidence in no way contradicted his testimony,id.there is no evidence that inspector hoti had the specific intent to use the questioning technique with the purpose of first obtaining unwarned incriminating statements in order,in a subsequent warned interrogation,to obtain similar incriminating statements.based on all of the available evidence,the district court found that inspector hoti did not deliberately utilize a interrogation technique to circumvent miranda.
even my colleagues in the majority are unwilling to say that this factual finding is clearly erroneous if the majority had reviewed the district court decision including its ultimate conclusion that inspector hoti did not intentionally utilize a interrogation technique using the proper clearly erroneous standard,then the outcome under justice kennedy test from seibert would have been would have been denied because the interrogator did not deliberately utilize a interrogation technique to circumvent miranda.
but instead of reviewing the district court factual findings for clear error,the majority improperly chooses to review the court factual findings de novo,replacing the district court credibility determinations with its own and the evidence based on information obtained entirely from the written record.
the majority justifies its reexamination of the district court factual findings by claiming that it is constructing a method to determine deliberateness,majority op.at,namely,establishing which party bears the burden of proving deliberateness,and what that burden is.but even accepting that the majority opinion clarifies aspects of a test that were previously unsettled in this circuit,there is still no basis for ignoring the district court thorough on this issue because the test articulated by the majority is the exact same test that was applied by the district court.
the majority states w e join our sister circuits in concluding that a court should review the totality of the objective and subjective evidence surrounding the interrogations in order to determine deliberateness,with a recognition that in most instances the inquiry will rely heavily,if not entirely,upon objective evidence.majority op.at.it goes on to state w e hold that the burden rests on the prosecution to disprove deliberateness,id.at,and that the burden is that of a preponderance of the evidence,id.at.
the test used by the district court to determine whether inspector hoti utilized a deliberate interrogation technique to circumvent miranda is entirely consistent with each of the above holdings by the majority.in its written opinion,the district court examined the totality of the circumstances in making its factual determination regarding deliberateness,considering both subjective and objective evidence that it found relevant to determining whether inspector hoti deliberately utilized a interrogation technique.capers,wl,at 
although the district court does not explicitly state in its opinion which side bears the burden of proving deliberateness,there is no doubt that the district court required the government to prove deliberateness by a preponderance of the evidence.at oral argument in the district court,judge mckenna asked the parties,a m i correct in assuming that the general rule applies,and that is,since this is a motion to suppress statements,that the government has the burden of proof by a preponderance,at,to which the attorney for the government responded,that correct,your honor.at 
even if de novo review of the district court factual determination regarding deliberateness were appropriate in this case,i would still be unable to agree with the majority finding that inspector hoti deliberately utilized a interrogation technique to circumvent miranda.
the test used by the majority to determine whether inspector hoti deliberately utilized a interrogation technique effectively undermines the subjective test established by justice kennedy in his concurring opinion in seibert and adopted by this court in carter because it ignores subjective evidence showing that the inspector did not deliberately utilize a technique,and instead relies exclusively on the objective factors listed in the seibert plurality opinion in reviewing the evidence of whether inspector hoti utilized a interrogation technique,the majority gives absolutely no weight to the inspector testimony that his reasons for not immediately advising capers of his miranda rights were to prevent the loss or concealment of the currency and money orders that the express mail envelope contained and to ascertain whether lopez was involved in the crime so that he could be released if necessary.majority op.at see also capers,wl,at citing tr.
despite the fact that judge witnessed inspector hoti testimony and was therefore better able to assess his that the inspector testimony was credible,the majority chooses to give it no weight whatsoever because,according to the majority,hoti did not articulate a legitimate exception to miranda.notably,the majority states 
neither of these reasons given by inspector hoti justifies delaying a miranda warning once it is obvious that a suspect is in custody.there is no exception to miranda that allows a delay in giving miranda warnings in order to preserve evanescent evidence.neither is there an exception to miranda that permits delaying the warnings in order to ascertain whether a suspected may be entitled to release.
majority op.at.
even assuming the majority is correct in finding that inspector hoti testimony did not express legitimate reasons for not immediately advising capers of his miranda rights,that conclusion would be of little import to the inquiry at he deliberately utilized a interrogation technique.under the test established in justice kennedy concurring opinion in seibert,the operative question is not whether inspector hoti had a legitimate reason for questioning capers prior to warning him of his miranda rights,but instead whether his reason for doing so was to deliberately utilize a interrogation procedure with the intended purpose of undermining miranda.in an opinion joined by retired justice david souter sitting by designation,the first circuit recognized as much and held that an interrogation for the purposes of recovering evidence did not constitute a deliberate strategy because the initial interrogation was aimed primarily at securing the stolen weapon that the police were searching for.united states jackson,cir boudin.in this light,there is nothing suspicious about the reasons put forth by inspector hoti for why he did not advise capers of his miranda rights prior to interrogating him.both reasons,under the circumstances,were quite credible.
by importing the tests establishing legitimate exceptions to miranda into the factual test for whether an interrogating officer deliberately utilized a technique,the majority completely undermines the subjective test that lies at the heart of justice kennedy seibert opinion.the line of cases is only relevant when statements made in response to the initial questioning are excluded by miranda.if district courts are now required to disregard subjective testimony about an interrogator reasons for not warning a suspect of his miranda rights whenever statements would be excluded by miranda,then courts considering interrogations will be forced to disregard whatever subjective evidence may exist 
under the majority test,in almost all cases where a confession is suppressed due to a violation of the suspect miranda rights,a subsequent confession will also be suppressed because the interrogating officer will be unable to articulate a legitimate reason for not advising the suspect of his or her miranda rights prior to the initial interrogation.under this approach,there would almost never be an occasion when justice kennedy approach would be applicable 
the inevitability of this result is made clear when the majority states that t he only legitimate reason to delay intentionally a miranda warning until after a custodial interrogation has begun is to protect the safety of the arresting officers or the public,majority op.at citing united states newton,cir,because this exception could never apply to interrogation cases.the inquiry only comes into play when statements are excluded by miranda.in cases where the public safety exception applies,even those statements are admissible,making the entire inquiry unnecessary.if the public safety exception were the only legitimate reason that an officer could give for failing to advise a suspect of his miranda rights prior to interrogating thus the only reason that would allow a court to consider the officer it would never be proper for courts to consider an interrogating officer testimony in interrogation cases.this would entirely undermine the subjective test established in justice kennedy seibert opinion.
moreover,even if the legitimacy of an interrogating officer actions were an appropriate consideration for determining whether the officer intentionally used a technique to undermine miranda,there is nothing illegitimate about the reasons put forth by inspector hoti.all of the evidence sought by inspector hoti is beyond the scope of the miranda protection.although capers statements would not have been admissible against him in a criminal proceeding,inspector hoti testified that he was not interrogating capers in order to procure a confession.instead,he was seeking physical evidence the currency and money orders and information about capers,lopez.an interrogating officer failure to advise a suspect of his miranda rights does not require suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect unwarned statements.see united states patane,holding that physical evidence obtained as a result of unwarned statements is not excluded by miranda united states morales,cir the miranda presumption of coercion has not barred the use of unwarned,voluntary statements to locate evidence.and miranda,which protects a suspect fifth amendment right against,does not protect suspects from making statements that incriminate other individuals.as such,there was nothing per se illegitimate about asking capers whether lopez was involved in the criminal activity or attempting to determine the location of physical evidence.
in addition to improperly finding that inspector hoti proffered reasons for delaying the miranda warning should not be considered because they lack legitimacy,the majority also finds that those reasons lack credibility when considered in light of the objective evidence.majority op.at.although this finding appears to be entirely superfluous to the outcome of this appeal based on the majority novel legitimacy test,see supra note,to the extent it is at all relevant to result the majority reaches,it is an improper application of the clearly erroneous standard.
while a district court findings of fact may be overturned if this court determines that they are clearly erroneous,this court is not entitled to overturn a district court assessment of the credibility of a assessment which is the providence of the district court.united states,cir united states raddatz,u,i t is unlikely that a district judge would reject a magistrate proposed findings on credibility when those findings are dispositive and substitute the judge own appraisal to do so without seeing and hearing the witness or witnesses whose credibility is in question could well give rise to serious questions.furthermore,w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the court choice between them can not be deemed clearly erroneous,at citing anderson city of bessemer city.these rules are not merely based on the belief that the district court is better positioned to make determinations of credibility as well as
