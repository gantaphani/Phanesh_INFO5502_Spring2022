jos√© velez appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered against him in the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard conway casey,judge for one count of possession of a firearm transported in interstate commerce,after a felony conviction,pursuant to g.on appeal,defendant contends that the district court erred in implicitly finding enforceable a provision of a proffer agreement permitting use of his proffer statements in certain circumstances at trial,and the district court erred in declining to replace trial counsel after counsel participated in a proffer session in which defendant made partial admissions of guilt.
background 
on november,defendant was indicted for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm shipped and transported in interstate commerce,in violation of g the charge was based on the observations of three new york police department,that on august,the officers saw defendant pull a gun from his waistband,heard the sound of metal hitting pavement,and then recovered a gun from the ground where defendant had been standing.
shortly after being charged,defendant participated in two proffer sessions.in a first session on january,defendant,accompanied by counsel,asserted his innocence,claiming that he did not possess the gun found on the ground where he had been standing.the government did not credit defendant statements.
on may,defendant,again accompanied by counsel,participated in a second proffer session,which he had requested.at this session,defendant was represented by his second attorney,because the district court had granted defendant request that he be relieved of his prior counsel.before participating in the meeting,defendant signed an agreement in which he waived,in certain circumstances,the protection otherwise applicable to his proffer statements that prohibits use of those statements as evidence against him.relevant to this appeal,the waiver provision to which defendant agreed provides 
t he government may use statements made by defendant at the meeting to rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of defendant including arguments made or issues raised sua sponte by the district court at any stage of the criminal prosecution including bail,all phases of trial,and sentencing in any prosecution brought against defendant.
accordingly,by signing the proffer agreement that included this waiver provision,defendant authorized the government to introduce defendant proffer statements at trial if defendant introduced evidence or arguments that were inconsistent with his proffer statements.
in the second proffer session,defendant recanted his claims of innocence at the initial session and admitted facts pertaining to one element of the charged,that he owned and possessed the firearm that the officers found on the ground near him.
defendant thereafter requested a third proffer session,which the government scheduled,but defendant canceled the meeting and elected to proceed to trial.
before the start of trial,however,defendant presented two issues to the district court.first,he requested that the court again appoint new defense counsel,on the ground that he would not receive a fair trial because his current second counsel had stated that he was limited to attack ing certain areas,which,as defendant contended,was due to counsel presence at the proffer session.the district court denied defendant request.
second,through his attorney at a pretrial conference and in an in limine motion,defendant sought a preliminary ruling from the district court on the scope of the defense arguments and defense witness testimony that would open the door to the government use of defendant proffer statements.in response to defendant argument at the pretrial conference,the government informed the court that it did not seek to introduce defendant proffer statements in its,but that it reserved the right to introduce such statements if they are deemed necessary to rebut testimony or arguments made by or on behalf of the defendant that are inconsistent with statements made by the defendant during the proffer session.
the district court initially did not rule on defendant motion,but it noted that certain anticipated defense witness testimony would come close to opening the door to the government introduction of defendant proffer statements.appellee br.at quoting trial transcript at.when defense counsel informed the court that it would not elicit that testimony,the district court provided additional time for the defense to reconsider its decision.however,later in the day,the district court stated that if the anticipated defense witness testimony were introduced,the court would indeed permit the government to introduce defendant proffer admissions,thereby implicitly finding that the proffer agreement was enforceable.defendant did not introduce the anticipated testimony.
after a trial,the jury convicted defendant of the sole count of the indictment,which yielded a sentencing range of to months imprisonment under applicable guidelines.at sentencing,in the context of offering mitigation to warrant a sentence at the low end of the range,defendant stated that he had been trap ped into making his admissions at the second proffer session the district court declined to credit defendant statement as relevant to mitigation,and on december,sentenced defendant principally to months imprisonment.
discussion 
challenge to the waiver provision in the proffer agreement 
on appeal,defendant argues that the waiver provision in the proffer permits the government to offer a proffer admission by the defendant in rebuttal to contradictory evidence or defendant constitutional rights to mount a defense,to the effective assistance of counsel,and to a fair trial we disagree.
as an initial matter,we reject the government assertion that we must refuse to consider defendant challenge on the ground that the record is insufficient for review because defendant failed to trigger the waiver provision at trial,either through evidence or argument.for this position,the government relies on luce united states,d,in which the supreme court held that to raise and preserve for review the claim of improper impeachment with a prior conviction,a defendant must testify.the government reads luce as setting forth a rule that,when applied to waiver provisions in proffer agreements,requires a defendant to actually trigger the contested waiver provision by introducing all of the arguments and evidence he wished to present,and letting the government respond with the rebutting confession.appellee br.at.
in luce,the defendant appealed the district court in limine ruling that the government could use a particular item of evidence a record of a prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance to impeach the defendant credibility in the event that he testified and denied any prior involvement with drugs.see luce,at.reasoning that,under the evidentiary rule governing permissible impeachment evidence,review of the trial court ruling depended on a balancing of the prior conviction probative value and its prejudicial effect,which,in turn,depended on the exact nature of the defendant actual testimony triggering use of the contested impeachment evidence,the supreme court concluded that appellate review was unavailable in the absence of testimony by the defendant.id.at.
this conclusion does not support the government assertion here that we are precluded from reviewing defendant claim.unlike the claim in luce,defendant in the instant case contends that the waiver provision is unenforceable and unconstitutional as a general matter,not that the trial court erred in its application of an evidentiary rule balancing test.he states it seems enough that the government is able to effectively prevent the defendant from testifying in his own behalf,referring to the supreme court enforcement in united states mezzanatto,d,of a proffer agreement in which the defendant permitted the government to introduce his proffer statements in response to his own contrary testimony at trial.appellant br.at.defendant continues t his court should not extend the mezzanatto rule beyond the defendant testimonial evidence thus to include any evidence proffered that the defendant is innocent.id.the record and its contents are irrelevant to the consideration of defendant broad assertion that proffer agreements can not constitutionally contain provisions that waive a defendant exclusionary privileges with regard to evidence or argument beyond his own testimony.accordingly,we proceed to consider the claim 
ordinarily,statements made by a defendant during plea negotiations,including proffer sessions,are inadmissible at trial.see also.f referring to federal rule of evidence however,a defendant can waive the protection afforded by rule as long as there is no affirmative indication that the agreement to waive was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily.mezzanatto,at.in mezzanatto,as defendant correctly points out,the supreme court considered and enforced a narrow waiver provision in which the defendant permitted the government to use his statements only when responding to contrary testimony by the defendant himself.id.at.here we face a more expansive waiver of rule because,in the proffer agreement at issue,defendant waived his exclusionary privilege in all circumstances in which the defense presents contradictory testimony,evidence,or or not defendant himself testifies.we agree with the district court implicit decision that the agreement is enforceable.
in contending that the agreement is unenforceable,defendant relies principally on united states duffy,d,in which the district court refused to enforce a waiver provision in a proffer agreement similar to the one we consider here.the duffy ruling determined that the waiver provision prevent ed defense counsel from making any sort of meaningful defense,id.at,and that it exploit ed a disparity of bargaining power between the government and the defendant,id.at.the court stated after signing the standard proffer agreement,the terms of which are dictated by the government,the only thing that a defendant is guaranteed is the chance to convince the prosecutor to enter a deal.at the same time,the defendant bears all of the risk.id.concluding that the waiver provision effectively forfeited the defendant fundamental rights to present a defense and to the effective assistance of counsel and,in doing so,implicated important public interests,the district court held the waiver provision unenforceable.id.at.
for the reasons that follow,we respectfully decline to adopt the position advanced in duffy,and we note with approval the recent,contrasting opinion in united states gomez,d,which found enforceable a proffer agreement containing a waiver provision identical to the one at issue in this case.
as the gomez ruling points out,fairness dictates that the agreement be enforced.id.at.if the proffer agreement is not enforced,a defendant will have less incentive to be truthful,for he will know that his proffer statements can not be used against him at trial as long as he does not testify,even if he presents inconsistent evidence or arguments.see also united states krilich,cir stating that,in proffer sessions,a prosecutor needs assurance that the defendant is being candid and that f or this strategy to work the conditional waiver must be enforceable its effect depends on making deceit costly.
in addition,invalidating a waiver provision like the one before us would clearly interfere with plea bargaining and cooperation direct contravention of the criminal justice system legitimate goal of encouraging plea bargaining in appropriate circumstances.see mezzanatto,at.the supreme court has noted that,i f prosecutors were precluded from securing waiver agreements,they might well decline to enter into cooperation discussions in the first place and might never take this potential first step toward a plea bargain.id.at.see also gomez,d at prosecutors will be reluctant to enter into cooperation agreements if they can not obtain some assurance that the defendant will tell the truth.
we do not lightly dismiss the observation in duffy that the government holds significant bargaining power in arranging proffer sessions and securing a waiver provision as a prerequisite for a defendant participation.d at.however,t he mere potential for abuse of prosecutorial bargaining power is an insufficient basis for foreclosing negotiation altogether.mezzanatto,at.id.at.rejecting the argument that gross disparity in the relative bargaining power renders waiver of rule in plea negotiations so inherently unfair and coercive that waiver should be prohibited.indeed,to the extent there is a disparity between the parties bargaining positions,it is likely attributable to the government evidence of the defendant guilt.see gomez,d at a lthough the government does have significant bargaining power in these situations,it is because the government has substantial evidence to prove the defendant guilt.we thus reject the argument that defendant,relying on duffy,makes in this the asserted disparity of power between the government and a defendant in proffers renders waiver provisions in proffer agreements unenforceable.
finally,a defendant remains free to present evidence inconsistent with his proffer statements,with the fair consequence that,if he does,the government is then permitted to present the defendant own words in rebuttal.gomez,at.with this avenue open to him,a defendant who has consented to a waiver provision like the one at issue here has not forfeited his constitutional right to present a defense,to the effective assistance of his counsel,or to a fair trial.
accordingly,we reject defendant claim that the waiver provision is unconstitutional,and we hold that,where a proffer agreement is entered into knowingly and voluntarily,a provision in which defendant waives his exclusionary privilege under federal rule of evidence by permitting the government to introduce defendant proffer statements to rebut contrary evidence or arguments presented by the defense,whether or not defendant testifies,is enforceable.
having concluded that the waiver provision in this proffer agreement is enforceable as long as it was entered into knowingly and voluntarily,we review the facts in that regard.
as noted above,before the waiver can be deemed unenforceable,the trial judge must find some affirmative indication that the agreement to waive was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily.mezzanatto,at.a waiver is made knowingly if the defendant has a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it,and it is voluntary if it is the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.moran burbine,d defining these terms in the context of waiver of miranda rights.
defendant does not contend that he failed to understand the right being waived or the consequences of the waiver.instead,he claims,as he did at sentencing,that,when he participated in the second proffer session,he changed his story because the prosecution trap ped him into making admissions.defendant contends that this him,at a sentencing hearing held four months after the end of the trial,see note,evidence of coercion at the proffer session.
we find no merit in defendant claim of coercion.defendant explanation of his participation in the second proffer session fails to demonstrate that his consent to the terms of the proffer agreement was a product of coercion,rather than a normal consequence of his decision to participate in the proffer defendant himself had requested.
in sum,we hold that the district court did not err in implicitly finding enforceable the waiver provision in the proffer agreement.
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 
defendant,represented on appeal by still another attorney his third,also asserts that trial counsel continued representation of him following the attorney presence at the second proffer session,in which defendant made partial admissions of guilt,constitutes a conflict of interest between defendant and attorney that deprived defendant of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.defendant essentiall
