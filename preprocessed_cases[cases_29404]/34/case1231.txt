opinion of the court 
abc,john doe,and john doe are subjects of an ongoing grand jury investigation into an alleged criminal tax scheme as part of that scheme,abc,under the direction of john doe and john doe,purchased and subsequently sold numerous companies.these consolidated appeals concern whether documents and testimony relating to legal advice obtained by abc in connection with these transactions are shielded by the and work product privileges.
when abc objected that the government had improperly served a subpoena for documents on abc,the government issued grand jury subpoenas for those documents to abc current outside counsel lacheen,wittels greenberg,llp,and blank rome,llp.later,it also served subpoenas for documents and testimony on three attorneys formerly employed by abc as counsel.in each instance,the firms and counsel asserted and work product privileges on abc behalf,the government moved to enforce the subpoenas,and abc opposed the motion as the purported privilege holder.
the district court granted the government motions to enforce based in part on the exception,which permits the government to obtain access to otherwise privileged communications and work product when they are used in furtherance of an ongoing or future crime.finding that the requested communications and work product either did not qualify as privileged or that any protection afforded was vitiated by this exception,the court largely rejected abc privilege claims and issued corresponding disclosure orders the first directed to abc,lacheen wittels,and blank rome in march the march order,and the second directed to the three counsel in june the june order.
abc seeks to appeal these orders disclosure orders are not normally immediately appealable final decisions.to obtain immediate appellate review,a privilege holder must disobey the court order,be held in contempt,and then appeal the contempt order.that has not happened here.abc argues nonetheless that it can appeal under an exception to the contempt rule established in perlman united states.under perlman,a privilege holder may immediately appeal an adverse disclosure order when the traditional contempt route is unavailable to it because the privileged information is controlled by a disinterested third party who is likely to disclose that information rather than be held in contempt for the sake of an immediate appeal.
we disagree that we have jurisdiction to hear abc appeal from the march order it directs both abc and the law firms to produce the withheld documents.while blank rome is in physical possession of them,it is holding them at the behest of abc.if abc wants immediate appellate review,it can take possession of the documents,defy the disclosure order,and appeal any resulting contempt sanctions because it has not yet taken these steps,we dismiss its appeal from the march order for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
we agree,however,that we have jurisdiction to hear abc appeal from the june order,which is directed solely to its former counsel.abc can not be held in contempt of this order because it does not direct abc to take or refrain from any action.and there is no indication that abc former employees are anything but disinterested third parties unwilling to be held in contempt to vindicate its purported privilege.we therefore reach the merits of abc appeal from the june order.
abc alleges a series of problems with that order the court applied the wrong standard of proof in determining whether the government made a sufficient showing to support application of the exception no matter the proof required,the court wrongly found that the government satisfied its burden the court erred in applying the exception to work product generated by the counsel because there is no suggestion these attorneys were involved in the alleged criminal scheme and with respect to five particular documents,the court ruled incorrectly that they either did not qualify as privileged or were subject to the exception.
we sympathize with the difficult position of abc attorneys.they are arguing against the applicability of the exception without knowledge of the underlying evidence for that exception.because this evidence would reveal aspects of the grand jury investigation and thus can not be made public,the district court filed its march and june orders under seal and provided only redacted copies to the parties.see.e.though we limit our discussion to background facts already disclosed to both parties in order to maintain this secrecy,we have received and closely reviewed unredacted versions of the orders,as well as secret grand jury information submitted ex parte by the government on the basis of that review,we affirm the district court june order.
background 
a.the alleged criminal scheme 
abc,john doe,and john doe are subjects of an ongoing grand jury investigation that seeks to determine whether they and others undertook fraudulent business transactions in order to evade federal income taxes.abc is an administratively dissolved corporation.it was formed in early and it ceased business operations in late.john doe was the company president and sole though indirect shareholder.john doe,who was also affiliated with the company,is his son.
during abc existence,it acquired companies with large cash accounts,few or no tangible assets,and considerable tax liabilities.abc would transfer these target companies to two limited liability companies.according to the government,shortly thereafter the limited liability companies would engage in various transactions that had the effect of fraudulently eliminating the target companies tax liabilities.having done so,john doe and john doe would then divert the target companies cash assets to themselves and their family members.
b.the district court march order 
in december,the grand jury issued a subpoena to abc former vice president of corporate acquisitions as the company custodian of records.the subpoena sought all records relating to transactions and business dealings between abc and specific entities,including the two limited liability companies implicated in the alleged criminal scheme.at some time the government received access to,or copies of,abc documents from a law firm that previously represented the company.the firm withheld documents that abc claimed were privileged but did not supply the government with a privilege log.
abc subsequently changed representation.lacheen wittels now represents abc and john doe,while blank rome represents john doe.as is often the case,the grand jury subjects have a agreement in place.
following this change in representation,the documents that had been held by abc former outside counsel were transferred to blank rome.the documents were transferred to blank rome rather than lacheen wittels because,according to abc,lacheen wittels does not have sufficient space to store the documents.after the documents were transferred,abc provided the government with a privilege log in april for the documents it was withholding.despite previously producing documents and providing this privilege log,abc for the first time also took the position that the government had not effectively served the subpoena on its former vice president.
to address any problems arising from its alleged service error,the government served grand jury subpoenas on lacheen wittels and blank rome.the subpoenas sought all documents relating to abc that blank rome received from abc former outside counsel.in response to these subpoenas,blank rome produced approximately boxes of documents.it continued to withhold,however,the documents listed in the april privilege log,and abc provided the government with another privilege log in june for additional documents withheld.
thereafter the government filed a motion to enforce the subpoenas,requesting that abc,blank rome,and lacheen wittels be required to disclose of the documents identified in the privilege logs.it argued that even if the documents were otherwise entitled to protection under the privilege and work product doctrine,the exception wipes away that protection.
the march order directed abc,blank rome,and lacheen wittels to produce of the requested documents.the district court concluded that the exception barred abc privilege and work product claims.it did not resolve whether the government had properly served abc.
five days later,abc,john doe,john doe filed a timely notice of appeal and a motion for a stay of the district court order pending appeal.we granted the stay and expedited the appeal 
in may,we issued an opinion and judgment dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because abc could receive immediate appellate review by taking possession of the documents,refusing to produce them,and then appealing any contempt sanctions imposed by the district court.we left it to abc,the government,and the district court to select a procedure for transferring the documents from blank rome to abc if it still wished to pursue a contempt appeal.
shortly after our may order issued,the parties had a conference call with judge bartle to discuss how to transfer the documents from blank rome to abc.following that call,blank rome sent a letter to the government proposing two potential mechanisms for permitting abc to seek appellate review following a contempt sanction blank rome could transfer possession of the privileged documents to the clerk of the court,who would hold the documents until abc either decided not to be held in contempt or until after final appellate review or the government could stipulate that even if the documents remained in the physical possession of blank rome,they are being held by that firm as an agent for abc.under either scenario,if abc decided to refuse to comply with the disclosure order,only it would be subject to contempt sanctions.
the government,in a letter dated may,rejected both of these proposals because they provide no avenue for a meaningful contempt sanction.it also noted its belief that the law firms could still be held in contempt for not producing the documents if the parties could not come to an agreement on how to transfer the documents.
after we granted its motion to lift the stay in this case on june,the government sent a letter to judge bartle enclosing a proposed order outlining a procedure for transferring the documents.if entered,it would require blank rome either to appear in court and produce the documents at issue to the government or appear in court and produce documents to a representative of abc who was willing and authorized to a accept service on behalf of abc,b take custody of and maintain the transferred documents until produced to the government,and c suffer significant contempt sanctions.the district court was unable to act on the proposed order,however,because we reinstated the stay on june.
abc,john doe,and john doe subsequently filed a petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc.we granted the petition for a panel rehearing to revisit,in light of the developments on remand,our holding that we lacked jurisdiction under perlman to hear this appeal.
c.the district court june order 
in december grand jury subpoenas were issued to three attorneys formerly employed by abc as counsel.each of the attorneys received two subpoenas,one seeking testimony and documents from that attorney in his or her individual capacity and one seeking documents and testimony from him or her as a custodian of records for abc.
in response to these subpoenas,the attorneys withheld documents and refused to testify as to certain matters on the grounds that the information sought is shielded from production by the privilege and the work product doctrine when the government subsequently filed a motion to enforce the subpoenas,abc,who successfully intervened to contest the subpoena,opposed that motion on the same grounds.
the june order reaffirmed the district court prior ruling.the court required the counsel to produce of the withheld documents,finding that they were either not privileged at all or that any privilege was vitiated by the exception.it also instructed the attorneys to testify about transactions involving the target companies that abc ultimately sold to the two limited liability companies implicated in the alleged criminal scheme.
abc,john doe,and john doe subsequently filed a notice of appeal and the district court granted a stay of their order pending appeal.we consolidated the appeals of the district court march and june orders.
ii.standing 
although the government does not challenge appellants standing,we are obliged to address it sua sponte,city of dallas,quoting anthony council,cir.a person has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena issued to another when he has a sufficiently important,interest in the materials or testimony sought.in re grand jury,cir collecting cases.abc has standing to challenge the grand jury subpoenas because it claims and work product privileges in the documents and testimony at issue.id john doe and john doe,in contrast,do not hold any privilege in the documents or testimony and have not asserted any other interest in them.they therefore lacked standing to oppose the government motion to enforce the subpoenas and do not have standing to appeal the district court resulting orders.
iii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction under.although our jurisdiction is in dispute,we have the jurisdiction to decide that dispute.alaka att y,cir.
finality and the contempt rule 
t he right to a judgment from more than one court is a matter of grace and not a necessary ingredient of justice cobbledick united states.congress has bestowed this grace by granting the courts of appeals jurisdiction over final decisions of the district courts.whether a decision is final depends on its effects.marcus twp.of abington,cir.ordinarily,a final decision will have two effects.first,the decision will fully resolve all claims presented to the district court.second,after the decision has been issued,there will be nothing further for the district court to do.aluminum of am.beazer east,cir citing catlin united states.
when a district court orders a witness whether a party to an underlying litigation,a subject or target of a grand jury investigation,or a complete stranger to the proceedings to testify or produce documents,its order generally is not considered an immediately appealable final decision under.see united states ryan,cobbledick,at alexander united states.it is well settled that a witness who seeks to present an objection to a discovery order immediately to a court of appeals must refuse compliance,be held in contempt,and then appeal the contempt order.church of scientology of cal.united states,citing ryan,u.see also cobbledick,at alexander,at demasi weiss,cir.a district court contempt order is itself immediately appealable because it is a final judgment imposing penalties on the willfully disobedient witness in what is effectively a separate proceeding.
the contempt route to an immediately appealable final decision is a firmly established feature of federal appellate procedure,stretching back to at least the supreme court decision in alexander,but the decision to travel that route must not be made lightly.the supreme court has 
consistently held that the necessity for expedition in the administration of the criminal law justifies putting one who seeks to resist the production of desired information to a choice between compliance with a trial court order to produce prior to any review of that order,and resistance to that order with the concomitant possibility of an adjudication of contempt if his claims are rejected on appeal.
ryan,at citations omitted.the rule,though at times a harsh one,was formulated to discourage appeals in all but the most serious cases.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.requiring a person who objects to a disclosure order to refuse to comply,be subjected to sanctions in contempt,and then appeal from the sanctions,puts the objecting person sincerity to the test by attaching a price to the demand for immediate review.wilson,cir.it forces the objector to weigh carefully the likelihood of success of its challenge to the underlying disclosure order against the seriousness of the sanctions it would face whether incarceration,a hefty monetary fine,or some other penalty if it disobeys the order to disclose.it also forces the objector to assess the importance it attaches to avoiding the ordered disclosure and protecting any associated privileges.
b.the perlman exception to the contempt rule 
in perlman united states,the supreme court carved out an exception to the rule that a privilege holder must stand in contempt of a disclosure order before an immediate appeal may be taken.
louis perlman testified on behalf of his company in a patent infringement suit in district court.id.at.when the company moved to dismiss its suit without prejudice,the district court granted the company motion,but it ordered the court clerk to impound the exhibits perlman used during his testimony and to maintain them under seal.id.at.
soon after,the government began a grand jury investigation of perlman,suspecting him of perjury during his prior testimony.id.at.to assist in the investigation,the government sought an order from the district court directing the court clerk to produce the exhibits perlman used during his testimony.id.at.perlman objected,claiming that use of the exhibits as a basis for indictment against him would be an unreasonable search and seizure and would make him a compulsory witness against himself in violation of the constitution fourth and fifth amendments.id.at.the district court rejected perlman challenge and ordered the clerk to produce the exhibits to the government.id.at.
when perlman ultimately appealed to the supreme court,which heard the case under its appellate jurisdiction,the government argued that the district court disclosure order was not appealable.id.at.the supreme court disagreed,saying only that 
t he second contention of the government is somewhat strange,that is,that the order granted upon its solicitation was not final as to perlman but interlocutory in a proceeding not yet brought and depending upon it to be brought.in other words,that perlman was powerless to avert the mischief of the order but must accept its incidence and seek a remedy at some other time and in some other way.we are unable to concur.
though the perlman doctrine reach has not been set precisely by the supreme court,it generally permits an interlocutory appeal of a disclosure order if it is directed at a disinterested third party lacking a sufficient stake in the proceeding to risk contempt by refusing compliance.see church of scientology,at united states nixon,in that circumstance,the privilege holder is allowed to appeal immediately without suffering contempt sanctions because the privilege holder can not itself disobey the disclosure order and the third party to whom the disclosure order is directed is unlikely to do so on its behalf.see in re grand jury empanelled,cir explaining that the privilege holder in perlman and its progeny were not the targets of the subpoena itself,which meant that the contempt route for obtaining an appeal was not available to them in re grand jury applicants,cir explaining that the contempt rule restricting appellate review is limited to situations where the contempt route to a final order is available to the appellant in re grand jury proceedings,at permitting perlman appeal where the disclosure order adverse to the privilege was not directed to the privilege holder in re air crash at belle harbor,on,cir wilson,at in re motor fuel temperature sales practices,cir.
mohawk and its effect on perlman 
in addition to contempt and perlman appeals,some courts permitted privilege holders to take immediate appeals of adverse privilege determinations if they could satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.the doctrine,first announced in cohen beneficial industrial loan,provides that there is a small class of collateral rulings that,although they do not terminate the litigation,are appropriately deemed final under.id.at.that small category includes only decisions that are conclusive,that resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.swint chambers cnty.comm n.
in mohawk industries,carpenter,however,the supreme court held that disclosure orders adverse to the privilege do not qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.focusing exclusively on the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine,the mohawk court held that collateral order appeals are not necessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to the privilege where the privilege holder is a party to the litigation because postjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the rights of litigants and assure the vitality of the privilege.mohawk.at.appellate courts can remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings by vacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.id.at.
the government argues that this decision narrows the traditionally understood scope of the perlman doctrine to instances where effective postjudgment review is unavailable.deciding whether mohawk precludes our jurisdiction in this case where the privilege holder,abc,is a subject of a grand jury investigation prompts two distinct inquiries.
the first is whether mohawk,which dealt with the collateral order doctrine,applies to the perlman rule at all.other courts of appeals see holt orsted city of dickson,cir united states.krane,cir wilson,at have concluded that the supreme court reasoning in mohawk about the effective reviewability of disclosure orders that would break the privilege applies equally to perlman so long as the privilege holder is a party to an underlying litigation.when that is the case,those claims can be reviewed effectively postjudgment,making immediate appeals unnecessary.
assuming mohawk narrows perlman at all,the second inquiry is whether this reasoning extends to prohibit perlman appeals from grand jury investigations.an order requiring the disclosure of privileged materials arguably is as effectively reviewable,absent an immediate appeal,for subjects of a grand jury investigation as it is for parties in civil litigation.if the grand jury investigation leads to an indictment and later a conviction,we can remedy an improper disclosure of privileged material by vacating the adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.mohawk.at.of course,this may not always be the case.a subject of a grand jury investigation may not actually have an opportunity for review of a disclosure order he may never be indicted,the charges may be dismissed,or he may be acquitted.the same is often true in civil litigation,however.after an unfavorable privilege ruling,a civil litigant may nonetheless settle,obtain summary judgment,or win a favorable verdict,leaving the privilege broken and the district court ruling unchallenged.
regardless,we decline to hold that the supreme court narrowed the perlman doctrine at least in the grand jury context sub silentio.see hohn united states,our decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them,regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.rodriguez de quijas.express,if a precedent of this court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.perlman himself sought to prevent the disclosure of documents to a grand jury that was conducting an investigation into whether he committed perjury in a patent infringement action.the supreme court has not subsequently suggested that perlman status as a grand jury subject would today deny him immediate appellate review and the mohawk court gave no clear indication that this was a consequence of its intended holding.it did not discuss,mention,or even cite perlman,a fact that is not that surprising given that the perlman doctrine and the collateral order doctrine recognize separate exceptions to the general rule of finality under.see krane,at 
the government argues that we should nonetheless hold that the mohawk court narrowed perlman because mohawk description of the rule relied on precedent regarding what it means for an order to be effectively final,and this precedent indisputably includes perlman.government br.at.the government cites ryan for its statement that all appeals under which includes both collateral order and perlman appeals should be limited to cases where denial of immediate review would render impossible any review whatsoever of an individual claims.at see also cobbledick,at noting that the analysis of finality applied in cobbledick is illustrated by perlman.in the same passage of ryan,however,the court described perlman a case where the privilege holder was a grand jury subject as satisfying the finality requirement.at.
we can not say that the supreme court has abandoned that determination on the basis of a later case,mohawk,that never cites,let alone discusses,perlman.if and when that court next hears a case involving the perlman doctrine,it may well hold that the doctrine does not allow grand jury subjects to receive immediate appellate review of adverse privilege determinations.and,given the need for judicial efficiency in the criminal context,such a decision may be justifiable.we will not,however,intrude on the supreme court prerogative to make that determination.we therefore conclude that the perlman exception remains viable.
jurisdiction over appeal from the district court march order 
we dismiss abc appeal of the district court march order because the contempt route remains open to it.it is subject to a court order to produce the documents.although the documents are in the physical possession of blank rome,they are abc documents and are under its legal control see in re grand jury,cir a party lack of possession or legal control over documents requested by a subpoena is normally a valid defense to a subpoena and justification for a motion to quash.in re marc rich,cir the test for the production of documents is control,not location.abc is responsible for deciding whether to produce or withhold the documents,and could properly be held in contempt for directing the law firms to withhold them 
the situation is complicated because the court order is also directed at abc outside counsel,exposing them to potential contempt sanctions if they do not comply with it we recognize that production of the documents by the law firms,despite an instruction from abc to withhold them,might as a practical matter avert any need for the government to seek contempt sanctions against abc.when we first heard oral argument in this case,the government,in an attempt to address this concern,indicated that it would not seek contempt sanctions against the law firms if the documents were transferred from blank rome to abc possession.we agreed that this course of action would take care of our concern,and instructed abc,the government,and the district court to resolve a plan for transferring the documents.
unfortunately,piecemeal consensus dissolved to dissonance.abc and the government were unable to agree on a mechanism to transfer the documents.while abc believes it sufficient for blank rome to transfer the documents generally to the possession of abc,the government believes any resulting contempt sanctions against abc in that circumstance would be meaningless because the company is defunct.instead,the government wants the documents to be transferred to a designated representative of the company who is personally willing to suffer significant contempt sanctions.
according to abc,this inability to agree indicates we were wrong that the contempt route remains open to it.that the parties were unable to resolve this dispute amicably,however,does not mean that the contempt route is foreclosed.the district court which was previously hamstrung due to our imposition of a stay of its march order is no doubt capable of resolving this dispute for the parties.
we now lift the stay to free the court to resolve this matter.if abc continues to want to pursue a contempt appeal,the court should determine an appropriate mechanism for transferring the documents from blank rome to abc.while we do not dictate what contempt sanctions the court imposes or how the documents are transferred,it should effect a transfer that permits it to impose sanctions sufficient to put abc sincerity to the test in determining whether to pursue the contempt route.in re grand jury proceedings,at see also wilson,at.
this may mean,as the government requests,that the documents are transferred to a representative of abc rather than into its general possession.in the normal course,a court can impose sanctions,including monetary fines and incarceration,against a disobedient corporate entity or any corporate officer responsible for the corporation refusal to obey.see carol jones,fletcher cyc.thomas reuters reich sea sprite boat,cir workers pension trust fund of local union gary serv,cir nlrb maine caterers,cir.if abc,as a defunct corporation,is nothing more than a ghost without officers or property,these normally effective sanctions may be meaningless.accordingly,the court may,in its discretion,designate a representative of abc to receive delivery of the documents or require abc to do so.
abc argues that t here is no one who is ready,willing,or able,under these circumstances,to receive the documents and suffer incarceration to vindicate the privilege rights of abc appellants br.at.this proves too much.corporations act through and are controlled by individuals.there must be some person or persons directing abc to assert privilege over the withheld documents.if those person s are unwilling to suffer contempt sanctions,this only points out that the privilege holder has weighed its chances of success on appeal against the seriousness of the sanctions it will face for disobeying the district court order,and determined that it is unwise to seek immediate appeal.
we stress that if the documents are transferred pursuant to court order or an eleventh hour agreement between the parties,the law firms absent bad faith dealings should not be the target of any sanctions.we are confident that the government,consistent with its representations to us,will not seek to hold the law firms in contempt in that event.and no doubt the district court appreciates this difficult predicament 
abc cautions that refusing to hear this appeal would essentially destroy the perlman doctrine because perlman can now be defeated if the government or another litigant simply names the privilege holder in the motion to compel and includes the privilege holder in the compulsion order,even where the privilege holder is not in possession of the subpoenaed documents.appellants br.at.this concern is overstated.our reasoning would only prevent an appeal where a privilege holder subject to a disclosure order retains legal control of the documents that are in the physical possession of another and the government has agreed that the documents can be transferred to the privilege holder without the transferor risking contempt although the government may be wise in the future to avoid these complications by issuing a subpoena only to the privilege holder,the contempt route remains open in this instance and there is no need for us to allow a perlman appeal.
jurisdiction over appeal from the district court june order 
we do,however,have jurisdiction to hear abc appeal of the district court june order.the contempt route is not open to abc because the subpoena and subsequent order were directed solely at the three former abc attorneys.there is also no basis to believe that these former employees are anything but disinterested third parties who are unlikely to stand in contempt to vindicate abc alleged privilege.recognizing these facts,the government does not argue that the contempt route remains open to abc,relying instead on its argument that mohawk precludes a privilege holder who is a grand jury subject from appealing under perlman.as explained above,we decline to hold that mohawk so narrows perlman.accordingly,we reach the merits of this appeal with one exception.
in its june order,the district court rejected abc request to issue an order requiring the government to allow abc to preview the questions that the government intended to ask the counsel before the grand jury.abc does not argue that the district court refusal to allow it to preview these questions a ruling based primarily on the court determination that there was no compelling necessity to justify breaking the seal of secrecy normally afforded to grand jury investigations is independently appealable prior to a final decision on the merits.instead,it asks us to consider this ruling in the course of deciding its substantive privilege claims on the theory that its inability to preview the questions prevented it from effectively defending its privileges.
abc has not cited,and we have not found,any case where we have considered this sort of ancillary due process issue in the course of hearing substantive privilege claims on a perlman appeal.we have,to be sure,previously considered other procedural issues such as whether a district court erred in refusing to order the government to disclose its ex parte affidavit supporting application of the exception,in re grand jury subpoena,cir,and whether a district court erred in holding a hearing ex parte to determine the reasonableness of a subpoena,in re grand jury,cir in the course of deciding a perlman appeal.these procedural questions,however,were closely tied to the substantive issues raised on appeal.they concerned the disclosure of evidence underlying the challenged district court ruling or the method employed to test the sufficiency of that evidence.the question presented here whether abc defense of its privilege was hindered by being denied the opportunity to preview grand jury questions is significantly more tangential to the substantive privilege issues resolved by the district court 
as the supreme court reiterated in mohawk,congress has shown a preference that the appealability of decisions under be determined through the rulemaking process rather than through court decision.mohawk.at specifically,congress in amended the rules enabling act to authorize th e supreme court to adopt rules defin ing when a ruling of a district court is final for the purposes of appeal under section these provisions warrant the judiciary full respect.id.alteration omitted quotation marks and citations omitted.
because we derive our jurisdiction from congress exercise of its authority to ordain and establish inferior courts,art.iii,we are obliged to defer to congress in this context.in addition,declining to expand our jurisdiction through court decision reflects an understanding of our institutional limitations in accurately predicting the effect that jurisdictional rules will have on judicial economy an interest that is particularly important in the grand jury context.for these reasons,we decline to exercise jurisdiction over this ancillary procedural issue.
crime fraud exception quantum of proof 
though they both operate to protect information from discovery,the doctrine and the privilege serve different purposes.in re chevron,cir.the privilege protects from disclosure confidential communications made between attorneys and clients for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance to the client.in re teleglobe commc ns,cir accord restatement third of the law governing lawyers.although such communications may be both relevant and highly probative of the truth,we shield them from production in order to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.upjohn united states.
the work product doctrine,in contrast,promotes the adversary system by enabling attorneys to prepare cases without fear that their work product will be used against their clients.in re chevron,at quotation marks and citation omitted.it protects from discovery materials prepared or collected by an attorney in the course of preparation for possible litigation.in re grand jury investigation,cir quoting hickman taylor.
despite their importance,the protections afforded by the privilege and the work product doctrine are not absolute.the supreme court has explained that the exception is one limit on the scope of the protection afforded by the privilege.
the privilege must necessarily protect the confidences of wrongdoers,but the reason for that protection the centrality of open client and attorney communication to the proper functioning of our adversary system of justice ceases to operate at a certain point,namely,where the desired advice refers not to prior wrongdoing,but to future wrongdoing.
united states zolin,quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.we have held that this exception also applies to the work product doctrine.the work product privilege is perverted if it is used to further illegal activities as is the privilege,and there are no overpowering considerations in either situation that would justify the shielding of evidence that aids continuing or future criminal activity.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.
to circumvent these privileges under the exception,the party seeking to overcome the privilege in this case,the government must make a prima facie showing that the client was committing or intending to commit a fraud or crime,and the communications were in furtherance of that alleged crime or fraud.in re grand jury subpoena,at citations omitted.the prima facie standard is drawn from the supreme court decision in clark united states.
there are early cases apparently to the effect that a mere charge of illegality,not supported by any evidence,will set the confidences free.but this conception of the privilege is without support in later rulings.it is obvious that it would be absurd to say that the privilege could be got rid of merely by making a charge of fraud.to drive the privilege away,there must be something to give colour to the charge there must be prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact.
when that evidence is supplied,the seal of secrecy is broken.
id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.
while there is general agreement on these precepts,courts of appeals are divided as to the appropriate quantum of proof necessary to make a prima facie showing.this is not surprising.prima facie is among the most rubbery of all legal phrases it usually means little more than a showing of whatever is required to permit some inferential leap sufficient to reach a particular outcome.in re grand jury proceedings,cir citing black law dictionary ed mcdonnell douglas green.
when the supreme court last addressed the exception,it did little to clarify the necessary evidentiary showing.because it is difficult to determine whether a document contains communications used in furtherance of a crime or fraud,courts sometimes review the allegedly privileged materials in camera to decide whether the exception applies to preclude the privilege.the supreme court affirmed the permissibility of that practice in zolin so long as there is independent evidence sufficient to support a reasonable belief that in camera review may yield evidence that establishes the exception applicability.at.the court indicated that this is a lesser evidentiary showing than is required ultimately to overcome the privilege,id.at,but declined to address the amount of proof that is ultimately required,id.at.
courts of appeals have articulated the proper measure of proof in different ways.some require there to be probable cause or a reasonable basis to suspect or believe that the client was committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud and that the communications were used in furtherance of the alleged crime or fraud.see in re grand jury proceedings,f d at united states jacobs,cir united states collis,cir in re grand jury proceedings,cir.other courts call for evidence sufficient to compel the party asserting the privilege to come forward with an explanation for the evidence offered against the privilege.see united states boender,cir in re grand jury subpoena,cir.still other courts demand a showing of evidence that,if believed by a trier of fact,would establish that some violation was ongoing or about to be committed and that the communications were used in furtherance of that scheme.see in re grand jury,in re grand jury proceedings empanelled january,cir in re grand jury investigation,cir.
our own statement of the proof necessary to apply the exception is not particularly helpful.we have consistently expressed the amount of proof required as follows a prima facie showing requires presentation of evidence which,if believed by the,would be sufficient to support a finding that the elements of the exception were met.in re grand jury subpoena,at quoting haines liggett grp,cir.this begs the question because it does not quantify what evidence is sufficient.for example,does the trier of fact have to find that there is probable cause to believe a crime or fraud occurred or that it is more likely than not a crime or fraud occurred 
the question of what proof we require to overcome evidentiary privileges arises in this appeal.although the district court cited our traditional sufficient to support language,it also concluded that the government had met its burden by establishing that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that abc had committed a crime or fraud.abc urges us to disavow this reasonable basis to suspect language,which it asserts reflects a far less stringent standard than our own sufficient to support test,and to remand this matter to the district court so that it can analyze whether the government met its burden under the appropriate standard 
we have never held,however,that our standard was significantly more demanding than the standards set out by other courts of appeals.to the contrary,we have cited approvingly the seventh circuit court pronouncements that a party opposing the privilege meets its burden by introducing evidence sufficient to require the party asserting the privilege to come forward with an explanation,in re impounded,at citing in re feldberg,cir,and that prima facie evidence can not mean enough to support a verdict in favor of the person making the claim,in re grand jury investigation,cir quoting in re feldberg,at.we have also stressed that t he burden is not a particularly heavy one,and that demonstrating a reasonable basis to suspect the perpetration of a crime,if based on adequate evidence,satisfies the first prong of the exception.id.at see also haines,at approving the district court determination that the probable cause formulation and the sufficient to support standard amount to the same basic proposition.
today,we clarify that our precedent is properly captured by the reasonable basis standard.the privilege,work product doctrine,and exception are all compromises based on policy determinations.although it is difficult to predict whether a particular standard of proof will strike the appropriate balance between these competing policy concerns,we believe,as do other circuit courts,that the reasonable basis standard affords sufficient predictability for attorneys and clients without providing undue protection to those that seek to abuse the privileges afforded to them.this is also the standard that we believe is closest to the supreme court pronouncement that,for the exception to apply,there must be something to give colour to the charge that the communication was used in furtherance of a crime or fraud.clark,at.
where there is a reasonable basis to suspect that the privilege holder was committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud and that the communications or attorney work product were used in furtherance of the alleged crime or fraud,this is enough to break the privilege.the reasonable basis standard is intended to be reasonably demanding neither speculation nor evidence that shows only a distant likelihood of corruption is enough.in re grand jury proceedings,at.at the same time,the party opposing the privilege is not required to introduce evidence sufficient to support a verdict of crime or fraud or even to show that it is more likely than not that the crime or fraud occurred.see id.at in re grand jury investigation,at.the reasonable basis standard is one with which courts are familiar,and we are confident that they will be able to apply it consistently to achieve the policy objectives of the privileges and the exception.
perhaps recognizing that our precedent is amenable to the reasonable basis standard articulated by the district court,abc asks us to modify the standard to establish by requiring the government to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the privilege has been employed to commit a crime or fraud.appellants br.at.
the supreme court decision in bourjaily united states,provides some support for use of the standard.federal rule of evidence a requires courts to decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified,a privilege exists,or evidence is admissible.in bourjaily,the supreme court held that factual predicates needed to determine the admissibility of hearsay evidence under rule d e must be established by a preponderance of the evidence see at.because rule a also applies to preliminary factual determinations underlying application of the exception,see zolin,at,it could be inferred that the same preponderance standard applies to these determinations.
bourjaily,however,does not dictate that we apply a standard in our case.the supreme court there was not interpreting the language of rule a or any other provision of the federal rules of evidence.instead,because t he federal rules nowhere define the standard of proof the court must observe in resolving these questions,the supreme court was guided by its prior decisions regarding admissibility determinations that hinge on preliminary factual questions.bourjaily,at.we are guided by the same inquiry here.
neither our own nor supreme court precedent suggests that a standard is necessary to protect the policy concerns underlying the exception.to the contrary,we have found that these policy concerns,which differ from those attending evidentiary admissibility,are appropriately protected by a lower standard.this is particularly true in the grand jury context,where the need for speed,simplicity,and secrecy weighs against imposing a standard that would require adversarial hearings or the careful balancing of conflicting evidence see in re impounded,at any holding that would saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and frustrate the public interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.quoting united states dionisio,in re napster,at c ourts of appeal have noted that the need for speed and simplicity at the grand jury stage weighs against a standard that requires courts to hear testimony or to determine facts from conflicting evidence before making a determination.quotation marks and citations omitted.accordingly,we do not adopt a test as the proof necessary to apply the exception.
crime fraud exception satisfaction of government burden 
abc asserts that,regardless of the proof required,the district court erred in determining that the government satisfied its burden.as just discussed,a party seeking to apply the exception must demonstrate that there is a reasonable basis to suspect that the privilege holder was committing or intending to commit a crime or fraud,and that the communication or attorney work product was used in furtherance of that alleged crime or fraud.we review the district court decision that there is sufficient evidence of a crime or fraud to waive the privilege for abuse of discretion.in re impounded,at citations omitted.we review factual determinations underlying that decision for clear error.id.at 
commission of a crime or fraud 
the district court found that the evidence submitted ex parte by the government provided a reasonable basis to suspect that abc willfully evaded paying federal income taxes in violation of and engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the united states of federal income taxes in violation of this scheme,which occurred between and,unfolded in two phases.in the acquisition phase,abc acquired the stock of closely held companies.the target companies generally had large cash accounts,few or no tangible assets,and considerable tax liabilities.in the disposition phase,abc would remove significant amounts of the target companies cash assets,transfer the stock of the target companies to two limited liability companies,and engage in various transactions that had the effect,it is alleged,of fraudulently eliminating the target companies tax liability.having done so,john doe and john doe would then divert the target companies cash assets to themselves and their family members.
our discussion of the district court findings is necessarily abridged because of the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.as noted,we received unredacted versions of the district court march and june orders and ex parte submissions from the government.having reviewed these materials,we can not say that the district court detailed factual findings constituted clear error or that it abused its discretion in determining that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that abc was engaged in a criminal scheme 
abc cites four recent decisions of the united states tax court in support of its assertion that the district court mistakenly found that the government satisfied its burden in establishing that abc committed a crime or fraud.see slone comm r,cch frank sawyer trust comm r,cch starnes comm r,cch,aff,cir grifin comm r,cch.in each of these cases,the tax court held that company shareholders were not liable for tax deficiencies incurred by their respective companies after they were sold to third parties.abc argues that it is in the same position as the selling shareholders in slone,frank sawyer trust,starnes,and griffin,and thus can not be responsible for the allegedly fraudulent transactions that occurred after it sold the target companies.
we do not agree that these decisions preclude application of the exception.as an initial matter,the district court and the tax court applied different statutory provisions in distinct contexts.the latter determined whether the shareholders could be held liable as transferees under which requires application of substantive state law for tax deficiencies incurred after the sale of the relevant company.the district court,in contrast,analyzed whether there was a reasonable basis to suspect that abc willfully evaded paying federal income taxes in violation of and engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the united states of federal income taxes in violation of.
in addition,the tax court decisions depended on analyses which included detailed reviews of the transactions at issue,the roles of the shareholders,and their knowledge of the fraudulent transactions.we are limited in our ability to discuss the facts of the alleged criminal scheme that the grand jury is investigating.but it will not disclose too much for us to say that the government submissions provide sufficient support for the inference that abc played a considerably different role in the alleged criminal scheme than the shareholders in slone,frank sawyer trust,starnes,and griffin played in those transactions.
use of attorney advice in furtherance of the crime or fraud 
on the basis of its finding,the district court ordered the three counsel to answer all questions concerning transactions involving companies that abc purchased and subsequently transferred to the two limited liability companies implicated in the alleged criminal scheme although the fraudulent tax transactions took place in the disposition phase,the district court determined that the acquisition phase was also an essential component of the alleged criminal scheme.the alleged purpose of the criminal enterprise was to divert large sums of money to john doe,john doe,and their relatives.acquiring targets with large tax liabilities was therefore a necessary precursor to achieving that objective.accordingly,the district court ordered the counsel to answer questions regarding all phases of the transactions.
we do not think that the district court factual findings were clear error or that it abused its discretion in determining that there is a reasonable basis to suspect that abc used the legal advice it obtained in connection with these transactions to further its criminal scheme.for the exception to apply,the attorney does not have to be implicated in the crime or fraud or even have knowledge of the alleged criminal or fraudulent scheme.in re grand jury investigation,at.all that is necessary is that the client misuse or intend to misuse the attorney advice in furtherance of an improper purpose.id.at.when this occurs,the purpose of the privilege,to promote the fair administration of justice,has been undermined and the privilege no longer applies.id.
the district court found that there is a reasonable basis to suspect that abc was engaged in a criminal scheme that consisted of multiple phases.although abc suggests that there is no evidence implicating its former counsel in the allegedly fraudulent transactions that occurred in the disposition phase of the scheme,because it is the criminal intent of the client and not its attorneys that matters,it is irrelevant whether the counsel were only engaged in the scheme initial phases.if the acquisition phase was a critical component of the criminal enterprise as the district court found,any legal advice that abc obtained to further those acquisitions was used for an improper purpose and is not entitled to any protection otherwise afforded by the privilege or work product doctrine.
in an effort to undermine the district court rulings,abc asserts that it presented evidence to the district court demonstrating that the counsel legal services were not used in furtherance of any crime or fraud.specifically,abc points to sworn declarations of one of the counsel and john doe purportedly demonstrat ing that there were no circumstances where abc consulted an attorney and then engaged in a course of action that was fraudulent or criminal.appellants br.at.
these declarations do not alter our conclusion that the district court did not commit reversible error.although the counsel testified that he provided a variety of legal services for abc in connection with its acquisition of closely held corporations,he did not indicate one way or the other whether he believed these transactions were part of a larger criminal scheme.in any event,even if he were entirely ignorant of such a scheme,this would not put the exception out of play.
the declaration of john doe is equally unpersuasive.he testified that,to the best of his knowledge,information,and belief,abc never sought advice from an attorney that was then used to commit a crime or a fraud.while this evidence is not necessarily irrelevant,the district court was hardly required to credit this bald statement of innocence from a grand jury subject or to determine that it outweighed the substantial evidence submitted by the government.
application of crime fraud exception to the work product doctrine 
abc asserts that even if the district court was correct in applying the exception to strip the protection conferred by the privilege,the exception does not affect the cover conferred by the work product doctrine because there is no evidence that the attorneys knew of the alleged criminal scheme.
we have left open the possibility that there may be circumstances in which an attorney,without knowledge of his client illegal activity,might properly claim and prevail in asserting a work product privilege even when his client can not.in re grand jury proceedings,at.because the work product doctrine protects the interests of attorneys separately from the interests of clients,there is at least some basis for the proposition that an innocent attorney should be able to prevent disclosure of work product that his client used to further a crime or fraud.accordingly,other courts of appeals have afforded attorneys this protection in appropriate circumstances.see,in re green grand jury proceedings,cir in re grand jury proceedings,at.
we continue,however,to leave for another day whether we should join these courts.none of the counsel has appealed the district court june order.indeed,the counsel would likely need to disobey that order for us to have jurisdiction over their purported work product claims.in the absence of their doing so,we can not properly assess the existence and parameters of their independent interests in resisting disclosure of information.
d.the district court document rulings 
abc challenges the district court rejection of its privilege claims with respect to five documents in the possession of abc former counsel.as noted,we review legal issues underlying the application of the privilege or work product doctrine de novo and review factual findings underlying the application of these privileges for clear error.in re chevron,at.
two copies of opinion letter prepared by abc outside counsel 
this document is a opinion letter prepared by abc outside counsel relating to the allegedly fraudulent transactions investigated by the grand jury.two of the counsel are in possession of this document.the only difference between the copies in their possession is that one includes handwritten notes.the district court determined that any protection afforded by the privilege or work product doctrine to the opinion letter was extinguished by the exception.
abc raises two challenges to this ruling.first,it argues that the district court erred in reversing its previous ruling rejecting the government claim that the opinion letter was used in furtherance of the alleged tax crimes.in its march order,the court ruled that the government failed to carry its burden of introducing prima facie evidence that the opinion was used in furtherance of the alleged tax crimes.specifically,the court found there was no evidence that the letter was scripted to provide abc principals with legal support to defend the allegedly fraudulent transactions if they were later questioned by the authorities.in its june order,the court changed its ruling on the basis of evidence newly obtained by the government an interview memorandum it submitted ex parte and under seal.though we are unable to discuss the content of this witness summary,we have reviewed it and see no abuse of discretion in the court determination that it provides a reasonable basis to suspect that abc used the legal advice contained in the opinion letter to further the alleged criminal tax scheme.
second,abc claims that the handwritten notes on one of the copies of the opinion letter should be protected from disclosure as attorney work product because no evidence exists implicating the author of the note presumably the counsel in the alleged criminal scheme.as abc never raised this issue before the district court,it has waived the opportunity to raise it on appeal.see united states williams,cir franki found.alger rau,cir.moreover,as we have already noted,the counsel have not appealed the district court june order.
email chain containing communications between abc outside counsel and a target company outside counsel 
this document is an email chain.the first message in the chain is between outside counsel representing abc and outside counsel representing one of the target companies it purchased.in this message,counsel for the target company asks where to transfer certain business records,including records pertaining to patents,of the target corporation,asserts that the target company was not required to undertake any maintenance responsibilities related to those patents,and inquires whether outside counsel prepared a transaction binder related to the purchase.the second message in the chain is between abc outside counsel and one of abc former counsel.in that message,the outside counsel forwards the first email with the request to p lease see email below.per my voicemail,please advise me as to what you would like us to do.because the counsel was no longer employed by abc,the remainder of the chain consists of communications discussing with whom at abc the outside counsel could communicate about the matter.the district court determined that none of these communications was protected by the privilege.
as we have explained,that privilege 
applies to any communication that satisfies the following elements it must be a communication made between privileged persons in confidence for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal assistance for the client.privileged persons include the client,the attorney s,and any of their agents that help facilitate communications or the legal representation.
in re teleglobe,at quoting restatement third of the law governing lawyers,to the extent that the record is ambiguous as to the elements which are necessary to establish the claim of privilege,the burden of proving that the privilege applies is placed upon the party asserting the privilege.in re grand jury empanelled february,cir alterations omitted quoting united states landof,cir.
the second email in the chain contains the only communication that is arguably privileged.according to abc,this email plainly involves a request for legal advice because one attorney is asking the other attorney how to prepare for one of the acquisitions at issue.appellants reply at.we disagree.it is at best ambiguous whether the communication is a request for legal advice,how abc wants to respond to the target company assertion that it is not responsible for maintaining certain patents or is a purely administrative request,where the business records should be transferred and whether a binder has been made.because abc bears the burden of demonstrating that the privilege applies,and it has provided no support for its assertion that this was a request for legal advice,we can not say that the district court erred in finding that this email lacks a privilege protection.
two documents containing communications between john doe and abc in house counsel 
these documents contain communications between one of abc former counsel and john doe pertaining to matters involving the of abc affairs.abc argues that they do not pertain to any specific transaction engaged in by abc during its operations and therefore can not be considered to be in furtherance of any crime or fraud.appellants br.at.whatever the merits of this argument,the district court did not order disclosure of the documents on the basis of its ruling,but rather because of its determination that the communications do not contain legal advice protected by the privilege.abc does not make any argument why this ruling was incorrect,and,even absent this waiver,we see none.we accordingly affirm the district court ruling as to these two documents.
conclusion 
we summarize our holdings.
abc has standing to contest the grand jury subpoenas because it claims privilege in the documents and testimony.john doe and john doe,in contrast,lack standing because they are not privilege holders,and do not have any other legally cognizable interest in the documents or testimony.
even though abc has standing,we lack jurisdiction to hear its appeal from the march order because abc may travel the contempt path to jurisdiction.if abc wishes to appeal this order immediately,it must take possession of its documents from blank rome,refuse to produce them to the government,and appeal any resulting contempt sanctions.because the parties have been unable to agree on a mechanism for transferring the documents,we lift the stay to allow the district court to effect an appropriate transfer.in doing so,the court,if it wishes,may designate a representative of abc to receive delivery of the documents or direct abc to do so.
we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal by abc from the june order because that order is not directed to it and its former employees are unlikely to risk contempt sanctions on its behalf.contrary to the government suggestion,we decline to hold that the supreme court decision in mohawk industries,carpenter,precludes perlman appeals by grand jury subjects.
finally,in reaching the merits of abc appeal from the june order,we hold that the court correctly a applied the exception to deny abc a privilege protection over testimony and two documents sought from its former counsel and b determined that three documents sought from those counsel do not qualify as privileged.
in this context,we dismiss the appeals by john doe and john doe for lack of standing,dismiss the appeal by abc from the march order for lack of jurisdiction,and affirm the june order 
i agree with the majority that john doe and john doe lack standing to challenge on the basis of the privilege or work product doctrine the district court disclosure orders,because neither individual can claim the protection of either exemption from disclosure.i also agree that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court march order the march order to the extent that it requires production directly by abc corporation abc,because abc may obtain appellate jurisdiction over that portion of the march order by refusing to produce the contested documents and standing in contempt i also am in complete accord with the majority holdings that we do have jurisdiction over abc appeal from the district court june order the june order,which compels former counsel of abc to produce certain documents claimed to be protected from disclosure by abc because the former lawyers have no stake in the controversy sufficient to prompt them to risk contempt of court sanctions,and the only recourse available to abc is a direct appeal of the june order.finally,i agree that the district court correctly applied the exception to the privilege in ordering production of certain documents by former counsel.i write separately,however,because i believe that we have jurisdiction over abc appeal from the march order to the extent that it requires production by abc outside lawyers blank rome llp blank rome and lacheen,wittels greenberg,llp lacheen wittels.i would instead reach the merits of both orders,and i would affirm the district court to the extent it ordered production of the documents in question by both outside and former counsel.
jurisdiction 
a.the perlman doctrine 
as discussed in the majority opinion,a witness ordered to produce documents before a grand jury may not ordinarily bring an interlocutory appeal challenging the order requiring production.see in re grand jury proceedings fmc,cir.to obtain review,the witness must instead stand in contempt and appeal the contempt order.id.
the supreme court,however,carved out an exception,known as the perlman doctrine,permitting privilege holders to bring interlocutory appeals of orders requiring production by custodians.see perlman united states,see also in re grand jury proceedings cianfrani,f d,cir in re grand jury proceedings fmc,at in re grand jury,cir in re grand jury,cir.the perlman doctrine rests on the premise that a privilege holder does not have the option of standing in contempt to obtain jurisdiction over an order directing production by a custodian,because the order is not directed to the privilege holder.see in re grand jury schmidt sons,cir in re grand jury,at.moreover,a custodian in possession of subpoenaed documents will more likely comply with a district court order than stand in contempt to protect the privilege holder rights.see in re grand jury proceedings cianfrani,at.because the privilege holder can not stand in contempt or force the custodian to stand in contempt,the privilege holder becomes effectively powerless to avert the mischief of the district court order.perlman,at.to prevent this result,we have held that a district court order requiring production by a custodian is final as to the privilege holder,and permit the privilege holder to take immediate appeal pursuant to.see in re grand jury schmidt sons,at w hen a party,other than the one to whom a subpoena has been addressed,moves to quash the subpoena,the denial of his motion disposes of his claim fully and finally.citations omitted.
applying the logic of perlman to this appeal,i agree with the majority that abc can not appeal the portion of the district court march order requiring abc itself to produce the documents directly.abc is an ordinary subpoenaed party,rather than a privilege holder challenging production by a,with respect to the portion of the district court march order requiring that it produce certain documents.it must therefore stand in contempt to confer jurisdiction over this part of the district court order.see in re grand jury proceedings fmc,at.
in my view,however,the portions of the district court march order requiring production by the law firms are a different matter.with respect to the portions concerning the law firms,abc is the purported privilege holder challenging a district court order requiring production by custodians.abc can not stand in contempt of the district court order as to the law firms,because that part of the order is not directed to abc.see in re grand jury schmidt sons,at.abc is thus more or less in the same position as were the privilege holders in the long line of cases in which we have applied the perlman doctrine abc only effective recourse is a direct appeal of the order requiring custodians to produce purportedly privileged records.indeed,i see no meaningful distinction between the march and june orders to the extent that they both compel production of purportedly privileged documents in the custody of parties other than abc.
effect of the order against abc corporation 
the majority distinguishes this appeal principally on the grounds that both the law firms and abc are subject to the district court order requiring production.therefore,in the majority view,abc can obtain immediate appellate review by demanding that the law firms return the documents to it and by incurring a contempt sanction.the majority argument rests,in part,on its assertion that if abc can appeal under perlman,then any client will be able to bring an interlocutory appeal by giving its documents to its law firm.
i can not agree with the majority logic.the purpose of the perlman doctrine is to enable a privilege holder to appeal an order requiring production when he or she lacks the opportunity to contest the subpoena by disobedience because it is not directed to him or her.in re grand jury,at quoting in re grand jury matter dist.council health welfare fund,cir.that is exactly the situation that we now face with respect to the orders compelling production of the contested documents by the law firms.because blank rome,rather than abc,has physical custody of the documents,abc can not unilaterally stand in contempt.regardless of abc intent to stand in contempt,blank rome can comply with the district court order and produce the documents.
i disagree that abc has the option of obtaining jurisdiction by taking physical custody of the documents and refusing to produce them to the government.although the majority rules out the possibility of the government charging the law firms with obstruction of justice,it can not rule out the possibility that the district court will hold the law firms in contempt.the government subpoenaed the law firms individually and moved to compel them to produce the documents.the district court issued an order requiring production by the law firms directly.transferring the documents to abc will not negate the law firms duty to comply with the district court order.see couch united states,the rights and obligations of the parties bec o me fixed when a summons is served,and a document transfer does not alter them.citations omitted in re grand jury empanelled,cir holding that an employer can not defeat a subpoena served on its employee by taking the requested documents from the employee and claiming that the documents are no longer in the employee possession united states asay,cir stating that a recipient of a summons can not defeat the summons by relinquishing possession of the requested documents united states three crows,d,t he law does not allow a custodian of records to send the requested documents away after receiving a summons and then claim he can not produce them,because they are no longer in his possession.accordingly,if the law firms ignore the district court order and instead turn over the documents to abc,they will be just as much in contempt as abc.see nilva united states,a criminal contempt is committed by one who,in response to a subpoena calling for corporation or association records,refuses to surrender them when they are in existence and within his control.citations omitted.g the court may hold in contempt a witness who,without adequate excuse,disobeys a subpoena issued by a federal court in that district.a authorizing civil contempt sanctions when a witness refuses without just cause shown to comply with an order of the court to testify or provide other information.
this matter was returned to the district court with the understanding that the parties would be able to reach an agreement on a way to transfer the contested documents to abc that would avoid the law firms being found in contempt.the inability of the parties to reach agreement on a mechanism for the transfer of the documents in question to the defunct corporation,coupled with the government unwillingness to forego contempt sanctions against the law firms,illustrates why jurisdiction should be found to exist in relation to the district court directives requiring production by the law firms.there is no effective mechanism to avoid the problem that perlman resolves the release of privileged documents by a disinterested custodian who is understandably unwilling to suffer contempt sanctions to protect a privilege held by another.
the government reluctance to agree to a document transfer is not surprising.the government wants a meaningful contempt sanction,one that threatens an individual with imprisonment or hefty monetary penalties.but abc is defunct and no individual has thus far appeared to take on the dubious responsibility of suffering contempt to protect the privilege.
in large measure,the problem presented in this case is attributable to the fact that abc,the privilege holder,is no longer active and has no person within the jurisdiction of the district court to whom the documents can be transferred.it is not a sufficient answer to the conundrum created by the fact that abc is defunct to place the matter in the very capable hands of the district court and say you come up with an appropriate mechanism for transferring the documents from blank rome to abc majority,typescript at.nor is it sufficient to say that there must be some person who has decided to assert the privilege,and that person should be designated to receive the documents and suffer contempt sanctions.no such person within the jurisdiction of the district court has yet been identified,and the government certainly would not agree to a transfer of the documents to a person who is not subject to the district court jurisdiction.it is this inability to identify a person who could be held in contempt that makes the perlman doctrine particularly applicable here.
nor does the fact that the law firms are abc agents,and thus have a duty to return the documents to abc upon abc demand,alter the result.although i agree in general that a client can require his or her attorney to return documents,i disagree that abc can do so in light of the district court order.a client generally can not require his or her attorney to violate a district court order to protect his or her privilege.an attorney,after asserting all objections to producing client confidences,may ethically comply with a court order requiring production.see model rules of prof l conduct cmt.rules of prof l conduct cmt.see also in re grand jury proceedings in matter of fine,cir stating that an attorney may ethically reveal client confidences pursuant to a court order.because the district court order requires the law firms to produce the documents,abc can not force the law firms to instead return the documents to it.
moreover,i disagree that applying perlman when the privilege holder is also subject to the district court order will enable any client to take a perlman appeal by turning over all documents to his or her attorney.as the majority agrees,the government may request documents by subpoena that are subject to the subpoena recipient legal control.see in re grand jury,cir a party lack of possession or legal control over documents requested by a subpoena is normally a valid defense to a subpoena and justification for a motion to quash.as the government appears to agree,a client maintains control over documents that he or she turns over to his or her current attorney,because the client may ordinarily request the documents return.appellee br.t he subjects of the grand jury investigation do not suggest that the corporation no longer has the ability to obtain its documents from its lawyer.see also mercy catholic med.ctr.thompson,cir holding that control under.a is the legal right or ability to obtain the documents from another source upon demand.in the majority of future cases,the government will be able to avoid a perlman appeal by subpoenaing records solely from the privilege holder and obligating the privilege holder to request his or her attorney to produce the documents.perlman jurisdiction exists in this instance because the government chose to subpoena the law firms directly in possession of the documents,thereby subjecting them to possible contempt sanctions should they refuse to comply.
i am also concerned that the majority rule will effectively eviscerate the perlman doctrine in all instances where,as here,the privilege holder can direct the custodian to produce the subpoenaed documents,but can not necessarily prevent the custodian from releasing the documents in the event a court orders production.in such cases,the government will have every incentive to subpoena both the privilege holder and the custodian,obtain orders against both,and use the order against the privilege holder to artificially prevent the privilege holder from taking a perlman appeal.creating such a loophole,in my view,is inconsistent with our court interpretation of perlman as enabling privilege holders to obtain jurisdiction when they can not obtain jurisdiction by standing in contempt.
finally,i am constrained to note that this jurisdictional puzzle involving a defunct corporation that has been subpoenaed to produce documents held by its law firms has tied this matter up for months.notably,the june order,because abc is not subject to it,is immediately reviewable under perlman,but the march order is still unreviewable until procedural hurdles are surmounted.i believe,admittedly with the benefit of hindsight,that the government has unwittingly caused a lengthy delay in the grand jury proceedings by trying to the perlman doctrine by having both the law firms and abc be the subjects of the disclosure order.interests of judicial economy and speedy grand jury investigations would have been better served had the government not taken such a belt and suspender approach by subpoenaing both the privilege holder and its law firms,but instead had directed its subpoena only to the custodians of the records and allowed the perlman doctrine full play with an adjudication on appeal of the privilege claims.
effect of current representation by the law firms 
finally,although not addressed by the majority,the government argues that the perlman doctrine does not apply in this instance because the law firms are not d isinterested t hird p arties due to their current representation of subjects of the grand jury investigation.appellee br.i believe that the perlman doctrine applies to current attorneys and would reject this argument.
as an initial matter,our court interpretation of the perlman doctrine does not require strict disinterest,at least in the sense of requiring total with the privilege holder.we have instead tended to focus our analysis on whether the privilege holder is in a position to control the subpoenaed custodian decision whether to produce the records,and on whether the personal stake in the matter is substantial enough for it to likely stand in contempt to protect the privilege holder rights.in re grand jury matter,cir see in re grand jury schmidt sons,inc,at holding that the privilege holder employees are under perlman because employees are unlikely to stand in contempt to protect their employer.applying this framework,the majority and i agree that a privilege holder former attorney qualifies as a custodian under the perlman doctrine,because a former attorney is not guaranteed to stand in contempt to protect his or her former client privilege.see in
