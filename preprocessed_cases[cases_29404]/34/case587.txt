lawrence maher,an erstwhile massachusetts drug dealer supplying cocaine to southern maine,was the subject of a police sting operation.while under surveillance on july,maher wandered drunkenly around a public parking lot in old orchard beach,maine,calling out the name of a potential drug buyer.he then got in his van,which contained drugs,and fell asleep at the wheel with the key in the ignition and an open beer can beside him.
the police,well aware of the opportunity created,naturally investigated.they arrested maher for the state crime of operating under the influence oui after maher failed field sobriety tests.incident to arrest,they searched maher person and van and found heroin,cocaine,and drug paraphernalia.maher luck was no better at trial.he was found guilty of the federal crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.see a.on april,he was sentenced to months in prison and six years supervised release.
on appeal maher makes an easily fourth amendment claim,which is significant largely because we reject his legal argument that reasonable suspicion of drunk driving can not exist where the operator is asleep and the vehicle is off.of more significance is his argument,under crawford washington,d,that the prosecution may not evade strictures on admission of testimonial statements by declarants on the basis that the statements are offered only for context.while concerned about the prosecution use of such evidence here,we find no basis to reverse the conviction.
we recount the facts.as to those facts relevant to the suppression issue,we rehearse the findings of the magistrate judge,consistent with record support.see united states romain,cir.
on july,officer ernest macvane,a windham,maine,police officer assigned to a task force of the united states drug enforcement administration dea,arrested one william johnson on cocaine charges.johnson told officer macvane that he had bought his cocaine from maher,who lived in massachusetts and was a significant trafficker in southern maine.
johnson agreed to assist in a staged drug transaction with maher.he was told that his telephone calls with maher would be monitored and recorded.johnson called maher on july and asked if maher was coming down here again.maher replied,tomorrow i hope,yeah.the following exchange ensued 
maher d o you got any numbers 
johnson what that 
maher one,two,three unintelligible.
johnson four.
maher okay,buddy.
after some discussion of whether johnson might come to massachusetts instead,maher told johnson,i got you down for four either way.he did not explicitly mention cocaine.
on the night of july,dea agent kate barnard called maher to set up a separate meeting she told maher she was sue,and said she wanted to hook up so that she could get something.maher,apparently thinking she was an acquaintance agreed to meet her at radley market in old orchard beach.the next morning,johnson called maher to discuss meeting.maher told johnson he was waiting for a friend at a store an apparent reference to radley market and told johnson to call back.
later that morning,dea agent paul buchanan saw maher wandering in the parking lot adjacent to radley market,stumbling and calling the name sue.agent buchanan watched maher enter the market and emerge minutes later.maher appeared intoxicated to agent buchanan,who said he was still stumbling and disoriented.
maher climbed into the driver seat of a white minivan.about ten minutes later,agent buchanan approached the minivan and saw maher asleep or unconscious,slumped in the driver seat.no one else was in the van.the keys were in the ignition,though the engine was not running.this information was relayed to old orchard beach police officer gerald hamilton.
officer hamilton drove to radley market and approached the minivan.he spoke to maher,but maher did not wake up,so officer hamilton reached through the window and shook maher to rouse him.the officer asked maher if he was okay,and maher replied that he was just leaving.officer hamilton observed that maher had droopy eyes and spoke in a mumble.
officer hamilton could see an open beer can in the minivan console and a on the passenger seat.he asked maher if he had drunk alcohol or used drugs.maher replied that he had had only about two ounces of beer and that he did not use drugs.officer hamilton told maher he should not have driven.maher replied that officer hamilton was right he asked the officer to cut him a break and said he would find his way to a friend house.officer hamilton then ordered maher out of the van and conducted three field sobriety tests.maher failed all three and was arrested on suspicion of oui.see.ann.tit.
during a search incident to arrest,officer hamilton found in maher pocket a large roll of currency,totaling,and a film canister containing approximately half a gram of what was later determined to be heroin.in the van,police found a black canvas bag which contained three sandwich bags,each of which held a ball of white powdery material slightly smaller than a baseball.the substance was later determined to be grams of cocaine the canvas bag also held a black digital scale.additionally,it contained a note which listed several names to the right of each was a number.the first name was johnson.to the right of his name was the number.
prior to trial,the defense filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from maher van.the defense argued that even assuming maher was intoxicated,officer hamilton had lacked any reason to think maher had committed oui.
after a suppression hearing during which officers macvane and hamilton testified,the magistrate judge recommended on october,that the motion to suppress be denied.the magistrate judge noted that under maine law,an officer may order field sobriety tests on reasonable suspicion of oui.he also noted that attempted operation counts as operation under the maine oui statute.see.ann.tit.the magistrate judge catalogued the evidence that maher was intoxicated before entering the minivan and found that when awakened,maher both admitted that he had driven and said he was just leaving.the court concluded this was sufficient evidence,together with the rational inference that the defendant had entered the vehicle in order to drive it,to justify the field sobriety tests.the district court adopted this decision and denied the motion to suppress.
at trial,the government never called the informant,johnson,as a witness.it did,however,introduce the drugs seized from the minivan and testimony that the amount of cocaine seized far exceeded the amount one might have for personal use.the parties stipulated that the substance seized from the minivan was cocaine weighing grams.
a.the motion to suppress 
maher first challenges the district court denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the minivan.our review of the ultimate determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion on a motion to suppress is de novo.united states scott,cir citing ornelas united states,d.s ubsidiary factual findings are reviewed for clear error,giv ing due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.united states burhoe,cir second alteration in original quoting ornelas,at.
maher argues that the totality of the circumstances did not create reasonable suspicion that he had committed,or was about to commit,the state crime of oui.he argues that the absence of reasonable suspicion breaks the chain of circumstance that permitted the drug seizure without reasonable suspicion,officer hamilton had no basis to require sobriety tests without the tests,officer hamilton had no probable cause to arrest maher for oui without the arrest,there was no reason to search the van.
we reject this argument at its starting point.assuming arguendo that reasonable suspicion is the applicable legal standard it was met on these facts.
reasonable suspicion,a less demanding standard than probable cause,denotes at least a minimal level of objective justification for a stop.united states sokolow,d.in evaluating whether reasonable suspicion is present,we look at the totality of the circumstances to see whether the detaining officer ha d a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.united states arvizu,d internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states cortez,d.
in this case,officer hamilton knew because he had been told by other officers that maher had just been stumbling disorientedly,a common characteristic of intoxication,around the parking lot of radley market.see united states meade,cir police may rely upon each other knowledge of facts when forming suspicions of wrongdoing.officer hamilton saw maher slumped over the wheel of his van in a public lot,apparently not conscious,in the middle of the day.the officer saw an open can of beer next to maher maher did not respond to verbal attempts to wake him up.and when maher did wake up,he had droopy eyes and mumbled his words.officer hamilton had a reasonable basis to think maher was intoxicated.
but maher mere intoxication is not what led to the search of the car.the search was justified on the basis of reasonable suspicion that the crime of oui had been committed,which led to the sobriety tests,which led to the arrest.officer hamilton knew maher was the only occupant of the minivan,that he was in the driver seat,and that the key was in the ignition.he knew maher vehicle was parked in a state other than his home state.the inference was entirely rational that maher had driven while intoxicated and that he would drive again.see united states jesus,cir a factfinder may make inferences in light of human experience see also united states mcfarland,cir.furthermore,maher told officer hamilton he was just leaving and asked the officer to cut him a break suggesting he knew he had broken the law.maher also tacitly admitted,by agreeing with officer hamilton statement that he should not have driven,not only that he had driven recently but that he had driven drunk 
maher key legal argument is that courts seem to require that a sleeping defendant be found behind the wheel with a running engine before they will find reasonable suspicion of oui.we reject any argument that reasonable suspicion of oui can not exist when an apparently intoxicated person is found asleep behind the wheel unless the engine is running.fourth amendment analysis is always and rarely employs litmus tests see brigham city stuart,d noting that the ultimate touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness and concluding a warrantless entry was plainly reasonable under the circumstances.
b.the confrontation clause challenge 
maher argues there were twelve instances at his trial in which hearsay was erroneously admitted,and that consequently he is entitled to a new trial.he lumps them together and argues that the admission of the testimony violated his constitutional rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,as defined in crawford washington,d.he did not object to the majority of this testimony,and he can not show plain error.where he did object,no confrontation clause issue is presented.
the admission of informants testimonial statements,through the testimony of police officers,is a recurring issue in the courts of appeals.crawford holds that a declarant testimonial statement is not admissible under the confrontation clause unless the declarant testifies,id.at,or the defendant had a prior opportunity for and the declarant is unavailable,id.at,or the evidence is admitted for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted,id.at.each of these tests has its own subtleties.
assuming the declarant does not testify and is in fact available,there was no prior opportunity for of the declarant,crawford claims will usually turn on one of two issues.first,was the statement testimonial second,if so,is it admissible for reasons other than the truth of the matter asserted 
there has been a great deal of attention to the first issue,which this court discussed in united states brito,cir.in crawford,the supreme court did not precisely define what it meant by testimonial.it instead listed,for illustrative purposes,three formulations that came within the core class of testimonial statements.at.the first includes ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.id.at.emphasis added.the second includes extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted omission in original citing white illinois,d.the third encompasses statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.this court,applying crawford,has said a statement is testimonial if a reasonable declarant,similarly situated,would have the capacity to appreciate that the statement is of a sort typically preserve d for potential prosecutorial use.brito,at holding that calls may be testimonial in certain circumstances.
there has been somewhat less development,of the second issue,perhaps because this crawford exception appears simply to rest upon a exception to the hearsay rule for statements not offered for the truth of the matter.even before crawford,however,it was recognized in the standard treatises discussions of the hearsay rule that 
one area where abuse may be a particular problem involves statements by arresting or investigating officers regarding the reason for their presence at the scene of a crime.the officers should not be put in the misleading position of appearing to have happened upon the scene and therefore should be entitled to provide some explanation for their presence and conduct.they should not,however,be allowed to relate historical aspects of the case,such as complaints and reports of others containing inadmissible hearsay.such statements are sometimes erroneously admitted under the argument that the officers are entitled to give the information upon which they acted.the need for this evidence is slight,and the likelihood of misuse great.instead,a statement that an officer acted upon information received,or words to that effect,should be sufficient.
broun,et,mccormick on evidence,at ed emphasis added.
maher crawford arguments appear to cover two different types of testimony by officers concerning statements by the testimony that the informant said x to the officer,and testimony from which maher argues the jury would necessarily infer that the declarant had said x,but which did not itself quote or paraphrase the declarant statements.crawford covers the first admission of statements by and declarants through testimony of others.maher makes no effort to explain why crawford should be read to extend to the second category,and so we disregard the statements which fall in that category.
we address maher strongest argument that the testimony violated crawford.early in the government case,the prosecutor asked officer macvane how he found out that maher may be involved in illegal activity.there was no objection.officer macvane replied william johnson.moments later,the prosecutor and officer macvane engaged in the following colloquy 
q b ased on bill johnson response to your questions about who gave him the cocaine,did you do inquiries regarding whether such a person existed 
a yes i did.
q what did you do on those lines 
a i checked the name lawrence maher in the state of maine department of motor vehicle database and also the massachusetts database and found that he existed in both of them.
again,there was no objection.
obviously concerned about the use the jury might make of this testimony,the trial court admirably and sua sponte instructed the statements made by johnson,whatever they are,that is for you to decide,are not to be used by you as to the truth of those statements.they are merely to be used as something that he responded to by doing something else.the court then gave the jurors an example of the difference between hearsay and use of a statement.
