opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from a district court order denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by ronald williams.williams,who is serving a term of life imprisonment in pennsylvania for murder,argues that his right to an impartial jury was abridged because the state courts refused in proceedings to admit certain evidence of racial bias on the part of members of the jury.williams sought to introduce this evidence to show,among other things,that jurors lied during voir dire when they denied racial prejudice.the state courts refused to consider the evidence at issue based on the evidence rule that generally bars juror testimony for the purpose of impeaching a verdict the no impeachment rule.we hold that the state courts refusal to receive some but not all of this evidence violated williams clearly established constitutional rights,and we therefore vacate the decision of the district court and remand for an evidentiary hearing at which williams will have the opportunity to introduce the improperly excluded evidence and to attempt to prove that a juror lied during voir dire.
on august,at about,archie bradley stepped off a city bus outside a truck depot maintained by his employer,trucking,in cranberry,pennsylvania.minutes later,witnesses heard five gunshots nearby.one witness also saw the triggerman standing over bradley body and holding a gun.immediately before the witnesses contacted police,a patrolling traffic officer observed a suspicious car leaving the parking lot.he noted the license plate and initiated a pursuit that escalated in intensity.the driver of the fleeing car threw various objects out the window,striking the police car with one of them,and succeeded in eluding the officer,but the car overturned on an embankment.police discovered it abandoned.retracing the route of the car chase,police recovered a firearm,a silencer,and an ammunition cartridge,and the police matched the gun forensically to the object that had struck the police cruiser.a search of the vehicle yielded more guns and ammunition,as well as a slip of paper on which was written.
in the hours of august,williams telephoned jewel hayes,an intimate acquaintance,explaining that he was stranded somewhere and needed a ride.hayes agreed,but when she could not find the designated location,she asked a police officer for directions.police traced the phone call and arrested williams and his brother raymond.the eyewitness to the shooting identified williams as the gunman.a caller who claimed to have witnessed the vehicle leaving the crime scene initially described the car as blue and its driver as white,but this witness later decided that the car was gray and the driver was black.the witness eventually identified williams,who is african american,as the driver.both parties in their briefs refer to other inculpatory and exculpatory evidence,but none of it has a bearing on this appeal.
during voir dire proceedings in the williamses trial,the trial court asked two questions regarding racial bias 
do you personally believe that blacks as a group are more likely to commit crimes of a violent nature involving firearms 
can you listen to and judge the testimony of a black person in the same fashion as the testimony of a white person,giving each its deserved credibility 
all the jurors who were selected to serve answered no to the first question and yes to the second.the jury convicted both williams and his brother and sentenced them to death.
shortly after the verdicts were returned,williams attorney filed motions.among other things,he sought a new trial on the ground that the jury had received and had been influenced by information not introduced in court.in support of this motion,williams attorney submitted the affidavit of juror judith montgomery.montgomery,who died in,stated that p rior to the deliberation process as to ronald alfred williams sentencing,another juror had told the entire jury that,according to information received from an alternate,ronald williams had committed two murders,that raymond williams was wanted for two other murders,and that,if this jury did not give the death penalty,regarding raymond williams another jury would.app.
on february,the trial judge held an evidentiary hearing on these allegations.raymond williams and his attorney were present at the hearing,but neither ronald williams nor his lawyer was there.at the beginning of the hearing,the judge stated that a juror may not impeach his or her own verdict but that there is a narrow exception allowing testimony of extraneous influences which might have affected the jury during their deliberation.app.montgomery,the other jurors,and a reporter for a local newspaper who had overheard a conversation among the jurors then testified.this testimony revealed that,after the verdict but before the verdict,half of the jurors had heard that ronald williams was wanted on other murder charges.see commonwealth williams,direct appeal of raymond williams.the trial judge nevertheless refused the request for a new trial because he was satisfied by the testimony of the jurors that they had not been influenced by this information in imposing sentences of death.see id.on appeal,however,the pennsylvania supreme court vacated the death sentences imposed on both brothers and remanded for the imposition of sentences of life imprisonment.id.at commonwealth williams,direct appeal of ronald williams.the state supreme court concluded that prejudicial extraneous information had tainted the death verdicts,but the court saw no need to disturb the guilty verdicts since the testimony at the hearing had established conclusively that none of the jurors had heard the objectionable information until after the guilty verdicts had been returned.at,
in,ronald williams,represented by new counsel,filed a state relief act pcra petition in which he contended that members of the jury had lied during voir dire when they answered the questions about racial prejudice.in support of this motion,williams relied on a new affidavit by montgomery and another affidavit by jewel hayes,who had testified at trial.
montgomery affidavit stated 
w hen i was juror in the trial of commonwealth of pennsylvania ronald williams and raymond williams i was called a nigger lover and other derogatory names by other members of the jury.remarks were made to me such as i hope your daughter marries one of them the jurors were given information by an alternate juror who was told by the sheriff that the men were wanted in other states and if we do get them another state would and that raymond williams,appellant brother and was going to die anyway as he shot and crippled a man for life in michigan.the man lived and was able and willing to testify against raymond,so his black ass was cooked anyway.
hayes affidavit averred 
subsequent to the proceedings in this case i ran into juror number two in the lobby of the courthouse upon seeing me he stated all niggers do is cause trouble i am not sure whether this was stated directly to me but it was stated for my benefit and loudly enough for me to hear and to get a rise out of me.during our confrontation he also stated i should go back where i came from.
on july,the court held an evidentiary hearing on this issue.prior to the receipt of testimony,the court ruled that evidence of what went on in the courtroom,or in the jury room would not be admitted but that evidence of any extraneous information that might have affected the guilty verdict would be received.app.montgomery again testified,and she reaffirmed that the information about the other murder charges against williams had not been received until after the guilty verdict was returned.id.at.hayes was not called as a witness.
the pcra court denied williams petition.stating that williams had argued that racial slurs had allegedly been uttered by jurors during jury deliberations,the court wrote that it is firmly established that after a verdict is recorded and the jury discharged,a juror may not impeach the verdict by his or her own testimony.app.the court added that,while there is an exception to this rule for extraneous influences on the jury deliberation process,the alleged slurs were not extraneous and thus did not fall within the exception.id.the court did not explain why it did not consider hayes evidence.
on appeal to the superior court,williams argued that his federal constitutional right to an impartial jury had been abridged by the pcra court refusal to consider the evidence in the montgomery and hayes affidavits for the purpose of determining whether jurors had lied during voir dire.see amend.app.since the pcra court had refused to consider this evidence due to the no impeachment rule,the clear implication of williams argument was either that this rule did not apply when evidence was offered to prove that a juror lied during voir dire or that under these circumstances the rule had to give way to his constitutional right to an impartial jury.however,the discussion in williams brief did not spell out either of these arguments,and the superior court affirmed based on the pcra court analysis.commonwealth williams,slip op.at.
williams filed a petition for allocatur that raised the issue now before us in virtually the same words as his superior court brief,amend.app.at,but the pennsylvania supreme court denied review.commonwealth williams.
williams then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that the petition should be denied.at the outset of her discussion of the pertinent issue,the magistrate judge noted that williams had submitted affidavits of one juror,montgomery and one trial witness,hayes,r r at,but the magistrate judge made no further reference to hayes.indeed,the magistrate judge later stated that the state courts refused to consider williams proposed submission of affidavits by two jurors based on the no impeachment rule,and the magistrate judge concluded that williams had not demonstrated that the state courts actions were contrary to tanner united states,d and other relevant supreme court cases,which do not permit the type of jury impeachment testimony williams sought to introduce.r r at emphasis added.the district court adopted the report and recommendation without elaboration,and this appeal followed.a panel of our court granted a certificate of appealability on the following questions 
was williams denied due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment or a fair trial or impartial jury in violation of the sixth amendment because jurors were disingenuous on voir dire in answering questions about racial bias or is this a rare case which is an exception to the rule see united states henley,cir shillcutt gagnon,cir.
our standard of review in this case is governed by d.under this provision,federal habeas relief may not be awarded as to any claim that a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d,d emphasis added.c learly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d.a decision is contrary to a supreme court holding if the state court contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a different result.id.at.a decision involve s an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or if the state court unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.we review de novo the district court application of section d.see banks horn,cir.
williams points to mcdonough power equipment,greenwood,d mcdonough,as the supreme court precedent that the state courts contradicted or unreasonably applied.in mcdonough,the losing parties in a civil trial in federal court argued that they were entitled to a new trial on the ground that a juror had failed to disclose material information in response to a question asked during voir dire.the supreme court held that in order to obtain a new trial in such a situation,a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.id.at.
although mcdonough was a federal civil case,a state court decision failing to apply this same rule in a criminal prosecution would represent an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law within the meaning of d.the mcdonough court based its decision on the following principle 
one touchstone of a fair trial is an impartial trier a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.smith phillips,d.
mcdonough,at.smith,the precedent on which mcdonough relied,was a habeas case in which a state prisoner claimed that he was denied due process because of juror bias.accordingly,to hold that the right recognized in mcdonough is not available to a defendant in a state criminal case would be an unreasonabl e refus al to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.williams taylor,at.see jones cooper,cir but see montoya scott,cir reserving decision on question.
mcdonough,however,did not decide the issues raised in this appeal.mcdonough addressed the right of a party to obtain a new trial upon making a particular showing,not the admissibility of evidence to make that showing.as far as the admissibility of evidence is concerned,the most that may fairly be taken from mcdonough is that a state may not adopt evidence rules that entirely frustrate the ability of objecting parties to make the showing specified in that case.smith,at.this court has long held that the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity to prove actual bias.no further limitations on the power of a state to fashion its own evidence rules may reasonably be extracted from mcdonough alone.certainly mcdonough can not be read as clearly establish ing constitutional limits on state no impeachment rules.
the supreme court decision that best addresses the interplay between a defendant constitutional right to offer evidence of juror misconduct and the traditional no impeachment rule is tanner united states,d.in tanner,the defendants argued that the trial judge had erred in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing at which jurors would be allowed to testify about alcohol and drug use by jurors during the trial.the defendants maintained that this testimony was not barred by federal rule of evidence b,which codifies the no impeachment rule.in addition,the defendants contended that,even if the testimony was prohibited by rule b,the trial judge refusal to receive the evidence violated their constitutional right to a competent jury.at.
the supreme court disagreed.after holding that the testimony at issue was barred by rule b,the court also rejected the defendants constitutional argument,noting that the no impeachment rule is supported by and very substantial concerns.id.at.tanner strongly suggests that the exclusion of evidence of juror misconduct pursuant to the traditional no impeachment rule is constitutional because of the important purposes that the rule has long been recognized as serving.but of course tanner does not necessarily mean that the converse is true,that it is necessarily unconstitutional for a state to adopt a version of the no impeachment rule that bars more testimony than does the traditional rule.in such a case,a court would have to look beyond tanner in order to determine whether this expanded rule violated the constitution or fell within the states broad power to fashion the rules of evidence applicable in their own courts.see duckworth owen,d rehnquist,dissenting from denial of certiorari 
just how far beyond the traditional rule a jurisdiction could go without violating the constitution is an unsettled question.the principal supreme court cases striking down exclusionary state evidence rules involve situations bearing little resemblance to those of the present case.in washington texas,d,a state rule prohibited a in a crime from testifying for the defense.the court stated that the constitution is offended by arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying on the basis of a priori categories that presume them unworthy of belief.id.at.the court added that,because the rule at issue permitted a to testify if the witness was called by the prosecution or had previously been acquitted of the crime,the rule could not even be defended on the ground that it rationally set apart a group of persons who are particularly likely to commit perjury.id.
in chambers mississippi,d,a murder defendant was precluded from bringing to the jury attention the fact that another man,mcdonald,had confessed to the murder in the presence of three witnesses.at trial,the defendant called mcdonald to the stand,but mcdonald denied committing the murder,and the defendant was not permitted to him about the confession because state law prohibited a party from impeaching the party own witness.id.at.the defendant then attempted to question the three witnesses about the confession,but this evidence was ruled to be inadmissible hearsay because the state did not recognize an exception for declarations against penal,as opposed to,pecuniary interest.id.at.noting that the state had not even attempted to defend or explain the underlying rationale of the rule prohibiting a party from impeaching the party own witnesses,id.at,the supreme court concluded that this rule,combined with the mechanistic application of the hearsay rule,had deprived the defendant of a fair trial under the facts and circumstances of the case.id.at.
in crane kentucky,d,a murder defendant confession was found before trial to have been voluntary and thus admissible.at trial,the defendant wanted to convince the jury that the confession was unreliable due to the circumstances under which it was given,but this evidence was ruled inadmissible.id.at.the supreme court held that the defendant conviction had to be reversed,observing that neither the state supreme court nor the prosecution had advanced any rational justification for the wholesale exclusion of this body of potentially exculpatory evidence.id.at.
in rock arkansas,d,a homicide defendant underwent hypnosis to refresh her memory.because state law excluded all hypnotically refreshed testimony,the defendant was not allowed to testify to any facts that she had not reported prior to the hypnosis.observing that restrictions of a defendant right to testify may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,id.at,the court held that the defendant right had been abridged because no specific determination had been made that the excluded testimony was unreliable.id.at.the court noted that the state court ruling had deprived the defendant of the testimony of the only witness present at the scene and had infringed the defendant interest in testifying in her own behalf,id.at,an interest that the court deemed particularly significant.united states scheffer,d.
none of these cases clearly establishes just how far a jurisdiction may go in excluding evidence of juror misconduct.the only principle applicable to the present case that these cases may be viewed as clearly establish ing is that a state evidence rule may not severely restrict a defendant right to put on a defense if the rule is entirely without any reasonable justification.
the no impeachment rule has been traced to a decision by england lord mansfield,vaise delaval,eng,and the rule once carried the appellation mansfield rule.according to wigmore,with the prestige of the great chief justice,this rule soon prevailed in england,and its authority came to receive in the united states an adherence almost unquestioned.john henry wigmore,evidence in trials at common law at mcnaughton.
several different forms of the rule were common in this country,but in general a distinction was drawn between,on the one hand,mistakes and misconduct by the jury during deliberations and,on the other hand,improper outside influences.see christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence at ed.in mattox united states,the supreme court stated that a a juryman may testify to any facts bearing upon the question of the existence of any extraneous influence,although not as to how far that influence operated upon his mind or as to the motives and influences which affected the jury decision.see also mcdonald pless.t he losing party can not,in order to secure a new trial,use the testimony of jurors to impeach their verdict.hyde united states.
rule b of the federal rules of evidence codifies this approach.it provides 
upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict,a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror mind or emotions except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention.
pennsylvania has long followed a similar rule.under the governing cases at the time of williams trial,a juror was precluded from invalidating or impeaching a verdict by the juror own testimony,commonwealth patrick,collecting cases,unless the juror alleged that an external factor had improperly influenced the verdict,commonwealth boden.the pennsylvania rules of evidence now provide for the same policy in language nearly identical to the federal rule.compare.evid.b with.b.see.evid.b cmt.characterizing.b and.evid.b as consistent with existing pennsylvania law.the supreme court in mcdonald explained the importance of the concerns that underlie the no impeachment rule 
l et it once be established that verdicts solemnly made and publicly returned into court can be attacked and set aside on the testimony of those who took part in their publication and all verdicts could be,and many would be,followed by an inquiry in the hope of discovering something which might invalidate the finding.jurors would be harassed and beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.if evidence thus secured could be thus used,the result would be to make what was intended to be a private deliberation,the constant subject of public investigation to the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference.
at.in tanner,at,the court added 
allegation of juror misconduct,incompetency,or inattentiveness,raised for the first time days,weeks,or months after the verdict,seriously disrupt the finality of process moreover,full and frank discussion in the jury room,jurors willingness to return an unpopular verdict,and the community trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of postverdict scrutiny of juror conduct.
with this background in mind,we turn first to the affidavit of jewel hayes.as noted,hayes stated in her affidavit that she had encountered a juror in the lobby of the courthouse after the trial had ended and that the juror had stated that all niggers do is cause trouble and that hayes should go back to where she came from.hayes was not a juror,and although the habeas respondent hereinafter the commonwealth suggests that hayes evidence concerned the internal workings of the jury,appellee br.at,this is plainly not correct.the incident that hayes recounted occurred after the trial ended and in a public place no other jurors were alleged to have been present at the time and the offensive remarks did not concern discussions among the jurors or anything that any other juror had purportedly said or done.
no rational justification for the exclusion of this testimony was provided by the state courts or the district court,and none has been offered in this appeal.hayes testimony does not fall within the original version of the no impeachment rule.see vaise,eng.at the court can not receive such an affidavit from any of the jurymen themselves but in every such case the court must derive their knowledge from some other source such as from some person having seen the transaction through a window,or by some such other means.nor does hayes testimony fall within the version of the no impeachment rule adopted for use in pennsylvania or the federal courts.see commonwealth greevy,public policy forbids the examination of jurors,as to the reasons for their verdict emphasis added cluggage swan,binn,yeates,stating that the testimony of jurors ought not to be admitted to invalidate their verdicts emphasis added.evid.b.b.although williams relied on hayes affidavit in the pcra court,the superior court,the pennsylvania supreme court,and the district court,none of these courts explained why hayes evidence was inadmissible.
in defending the state courts treatment of this issue,the commonwealth notes without elaboration that williams did not present jewell sic hayes live testimony at the july,hearing,appellee br.at,but we can not affirm the decision of the district court on this ground.when a federal constitutional claim is rejected without explanation,we must presume that the decision was not based on a state procedural rule.coleman thompson,d.if the state courts had refused to consider the evidence in hayes affidavit on the ground that the defense failed to produce her live testimony at the pcra hearing,we would have to determine whether this was an adequate and independent state ground that precluded our consideration of the merits of the federal constitutional claim.but the state courts made no mention of any such procedural bar,and we must therefore proceed on the assumption that williams federal constitutional claim,insofar as it was based on hayes evidence,was rejected on the merits.
finally,the commonwealth brief argues that hayes evidence did not show that the juror in question lied during voir dire.appellee br.at.we would be presented with a different question in this appeal if the state courts had made a factual finding that hayes testimony was not credible or that the juror in question,despite the comment recounted by hayes,had answered the pertinent voir dire questions truthfully.in either of those circumstances,we would be compelled to decide whether the state courts findings were unreasonable in light of the state court record.d.but the state courts made no such findings.because they did not do so and also made no mention of a state procedural bar,we must assume that the state courts ruled either that hayes testimony was inadmissible or was insufficient,even if believed,to warrant relief.either holding would represent an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.on the facts presented to us,the failure to receive and consider hayes testimony for the purpose of determining whether a juror lied during voir dire can not be sustained under d.
we now consider montgomery evidence.montgomery made two allegations.first,she testified that,after the guilty verdicts were returned but before the jury sentenced the williams brothers to death,the jurors were told by an alternate that ronald williams had been convicted of two other offenses and that his brother was wanted in two other states.second,she stated in her second affidavit that,when she was juror,other jurors made remarks that suggested acute racial bias.app.we discuss each allegation separately.
with respect to the first allegation regarding the jury receipt of extraneous information after the guilty verdict was returned we see no ground for holding that williams is entitled to relief beyond that already awarded by the pennsylvania supreme court.there is no dispute that montgomery testimony about outside information received by the jury falls within the no impeachment rule exception.indeed,the court of common pleas twice permitted montgomery to testify about such extraneous influence,and the pennsylvania supreme court agreed that this testimony was admissible.see williams,at williams,at.however,because the jurors first received this information at the sentencing phase,the state supreme court held that the proper remedy was not a new trial but a reduction of the sentence to one of life imprisonment.williams,at williams,at citing.h.we see no basis for holding that anything more is required by the federal constitution.
we thus come to montgomery allegation that jurors made racially biased remarks at some point during the trial.williams first contends the state courts were obligated to consider montgomery testimony about these remarks because the no impeachment rule simply does not apply when a defendant seeks to introduce evidence to support a claim of juror misconduct committed during voir dire,appellant br.at,but this argument is plainly too broad.if it were correct,a party could call jury members to testify about statements made during actual jury deliberations so long as the purpose for introducing the evidence was to show that a juror had lied during voir dire.however,both the federal and the pennsylvania rules of evidence categorically bar juror testimony as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations even if the testimony is not offered to explore the jury process in reaching the verdict.indeed,rule b was amended during the legislative process precisely to make it clear that the rule means what its plain terms state in this regard.see tanner,at.although the question now before us is not whether montgomery testimony was prohibited by federal rule b since rule b did not govern the state proceedings or by the pennsylvania version of the no impeachment rule since the enforcement of a state rule is a matter for the state courts,the supreme court decision in tanner implies that the constitution does not require the admission of evidence that falls within rule b prohibition.see id.at.and in any event,tanner surely defeats any argument that it is clearly established in supreme court jurisprudence that the constitution mandates the admission of such evidence thus,if the juror statements to which montgomery referred occurred during jury deliberations,the state courts did not violate clearly established federal law in refusing to consider those statements.
but what if the statements were not made during jury deliberations as noted,montgomery second affidavit did not pin down exactly when or where the alleged statements were made,stating only that they took place when i was juror in the trial of commonwealth of pennsylvania ronald williams and raymond williams.suggesting that the comments did not occur during the deliberations,williams contends that the no impeachment rule does not apply to statements made by jurors before deliberations began and outside the jury room,appellant br.at,but this broad argument is wrong.in tanner,the court held that the no impeachment rule barred testimony about juror alcohol and drug use during the trial.at.the court did not accept justice marshall argument in dissent that the rule did not apply to juror conduct that occurred during the trial itself and not during the deliberations,id.at.marshall,dissenting,and the court rejected a rigid distinction based only on whether the event took place inside or outside the jury room.id.at.
but while we reject williams argument that location is dispositive,we recognize that a narrower argument could be made in support of the admission of the particular testimony in dispute here.specifically,if the other jurors alleged comments did not occur during deliberations and if montgomery testimony about those comments were received for the limited purpose of showing that jurors lied during voir dire,it could be argued that her testimony must be allowed by rule b because it would not concern either any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations or the effect of an
