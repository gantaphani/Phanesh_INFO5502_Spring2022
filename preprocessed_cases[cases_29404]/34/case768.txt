in this case,the department of homeland security dhs identified a computer in brooklyn,new york,that it believed was offering,on a network,electronic files that contained child pornography.dhs agents determined that the computer was subscribed to yuri bershchansky and they obtained a warrant to search what they apparently believed to be his residence.the agents searched bershchansky home,seized his computer equipment,and elicited a confession from him.bershchansky was later arrested and charged with one count of possessing child pornography in violation of a b and b.
the warrant authorized a search of apartment at the location where bershchansky lived,but the agents executed the warrant by searching apartment instead.bershchansky moved to suppress on the grounds that the agents exceeded the scope of the warrant when they searched an apartment other than the one approved by the magistrate judge.on july,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york matsumoto,granted the motion.the government appeals.we affirm.
background 
a.the investigation 
after two evidentiary hearings,the district court made detailed findings of fact.based on the district court findings and the record in the case,we summarize the facts as follows 
in november,an investigator in the homeland security investigations unit hsi of dhs identified a computer on a network that he believed was hosting digital files known to be associated with child pornography the computer was logged in from internet protocol address the ip address the investigator direct connected to the ip address and discovered numerous video and image files being offered for download,many of which contained titles indicative of child pornography.the investigator,using special software,downloaded these files.
special agent robert raab,a member of hsi child exploitation group,was assigned to investigate the ip address.he confirmed that the downloaded files contained images of child pornography.he also determined that the ip address was registered to cablevision,an internet service provider.he issued an administrative summons to cablevision,requesting the subscriber information associated with the ip address.cablevision informed raab that,during the relevant time period,the ip address was assigned to yuri bershchansky at address gerritsen av apt in brooklyn,new york.raab next contacted con edison,an electrical service provider,by telephone to confirm the subscriber information associated with the gerritsen avenue address provided by cablevision.raab testified that a con edison representative told him that the bill for apartment at gerritsen avenue in brooklyn was in bershchansky name.
next,raab,along with special agent steven cerutti,visited gerritsen avenue to confirm bershchansky residence.the building at gerritsen avenue is a dwelling with at least three apartments.two exterior doors face gerritsen avenue,with one on the left,slightly above street level,and the other on the right,slightly below street level.the apartment on the left is apartment and the apartment on the right is apartment raab and cerutti knocked on the door to the left apartment and a young woman,anna klishina,answered.the agents proceeded to ask her who lived in the apartment.anna answered that she lived there with her mother and stepfather.the agents next asked whether an individual named kim a fictitious name lived in the apartment to the right.raab and cerutti testified that they could not remember the exact words of anna response,but anna mother,svetlana klishina,overheard the conversation and testified that anna told the agents that kim did not live in that apartment,but rather,that a mother and her son lived there.when the agents initially went to the apartment on the left,they did not know who lived there,and they picked it just as a place to start.at.after speaking to anna,they did not rule out that bershchansky lived in the apartment with the klishina family.
b.the search warrant application 
on january,raab submitted a search warrant application for gerritsen avenue,apt,brooklyn.in his affidavit,raab described the premises to be searched as follows 
the subject premises is an apartment located within a red brick dwelling,which is attached on one side.the front of the dwelling has two exterior doors.the door to the left leads upstairs to apartment.the door to the right as you face the building leads to the subject premises.the door is brown and bears the number.
at.raab did not mention whether the door to the right was upstairs or downstairs.in his affidavit,he also summarized the steps hsi took in investigating the computer associated with the ip address.he repeatedly cited the ip address as the target of the investigation.he further outlined how he determined that the ip address was subscribed to yuri bershchansky of gerritsen avenue apartment,brooklyn,new york.specifically,raab represented that cablevision,con edison,and anna klishina confirmed that bershchansky lived in apartment.raab concluded that there was probable cause to believe that there is kept and concealed within the premises known and described as gerritsen avenue,apt,brooklyn,evidence or instrumentalities of sexually explicit material relating to children.at.
in fact,records from con edison obtained after the search warrant was issued indicated that bershchansky service address was gerritsen ave.the con edison records also indicated that gerritsen ave was assigned to svedlana klishina.the cablevision records obtained before the search indicated erroneously that bershchansky resided in apartment.
the magistrate judge azrack,reviewed the warrant application and raab supporting affidavit and issued the requested warrant authorizing the search of gerritsen avenue,apartment.thereafter,raab prepared and distributed an enforcement operation plan to apprise the search team of the place to be searched,the target of the investigation,and any potential safety hazards.the enforcement operation plan repeatedly identified gerritsen avenue,brooklyn,ny as the place to be searched and included no other physical descriptions of the residence.raab also held a briefing with the search team and circulated a copy of the search warrant.
c.the execution of the search warrant 
on january,approximately eight hsi agents including raab and cerutti assembled to execute the search warrant.upon arriving at gerritsen avenue,raab knocked on the door to the right,apartment.bershchansky mother answered and the agents informed her of the search warrant.raab and the other agents then entered the apartment to conduct the search,finding and seizing computer equipment,including a desktop computer and two external hard drives.photographs of the doors received into evidence at the suppression hearing show that both the outer and inner doors to the apartment to the left were clearly marked,and that the inner door to the apartment on the right the apartment that was searched was clearly marked.
bershchansky was present during the search and the agents proceeded to interview him.he admitted receiving and possessing child pornography.the government would later,through forensic review,determine the presence of more than electronic files containing child pornography in the seized computer equipment.on december,bershchansky was arrested and charged with possession of child pornography,in violation of.a b and b.
proceedings below 
on march,bershchansky moved to suppress the computer evidence and admissions in question.bershchansky argued,inter alia,that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause and that raab knowingly misled the magistrate judge by omitting material information in the warrant application.on may,the district court held a hearing on the motion and reserved judgment.on august,bershchansky filed a supplemental brief arguing that this court intervening decision in united states voustianiouk,cir,required suppression of the evidence.on december,the district court held a second evidentiary hearing.
on july,the district court issued a and memorandum and order,ordering the suppression of the evidence seized and statements made during the execution of the warrant.united states bershchansky,d.the district court concluded that the agents exceeded the scope of the search warrant by searching premises other than the one they were authorized to search,and it also determined that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply.hence,it suppressed the evidence.id.at.this appeal followed 
discussion 
we consider three areas of dispute a the standard of review b the scope of the search warrant and c the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
standard of review 
on appeal from a district court ruling on a motion to suppress evidence,we review legal conclusions de novo and findings of fact for clear error.united states freeman,cir.we also review de novo mixed questions of law and fact.id.citing united states lucky,cir.we pay special deference to the district court factual determinations going to witness credibility.united states jiau,cir.
bershchansky contends further that,as the prevailing party below,he is entitled to have the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to him.indeed,in a number of our decisions we have held that,when reviewing a district court decision on a motion to suppress,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,the defendant where the motion is granted.see,united states andino,cir united states murphy,cir united states jackson,cir united states oates,cir.the government,however,argues that where a defendant motion to suppress is granted,the evidence should be viewed in its favor even though it did not prevail below,and,to be sure,there is authority to support that proposition.see,united states barner,cir united states julius,cir in yet other decisions,we simply reviewed factual findings for clear error,without viewing the evidence in favor of either party,prevailing or not,and we reviewed conclusions of law and mixed questions of fact and law de novo.see,united states raymonda,cir jiau,at united states lopez,cir united states irving,cir.hence,we have taken three different approaches in reviewing decisions granting motions to suppress 
the government position that we should view the evidence in the light most favorable to it even when it is not the prevailing party does not make sense and we reject it.only a few of our decisions have held as such,the first of which was united states howard,cir.in howard,we reviewed a district court grant of a motion to suppress and held that we view the district court factual findings in the light most favorable to the government,even though the government was not the prevailing party.id.in support of this proposition,the howard panel cited united states casado,cir.in casado,however,we reviewed a district court denial of the defendant motion to suppress,and accordingly we viewed the evidence in the government favor.casado,at holding that,where district court denied motion to suppress,we view the district court factual findings in the light most favorable to the government howard inadvertent misapplication of casado spawned a pair of cases that diverged from our longstanding precedent.see barner,at citing howard and julius julius,at citing howard.we conclude that these decisions applied the incorrect standard in reviewing a district court grant of a motion to suppress,and that they are inconsistent with our precedent 
we think the better approach is to review the district court findings of fact for clear error without viewing the evidence in favor of either party,and to review its conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo,as we did in,raymonda,at jiau,at lopez,at and irving,at generally,our cases have applied the light most favorable standard in three situations review of a grant of a motion to dismiss under.b,where we assume the facts alleged in the complaint to be true and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff review of a grant of a motion for summary judgment under,where we resolve all factual disputes and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party and review of a general verdict rendered by a jury,which entitles the prevailing party to have the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom viewed in its favor.see patane clark,cir per curiam reviewing district court decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim kosmynka polaris,cir reviewing jury verdict island software computer,microsoft,cir reviewing district court grant of summary judgment.in the first two scenarios,the trial court has not made factual findings and the decision is based on one side factual assertions or evidence,and in the third scenario,the jury likewise has not made specific factual findings but has rendered only a general verdict.
where a district court has made factual findings and drawn reasonable inferences in granting or denying a motion to suppress,it does not make sense for us to view the evidence in favor of either side on appeal.indeed,it would be difficult to review a finding of fact for clear error while viewing the evidence underlying that fact in favor of either party.when reviewing for clear error,we may reverse only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,andino,at,and w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous,united states murphy,cir.a requirement that the evidence be viewed in favor of one side or the other would be at odds with the notion that deference must be given to the factfinder view of the evidence,and,for example,where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the less favorable of the two would not be clearly erroneous.
in the end,however,in this case we need not decide whether,when reviewing a district court factual findings on a motion to suppress,we should view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party or we should simply review for clear error without construing the evidence in favor of the prevailing party,for bershchansky would prevail under either standard of review.accordingly,while we reject the government position that the evidence should be viewed in its favor even though it did not prevail below,we need not decide between the two remaining views.
b.the scope of the search warrant 
applicable law 
the fourth amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.police officers must first obtain a warrant before they search a person home,unless exigent or other circumstances justify a warrantless search.andino,at.search warrant procedures are not mere formalities they protect against indiscriminate searches and seizures.payton new york,see also mcdonald united states.indeed,the fourth amendment requires that the search warrant describe with particularity the place to be searched and the items to be seized.kentucky king,accord united states clark,cir.this particularity requirement protects individuals from exploratory rummaging not supported by probable cause.united states galpin,cir quoting coolidge new hampshire,accord united states mccargo,cir.
in determining the permissible scope of a search that has been authorized by a search warrant we must look to the place that the magistrate judge who issued the warrant intended to be searched and not to the place that the police intended to search when they applied for the warrant.united states voustianiouk,cir.we look directly to the text of the search warrant to determine the permissible scope of an authorized search.see groh ramirez,the mere fact that the magistrate issued a warrant does not necessarily establish that he agreed that the scope of the search should be as broad as the affiant request.
ii.application 
it is apparent from the face of the warrant,as well as raab supporting affidavit,that the magistrate judge authorized the search of apartment and no other apartment.the finding of probable cause was predicated on evidence that child pornography was being made available on a computer with an ip address that raab believed was associated with a user in apartment.raab repeatedly referred to apartment in his affidav
