background 
nicholas lohman brought an action asserting numerous claims relating to his discharge from employment with duryea borough.only three first amendment retaliation claims survived summary judgment and proceeded to trial.defendants made three settlement offers after trial commenced,including one for.lohman rejected each of these offers.the jury found for lohman on one of the three claims,and awarded him in lost wages and nominal damages.lohman moved for attorney fees and costs of.
the district court granted the motion in part,awarding in attorney fees and in costs.the district court engaged in an extensive consideration of the lodestar,and a review of the twelve factors set forth in johnson georgia highway express,cir,and referenced by the supreme court in hensley eckerhart,d.the district court noted that in hensley,the supreme court stated that the most critical factor in determining a reasonable fee is the degree of success obtained.lohman borough of duryea.july,at quoting hensley,at.
the district court then proceeded to refer to case law that had been cited by the parties regarding the propriety of considering settlement negotiations in awarding fees,including alphonso pitney bowes,which was relied upon by lohman.in alphonso,defendants brought a motion for sanctions against a plaintiff,arguing that the plaintiff unsuccessful employment retaliation claims were frivolous.id.at.the plaintiff sought to undermine the defendants position by offering evidence that the defendants made a settlement offer on the eve of trial.id.at.the court disregarded the plaintiff argument,intimating that the use of settlement discussions to show the validity or invalidity of a claim would violate federal rule of evidence.id.
however,the district court here found another case,emi catalogue partnership,may,to be more relevant,and its logic more persuasive.in emi,the court referred to the language of rule and considered the precise issue before us in a copyright case.the court noted that a distinction should be drawn where 
evidence of the alleged settlement negotiations is not being offered to prove either liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.rather,it is being offered to show that the court rejection of the claim should not merit an award of attorney fees under the court power of equitable discretion 
id.at quoting.furthermore,the court noted,
because nothing in the language of rule requires exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations on issues other than liability for or invalidity of a claim or its amount,the court can consider evidence of settlement negotiations where,as here,that evidence is probative of the objective unreasonableness of the claim for purposes of determining whether to award attorney fees under the copyright act.
id.the district court here agreed,and concluded that evidence of settlement negotiations could be used as an indicator of the degree of success obtained by lohman counsel under.it stated,in so concluding the fact that plaintiff prevailed at trial may not be entirely indicative of counsel success.therefore,the court will consider the settlement negotiations in its determination of plaintiff attorney fee award.lohman,wl at internal citation omitted.
the court calculated a lodestar of,but concluded that the award should be reduced for limited success.in reasoning through this reduction,evidence of settlement negotiations between the parties was but one consideration 
in this case,the court finds that the lodestar,or the product of the reasonable rate times the reasonable hours,results in an excessive fee award.as per hensley,a court may consider other facts in determining an award.hensley,at.the degree of success obtained for pollick was not as great as she claims.of the six claims in the complaint,only the first amendment claims went to trial.of the claims that were presented to the jury,only one claim returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.
furthermore,the court notes that the plaintiff counsel may have achieved a much greater level of success if plaintiff had settled the case.a thousand dollar result in settlement is significantly greater than the,and five dollar result obtained at trial.plaintiff noted that she worked on a contingent fee basis.had plaintiff settled for the thousand dollars,counsel would only have been entitled to about thousand dollars,as contingent fee agreements often call for approximately percent.if she had a contingent fee agreement of,she would have received dollars.likewise,a contingent fee of the jury verdict would have yielded and sixty dollars and cents and,and dollars respectively.
plaintiff counsel argues that she achieved excellent results for her client,especially because this trial followed on the heels of another trial.the fact that this trial followed another is not relevant.while she focuses on the fact that she received a jury verdict in her favor,her client received a lesser result from trial than from settlement,and only prevailed on one claim.in this case,the results obtained at trial do not justify an award of over dollars as calculated by the lodestar,and surely does not justify the requested fees of over thousand dollars.
the johnson factors,other than the results obtained factor,also justify a reduced award.the skill requisite to perform the services was not particularly counsel often brings first amendment retaliation claims,and such a claim is not a new or novel issue of law.the claims were not particularly difficult counsel did not demonstrate any special ability in the prosecution of the case.the case can not be considered undesirable there is no evidence that lohman was unable to attract other attorneys to this case.these factors weigh in favor of a downward departure from the lodestar.
based upon the johnson factors,including the results obtained factor,the court finds that a downward departure of the lodestar is warranted,and plaintiff will be awarded a total of thirty thousand dollars in attorney fees.such an award is comparable to the award plaintiff counsel would have received had the plaintiff settled for the maximum settlement offer,and substantially greater than one she would have received under a normal contingent fee of the verdict.
lohman argues on appeal that the district court erred by using evidence from settlement negotiations to reduce the fee award.
ii.discussion 
in a civil rights action,a district court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.it is undisputed that lohman prevailed in his action,but the parties disagree as to whether the fee awarded was reasonable.we have jurisdiction to review a fee award under,once the award has been reduced to a definite amount.interfaith cmty.org.honeywell,cir.while we generally review fee awards for abuse of discretion,the issue as to what standards are to be applied in determining the fee involves a question of law,and our review of the issue before us is plenary.washington phila.county court of common pleas,cir.
we agree with the district court that rule does not bar a court consideration of settlement negotiations in its analysis of what constitutes a reasonable fee award in a particular case.by its terms,rule requires exclusion of evidence of such negotiations when offered to prove liability for,invalidity of,or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount,or to impeach through a prior inconsistent statement or contradiction.this was the case in alphonso,relied on by lohman in the distr
