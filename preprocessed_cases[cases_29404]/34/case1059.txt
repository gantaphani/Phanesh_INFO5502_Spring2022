sidi makadji petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or the agency,which affirmed the decision of the immigration judge ij denying his claims for political asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act.the ij denied asylum on the ground that,after makadji was forcibly deported from mauritania on account of race,he firmly resettled in mali.we hold that the ij erred by misplacing the burden of proof on makadji,and by finding makadji firmly resettled in mali without substantial evidence to support the finding.the ij denial of makadji withholding of removal claim was also in error,because the ij failed to shift the burden of proof to the government upon makadji showing of past persecution.we therefore vacate the agency decision and remand for rehearing.

during his time in mali,makadji did not obtain any official permission or recognition from the malian government.his father obtained for him a mauritanian card by bringing makadji birth certificate to the mauritanian embassy.according to makadji,his father obtained the card b ecause in mali we did not have mali documents so we need this identification card.before i go anywhere i could be recognized as mauritanian.id.at.in,makadji left mali using another person passport and traveled,via ghana,to the united states.as to why he left mali,he explained,it was not easy years for us because mali government did not have us,in fact,mali government was blaming the mauritanians there for all the problems they have,disease or if they lack they lacking they said is because of us so i have to leave there because things were getting bad for us.id.at.makadji parents and brother stayed in mali and remained there as of the hearing in this case.makadji testified that his family did not come to the united states because t hey do have the means to come here.it not easy to come.id.at.while in the united states,makadji has sent part of his earnings from working in a bakery home to his family.

ii.procedure 
in april,makadji filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat.at the hearing before the ij,makadji primary evidence was his testimony,summarized above a letter from his father dated november,saying,the malian government will not grant rights for us.they want us to repatriate to mauritania and the country report on human rights practices for,issued by the united states state department.the country report documents the the redistribution of land in mauritania from southerners and haratines to white moors and that some southerners had been expelled or fled from the country from to.country report,at.it adds that t he government continued to welcome the return of any citizens who had been expelled or who had fled from to,id.at,and that some of those returning to mauritania after the crisis were granted land rights,while others were not,id.at.it asserts,the government has stated since that any citizen outside the country may return,and returnees had been documented out of the roughly who were expelled during the crisis.id.at.
although finding makadji testimony credible,the ij denied makadji petition,concluding that the malian government implicitly offered permanent resettlement to makadji and his family,which made makadji ineligible for asylum.in support of this finding,the ij emphasized that makadji resided in mali for ten years his family remained in mali makadji offered no evidence to establish that the malian government engaged in wholesale repatriation of mauritanians or intended to deport him or his family to mauritania,or that his parents are living a surreptitious existence in mali makadji worked odd jobs in mali and makadji father obtained for him a mauritanian card,the purpose of which was to proclaim that he was a mauritanian citizen while living in mali.
the ij also denied makadji claim for withholding of removal,because makadji has not established that it is clearly probable that he will be harmed if he returns to mauritania.the ij characterized makadji beating and deportation from mauritania as past persecution,but found essentially that makadji failed to establish that circumstances had not changed in mauritania since.the ij relied heavily on the country report in finding that mauritania had admitted many returnees who were persecuted in upon these findings,the ij ordered makadji removal.on makadji appeal,the bia affirmed the decision of the ij without discussion.
discussion 
resettlement 
as noted above,the ij denied makadji application for asylum premised on likelihood of persecution in mauritania,concluding that makadji was ineligible for asylum because he had been offered permanent resettlement in mali and was firmly resettled there.in our view this ruling was flawed and requires that we remand the case for two related reasons first,the ij erroneously placed the burden of proof regarding the question of resettlement on makadji.second,the ij conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.ins,cir a finding will stand if it is supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.quotation marks omitted.
an alien seeking asylum in the united states by reason of persecution in his homeland is ineligible for this relief if he firmly resettled in another country prior to arriving in the united states.see b a vi c.courts have explai
