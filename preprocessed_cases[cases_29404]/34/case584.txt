the complicated journey of this criminal case began with the indictment of ducan fanfan in on one count of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine in violation of a,b b.in a trial conducted in october,a jury convicted fanfan,who was thereafter sentenced by the trial judge in june to months in prison.
the sentence was well under the guideline level for the amount of drugs attributed to fanfan because the district judge,acting in the period before united states booker,d,deemed himself limited by blakely washington,d,to the gram figure contained in the indictment and the jury verdict.on the government appeal,the supreme court reviewed the district court decision,and in concert with its booker decision,the court then remanded fanfan case for resentencing.booker,at.
the district judge resentenced fanfan in may to months in prison,treating the guidelines as advisory but ultimately sentencing fanfan within the guideline range that the court found applicable.fanfan now appeals,arguing that both his conviction and the resentencing were flawed.we begin with challenges to the conviction,then move to the sentence.
fanfan principal claim of error addressed to his conviction is that certain evidence should not have been admitted.the contested evidence includes both statements of and actions of fanfan occurring after the main but not fanfan himself had been arrested.to understand the evidence and its role requires considerable background.
the indictment against fanfan charged him with conspiring from september to april.the included vaughan smith,joe ash,and donovan thomas,all of whom testified for the government as part of plea agreements.with corroborating detail,thomas testified that starting in the summer of he regularly purchased cocaine from fanfan,who was based in massachusetts,and supplied it to ash.ash testified that he supplied it to smith,who was based in maine.ash also testified that his sister and girlfriend sometimes made from thomas.
both smith and ash described their own roles and actions in terms consistent with thomas testimony,but neither of them dealt directly with fanfan or could testify to his role.the closest connection ash had to fanfan was when thomas told ash that his man had a car to sell.ash gave thomas cash for the vehicle.fanfan accompanied thomas when thomas delivered the lexus to ash,and ash identified fanfan at the trial as the man from whom he purchased the car.
in late march,agents arrested smith,finding money and drugs in his home,and on april,smith arranged a controlled purchase from ash,who was in turn arrested the next day with drugs.thomas was arrested later that same day when he traveled to maine to collect payment from ash.at trial the government was prepared to treat thomas arrest as terminating the conspiracy.this is not necessarily so but,given the concession,we follow the district court in treating what happened after thomas arrest as events.
under arrest,thomas made statements to the police identifying fanfan and admitting that he had been distributing drugs for fanfan since the summer of.thomas then paged fanfan,with the government recording the call,and ordered a kilogram of cocaine and four and a half ounces of crack cocaine.thereafter,thomas met fanfan by prearrangement fanfan was arrested,and police seized from his car kilograms of cocaine and grams of cocaine base.
at trial,thomas testified to the events just described and tapes were played of the conversations between thomas and fanfan recording the ordering of the drugs and the rendezvous arrangements between the two of them.the government also offered the seized drugs in evidence.the district court admitted all of the evidence but with a limiting instruction as to statements made by thomas after his arrest.
in substance,the district court told the jury that anything said by thomas,out of court and after his arrest,could not be considered for its truth but only to provide context for the jury understanding of fanfan statements and actions fanfan own statements,of course,were party admissions not subject to a hearsay objection,but the communications between thomas and fanfan were cryptic,as is commonly the case in drug dealing.the district court also told the jury not to consider the evidence of events occurring as evidence of any other crime,but only as evidence to prove the charged conspiracy.
fanfan first argues that the evidence of a major drug transaction after the charged conspiracy had ended was bad act evidence of conduct not itself part of the charged crime.such evidence is not admissible to show criminal propensity and must have some other legitimate purpose such as showing identity or plan.b and,in addition,the evidence must be excluded if unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence.
we will assume that these objections were properly preserved,as it does not affect the outcome.the evidence of this final transaction was undoubtedly potent although thomas own testimony of his drug dealing with fanfan amply supported fanfan conviction,thomas was the only one who could squarely identify fanfan as the man who supplied the rest of the chain.and since thomas had a plea deal with the government and a prior record,his testimony was subject to impeachment.the final,transaction,in which fanfan was seized with drugs corresponding to thomas order,not only bore out thomas earlier testimony but provided vivid evidence of fanfan criminal endeavor.
however,this final transaction was not just some random drug crime by fanfan from which could be inferred a propensity on his part to commit drug crimes and from which,in turn,a jury could infer that he engaged in the earlier conspiracy charged in this case.here,the crime was close in time to the conspiracy as described by thomas the procedure used to contact fanfan and order the drugs corresponded to thomas description of the conspiracy and fanfan appearance at the rendezvous with the drugs order completed the equation.
thus,even if not part of the conspiracy because unknown to fanfan the conspiracy had ended,the final transaction evidenced the modus operandi by which the conspiracy was carried out,which in turn answered the question of the identity of the lead purpose for which bad act evidence is allowed.b.the case law in this circuit and elsewhere supports the view that modus operandi evidence can be admitted to prove identity,despite fanfan attempt to distinguish some of the cases on their facts 
as for rule,the disputed evidence was highly probative.the final transaction was an integral part of a prior pattern of behavior described by thomas and,but for his arrest,would have been part of the conspiracy between fanfan and others in the chain.it was not inflammatory a vivid depiction mirroring prior events to which thomas could properly testify.see united states procopio,cir.the risk that the jury would overvalue or misuse the evidence was minimal.
both the rule and the rule issues,as presented in this case,involved judgment calls as to the application of clear rules to clear facts.on such judgments,the district judge enjoys considerable latitude and will be overturned only for abuse of discretion.trenkler,at.in this case,the district court was not only within its discretion but also clearly right in admitting the evidence.
turning to a related but different claim of error,fanfan argues that the limiting instruction as to the use of this bad act evidence was insufficient.the judge did caution the jury that it could consider the transaction only to assist it in deciding whether the conspiracy had occurred and that it could convict only for the conspiracy charged in the indictment and not for any other crime.fanfan says that the jury should also have been told not to draw the propensity inference.
so far as we can tell,fanfan made no request for such an instruction while fanfan maintains that he objected to the instruction,the government disagrees and we search in vain for evidence in the transcript of an objection.that is hardly surprising many defense lawyers would shrink from an instruction that the jury should not count fa
