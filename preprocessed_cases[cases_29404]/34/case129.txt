this appeal links the stories of defendant evgueni tetioukhine,a native of russia,and fionghal solomon maceoghan,the man whose name,identifying information,and life history tetioukhine assumed for over twenty years.once tetioukhine appropriation of maceoghan identity was eventually discovered by law enforcement officials,he was charged in a indictment with,inter alia,wire fraud,providing false information to obtain federal financial aid,making false statements in an application for a passport,and aggravated identity theft.
at trial,tetioukhine claimed that he lacked the requisite intent to be guilty of misappropriating maceoghan identity.although the defense itself was not unique,his story was.tetioukhine testified to his belief that he had been lawfully adopted by maceoghan biological father,laurence albert mccoon.as a result,tetioukhine said,he genuinely thought he had taken on maceoghan identity through legitimate means and had the right to use maceoghan identifying information as his own.
the jury rejected this defense and found tetioukhine guilty.on appeal,he challenges two of the district court evidentiary rulings first,the exclusion of a proposed expert witness in soviet adoption practices and cultural differences between the former soviet union and the united states,and second,the admission of evidence pertaining to his larceny conviction.discerning no error,we affirm.
fionghal solomon maceoghan and evgueni tetioukhine 
we briefly summarize the following facts,drawn from the trial testimony and documentary evidence.in,fionghal maceoghan was born in dublin,ireland,to laurence albert mccoon a citizen,and rosamond decoursey ireland.although maceoghan lived in ireland for most of his life,he claimed citizenship through his father.
mccoon lived with his wife and son for a time,but then left the family when maceoghan was about three or four years old.mccoon later returned to ireland and reunited with the family when maceoghan was about ten or eleven,and all three of them moved to the united states together.maceoghan and his parents lived in englewood,california,and also spent time in minnesota.at some point during maceoghan childhood,mccoon applied for and obtained a social security card on his behalf.
mccoon and decoursey ireland eventually separated,and mother and son returned to ireland.mccoon had only limited contact with them for the remainder of maceoghan childhood.the last time maceoghan had seen his father was circa.maceoghan had never met tetioukhine,or visited rhode island until he arrived there to testify at the trial.
one night,to amuse himself during a boring evening,maceoghan entered his last name into facebook search engine,which returned the profile of a person named olesya maceoghan.this name caught maceoghan attention because the spelling of his surname was unusual,and he wondered if olesya was a half sister or distant relative.maceoghan contacted her via facebook,and discovered that she lived in rhode island and was married to a man who also called himself fionghal solomon maceoghan.this revelation initiated a chain of events that eventually uncovered the following facts.
in,tetioukhine was born in the former soviet union,in an area that is now part of russia.tetioukhine arrived in the united states in june on a temporary visa,which permitted him to stay in the country until october of that same year.tetioukhine,however,did not leave the country on his appointed date.instead,on october,the day after his deadline for departing the united states,he obtained a rhode island identification card in the name of fionghal maceoghan,after presenting a birth certificate and social security card with maceoghan identifying details.tetioukhine then used the name to procure a replacement social security card,stating on the application that he was born in ireland,that he was a citizen by birth,and that mccoon was his father.on an application for a passport filed in,tetioukhine once again used maceoghan identifying information,and further stated that as a child,he had once possessed a passport that he had since misplaced.tetioukhine also used the identity to obtain a mortgage loan and a rhode island driver license.
in january,tetioukhine applied for a federal student loan of about,in order to attend a rhode island university.the school asked tetioukhine to explain why he had not registered with the selective service,which for certain individuals was a prerequisite to receiving federal financial aid.tetioukhine responded that while he was a citizen by birth,he had been born in ireland and lived in ireland and the united kingdom for most of his life.he also stated that he had only arrived in the united states in march.
in his defense at trial,tetioukhine explained that not long after arriving in the united states,he met and befriended mccoon while they were both staying at a chabad house a jewish community center in rhode island.after learning of tetioukhine interest in staying in the country,mccoon offered to adopt him.as part of that process,mccoon brought him a social security card bearing maceoghan name.although the parties now agree that mccoon never actually adopted tetioukhine,the latter trusted that this purported adoption was legitimate.he also testified that in the soviet union,adoptees regularly changed their names,birth dates,and other identifiers as part of the adoption process.he thus believed that he had the right to take on maceoghan identifying information as his own.
tetioukhine expert testimony proffer 
before trial,tetioukhine informed the government that he intended to call an expert witness,sergei khrushchev,in his defense.khrushchev is the son of former soviet premier nikita khrushchev.at the time of trial,the younger khrushchev was a senior fellow at the watson institute for international studies at brown university in providence,rhode island.
tetioukhine provided the government with initial information regarding khrushchev via a letter dated july.this missive stated that khrushchev would testify about the cultural and political experience of soviet citizens in as well as the experience of russian jews in the soviet union as well as in the united states at the time of tetioukhine arrival.khrushchev attached curriculum vitae addressed his knowledge of russian economic and political reforms and us soviet relations.in early august,tetioukhine supplemented this disclosure with a brief letter that identified three broad subjects of khrushchev proposed testimony adoption practices in the soviet union the experience of a russian jewish immigrant to rhode island in the and late soviet era american propaganda,which would show that russians believed that coming to the united states was a very simple process and that centralized government and bureaucracy was extremely limited.
the government sought to preclude khrushchev testimony.the district court held a hearing on august,where it asked tetioukhine to make an oral offer of proof regarding the specific testimony he intended to elicit from khrushchev.defense counsel noted that khrushchev was present at the hearing and offered to have him testify,but the trial judge reiterated that counsel should make an oral proffer.
the proffer that followed focused heavily on khrushchev expertise in the differences between soviet and russian culture and the culture of the united states,and how these differences might impact the decision making of leaders and of individuals.counsel also discussed,inter alia,khrushchev knowledge of propaganda that had circulated in the soviet union,which portrayed the united states as a society with little or no bureaucracy and a very free country where foreigners were welcome.tetioukhine counsel suggested that this perception would buttress the legitimacy of tetioukhine subjective belief in his adoption.
at the hearing conclusion,the court excluded khrushchev testimony on the basis that it lacked relevance,would not be helpful to the jury,and would confuse and obfuscate the real issues.
c.the trial and tetioukhine impeachment 
for its part,the government informed the court and defense counsel before trial that if tetioukhine took the stand on his own behalf,the government would impeach his testimony with his conviction for larceny in a building.see.laws ch.the conviction arose from tetioukhine theft of multiple pieces of gold over several months from his,a jewelry company.prior to trial,defendant moved to exclude this testimony.the court deferred ruling on this motion until trial.
at trial,tetioukhine took the stand in his own defense.he portrayed himself as a dutiful,gainfully employed person whose assumption of maceoghan identity was consistent with his desire to follow the law.when the subject of tetioukhine prior employment at the jewelry company arose,he stated that he had worked there for four or five months,and that he had left that job and eventually found another position.he did not mention the reason for his departure from the jewelry company.tetioukhine also testified regarding other jobs he had held during his years in the country.
after this testimony,the government argued tetioukhine had opened the door to admitting his prior conviction by leaving the inference that he is a citizen with a solid employment history who follow ed the law and pa id his taxes.although the court did not agree that the door had been opened to the conviction itself,it permitted a limited line of questioning regarding the circumstances of tetioukhine departure from his former employer.
when the government resumed questioning and asked tetioukhine about the incident,he testified that he had only stolen a tiny piece of gold.the government challenged this assertion,and tetioukhine responded by minimizing the seriousness of his thefts.for example,tetioukhine testified that t his never went to court they promised me to basically drop the case or something like that,and that was the story.the court ruled that tetioukhine had now made the conviction itself admissible.the government then asked tetioukhine whether he had pleaded guilty to larceny in,and defendant admitted that he had.
at the trial conclusion,tetioukhine was found guilty of eight counts of the indictment,one of the aggravated identity theft counts having been dismissed before trial on the government motion.after the jury rendered its verdict,the court later dismissed another of the aggravated identity theft counts.the court then sentenced tetiouhkine to months in prison.tetiouhkine filed a timely appeal of the judgment of guilt on the remaining seven counts.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see united states chiaradio,cir united states landry,cir.we do not substitute our views for those of the district court.instead,we defer to the trial judge sound judgment,vacating only when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.united states nguyen,cir quoting united states roberts,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the exclusion of khrushchev testimony 
federal rule of evidence provides that a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify in the form of an opinion if his scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.a.this evidence,even if it passes the requirements of rule,remains subject to rule balancing test.see united states pires,cir see also.permitting court to exclude relevant testimony if probative value is substantially outweighed by danger of,inter alia,unfair prejudice,confusion,or misleading jury.
the proponent of the evidence bears the burden of demonstrating its admissibility.see harrison sears,roebuck,cir.accordingly,the proponent must explain to the trial judge why the expert testimony meets the requirements of rule,so that the court can make an appropriate assessment of its admissibility.see united states downing,cir holding that a defendant who seeks the admission of expert testimony must make an detailed proffer to the court,including an explanation of precisely how the expert testimony is relevant to the issues in dispute.
tetioukhine sole defense was that he lacked the requisite intent to be guilty of misappropriating maceoghan identity.to advance this defense,he testified to his belief that mccoon had legally adopted him and that he was unaware of the true fionghal maceoghan existence.under these circumstances,he genuinely believed that the purported adoption lawfully permitted him to take on a name,birth date,and background different from those related to his own birth,and that he was therefore telling the truth as he knew it when he represented himself as maceoghan to the world.
recognizing that this theory might seem implausible to a jury,tetioukhine argued to the court that khrushchev cultural context testimony would have shown that his beliefs were subjectively reasonable.we take this assertion to mean that a reasonable person who shared his nationality and cultural background would have also shared his view of his adoption accepting,for the purposes of evaluating his evidentiary claim,that tetioukhine subjectively reasonable beliefs would have been probative of his lack of the requisite intent,we note that defendant initial written disclosures did little to elucidate the link between tetioukhine defense and khrushchev subjects of expertise.the supplemental letter sent in august contained more specifics regarding khrushchev proposed testimony.once again,however,its broad statements regarding american propaganda in the former soviet union and the experience of a russian jewish immigrant to rhode island bore only a slender connection to the key disputes in the case.
of course,the relevance of expert testimony regarding cultural matters is and must be assessed on a basis.the one grain of relevance we perceive in khrushchev proposed testimony concerned russian adoption law,custom,and practice.testimony about this subject might have buttressed tetioukhine purported belief that,once adopted by mccoon,he could lawfully use maceoghan identifying information as his own.
given the vagueness of defendant pretrial disclosures,tetioukhine oral proffer afforded him a critical opportunity to focus on this aspect of khrushchev proposed testimony.instead,the oral proffer was larded with the same general references to cultural differences described in the written disclosures.counsel attempts to explain the significance of american propaganda available to people in the soviet union,and the supposed perception of the friendly and welcoming nature of american society,often devolved into unhelpful abstractions that failed to build the crucial bridge to the issue of tetioukhine intent.
the following exchange was emblematic of the proffer murkiness 
mcelroy your honor,khrushchev can also testify about the expectations that he had as an individual,but also the differences 
the court that who had 
mcelroy that professor khrushchev had,the differences between the culture that he experienced in the soviet union and the culture that he experienced when he came here and his education in both of those cultures both before and since his emigration to the united states and how those cultures work differently.
the court specifically 
mcelroy specifically that some of the propaganda was that america was a society with little or no bureaucracy that america was a free country where foreigners were welcome at all you know,always welcome that particularly jews were welcome in the united states.
as the district court correctly noted,russian culture is a very broad topic with little evident probative value,and counsel statements regarding the different workings of the two cultures and the soviet perception that america was a free country did little to establish the relevance and helpfulness of khrushchev testimony.thus,based on the information presented,the district court was within its discretion to conclude that khrushchev proposed testimony was largely irrelevant and unhelpful.united states sebaggala,cir concluding that trial judge did not abuse discretio
