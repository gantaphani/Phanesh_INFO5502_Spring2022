on july,wood filed a motion seeking clarification of paragraph h of the standing order or,in the alternative,seeking leave to substantively communicate ex parte with saleh.a united states magistrate denied wood request to substantively communicate ex parte on the basis that paragraph h prohibited such communications without leave of court and wood failed to show circumstances justifying overriding the dictates of paragraph h.consequently,although the magistrate judge permitted wood to discuss substantive matters concerning the commitment hearing with saleh,such discussions were required to be in the presence of counsel for the government.
wood appealed this ruling to the district court,contending that the magistrate judge ruling deprived him of his due process rights.in particular,wood contended that he had a right to have an expert examine him,testify on his behalf,and consult with his attorney.the district court affirmed the magistrate judge ruling,concluding that the magistrate judge correctly interpreted the standing order and that the standing order was consistent with the act.
on july,the district court held a civil commitment hearing.wood conceded the first prong under the act,which called for the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that wood had previously engaged in or attempted to engage in sexually violent acts or child molestation.at the hearing,tanya cunic cunic,hoberman,saleh,and eva toney,wood sister,testified 
cunic testified that she was a forensic psychologist at fcc butner in butner,north carolina.cunic performed a forensic evaluation of wood.cunic performed her evaluation pursuant to a referral from the sex offender certification review branch.cunic testified that wood did not submit to a clinical interview and she performed a record review.
cunic testified that she diagnosed wood with two serious mental disorders pedophilia,sexually attracted to females,non exclusive type,based on wood history and pattern of offending and personality disorder,not otherwise specified with antisocial traits,based on wood history of volatile interpersonal relationships,assaults,unstable employment,and frequent contacts with law enforcement.cunic further testified that,based on wood serious mental disorders and dynamic risk factors,he would have serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation.
hoberman testified that he diagnosed wood with two serious mental disorders pedophilia,sexually attracted to females and antisocial personality disorder.hoberman also testified that he believed that wood would have serious difficulty in refraining from future acts of child molestation if released,based on wood serious mental disorders,admissions during psychological testing,and a risk assessment hoberman performed.
saleh testified that there was no evidence that wood suffered from pedophilia.likewise,saleh testified that wood did not suffer from antisocial personality disorder.saleh testified that he did diagnose wood with personality disorder not otherwise specified but that there was no link in wood case between the disorder and sexual reoffending.saleh further testified that,if the district court found wood suffered from a serious mental disorder,he believed wood would not have serious difficulty in refraining from engaging in child molestation.
on september,the district court issued its civil commitment order.the district court first summarized wood offense history.the district court then turned to the three elements required for civil commitment under the act.with regard to the first element,the district court found that the government had proved that wood had previously engaged in child molestation based on wood conviction for sexual abuse in the second degree.
with regard to the second element,the district court found that wood suffered from pedophilia,a serious mental disorder.the district court credited the opinions of cunic and hoberman over the opinion of saleh.the district court held that it did not ascribe much weight to the uncharged sexual misconduct.the district court found,however,that when combined with the charge,the uncharged sexual misconduct was entitled to significant weight.the district court arrived at this conclusion after it credited hoberman and cunic explanation of its relevance.
the district court also found that wood suffered from another serious mental disorder,that is,personality disorder,not otherwise specified with antisocial traits.according to the district court,this finding was supported by the psychological testing performed by hoberman.the district court further noted that wood 
has failed to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as evidenced by his extensive nonsexual criminal history.wood has acted impulsively in the past and has also demonstrated aggressiveness,as indicated by his multiple convictions for assault wood has continued his irresponsible behavior while in federal custody,incurring various disciplinary infractions for conduct such a fighting with another person in,and making,possessing,or using intoxicants on more than one occasion in.

with regard to the third element,the district court found that wood would have serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation if released.in so finding,the district court credited the opinions of cunic and hoberman over the opinion of saleh.
wood argues that the standing order violates his due process rights.we review the district court ruling on a constitutional challenge to a federal statute de novo.united states timms,cir.
the gist of wood argument is that the standing order is fundamentally unfair because it prohibits him from having substantive ex parte communications with his selected additional examiner,saleh.in wood view,such a prohibition is inherently unfair because the government is not prevented from having substantive ex parte communications with its bop experts.to ensure fundamental fairness,wood insists that he is entitled to have substantive ex parte communications with his selected examiner.
in response,the government contends that wood received a fair hearing and,therefore,his due process rights were not infringed.the government points out that the standing order permits representation by counsel,and allows a defendant to testify at the hearing,present evidence,subpoena witnesses,and confront and witnesses.the government further points out that the standing order permits the defendant to move,pursuant to rule b d,for a examiner,who can examine the defendant and discuss ex parte the strengths and weaknesses of the defendant case with counsel,thereby assisting the defendant in developing his defense.finally,the government points out the standing order ensure s that the district court as the receives only unvarnished and neutral information from the testifying experts.appellee br.at.

the constitutional rights to which a defendant in a criminal trial is entitled do not adhere to a respondent in a commitment hearing.nonetheless,because an adverse result in a commitment hearing results in a substantial curtailing of the respondent liberty whether the respondent is already a prisoner or not,the supreme court has held that procedural due process does guarantee certain protections to civil commitment respondents.
we also noted in baker that the supreme court in vitek outlined the following minimum safeguards to which due process guarantees a defendant in a civil commitment proceeding 
a hearing at which evidence is presented and the respondent is provided a chance to be heard and to present documentary evidence as well as witnesses the right to confront and to government witnesses at the hearing,except upon a showing of good cause an indep
