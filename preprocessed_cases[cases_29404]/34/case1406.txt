david diguglielmo,the district attorney of the county of philadelphia,and the attorney general of the state of pennsylvania the commonwealth appeal from the order granting habeas corpus relief to state prisoner jose medina pursuant to a.
medina was convicted in a commonwealth court of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.in ruling on his federal habeas corpus petition,the district court concluded that medina trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because he failed to object to the competency of a old witness.the district court concluded that the state court decision upholding medina conviction was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
the commonwealth contends that the district court erred in concluding that every reasonable attorney would have challenged marcos toro competency at trial.it also maintains that medina was not prejudiced by counsel decision not to challenge marcos competency.we will reverse the district court order because medina has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to object to marcos toro competency.
at the preliminary hearing in this matter,marcos toro testified that during the evening of october,he and his old brother hector encountered medina in a chinese store at cambria street and mascher street in philadelphia.medina was known as harry.both boys were familiar with medina because he was a friend of their older brother.they saw him on a daily basis.marcos toro had known medina since he was five years old.
medina showed the boys a rambo knife.hector testified that medina was drunk and he said today i am going to kill somebody with this knife.the boys then left the chinese store and went to their home,which was one block away.a short time later,marcos toro heard medina shouting that he was owed forty dollars.marcos toro testified that he saw medina stab william bogan in the heart with the same knife he had seen earlier.
on,however,marcos toro testified that he did not see medina stab bogan.instead,he stated that his brother told him he saw the assault.on redirect examination,assistant district attorney ada ann ponterio questioned marcus toro as follows 
before we came in here today,the defendant sister and mother came up to speak to you right 
and they made you nervous,did they witness shakes head 
q.did you tell me they scared you 
q.they are here in the courtroom and they are staring in your direction from the back row.
are sic do they make you nervous now that you are binding your hands 
witness shakes head 
ada ponterio indicate nodding his head up and down.
following this colloquy,judge charles margiotti ordered the removal of medina family from the courtroom.after the family was removed,ada ponterio continued her redirect examination.in response to her questions,marcos toro testified that he saw medina stab bogan once and then dig through his pockets.
on,defense counsel,robert silverstein,asked marcos toro whether he saw medina stab bogan.marcos toro replied yes.
ada ponterio then questioned marcos toro as follows 
now,is what you are telling the judge the truth 
do you know the difference between the truth and a lie 
before the witness could answer the question,judge margiotti stated i am satisfied he is precocious.he is a very bright boy.
silverstein did not move for a competency hearing based on marcos toro age,or his inconsistent responses to the questions posed during direct and,nor did he object to judge margiotti sua sponte finding that marcos toro was precocious.judge margiotti determined that the commonwealth had presented a prima facie case.he ordered that medina be held for trial.
medina was represented at his trial by edward daly.judge juanita kidd stout presided over the trial.before the jury was sworn in,assistant district attorney carol sweeney informed the court in an conference as follows 
today,he and his brother hector,michael now being,hector now being,were sitting in the anteroom looking,in my opinion,somewhat nervous about testifying as you might expect from children,but composed and under control until the defendant family arrived and when his mother,meaning the defendant mother,walked by and sat in the courtroom and the defendant sister and when the defendant brother,i believe it is his brother,a young man about the same age began milling around in the area outside the anteroom.
michael toro began to cry,and really lost his composure and said he was very nervous about testifying.the impression i got from the police that is,what i was supposedly told by the police and the officers are right here to relate to it,that is he is afraid to testify,his family fears some kind of retaliation.i am not saying they were justified in fearing that.i am not asking for any instruction.there has been no problem,but i ask you,during michael testimony and possibly during hector,although hector was not an emotional person,michael was,to ask the defendant family to remain outside.
judge stout asked daly if he had seen marcos toro cry.daly replied i saw the child cry this morning.daly stated further that he had no objection to excluding medina family.he also noted that they would be sequestered anyway because they would be testifying during the trial.judge stout granted the motion.
ada sweeney began her direct examination of marcos toro by questioning him about his age and whether he knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie as follows 
q.how old are you 
q.what grade are you in 
q.you are in the fifth grade.is that right 
do you know what it means to tell the truth 
q.what does it mean 
no response.
let me ask it the other way.do you know what it means to tell a lie 
do you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie 
q.you just told the jury and the judge when you put your hand on the bible you were going to tell the truth 
q.what does the truth mean 
the court first of all,let sit up straight and take your hand down.what happens to you if you tell a lie

q.what about when you tell the truth if you tell the truth,is that a good thing to do

the witness yes.
by sweeney 
q.we want you to tell the truth about what you may have seen and heard about a year ago involving the white dude.do you know what i am talking about 
daly i object to the leading nature of the question.
the court overruled.
you do know what she is talking about 
the witness no.
the court all right.
after hearing the testimony quoted above,daly did not object on competency grounds.ada sweeney proceeded with her direct examination.marcos toro testified that he saw medina in a chinese store.he stated he had known medina since he was five years old.he had seen medina every day in the neighborhood.when asked to tell the jury w hat happened after medina entered the store,marcos toro did not answer.ada sweeney then requested a sidebar conference,which was granted.she informed judge stout that ada ponterio had handled the preliminary hearing and knew the witness better than she did.ada sweeney requested that ada ponterio question marcos toro.judge stout replied if he testified at the preliminary hearing and you have the notes i think he can be declared an unavailable witness.daly objected to permitting a second lawyer to continue the direct examination of marcos toro.ada sweeney then requested the court permission to seat ada ponterio at counsel table.judge stout inquired whether the prosecutor could put on another witness.ada sweeney replied he wo be any better tomorrow.judge stout permitted ada ponterio to sit at counsel table.
ada then resumed her examination.marcos toro testified that medina showed him and hector toro a rambo knife.after leaving the chinese store,marcos toro went home.he testified that he saw medina stab a white man in the chest.he also testified that he did not see anyone go over to the white man after he fell down.
when ada sweeney showed marcos toro a copy of his interview with the police,she was asked if he could read.marcos toro did not reply.when marcos toro was asked if he signed the statement,he replied that he signed his name on every page.ada sweeney asked marcos toro to read the statement.judge stout then declared a recess.
after the jury left the courtroom,ada sweeney asked marcos toro if he was okay.the witness shook his head and went to the men room.ada sweeney asked a police officer to go into the men room and then report on marcos toro status.
judge stout stated that she had asked a court attache to try to get a doctor to examine marcos toro,but none was available.judge stout then directed that be called.judge stout reconvened the trial after minutes.
marcos toro testified that he heard the white man state i will pay you tomorrow.i will pay you tomorrow.after the white man fell on the ground,the witness saw medina digging in the victim pockets.
daly of marcos toro consisted primarily of reading marcos toro inconsistent testimony at the preliminary hearing,as demonstrated by the following 
do you remember this question in fact,you did see harry stab the guy.did you do you remember that question 
your answer my brother did.do you remember that answer 
do you remember this question your brother did and you were only telling us what your brother told you is that right and your answer yes.the answer is.
do you remember that question and that answer yes.
do you remember this question and you did eyewitness harry do anything.right am i correct you have to say yes or no.and your answer yes.
and you only assumed that because you saw the knife at the restaurant.is that right 
and you answered.
later,in his,daly asked marcos toro the following questions 
and when silverstein asked you that question,remember we went over here,when he asked you,you only assumed that because you saw the knife in the restaurant.is that right 
and when he asked you the question,everything you said about harry stabbing the white dude is either something that your brother told you or you made up because you figured he did it because he had a knife.right 
q.when he asked you that question,you were telling the truth.were you 
and it is not your intention,never was,to tell a lie.was it 
and you believed at the time you were talking to the police that you were helping them 
and what you told the defense attorney at the time was the truth.was it 
q.you thought from seeing the knife earlier that harry must have down sic it 
q.as you told the defense attorney,in fact,you did see it.did you 
on redirect examination,ada sweeney questioned marcos toro in the following manner 
q.did you make this up 
q.did you see this stabbing 
q.who stabbed the white dude 
daly did ask any further questions,nor did he request that the court determine whether marcos toro testimony should be excluded because he was not a competent witness.
medina was found guilty of first degree murder,robbery,and possessing instruments of crime in connection with the death of bogan.the jury deadlocked during the penalty phase.judge stout sentenced medina to life imprisonment.
on his direct appeal before the pennsylvania superior court,medina argued 
the trial court erred by permitting the testimony of two boys his counsel rendered ineffective assistance because he did not seek a determination of the boys competency to testify and did not object to their competency during the trial and the evidence was insufficient and the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.
commonwealth medina,slip op.at.the superior court held the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.id.at.the superior court summarized the evidence as follows 
in addition to the identification testimony given by michael toro,there was circumstantial evidence tending to connect appellant with the homicide.not only was appellant present at or near the scene of the stabbing,but he had in his possession a knife similar to that used by the killer and had previously vowed to use it to kill somebody.finally,there was testimony that he had been observed going through the victim pockets after the stabbing.thus,even though the offending knife had not been found and despite the sometimes less than positive identification by michael toro,a jury,having found the commonwealth evidence credible,could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the killer.
the superior court also held there is at least arguable merit to appellant contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the competency of the juvenile,michael toro.id.at.the superior court remanded for an evidentiary hearing on appellant claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.the superior court instructed that i f trial counsel assistance is found to be effective,the judgment of sentence may be reimposed.if counsel assistance was ineffective,however,a new trial must be granted.id.
at the november,evidentiary hearing before judge stout,ada sweeney called daly as a witness.daly testified that he did not object to michael toro competency at trial because,after reviewing the transcript of the preliminary hearing,he concluded that michael toro was competent and decided to wait until the trial to see the demeanor of his brother.he explained i ran down the criteria that one considers in looking at the competency of a witness.daly testified as follows 
well,the individual,did he perceive something yes,he saw something that was there did he recall it he could recall it did he have the necessary communicative skills yes,he did was there any question,did it appear that he understood the oath that he was taking yes,he appeared to understand the oath.
when asked about the advisability of requesting a competency hearing during trial.daly answered as follows 
well,i decided that the individual appeared to me to be competent,and based on the strategy that i wished to use,that is the fact that michael toro,in his preliminary hearing notes,seemed to,i wanted to have him on the stand to see whether or not he would do the same,which i believed that he,based on the notes testimony,that he would,and he in front of the jury at that time.
ada sweeney then asked daly what was your strategy designed to do at trial,in terms of of michael and hector toro daly answered m y strategy was if we had michael toro up on the stand,to use the preliminary hearing notes against michael toro,in order to show the jury that at a prior hearing he had on what he said that he saw.daly also stated that the strategy appeared to work 
during the trial,the strategy appeared to work,because michael toro,in fact,when the prosecution,that is yourself,asked michael toro a question,he went with the prosecution.however,when i went up and him,he went for the defense,that is,he did see what he supposedly saw.when you stood up again,he said yes,he had seen it.so,it was bouncing back and forth,and i thought,at that time,the bouncing back and forth was doing what i wanted it to do,that is creating a reasonable doubt.
after the evidentiary hearing,judge stout indicated she intended to deny medina claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the docket contains a hand written entry that states the defense motion for ineffective assistance of counsel is denied.the defendant is granted thirty days to appeal to the superior court.this entry was signed,stout below the words by the court.however,no order was entered by judge stout denying the motion.after judge stout death,judge legrome davis,now a federal district court judge,issued an order denying medina motion on october.
in medina second direct appeal,the court of common pleas concluded i t can not grant defendant relief simply because hindsight reveals that trial counsel tactical decision that the witness was competent and that he would be able to discredit him through cross examination was in error.commonwealth medina,slip op.at.of.the superior court affirmed that decision on february.commonwealth medina,eda,slip op.at,holding that c ounsel strategy,while arguably the wrong one in hindsight,was not lacking in a reasonable basis designed to further appellant interest.
medina filed for relief pursuant to the post conviction relief act on december.his petition was dismissed by the trial court.the superior court affirmed that dismissal on september.commonwealth medina.on december,the supreme court of pennsylvania denied medina petition for allowance of appeal.he then initiated this proceeding pursuant to.
in his pro se brief for habeas corpus relief filed pursuant to a,medina raised six claims.medina diguglielmo,d.his first three claims alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to object to the competency of the toro brothers.id.at.his fourth claim alleged ineffectiveness of counsel for failing to introduce medical evidence establishing that medina was incapable of acting in the manner described at trial.id.medina alleged,in his fifth claim,that the trial court rendered his trial counsel ineffective by admonishing counsel in front of the jury and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue.id.in his sixth claim,medina contended that the prosecution made improper remarks in its closing argument by vouching for the commonwealth witnesses and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue.id.
medina appointed counsel characterized the pro se petition as containing five claims 
ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to object to the competency of the toro brothers,violation of medina federal due process rights when the trial court failed to conduct a sua sponte inquiry into the competency of the toro brothers ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to introduce medical records ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to improper prosecutorial remarks and ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel in relation to the trial court admonishments of trial counsel in front of the jury.
the district court noted,however,that the magistrate judge report and recommendation r r disregards his pro se claim that the trial court violated his due process rights when it failed to conduct a sua sponte inquiry into the competency of the toro brothers.id.because t he parties did not object to the magistrate judge characterization of medina claims in their objections,and medina actually adopted the magistrate judge characterization of his claims in his objections to the r r,the district court did not consider whether the failure of the trial court to conduct a sua sponte competency hearing violated due process.id.
pursuant to rule b of the rules governing section cases,a district court is not required to determine de novo whether a magistrate judge erred in failing to consider a claim in his or her report and recommendation if no objection was made by a party on that ground.in his brief before this court,medina does not contend that his federal due process rights were violated by the failure of the trial court to conduct a sua sponte hearing regarding the competency of the toro brothers.furthermore,medina did not file a protective challenging the failure of the district court to consider his federal due process claims.see henderson carlson,cir holding that the failure of a party to object to a magistrate legal conclusions may result in the loss of the right to de novo review in the district not in the loss of the statutory right to appellate review.accordingly,we conclude that this claim has been abandoned or forfeited.
the district court entered a final order on june,granting medina petition for habeas corpus relief.it concluded that the state court dismissal of his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the competency of marcos toro was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.medina,d at.the district court also concluded that the failure of medina trial counsel to object on competency grounds was prejudicial because a bsent marcos testimony,there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have a reasonable doubt regarding medina guilt.id.at.
the commonwealth has timely appealed.this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to and c i a supp.
the commonwealth contends that the district court erred in concluding that daly representation was ineffective for failing to challenge marcos toro competency to testify.
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the supreme court instructed in williams taylor,d that 
u nder the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
id.at.for the writ to issue,the state court application of federal law must be objectively unreasonable.lockyer andrade,d.
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are evaluated pursuant to the standard enunciated in strickland washington,d.the standard has two components.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.id.at.when a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel assistance,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.at.regarding prejudice,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
of course,the state of the law is central to an evaluation of counsel performance at trial.a reasonably competent attorney patently is required to know the state of the applicable law.everett beard,cir,abrogated on other grounds,priester vaughn,cir.a criminal defendant may demonstrate that his representation was constitutionally inadequate by proving that his attorney performance was deficient,unreasonable under prevailing professional standards united states booth,cir.
the law of pennsylvania concerning the competency of a witness under fourteen years of age was clearly established long before the trial in this matter in rosche mccoy.see everett,at discussing status of state law at the time of trial,to evaluate competency of attorney.in rosche,the pennsylvania supreme court held that c ompetency is the
