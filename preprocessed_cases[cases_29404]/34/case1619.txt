during a routine traffic stop in seat pleasant,maryland,police removed obie lee powell,who was a passenger,from the vehicle and performed an patdown on him.based on evidence obtained by police after the patdown,a federal grand jury indicted powell for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine,possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.before trial,powell moved to suppress this evidence,arguing that the officers obtained it in violation of the fourth amendment.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion,holding inter alia that the officers had reasonable suspicion that powell was armed and dangerous and were thus entitled to frisk him.thereafter,a jury convicted powell of the offense of simple possession of crack cocaine and acquitted him of the other charges,and the court sentenced him to a month term of imprisonment.on appeal,powell contends that the court erred by denying his suppression motion.
in a case such as this,where law enforcement officers briefly patdown a person for safety reasons,reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous is necessary in order for the patdown to be lawful under the fourth amendment.terry ohio,d.earlier this year,in united states foster,cir,we noted our concern about the inclination of the government toward using whatever facts are present,no matter how innocent,as indicia of suspicious activity.twice in the past few months,we reiterated this concern.see united states massenburg,cir united states digiovanni,cir.in all three cases,we held that the government failed to meet its minimal burden of articulating facts sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.today,we once again are presented with a case in which the government has attempted to meet its burden under terry by cobbling together a set of facts that falls far short of establishing reasonable suspicion.for this reason,we vacate the judgment.
we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,the prevailing party below.united states kelly,cir,cert.denied,d.during the evidentiary hearing,the government presented the testimony of three witnesses who were employed by the seat pleasant police department and were present at the traffic stop officer catrina davis,officer christopher shelby,and corporal leroy patterson with the exceptions noted below,the parties agree that the testimony establishes the following facts,which are consistent with the district court findings.
on the night of november,while on routine patrol,officer davis observed a buick occupied by three individuals pull out from a parking lot.powell was a passenger in the backseat of the buick.because the buick had a headlight,officer davis stopped it.the stop occurred without incident.
officer davis made contact with the driver,jermaine mitchell,and obtained his driver license and vehicle registration.at the same time,corporal patterson,who was on patrol with officer davis,approached the passenger side.as officer davis returned to her patrol car to process mitchell traffic citation,corporal patterson engaged in an amicable conversation with powell.the topics of this conversation included their mutual appreciation of fish sandwiches which powell was eating and music which was audible in the buick.during this conversation,officer shelby arrived to provide assistance and joined corporal patterson at the passenger side of the buick.a fourth officer was on the scene,but that officer does not appear to have played a material part in the traffic stop.
at some point,powell indicated that he needed to pick up a child,and he asked how long the traffic stop would last.corporal patterson responded that he could not be certain about the expected duration of the traffic stop,and he told powell that he was free to leave if he so desired.powell declined the offer and remained in the buick.
eventually,an incoming radio communication advised officer davis,who was in her patrol car,that mitchell license was suspended.officer shelby,who was still standing by the buick passenger side,heard this communication on his personal radio,and he asked powell and the other passenger identified as tawanda if either one of them had a valid driver license although officer shelby reason for asking was to ascertain if either passenger could drive the vehicle away after the completion of the traffic stop,which they would have been permitted to do,he did not communicate that reason to powell or tawanda.
powell gave his license to officer shelby who,in turn,checked its status via radio.a responsive radio communication indicated that the license was suspended and that powell had priors for armed robbery.this latter information,known as caution data,comes from a computer database and is communicated to police in seat pleasant anytime a person has ever been charged with a crime,no matter when the charge was made or its disposition.regarding priors generally,officer shelby explained it just a prior.it does mean that they sic up to the same activity,but at which time you still have to take that into consideration,that they may still be armed or may still be conducting the same business.regarding powell priors specifically,officer shelby explained that he had no way of knowing whether that was yesterday news or years ago news,and n o way of knowing whether that was a conviction or an exoneration.id.
at the time the caution data was broadcast,neither powell nor the other occupants of the buick had appeared suspicious or presented any threat or problem to the officers.nonetheless,based solely on the caution data,officer shelby ordered powell from the buick and began to perform a patdown on him.during the patdown,powell became nervous and twice dropped to one knee thereafter,powell unsuccessfully attempted to run from the officers,but he only got a few steps before they regained control over him and placed him in handcuffs.at this time,powell was not under arrest.
once the officers secured powell,corporal patterson removed a backpack from the buick near where powell had been sitting.after finding a handgun in the backpack,the officers arrested powell.during a search incident to the arrest,the officers found the crack cocaine that forms the basis for his conviction.at the conclusion of the traffic stop,mitchell was cited for the traffic violation,and he and tawanda were permitted to leave.the buick was left parked on the street.
on appeal,powell concedes the lawfulness of both the traffic stop and his subsequent removal from the buick.see maryland wilson,d holding that an officer making a traffic stop may order passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop.however,he contends that officer shelby unlawfully patted him down after he exited the buick because the officers did not have a reasonable basis to suspect that he was armed and dangerous.powell argument is grounded generally in the basic rule that searches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate,are per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions,arizona gant,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted,and,therefore,before an officer places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything,he must have constitutionally adequate,reasonable grounds for doing so,sibron,d.
more specifically,powell argument is based on the holding in arizona johnson,d,in which the court extended the stop and frisk rule announced in terry to passengers in a routine traffic stop.the johnson court held to justify a patdown of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop,just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity,the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.id.as powell notes,at the time officer shelby began the patdown,his interaction with the officers had been entirely amicable and he like the driver and other passenger had been cooperative.thus,in powell view,the officers lacked reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous.
although the government presented several arguments below,its only written appellate argument is that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct the patdown.see brief of united states,at noting that the sole disputed issue is whether officer shelby reasonably suspected that powell was armed and dangerous in its appellate brief,the government specifically points to two factors to support its contention the caution data regarding powell and powell purported deliberate misrepresentation concerning the validity of his driver license.see,id.at.according to the government officers can not be expected to blind themselves to obvious risks of danger when a person they encounter demonstrates a willingness to be untruthful,especially when there is information that the person has been involved previously in violence.id.at.
the standards governing our determination of reasonable suspicion are.in the context of this case,reasonable suspicion is a particularized and objective basis for suspecting that the person to be frisked is armed and dangerous.ornelas united states,d the officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.terry,at.the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior,illinois wardlow,d,and it is measured by the totality of the circumstances,united states arvizu,d.
the reasonable suspicion standard is an objective one,so we examine the facts within the knowledge of the officers to determine the presence or nonexistence of reasonable suspicion.digiovanni,at.the reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search.florida,d.the government bears the burden of articulating facts sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion,burton,at,and although the standard of proof is obviously less demanding than that for probable cause,the government must be able to articulate something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,united states sokolow,d.as we recently explained 
t he government must do more than simply label a behavior as suspicious to make it so.the government must also be able to articulate why a particular behavior is suspicious or logically demonstrate,given the surrounding circumstances,that the behavior is likely to be indicative of some more sinister activity than may appear at first glance.
we review the district court reasonable suspicion determination de novo,bearing in mind that reasonable suspicion is to be determined on a basis,and thus one determination will seldom be useful precedent for another.ornelas,at.applying the foregoing standards to the facts of this case,we have no hesitation in concluding that the government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the officers had reasonable suspicion that powell was armed and dangerous when the patdown began.
we begin our analysis by viewing the traffic stop in its overall context.see united states branch,cir context is important in evaluating a reasonable suspicion determination.the officers interaction with powell began as part of a routine traffic stop on a public road,and there is no evidence in the record that it occurred in either a area or at a similarly unsafe location.for much of the traffic stop,the four officers on the scene outnumbered the three occupants of the buick.before officer shelby began the patdown,powell and the other occupants of the vehicle were entirely amicable and cooperative with the officers,they did not engage in any threatening or evasive conduct,and they did not display any of the signs typically associated with illegal or dangerous activity,evidence of,gang affiliation,or a possible concealed weapon.it is particularly telling that corporal patterson told powell during the traffic stop that he was free to leave if he wanted,which is an implicit acknowledgement that he did not consider powell to be armed and dangerous.johnson.at officer trevizo surely was not constitutionally required to give johnson an opportunity to depart the scene after he exited the vehicle without first ensuring that,in so doing,she was not permitting a dangerous person to get behind her.
standing alone,this context clearly provides no basis for the officers to reasonably suspect that powell might have been armed and dangerous.until powell was removed from the buick,the traffic stop itself could be considered remarkable,if at all,only because of its amicable,cooperative,and relatively safe nature.although we believe this context is important to a complete understanding of the issue before us,the inquiry does not end there.a passenger conduct may be sufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion,but it is not necessary when other factors are present.united states sakyi,cir citation omitted see also united states holmes,cir noting that a suspect cooperation with police officers during a terry stop does not,by itself,extinguish concerns that police may harbor about that suspect dangerousness.
we therefore move further in our examination of the totality of the circumstances that were present when the patdown began.as noted,the government has articulated two factors in its appellate brief to support its reasonable suspicion argument the caution data and powell purported deliberate misrepresentation regarding his driver license.we will separately address each of these factors before evaluating them together with the other circumstances of the traffic stop.see foster,at 
initially,we readily acknowledge that a person possible involvement in prior criminal activity,caution data can be relevant in establishing reasonable suspicion.see,holmes,at noting that reasonable suspicion can be based on the suspect commission of violent crimes in the past especially when those crimes indicate a high likelihood that the suspect will be armed and dangerous when encountered in the future.however,in most instances,a prior criminal record is not,standing alone,sufficient to create reasonable suspicion.foster,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also sprinkle,at noting that the officer knew the suspect had recently completed a drug sentence,but the officer had no information that he had returned to crime since his release.the rationale underlying this rule is clear 
if the law were otherwise,any person with any sort of criminal record or even worse,a person with arrests but no convictions could be subjected to an investigative stop by a law enforcement officer at any time without the need for any other justification at all.to find reasonable suspicion in this case could violate a basic precept that officers not disturb a free person liberty solely because of a criminal record.under the fourth amendment our society does not allow police officers to round up the usual suspects.
united states laughrin,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the tenth circuit was addressing reasonable suspicion necessary for a terry stop,but we believe its point applies with equal force to a determination of reasonable suspicion for a terry frisk.
officer shelby sole basis for frisking powell was the caution data,see,but the government unequivocally conceded at oral argument that the caution data,by itself,is insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion in this case.we believe that this concession is because the caution data while indicating that powell had priors for armed robbery does not provide any detail concerning when the priors occurred or whether they even involved convictions.the striking lack of specificity of the information in this case draws no distinction between,for example,a recent armed robbery conviction and a wrongful armed robbery charge,and in the officers view,such a distinction is irrelevant.without more,the caution data certainly does not justify a reasonable suspicion that powell was armed and dangerous on the night of the traffic stop.
we likewise acknowledge that false statements can be considered in establishing reasonable suspicion.branc
