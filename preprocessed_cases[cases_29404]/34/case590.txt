a jury convicted kurt roberson of selling more than grams of crack cocaine,see a and b a iii,and of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to that transaction,see c a.the district court sentenced roberson to months imprisonment.roberson appeal challenges his convictions and sentence on several grounds.we affirm.
the federal bureau of investigation fbi began investigating roberson in early.as part of that investigation,fbi agents engaged the services of a cooperating witness,eric mena,who had known roberson for eight years and had formerly been a drug dealing associate of roberson.mena agreed to make a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from roberson as part of a plea bargain resolving drug charges against him.
on march of that year,fbi agent edward kappler outfitted mena with an electronic transmitter and a digital recorder to enable the fbi to monitor mena conversations with roberson.mena then went to the home of raymond muse,a mutual associate of roberson and mena,and informed him that he wanted to buy some crack from roberson.muse brought mena to where roberson was currently staying.after roberson entered mena car,mena told him that he needed two ounces of crack.roberson agreed to provide the drugs the next evening and told mena that he should call to initiate the pickup.
while mena was saving roberson phone number on his mobile phone,roberson spontaneously stated,yo,you got any burners i can trade you a burner.mena testified at trial that burner meant handgun,and that he understood roberson statement to be an offer to sell him a gun.roberson described the gun as a brand new,cal.that was like a glock,top is chrome.the rest is plastic.mena was noncommittal as to that offer but confirmed that he would meet with roberson the next day.
the following evening,mena,who was again outfitted with a transmitter and an audio recorder,tried several times,unsuccessfully,to reach roberson on his mobile phone.the fbi directed mena to drive to muse house again.rather than using his own car,however,mena drove an undercover car that the fbi had equipped with a hidden video camera.after muse and mena successfully contacted roberson,muse directed mena to an apartment complex in a nearby town.mena drove the undercover car with muse as his passenger.
after they arrived at the apartment complex,muse located roberson and brought him to mena car.roberson sat in the front passenger seat next to mena,while muse sat in the back.roberson told mena,i got your sixty grams,and then told him it would cost.as mena was counting out his money,roberson looked out the back window and stated,i got the rap on me so i shook anyway.mena testified at trial that this meant that roberson was paranoid because he had a handgun on him.roberson then handed mena a sandwich bag containing crack.
as mena inspected the crack,roberson pulled a handgun out of his waistband,pointed it in mena direction,and stated,that what i talking about man.mena told roberson not to point the gun at him and asked to see it.roberson handed the gun to mena,who looked at it and smelled it to see if it had been fired.mena found the design of the gun to be consistent with a glock in that the top was chrome and the bottom was plastic.mena asked roberson why he wanted to get rid of the handgun and roberson replied that the serial numbers had been scratched off.when mena asked whether the gun had been fired yet,roberson replied,nah,i do waste shells,man.i shoot niggas though.mena handed the gun back to roberson,and they completed the drug transaction.
mena then asked roberson if he would be interested in buying mena car.mena initiated this conversation outside the car so that fbi agents would have an opportunity to observe roberson directly.as a result,agent timothy quinn,who was conducting physical and audio surveillance nearby,was able to drive within feet of mena and roberson as they looked over the vehicle.roberson then went back into the apartment complex.
later that month,a federal grand jury returned a two count indictment charging roberson of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of more than grams of cocaine base in violation of the controlled substances act csa,see a and b a iii the drug charge,and of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,see c a the gun charge.the government subsequently filed an information pursuant to providing notice of its intent to seek increased doubling of the drug charge mandatory minimum sentence from to reason of a prior conviction.after a trial,including testimony from mena,kappler and quinn,a jury convicted roberson on both counts.
roberson moved for a judgment of acquittal both during trial and after the verdict.see.a,c.he argued that there was insufficient evidence establishing that he had possessed crack or had sold more than grams of crack.he also argued that the government had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that he had carried or used a firearm,as that term is defined in a,or that he had carried or used a firearm during and in relation to the drug transaction.finally,he argued that,because the government had not offered any evidence establishing his prior conviction,the district court could not impose an increased penalty for the drug conviction.the court denied roberson motions in all respects.
at sentencing,the district court found that the mandatory minimum applied to the drug charge,see b a iii,and a consecutive mandatory minimum applied to the gun charge,see c a.after determining that the sentencing guidelines advised a sentencing range of years to life,and considering the sentencing factors set forth in a,the court imposed a sentence of years in prison,the statutory minimum sentence.
roberson now appeals the district court order denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the gun charge,arguing that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove either that he carried an actual firearm or that he carried a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense.he alternatively requests a new trial on the gun charge on the ground that the court erroneously instructed the jury concerning the in relation to requirement,and a new trial on both charges on the basis of improperly admitted testimony.finally,roberson argues that the applicable mandatory minimum sentence for the drug conviction is ten years,not years.
a.the gun charge 
roberson challenges the consecutive mandatory minimum sentence he received for using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense on several grounds.c a.we begin with roberson contention that the district court incorrectly instructed on the in relation to requirement,and compounded the error by simply restating the same erroneous instruction when the jury sought clarification.
at trial,both roberson and the government submitted proposed jury instructions addressing the gun charge.the government proposed the first circuit pattern jury instruction,which provides,in relevant part 
to carry a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to move or transport the firearm on one person or in a vehicle or container during and in relation to the crime.it need not be immediately accessible.to use a firearm during and in relation to a crime means to employ the firearm actively,such as to brandish,display,barter,strike with,fire or attempt to fire it,or even to refer to it in a way calculated to affect the underlying crime.the firearm must have played a role in the crime or must have been intended by the defendant to play a role in the crime.that need not have been its sole purpose,however.
see first circuit criminal pattern jury instructions.the pattern instruction purposefully declines to define in relation to separately from the terms carry and use.see id.cmt.it seems best not to define use or carry separately from during and in relation to.roberson,however,drawing on language from smith united states,d,proposed that a paragraph be added to directly address this requirement.the court agreed to instruct the jury on the in relation to element,but declined to adopt roberson proposal wholesale.instead,it crafted its own instruction based on language from smith 
the words during and in relation to are to be given their plain and customary meaning.the phrase in relation to is expansive.at a minimum it means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime.if a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it can not be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic king offense.the firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.
during a conference,roberson objected to the statement the phrase in relation to is expansive.he argued that the word expansive erroneously implied that the phrase in relation to was intended to expand,rather than limit,the phrase used or carried.the district court denied the objection and delivered the pattern jury instruction along with the in relation to insert that it had crafted.after the charge,roberson failed to renew his objection,and the jury retired to deliberate.
during the first full day of deliberations,the jury submitted a note asking does carrying a firearm during but independent of a drug transaction constitute the use of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking contending that the word independent means the opposite of in relation to,roberson requested the court to directly answer the jury question in the negative.the court,however,agreed with the government that such an instruction would risk providing the jury with a decisive conclusion.the court therefore elected to simply the gun charge instruction in the hope that hearing the instruction again would help the jury resolve the question internally.before the court summoned the jury,roberson again objected that the instruction was erroneous insofar as it stated that in relation to is expansive.after the of the instruction,the jury returned its verdicts later that day without additional inquiry.
to preserve an objection to a jury instruction under.d,a litigant must lodge a specific objection and state the grounds for the objection after the court has charged the jury and before the jury begins deliberations.see united states moran,cir.objections registered during hearings are insufficient to preserve the issue.see id.we review such unpreserved jury instruction claims for plain error only.see id.
roberson seeks a more favorable standard of review by arguing that his second objection to the expansive instruction preserved the issue because it was made after the court original charge to the jury on the gun charge and before the jury retired to deliberate following the court of the gun charge instruction.roberson contends that the second objection effectively served rule d purpose to bring to the attention of the trial court errors or omissions in its charge so that they may be corrected before the case goes to the jury.united states sturm,cir.but the case had already gone to the jury.roberson renewed objection,registered after the jury had begun its deliberations,came too late to satisfy rule d.see united states,cir a party waives any objection it might have to a jury instruction by failing to enter that objection into the record immediately after the judge has instructed the jury and before the jury begins deliberations.emphasis added we therefore review the instruction for plain error,under which roberson must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.moran,at quotation marks omitted.
roberson can not meet this stringent standard.the district court took the language t he phrase in relation to is expansive directly from the majority opinion in smith.see at.roberson makes no argument that smith is no longer good law or has been undermined by subsequent supreme court precedent.indeed,federal appellate courts continue to cite smith for the proposition that in relation to is expansive.see,united states brown,cir united states williams,cir mcneal united states,cir.
moreover,roberson argument that the jury likely misunderstood expansive to mean that the phrase in relation to was intended to enlarge upon the circumstances in which a defendant may be prosecuted for using or carrying a firearm,is belied when the instruction is viewed as a whole.see united states destefano,cir.although one definition of expansive is capable of expanding or tending to expand,the am.heritage dictionary ed,another is broad in size or extent comprehensive.id.only the latter definition makes sense in the context of the instruction as a whole.the sentences immediately following the expansive instruction state 
at a minimum in relation to means that the firearm must have had some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime.if a firearm is present simply as a result of coincidence or accident it can not be said that it was used or carried in relation to the drug traffic king offense.the firearm must have facilitated or have had the potential to facilitate the drug offense.
given the limiting language of those sentences,it would be illogical to read the sentence containing the word expansive in the way roberson suggests.when read in its entirety,the in relation to instruction adequately and accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase as described in smith.
roberson counters that the jury question illustrates that there was confusion with the instruction.he argues that the district court therefore erred by not directly answering the jury question as he suggested that if it is their conclusion that the gun was either used or carried independent of the drug trafficking offense,that would mean that it was not either used or carried in relation to the drug trafficking crime.
we disagree.as a general rule,whether to provide a supplementary instruction to the jury is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.elliott warren,cir.here,the court anticipated that the jury might wrestle with the issue of whether the gun was used or carried in relation to the drug transaction.at roberson behest,the court carefully crafted an instruction,consistent with smith,to aid the jury evaluation of the in relation to requirement.under the circumstances,it was well within the court discretion to eschew elaborat ing on these initial,entirely correct instructions and instead,elect simply to refer the jury to the original formulation.id.
this is especially so given the phrasing of the jury question,which suggested that the jury was putting it to the court to make the dispositive decision.district courts must exercise caution in such circumstances.see,arizona johnson,cir recognizing in a similar situation that a district court must exercise caution,when a simple affirmative or negative response might favor one party position,place undue weight on certain evidence,or indicate that the trial judge believes certain facts to be true when such matters should properly be determined by the jury quotation and emphasis omitted united states lakich,cir noting that a district court would have risked intruding on the jury fact finding had it given a simple affirmative answer to the jury question of whether a finding of entrapment on one count reflects on another.we therefore can not fault the court for choosing the more cautious alternative of the original instruction and letting that instruction stand alone 
roberson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the gun charge.in determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict,we review the totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and then ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states bailey,cir quotation marks omitted.
roberson first challenges the government evidence establishing that he used or carried a firearm during the drug transaction see united states taylor,cir noting that c requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the person perpetrating the predicate offense used a real gun.he contends that mena testimony by itself is insufficient to prove that the object roberson handed to mena was a real gun because mena is not an expert on guns and his lay opinion is not creditworthy,given that it is based on his observation of the alleged gun at night in a dark car.
although c requires proof that the gun is real,the government proof need not reach a level of scientific certainty.id.at.descriptive lay opinion testimony can be sufficient.united states kirvan,cir.here,mena testimony was sufficient to ground the jury finding.although mena was not a firearms expert,he testified that he was familiar with handguns,having held them on several occasions.mena testified that he had the opportunity to hold and closely inspect roberson handgun.mena took advantage of that opportunity,smelling it to see if it had been fired,and noticing that the serial numbers had been scratched off.at trial,mena provided details about the gun that it looked new and had chrome on the top with a black plastic bottom,noted that its design a plastic bottom was commonly referred to by his associates in the drug trade as a glock,and stated that it felt like a handgun.although mena observed the gun at night inside a car with the interior lights off,such factors go only to the weight of mena testimony,and would not prevent a rational jury from crediting mena opinion.taylor,at finding sufficient lay witness testimony by a bank teller and a customer service representative who observed the object gripped by the defendant at close range kirvan,at finding sufficient lay witness testimony of two individuals who described seeing the defendant holding what appeared to be a gun,and who stated that it sounded heavy when it fell to the ground.
roberson also contends that a rational jury could not have found that roberson used or carried the gun in relation to a drug trafficking offense because the evidence established,at most,that he carried the gun for the independent purpose of offering it to mena after completion of the drug transaction.he asserts that his offer to sell the gun to mena was an entirely separate and unrelated transaction.
as the jury was instructed,the in relation to language of c requires,at a minimum,that the firearm have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime.smith,at.mere possession of a gun during the course of criminal conduct does not support a conviction under the statute.united states plummer,cir see also united states grace,cir.nonetheless,the phrase has been construed broadly,and encompasses a variety of situations where the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense.see,smith,at.finding that an attempt to barter a firearm for drugs satisfied the in relation to requirement united states,cir holding that gun kept available if a contingency arose or to make an escape was carried in relation to the predicate drug offense.moreover,facilitation of the underlying drug offense need not be the defendant sole purpose for possessing the weapon.see united states,cir noting that a sufficient nexus existed between defendant possession of a gun and the drug crime notwithstanding a legitimate explanation for defendant possession of the,his employment as a police officer.
here,at least two permissible grounds existed for the jury determination that roberson used or carried the firearm in relation to the drug transaction.the jury could have reasoned that roberson brandished the gun to embolden himself or to intimidate mena.see united states eaton,cir.at their first meeting,roberson informed mena that he had a handgun to trade.a rational jury could infer that roberson intended that statement to put mena on notice that he would be armed on the day of the drug transaction.sure enough,during the transaction,before mena finished paying for the crack,roberson pulled the handgun from his waistband,pointed it in mena direction,and proclaimed,that what i talking about.further demonstrating his deadly potential,roberson informed mena that,while he does not waste shells,he does shoot niggas.although the evidence that roberson subsequently handed the gun to mena may weaken the theory that roberson was using the gun to intimidate mena,the above evidence was sufficient to ground the jury verdict.see plummer,at noting that while the facts may permit multiple inferences,the factfinder is entitled to choose among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.
even if the jury believed that the gun was carried only for the purpose of attempting to sell it to mena,it still could have reasonably concluded that the gun was carried in relation to the drug transaction.at the first meeting,when mena asked roberson for crack,roberson mentioned that he had a gun he wanted to trade.the next day,as mena was counting his money,roberson handed the gun to mena for his inspection and stated that he was nervous about carrying the gun because the serial numbers were scratched off.indeed,it appeared to mena that roberson was anxious to get rid of the gun.from this testimony,the jury could have reasonably concluded that the opportunity to trade the gun was an incentive for roberson to agree to mena request for crack.united states lipford,cir holding that in order to convince a seller to take the risks inherent in the sale of drugs,a drug purchaser can often sweeten the pot,offering to purchase not only drugs,but other illegal goods as well.on these facts,a jury could have reasonably concluded that,at least in roberson mind,the gun deal and the drug deal were intertwined.
improper testimony 
during its,the government asked mena whether he knew which is more addictive,crack or cocaine powder the district court overruled roberson subsequent objection,and mena answered,i believe crack is more addictive.when asked which drug is stronger,mena again answered,crack.mena then testified that when he had been a drug dealer,he had sold powder cocaine,but that roberson had been a crack dealer.during its closing argument,the government stated,eric mena told you that he was a cocaine dealer and that kurt roberson was a crack dealer.eric mena also told you that as between cocaine and crack,crack is more potent and addictive.
on appeal,roberson contends that the government failed to lay a sufficient foundation to ground mena opinion because it did not establish that mena was an expert on the addictive properties of cocaine,see,or offer evidence about mena lay perceptions as to the different addictive qualities or relative potency of crack versus powder cocaine,see.roberson contends that the improperly admitted evidence was both misleading in that it is the difference in the typical method of administration,not any difference in the inherent properties of the two forms of cocaine,that causes an increased risk of addiction with crack and highly prejudicial in that the improper testimony and closing argument was aimed at bolstering mena character,while degrading roberson.because mena testimony was critical to the government case,roberson argues,a new trial is necessary.the government concedes,correctly,that it did not lay an adequate foundation to ground mena testimony.nevertheless,the government argues that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of roberson guilt.
we agree with the government that the error was harmless because it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.united states flemmi,cir quotation marks omitted describing the harmless error standard for evidentiary errors.roberson attempts to rebut the government overwhelming evidence argument by pointing to various weaknesses in the government case.for instance,roberson asserts,the testimony of agents kappler and quinn identifying roberson was fallible.but even assuming that this testimony was not overwhelming by itself,it is notable that all of the government evidence,including the testimony of kappler and quinn,and the recorded audio and video evidence,corroborates mena account of what happened.given the wealth of evidence supporting mena testimony,it is highly unlikely that his veracity,at least with respect to the events of march and,was seriously questioned by the jury.moreover,we doubt that the jury would view the relative addictiveness of crack versus powder cocaine to be an important factor for drawing its conclusions about the character of the two men.mena admitted on the stand that he was a dealer of,among other drugs,powder cocaine.it is highly improbable that any diminutive boost mena credibility may have received from being cast as a dealer of a less addictive form of cocaine would have influenced the jury verdicts.
at sentencing,the district court heard argument concerning whether the mandatory minimum sentence on the drug charge should be doubled from ten years to years in light of roberson massachusetts conviction for distribution of marijuana in violation of.laws ch.see b a providing a mandatory minimum for any person convicted under a that has a prior conviction for a felony drug offense.roberson argued that the prior massachusetts conviction was not a felony drug offense under b a because massachusetts law categorized the offense as a misdemeanor.the district court rejected roberson argument,finding that the csa clearly defines a felony drug offense as any prior conviction for an offense punishable by more than one year of imprisonment.see.because roberson massachusetts conviction was punishable by up to two years in prison,see.laws ch,the court found that it qualified as a felony drug offense notwithstanding the state classification of the offense as a misdemeanor.
on appeal,roberson contends that the district court erred by applying the mandatory minimum to the drug charge.roberson arguments hinge on the premise that two defined terms are triggered by b a.citing to several canons of statutory construction and to the legislative history of the csa,he argues that the definition of felony drug offense contained in is modified by the definition of felony contained in.see the term felony means any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.roberson contends that both of these definitions must be satisfied to trigger b a mandatory minimum.under roberson interpretation,a prior conviction is a felony drug offense under b a only if the prior drug offense is both punishable by more than one year in jail,see id,and classified as a felony by the relevant federal or state authority,see id.
a recent circuit decision supports roberson position.see united states west,like roberson,the defendant in west had been convicted under a and b a iii for distributing more than grams of cocaine base.the district court increased the mandatory minimum from ten to years based on a prior drug conviction in maryland that was classified by that state as a misdemeanor,but which was punishable by up to four years in prison.on appeal,the circuit vacated the defendant sentence,holding that the definition of felony drug offense provided by must be read in conjunction with the definition of felony provided by.the circuit found the defendant congress intended felony drug offense to incorporate the definitions contained in both and was at least as plausible as the government that alone controls.id.at.invoking the rule of lenity,the court held that the enhancement provision of b a is limited to those instances in which the prior drug offense is both punishable by more than one year and classified as a felony by controlling authority.id.roberson argues that,even if we do not adopt his construction of the statute,we should follow the circuit and apply the rule of lenity to resolve the issue in his favor.
roberson challenge to the applicability of the mandatory minimum sentence presents pure legal questions of statutory construction.as such,our review is de novo.doyle huntress,cir.as in any case of statutory construction,our analysis begins with the language of the statute.zimmerman cambridge credit counseling,cir quoting hughes aircraft jacobson,d.we accord the statutory text its ordinary meaning by reference to the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.mullane chambers,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.if the statutory language provides a clear answer,the inquiry ends.see hughes,at.sepulveda united states,cir.
the wording of the provisions at issue,read in the context of the statute as a whole,lead us to conclude that,for the purposes of the csa,the term felony drug offense is a term of art separate and distinct from the term felony.in our view,the definition of felony drug offense contained in unambiguously controls for the purposes of determining whether the penalty enhancement in b a is triggered.we therefore reject roberson arguments and decline to invoke the rule of lenity.see united states councilman,cir en banc holding that the rule of lenity only applies if there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty about the statute quoting muscarello united states,d.we begin our analysis by delineating the csa structure.
in,to consolidate the assorted drug laws then on the books and to enhance federal drug enforcement powers,congress enacted the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act the act.see pub.law,stat.see generally gonzales raich,d.the act is subdivided into three titles.the csa,established in title ii,addresses the control of drugs and the enforcement of drug laws,see,while title iii,aptly named the controlled substances import and export act import act,concerns their import and export to and from the united states,see id.
part d of the csa lays out the substantive offenses and the attendant penalties.as is relevant here,part d makes it unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture,distribute,or dispense or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute or dispense a controlled substance.id.a.pursuant to the penalties provision of that section,any person who violates a through conduct involving,inter alia,grams or more of a mixture containing cocaine base,shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than years.id.b a iii.further on,the same subsection provides that i f any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final,such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than years.id.emphasis added.
section provides definitions for the terms used in the csa and the import act.the two relevant definitions provide as follows 
the term felony means any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony 
the term felony drug offense means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the united states or of a state or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs,marihuana,or depressant stimulant substances.
the most logical interpretation of b a,we believe,is that the phrase felony drug offense is a term of art invoked intentionally by congress to incorporate by reference the specific definition contained in.united states,cir holding that the statutory definition of the term aggravated felony in a f is a term of art that includes within its ambit certain misdemeanors under state law that carry a sentence of at least one year see also stenberg carhart,d when a statute includes an explicit definition,we must follow that definition,even if it varies from that term ordinary meaning.because the term felony drug offense is specifically defined in,and b a makes use of that precise term,the logical,commonsense way to interpret felony drug offense in b a is by reference to the definition in.see shalala,cir c ourts are bound to afford statutes a practical,commonsense reading.
roberson argues that definition must be read as incorporating the definition of felony in because the term felony drug offense contains within it the defined term felony.because the definition of a defined term is ordinarily triggered by every reference to that term within a statute,see norman singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,ed,roberson argues,the definition of felony is embedded in both definition of and b a reference to felony drug offense.
but the term being defined is not ordinarily read as being itself a part of
