the instant case is an appeal from the united states district court for the district of new hampshire,challenging the district court denial of donald mcmullin motion to suppress as well as the subsequent denial of appellant motion to withdraw guilty plea resulting in his conviction.
appellant alleges that the district court erred in its finding of probable cause as there were no facts set forth in the affidavit in support of the warrant application to establish that appellant had placed diazinon in the well of his next door neighbor,james fitzpatrick,or that any diazinon was located on appellant property.appellant further alleges that both the state district judge for the district court of southern carroll county,new hampshire and the federal district judge,incorrectly applied the law by citing to a history of animus between mcmullin and fitzpatrick as the basis for probable cause when the facts stated in the affidavit were obtained from the victim,fitzpatrick,an interested,unreliable witness.moreover,appellant contends that the good faith exception is inapplicable because the affidavit was lacking in probable cause and deficient as the wakefield police omitted material facts from it.
as to appellant motion to withdraw his guilty plea mcmullin alleges that because the evidence shows that he did not comprehend the law at the time he entered his guilty plea,the district court abused its discretion in denying his subsequent motion to withdraw the guilty plea.
for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court denial of appellant motion to suppress and motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
background 
on november,members of the wakefield,new hampshire police department wpd executed a state search warrant,issued by a state district court,of mcmullin residence.the original search warrant,which was based upon a search warrant application and supporting affidavit submitted by sergeant mark,was part of an investigation into the poisoning or attempted poisoning of mcmullin next door neighbor,fitzpatrick.the incriminating evidence recovered during the search,which consisted of more that two pounds of marijuana found in a trash bag and in smaller bags on different levels of the house,several firearms and ammunition,prompted the filing of the instant federal criminal indictment charging mcmullin with being an unlawful user in possession of a firearm in violation of g counts one and two,and an unlawful user in possession of ammunition in violation of g counts three and four.
on december,appellant sought to suppress both the evidence seized and the statements made to the police during the execution of the warrant.on may,the district court denied on the record appellant motion to suppress via an endorsed order indicating that an opinion would follow.thereafter,appellant entered into a conditional plea agreement,signed on june,for which a plea hearing was held on june.during the plea colloquy the district court clarified that mcmullin had reserved the right to appeal the court endorsed order explaining its earlier denial of his motion to suppress.subsequently,on july,the court issued an opinion denying appellant motion to suppress,finding that there was a substantial basis from which the issuing state judge could reasonably conclude that a crime had been committed and that evidence of the crime would be found within appellant premises.in the alternative,the court found that the good faith exception to the fourth amendment exclusionary rule,set forth in united states leon,d,applied to this case.
on august,nearly two months after appellant change of plea hearing,wherein he was adjudicated guilty,but prior to sentencing,appellant moved to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment charging him with being an unlawful user of drugs in possession of a firearm and ammunition.on january,appellant filed a memorandum in support of his original motion.in said motion mcmullin alleged for the first time that his guilty plea as to counts one and three had not been voluntarily,intelligently,and knowingly made.appellant alleged that he was pressured into pleading guilty,that he had a short time to make up his mind and that he did not understand what being a user in possession of a firearm meant.on january,the district court held a hearing on mcmullin petition to withdraw his plea and on july,the district court denied his request and entered judgment sentencing mcmullin to a prison term of twelve months and one day and three years of supervised release on each count.the court found that appellant had failed to show that a fair and just reason existed to authorize the withdrawal of his plea.consequently,on july,mcmullin timely filed a notice of appeal,contesting the district court denial of his motion to suppress as well as his request to withdraw his guilty plea as to counts one and three of the indictment.

motion to suppress 
in issuing the search warrant the state district judge found that the appellant had a motive to contaminate fitzpatrick well considering that fitzpatrick was to be a witness in a pending case against the appellant.furthermore,the state district judge found that there was sufficient evidence to believe that crimes probably had been committed and that evidence of those crimes would likely be found in appellant premises on the other hand appellant contends that at the time the wakefield police requested the search warrant,probable cause was absent.appellant further contends that since the affidavit lacked good faith,included false statements and material omissions,and was facially invalid,the good faith exception is inapplicable to the instant case.
we disagree with appellant contentions and conclude that the district court did not err in denying appellant motion to suppress.we concur with the district court ultimate determination that the state district judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to believe that mcmullin had contaminated fitzpatrick well with diazinon and that a fair probability existed that the pesticide would still be at mcmullin property.
probable cause

the task of the issuing judge is simply to make a practical,decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before her,including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information,there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.and the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the judge had a substantial basis for conclud ing that probable cause existed.

appellant requests us to consider that w hen there is a significant chance that an accuser lone and unverified allegations may be colored by existing acrimony with the accused,probable cause is not present,and it would be unconstitutional to act just on the accuser words.appellant br.at citing hebron touhy,cir.
we disagree with appellant contention that the warrant application and supporting affidavit submitted to the state district judge contained only fitzpatrick lone and unverified allegations.on the contrary,corroborated fitzpatrick complaint by,among other things,visiting fitzpatrick residence and checking the contaminated well location,which revealed the close proximity of the well to mcmullin property and the ready access he had to the well at any time of the day taking as evidence the tape and granular substances removed from the well reviewing,from the samples obtained by fitzpatrick,the test results performed by des health risk group,which showed that diazinon was present in the well researching what diazinon is used for,the effects of being exposed to it and how long it takes to disappear in water checking the wakefield police department records for any reports filed by fitzpatrick mcmullin in order to corroborate fitzpatrick allegation that there had been past disputes between them verifying that two civil suits had been filed against mcmullin,one by the crew road association for road damages and the other by the town of wakefield,for which fitzpatrick was a potential witness and finally verifying that mcmullin had been charged and indicted on two felony charges involving multiple allegations of vandalism near crew road,and that the case was pending before carroll county superior court wherein fitzpatrick was also a potential witness therefore,any suspicion that might have existed about the reliability of fitzpatrick statements was allayed by aforementioned corroborative investigations.see hebron,at.
furthermore,we are satisfied with the corroborative investigations performed by,and find that his efforts clearly established that fitzpatrick was a reliable witness worthy of credibility.we can not readily cast aside evidence provided by victims as t his court has affirmed that police officers can justifiably rely upon the credible complaint by a victim to support a finding of probable cause.forest pawtucket police dep t,cir citing transp,fontaine,cir see also acosta ames dep t stores,cir victims complaints are a prime source of investigatory information for police officers.in the absence of circumstances that would raise a reasonably prudent officer antennae,there is no requirement that the officer corroborate every aspect of every complaint with extrinsic information.the uncorroborated testimony of a victim or other percipient witness,standing alone,ordinarily can support a finding of probable cause.
therefore,we agree with the district court that the issuing judge could have drawn reasonable inferences from the attested facts sufficient to support a probable cause determination,and,in any event,sufficient to satisfy this court that she had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.united states mcmullin,wl,july,denial of motion to suppress.first,the record shows it was apparent that fitzpatrick well had been intentionally contaminated with diazinon since said chemical is not naturally occurring nor can it penetrate through the ground,by natural means,to the level of the well pump,faucets and shower head,in the granular form it was found.furthermore,the plumber who was called to investigate the low water pressure at fitzpatrick home was the person who discovered the granular substance in fitzpatrick well,which was subsequently examined by a state agency,and tested positive for diazinon.the record further shows that since the well cap had a breather cap with a hole of around inches in diameter that could be unscrewed,someone could have easily contaminated fitzpatrick well with diazinon through the cap.
second,we find that mcmullin had a motive to contaminate fitzpatrick well.the record shows that said motive could have reasonably emanated from the history of animosity between fitzpatrick and mcmullin,as well as fitzpatrick potential participation as a witness in the civil and criminal cases pending against mcmullin third,the record shows that mcmullin also had the best opportunity to put diazinon in fitzpatrick well since investigation revealed that the well was located near the boundary line between mcmullin and fitzpatrick property,and mcmullin had ready access to the well from his own property at any time.moreover,the authorities found unused quantities of the pesticide in appellant possession.
therefore,i t was not unreasonable for the state district judge to determine that a crime was committed,and to infer that defendant committed it,and,therefore,that he would likely possess pesticides containing diazinon identical to those found in the well.mcmullin,wl,at.hence,we find that the state district judge had substantial basis for conclud ing that probable cause existed.gates,at.quoting jones,at.
consequently,the district court did not err in denying appellant motion to suppress and we need not consider the district court alternate holding concerning the leon good faith exception.
motion to withdraw guilty plea 
the federal district judge,in denying appellant motion to withdraw his guilty plea,found that mcmullin had not shown that a fair and just reason exist ed such as to permit the withdrawal of his pleas.united states mcmullin,wl,july,denial of motion to withdraw guilty plea.mcmullin main allegation is that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea because that plea was not voluntary,intelligent and knowing.mcmullin contends that the evidence shows that he did not understand the law at the time he changed his plea that he was pressured into making the plea by his prior attorney,that he had a short period of time to make up his mind on whether to change his plea,and that at the time of sentencing he was not on his normal medications and had not eaten for nearly a day.
