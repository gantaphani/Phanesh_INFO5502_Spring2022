opinion of the court 
jelani lee appeals from his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base crack in violation of.lee principal argument is that the district court should have declared a mistrial after the jury discovered an inculpatory document that was never provided to defense counsel.because we find that lee defense was irredeemably undermined by this discovery,we conclude that the jury verdict is not one in which we can have confidence.accordingly,we will vacate lee conviction and remand for a new trial.
early in the evening of january,lancaster police officers stopped the car lee was driving.tommie spurill and james kollore were also in the car,as was linsey boyer,a woman spurill met at a bar the previous evening.the occupants of the car were searched and the officers found crack cocaine in boyer undergarments.boyer claimed that the drugs belonged to lee and kollore,and all four were arrested.
when she was interviewed by the police,boyer told the officers that spurill had called her cell phone earlier in the day from a local motel.when the officers called the number stored in boyer phone,a representative from a local red carpet inn answered.after his arrest,lee was searched and the officers found keys with tags reading and in lee pocket.lee told the officers that he was from new york,but that his address in lancaster was south queen street.
the officers went to the red carpet inn and interviewed kalpana patel,one of the franchise owners.she provided the officers with a registration card for room.the front of the card indicated that the room had been rented to omar martin for one night on january,and listed south queen street,lancaster as martin address.the back of the card indicated that martin had extended his stay through january,but the record is silent about whether the officers were aware of the back of the card.the officers showed patel a photo array and she identified lee as someone she knew.based on this information,the officers obtained a warrant to search room.there,the officers found substantial quantities of crack cocaine,cash,a digital scale,and plastic baggies.
the lancaster police turned the case over to federal authorities and lee,spurill,and kollore were indicted for possession of grams of crack with intent to distribute.lee was also indicted for possession of grams of crack with intent to distribute.the lancaster police made photocopies of the evidence they had obtained for the united states attorney office.however,they only photocopied the front of the hotel registration card,which indicated that martin had rented room for one night on january.the prosecutor then provided this evidence to defense counsel,which included a photocopy of only the front of the registration card.
at trial,lee attempted to show that martin whether identified as lee or someone checked out of the red carpet inn days before drugs were found.patel provided the primary testimony linking lee to the red carpet inn.she testified as follows on about january,lancaster police officers came to her hotel with keys to rooms and.the key to room had been missing for a few weeks.patel answered affirmatively when asked room on the early morning when the police came out and interviewed you had that room been rented at that time when asked who was staying in the room,patel testified that i staying for two or three days,i do remember that.june.at.all red carpet inn guests are required to fill out a registration card.
after this testimony,counsel for the government removed the carpet inn registration card from an envelope and handed it to patel.patel identified the card as the registration card for room and testified that the name on the card was omar martin.martin wrote on the card that his address was south queen street in lancaster.patel filled in the arrival date of january.nothing was written on the line next to departure date,but the numeral was written next to of days.when asked about the significance of the blank next to departure date,patel responded,i just write it down,you know,number of the days,so i writed sic it down,one.june.at.martin had previously rented room,but patel did not remember when.martin told her that he lost the key to room.
in addition,patel testified that the police came back the next day and showed her photographs.she picked one of the photographs as someone she knew.
when patel was by defense counsel,she repeatedly testified that the registration card indicated that martin stayed for only one day,january.patel acknowledged that she was the one who filled in the number of days martin had stayed.if a guest wanted to stay longer he would let patel know if they wanted to than one night,they telling us.june.at.she would then indicate that a guest had asked to stay longer and paid for the extra nights by marking it on the registration card.however,she did not have a registration card indicating that martin was staying at the hotel at the time the drugs were found.guests did not check out when they were ready to leave they paid in advance and simply left at the end of their stays.by the time of trial,patel testified that she did not specifically remember lee,but she did recall identifying someone.
the government also presented evidence that keys marked and were found when lee was searched,that lee had claimed south queen apartment his local address,and that spurill had made a phone call from the red carpet inn on the afternoon of january.
the parties stipulated that two bags of cocaine base were recovered from boyer.the smaller bag contained grams of cocaine base divided into nineteen baggies.the larger bag contained grams of cocaine base divided into baggies.the parties also stipulated that grams of cocaine base divided into baggies were recovered from a backpack in room,and that grams of cocaine base were recovered from bags under the bed in room.
just before deliberations began,the jury was provided with the trial exhibits,including the original copy of the hotel registration card.during its deliberations,the jury asked the following question what is the information on the back of the registration card in pencil june.at.this was the first time the parties,their counsel,or the district court realized that the registration card was a document.the back of the card contained dates handwritten by an unidentified person,suggesting that martin had been registered in room when the drugs admitted against lee were found there.this information completely undermined lee defense that he was not in the room on january,or.
lee objected that he was not provided the back of the card before trial and requested a mistrial.the district court denied the motion,finding that i do think that if there is any problem there,it certainly not anything that ca be cured by an instruction juries follow these instructions all the time and the law presume s they do.june.at.
the district court then called the jury into the courtroom and gave the following instruction 
i have examined sides of the document and i can instruct you and will instruct you that there has been no testimony as to the meaning of the notations on the back of the card.the testimony only had to do with the document as represented on the front of the card.
and there is no evidence before you and no testimony as to the meaning of the notations on the back of the card.
and i going to direct you to disregard the notations on the back of the registration card and not consider that as part of the evidence in the case when you evaluating the evidence and deliberating on your verdict.
lee claims that the government failure to provide the reverse of the registration card was a violation of federal rule of criminal procedure,regarding criminal discovery,that could only be remedied through a new trial.a trial court remedy for a discovery violation under its supervisory powers is reviewed for abuse of discretion while factual findings upon which the decision was based are reviewed for clear error.gov t of virgin islands fahie,cir.
rule provides that 
upon a defendant request,the government must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books,papers,documents,data,photographs,tangible objects,buildings or places,or copies or portions of any of these items,if the item is within the government possession,custody,or control and i the item is material to preparing the defense or ii the government intends to use the item in its at trial.
the government does not dispute that rule required it to disclose the back of the registration card and that it failed to do so before trial in fact,the government concedes that the reverse of the registration card would entirely defeat lee defense argument.appellee br.at.instead,the government argues that it met its rule obligation by providing defense counsel with access to the original exhibit during and after trial.while the government is correct that defense counsel could have averted this issue by examining the original exhibit before it was submitted to the jury,this does not alter the fact that the government had a duty to provide an accurate copy before trial.although it may be sound practice,defense counsel is not required to inspect every exhibit at trial to ensure that documents that appear to conform to the copies provided by the government are in fact identical instead,rule discovery requirements made it reasonable for defense counsel to rely on the government to provide,in the first instance,an accurate copy of the evidence offered at trial.
when a party fails to comply with rule,the district court is empowered to order that party to comply with the rule,grant a continuance,exclude the evidence,or enter other just relief.d.in determining an appropriate remedy,a district court should consider the reasons for the party delay in producing the materials,including whether it acted intentionally or in bad faith,and the degree of prejudice to the opposing party.united states ganier,cir see also fahie,at.accordingly,we must consider whether lee was prejudiced by the discovery violation and,if so,what remedy was required.
on appeal,a new trial is warranted to remedy a discovery violation where the remedy offered by the district court was inadequate to provide the defendant with a fair trial.united states lopez,cir quoting united states miller,cir alteration in original to determine whether the district court remedy was adequate,t he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.united states mitchell,cir quoting kyles whitley,d discussing standard for granting a new trial after a brady violation.
in evaluating the prejudice to lee,we must consider whether the discovery violation in this case caused jury contamination.e xposure to extrinsic information deprives a criminal defendant of the protections of the sixth amendment,including his right of confrontation,of,and of counsel.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted vacating conviction because district court provided extrinsic information to the jury during deliberations see also farese united states,cir stating that jury e xposure to evidence through discovery of secreted material is not subject to sixth amendment safeguards.thus,i t is perfectly plain that the jury room must be kept free of evidence not received during trial,and that its presence,if prejudicial,will vitiate the verdict.gov t of virgin islands joseph,cir internal quotation marks omitted holding that providing jury with a signed confession that was not admitted into evidence during deliberations violated defendant due process rights.this rule equally applies to material submitted to the jury through inadvertent attachment to properly admitted evidence.see,farese,at finding strong probability of prejudice to defendant when jury found by the government or defense in a trial exhibit united states brandenburg,cir granting defendant new trial where exhibits marked by the government with prejudicial annotations were sent to the jury.
the government argues that lee can not demonstrate prejudice because the reverse of the registration card was inculpatory rather than exculpatory.if not for the discovery violation,the government would have used the reverse of the registration card in formulating its case against lee,strengthening its position.because the district court instructed the jury to ignore the back of the registration card,the government believes that it did not obtain the benefit of this inculpatory evidence and that lee was not harmed by presenting a defense that was inconsistent with the reverse of the card.this argument is based on the assumption that the jury was able to follow the district court instruction to disregard the reverse of the registration card.we can not accept that assumption in this case.
we do presume that juries follow their instructions.see,richardson marsh,d united states bornman,cir.this rule is a pragmatic one,rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than in the belief that it represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the state and the defendant in the criminal justice process.richardson,at.however,the rule is not absolute we will not blindly assume that a jury is able to follow a district court instruction to ignore the elephant in the deliberation room.see,united states morena,cir holding that limiting instruction was not sufficient to cure prejudice resulting from persistent prosecutorial misconduct.for example,in the context of a jury tainted by material,we found that it was not reasonable to assume without inquiry that the jury would be able to follow an instruction to ignore the external material.gov t of virgin islands dowling,cir.in dowling,we held that 
where there is affirmative reason to believe that a member or members of the jury may have learned information about the underlying facts of the case that has a potential for adversely affecting the jury ability to impartially decide the case on the record evidence alone,the trial court has a duty to determine whether the trial should be aborted or whether the jury,with proper instructions,can be relied upon to judge impartially and to confine its deliberations to the record evidence.
id.at.in dowling,the district court asked the jurors to identify themselves if they had received information that had rendered them incapable of giving a fair trial to either side.id.at.we held that this question was inadequate to establish that the jurors would be able to disregard any material they had been exposed to,and remanded for a new trial.id.
the risk that a jury will be unable to follow the court instruction to ignore information depends on a number of factors including the strength of the proper evidence against the defendant,the nature of the information,and the manner in which the information was conveyed.see moore morton,cir dowling,at.united states urban,cir listing factors relevant to determining prejudice in a jury contamination case.
the government evidence connecting lee to the hotel room,apart from the reverse side of the hotel registration card,was relatively weak.keys marked and were found when lee was searched,but it was undisputed that lee was no longer staying in room someone who was later in a car with lee made a phone call from the red carpet inn and the clerk at the red carpet inn recognized lee as someone she knew.in contrast,the reverse of the registration card strongly supported an inference that lee was still renting the room when the drugs were found.as previously stated,the government admits that the reverse of the registration card would entirely defeat lee defense argument.appellee br.at.
the nature of the information on the reverse of the registration card and the manner in which it was conveyed also would have made it extremely difficult for the jury to ignore.the registration card itself was a properly admitted piece of evidence.unlike information obtained by reading news reports or overhearing gossip about a defendant,this information would have had much of the credibility of properly admitted evidence.the timing of the jury discovery of the notations on the back of the registration card also enha
