this case requires us to decide a familiar but difficult issue about the admissibility of prior bad act evidence under federal rules of evidence b and.the government alleged that defendant george varoudakis,charged with arson and conspiracy to commit arson in violation of i and,hired an acquaintance to burn down his failing restaurant,destinations,in order to collect insurance proceeds.following his conviction,varoudakis argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of a prior bad act,namely,testimony by varoudakis girlfriend and in the destinations arson,cheryl britt,that she saw varoudakis set fire to his leased car sixteen months before the destinations fire.we agree with varoudakis that the evidence should have been excluded under rule,and that the error was not harmless.accordingly,we vacate the judgment.
we recite the following undisputed facts or describe the testimony of certain witnesses.
in,george varoudakis opened a restaurant and night club called destinations at one congress street in boston.the establishment general manager was cheryl britt,varoudakis girlfriend since the.initially,destinations succeeded financially,but business declined about a year after it opened.varoudakis paid his suppliers cash on delivery and owed his workers back wages.his landlord claimed in back rent and damages,and began eviction proceedings in december.
in late,after several years of carrying insurance that was inadequate under the terms of his lease,varoudakis increased the contents insurance coverage for destinations to and bought business interruption insurance for.cheryl britt testified that varoudakis told her he increased the insurance so he could burn the restaurant and collect the insurance proceeds.
in january,varoudakis filed for bankruptcy for one congress street,a corporation he controlled that owned destinations in february,he filed for destinations,a separate company.varoudakis initiated these filings under chapter,allowing reorganization by the.in march,he filed for personal bankruptcy.also in march,the one congress street petition was voluntarily converted to chapter,which requires the debtor to transfer control to a bankruptcy trustee.on april,two days after the fire at destinations,the destinations petition was voluntarily converted to chapter.
britt testified that several weeks before the april fire,varoudakis told her to stop paying destinations bills.as a result,britt did not pay the february insurance bill.on march,the insurance policy was cancelled.at trial,varoudakis relied on the cancellation to contest the government theory that he burned destinations to collect insurance.britt,however,testified that varoudakis did not know the insurance was cancelled.
also sometime in march,varoudakis began moving sound and lighting equipment from destinations to a property he owned in everett.several employees worked long hours loading the equipment into trucks on the days and nights leading up to the fire.according to britt and others,the removal included a,tables,kitchen equipment,liquor,and paperwork.more than worth of equipment was removed.
britt and her sister,diane casey,testified that at the end of march,varoudakis hired casey boyfriend,nick adams,to torch destinations.britt said that varoudakis told her to pay adams when the job was completed.
on the night of april,varoudakis went to the foxwoods casino with two friends.britt and casey testified that he instructed casey to switch shifts with destinations scheduled night manager,mansour alrisheq,on the night of april because alrisheq did not know of the planned arson.casey also said varoudakis told her to give adams the keys to destinations.
destinations burned on april.investigators determined that arson caused the fire.varoudakis did not dispute this finding at trial.
in the early morning of april,apparently believing he had insurance,varoudakis called his insurance agent from foxwoods to report the fire.britt testified that when varoudakis learned that the fire damage to destinations was not extensive,he was furious with adams for having botched the job.
when interviewed about the fire in september,varoudakis,who was not then a suspect,told investigators that the fire might have been connected with the robbery of the destinations,which held between and,and that a rival greek club might be responsible.he also mentioned casey and adams as suspects.
cheryl britt initially denied to investigators that varoudakis had hired adams to set the fire.after she learned that varoudakis had accused casey and adams,and after investigators told her she could be indicted,she implicated varoudakis.in the course of these discussions with investigators in october,britt was promised immunity.however,she lied about her involvement in the fire and her relationship with varoudakis to investigators and in two grand jury appearances.the government did not revoke her immunity.at varoudakis trial,britt was one of the government main witnesses.
on february,after a trial,a jury convicted varoudakis of both arson and conspiracy to commit arson.at the end of the second of deliberations,the jury wrote the court a note saying at this current time,we are at an impasse.could you tell us how to proceed.the court told the jury to stop for the day and continue on the following day.after another day and a half of deliberations,the jury found varoudakis guilty.
at trial,the court allowed cheryl britt to testify that in december she saw varoudakis set fire to a cadillac he had leased.britt said that varoudakis parked the car on a piece of property he owned in everett and that he left in another car to buy gasoline,with her as a passenger.when he returned,he threw newspapers into the back of the cadillac,poured gasoline over them,and ignited the newspapers.britt said varoudakis told her that he torched the car because the lease had expired and he owed excess mileage charges,and that he expected insurance to cover the loss.on of britt,varoudakis offered the car lease agreement to impeach britt testimony that the lease had expired.the agreement showed that the lease had months remaining following britt testimony,officer richard gamby of the everett police department testified that he investigated the burning of a cadillac in december that matched britt description.
varoudakis argues that the car fire evidence should not have been admitted under rule b because its sole purpose was to demonstrate criminal propensity,or that the evidence should not have been admitted under rule because its probative value was substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect.the government responds that the car fire evidence was properly admitted,or,if not,that its admission was harmless error.
we review the district court determination that the prior bad act evidence was admissible under b and for an abuse of discretion.see united states balsam,cir.
standard for admission under federal rule of evidence b 
rule b provides that evidence of a defendant prior bad acts may not be admitted to prove his criminal character or propensity to commit crimes of the sort for which he is on trial to admit evidence of prior bad acts,a trial court must find that the evidence passes two tests.first,the evidence must have special relevance to an issue in the case such as intent or knowledge,and must not include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.united states frankhauser,cir.second,under rule,evidence that is specially relevant may still be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
as the text of rule b indicates,prior bad act evidence may be specially relevant if,for example,it goes to the defendant intent,knowledge,plan,absence of mistake,or identity.additionally,prior bad acts may be admitted in conspiracy cases under b if they explain the background,formation,and development of the illegal relationship.united states jesus,cir.see also united states prevatte,cir united states jones,cir united states passarella,cir united states magnano,cir.we have focused on two factors to determine the probative value of prior bad act evidence the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of resemblance to the crime charged.frankhauser,at,quoting united states fields,cir.
applying rule b 
the court ruling 
immediately before the opening statements of counsel,in response to a motion in limine filed by the defendant to exclude the car fire evidence,the court ruled that britt testimony about the car fire would be admissible to show varoudakis plan,knowledge,and intent in relation to whether he knowingly participated in a common scheme to defraud.in support of this rationale,the court cited the government allegations that varoudakis committed both the car fire and the destinations arson for a financial motive and with one of the same conspirators britt.
the court cited united states,cir,cert.denied,d,as authority for its ruling.in,the defendants,who were gang members,were convicted of an october arson.the trial court admitted prior bad act evidence primarily concerning two other recent fires.like the arson charged,both fires had also destroyed businesses owned by the defendants and insured by the same insurance company.these fires occurred just two months and six months before the october fire.in upholding the court decision to admit the evidence,we said the issue at trial was not just whether defendant latorre committed arson.the broader issue was whether latorre knowingly participated in a common scheme to defraud.id.at.
there are important differences between the facts supporting a common scheme rationale in and this case.unlike the recurring fires in arsons of business properties in six testimony does not suggest a plan connecting the car fire to the destinations fire.in united states lynn,cir,we held that evidence of a prior conviction for marijuana was not admissible to show a common plan or scheme connected to the defendant instant prosecution for marijuana distribution because there was no evidence that the previous offense leads in a progression to the second.id.at.similarly here,no evidence suggests that a continuing or connected scheme linked the car fire and the destinations fire.id.
the district court also saw the car fire evidence as specially relevant to the destinations fire on the ground that britt acted as varoudakis in both instances.the court was correct that prior bad act evidence is admissible to prove conspiracy in cases where the earlier crime involved the same participants as the charged crime.united states hadfield,cir,citing united states flores perez,cir.see also,at the evidence of latorre involvement with the same people in past arson and fraud schemes is especially probative of the issue whether he was an innocent tool of others or a knowing participant in the conspiracy.
britt,however,did not participate in the car fire as a.according to her testimony,and there was no contrary evidence,she was a witness who went along for the ride.by contrast,she testified that she helped varoudakis with the destinations fire,removing restaurant equipment and paying adams for his work.her lack of participation in the car fire distinguishes this aspect of the case from,in which the defendant and his fellow gang members played the same roles in committing the prior arsons as they did in the arson for which the defendant was charged.
finally,the court said that the car fire was specially relevant to varoudakis motive to commit the destinations fire because,in both instances,he allegedly committed arson to alleviate a financial burden by collecting insurance proceeds.unlike knowledge and intent,motive is not an element of the crime that the government must prove.for that reason,proof of motive must be offered to show some other element,for example,that the crime was committed,the identity of the accused,or the accused requisite mental state.see charles wright kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure.
when prior bad act evidence is offered to prove a motive for the crime,courts must be on guard to prevent the motive label from being used to smuggle forbidden evidence of propensity to the jury.id.that is the problem here.as proof of motive,the car fire testimony is offered as circumstantial evidence that varoudakis committed the destinations fire.it involves an inference of propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.frankhauser,at.put most simply,the government argues that varoudakis commission of the car fire arson in response to financial stress makes it more likely that he committed the restaurant arson in response to financial stress.contrast this forbidden inference with the permissible inference to be drawn in a case in which the prior bad,a botched robbery by the defendant that was frustrated by the ineptitude of his the motive for the defendants subsequent assault on his cohort.there the prior bad act would provide circumstantial evidence of the commission of the assault without the involvement of any propensity inference.
in a case that also involved arson of a restaurant owned by the defendant,the eleventh circuit excluded evidence that the defendant,in a separate incident,threatened to burn out a tenant after she did not pay a full month rent.see united states utter,cir.as in this case,the government argued that the tenant testimony would show how the defendant reacts to financial stress.id the court rejected this rationale,stating this is the type of character and propensity evidence prohibited by rule b.id.see also lynn,at.for the same reason,we find error in the district court financial motive rationale.
the relationship 
there is,however,a proper rationale for admitting the car fire evidence under b that differs subtly,but importantly,from the district court rationale that britt was a in both fires.the government urges on appeal that the car fire evidence was properly admitted because it demonstrates the background and formation of the conspiratorial relationship between varoudakis and britt during the planning for and commission of the destinations fire.
in united states jesus,cir,we said that prior bad act evidence is admissible to help the jury understand the basis for the relationship of mutual trust.id.see also united states love,cir united states pipola,cir united states rosa,cir united states diaz,cir.the district court in jesus admitted evidence about an uncharged heroin deal between the defendant,who was charged with other crimes,and one of his.we reasoned that the heroin purchase was relevant and admissible because it helped to explain the history between rodriguez and escobar,whose relationship was directly in issue and material to the case.jesus,at.
cheryl britt relationship with george varoudakis was similarly material to the conspiracy case against him.britt testified to the key facts that varoudakis hired nick adams to torch destinations and that he believed he still had insurance when the arson took place.britt testimony also refuted varoudakis alibi,and his claim that he removed the sound system and other equipment for a legitimate purpose.
britt knew these things because varoudakis trusted her.her testimony that he allowed her to watch him torch his cadillac demonstrated that trust.it also demonstrated varoudakis willingness to involve her in some way in his illegal acts.like the prior bad act evidence admitted in jesus,britt car fire testimony helped explain the nature of their relationship.
the defense argues that the prior bad act evidence should not be admissible to show the background and formation of britt relationship with varoudakis because varoudakis did not dispute that he and britt were intimates.at first blush,this argument seems plausible.however,we have held that evidence of prior bad acts may be probative even when it is relevant to an issue that the defendant does not contest.for example,such evidence may be admitted to show knowledge or intent when the defense is a general denial of the charges,see united states oppon,cir,or a claim of mistaken identity,see united states,cir.after all,the fact that the defendant does not contest the issue for which the prior bad act evidence is offered does not,by itself,remove those issues from the case.id.
we conclude,therefore,that the car fire evidence is specially relevant under rule b to varoudakis relationship with britt because it shows that he trusted her so much that he was willing to commit a crime in her presence we further conclude,however,that the contention that the government did not need the car fire evidence to prove the close relationship between britt and varoudakis remains a pertinent question in the rule analysis,which requires weighing the evidence probative value against its unfairly prejudicial effect.see united states gilbert,cir.
prior bad act evidence that surmounts the bar of rule b may still be inadmissible under rule.this rule requires the trial court to exclude the evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.otherwise relevant evidence may also be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by confusion of the issues,or misleading of the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.id.
the district court determination on this issue merits great deference on appeal.see hadfield,at.nonetheless,we find that in this case the district court erred in finding that the car fire evidence was admissible under rule.
under rule weighing test,it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.united states,cir.we stress unfair because b y design,all evidence is meant to be prejudicial.id.usually,courts use the term unfair prejudice for evidence that invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.for example,we have upheld the exclusion of prior bad act evidence in part because it was undeniably explosive,gilbert,at.we are also cautious when the prior act is a shocking or heinous crime likely to inflame the jury.united states moccia,cir.
as the district court noted,the car fire evidence is not particularly shocking.there is little danger that it swayed the jury toward a conviction on an emotional basis.but rule also protects defendants from unfair prejudice resulting from criminal propensity evidence as the supreme court has stated,improper grounds under rule certainly include generalizing a defendant earlier bad act into bad character and taking that as raising the odds that he did the later bad act now charged.old chief united states,d.
to be sure,all prior bad act evidence involves some potential for an improper propensity inference.that is why,under rule b,the possibility that a jury may infer something negative about a defendant character or propensity to commit crime does not make the evidence inadmissible unless no permissible inference may also be drawn.see,at.under rule,however,that risk of an improper criminal propensity inference should be considered in light of the totality of the circumstances,including the government need for the evidence given other available testimony,to prove the issue identified pursuant to the b special relevance analysis.see old chief,at.what counts as the rule probative value of an item of evidence,as distinct from its rule relevance,may be calculated by comparing evidentiary alternatives 
here is the crux of our analysis.the prejudice to an opponent can be said to be unfair when the proponent of the evidence could prove the fact by other,evidence.wright graham,supra.doubts about the probative value of prior bad acts evidence are thus compounded when prosecutors have other evidence available,rendering negligible their need to show intent by the prior bad acts.lynn,at see also wright graham,supra,the probative value of any particular bit of evidence is obviously affected by the scarcity or abundance of other evidence on the same point.
our recent holding in gilbert incorporated the understanding of rule unfair prejudice that we articulate here.in that case,we affirmed on interlocutory appeal a district court decision to exclude a variety of prior bad act evidence.we cited as factors the risk that the jury would infer criminal propensity,and the government lack of need for the evidence.see gilbert,at we simply do not see how the jury could regard the prior bad act evidence as specially relevant without drawing a forbidden inference of criminal propensity w e do not find particularly compelling the government argument that it has a strong need for this evidence.
there is clearly a tension between rules b and.the more similar the prior bad act evidence is to the charged crime,the more likely it is to be deemed relevant under b.yet the more the prior bad act resembles the crime,the more likely it is that the jury will infer that a defendant who committed the prior bad act would be likely to commit the crime charged.see united states beechum,cir the more closely the extrinsic offense resembles the charged offense,the greater the prejudice to the defendant.this is precisely the kind of inference that rule guards against.see lynn,at the ordinary inference here would seem very close to the inference the rule was designed to avoid.
applying rule 
the government primarily used the car fire evidence to cast varoudakis as an arsonist.in its opening statement,the government said the following now,the defendant knew very well how to plan an arson because this was the first arson he had planned.although rule b permits the admission of prior bad acts evidence as proof of plan,we have already concluded that no common plan or scheme linked the car fire and the destinations fire.see supra.in reality,this opening statement underscored varoudakis criminal propensity to burn destinations because of the car fire.in questioning britt about the car fire,the government did not stress the development of her relationship with varoudakis,a proper rationale for admission under b.instead,britt testimony focused on the facts of the car fire and varoudakis statement to her that he burned the car to collect insurance coverage.
moreover,as in gilbert,the probative value of the car fire evidence was minimal.the government did not need the car fire to demonstrate the close nature of varoudakis relationship with britt.britt testified that she and varoudakis began a romantic relationship in about,and that they lived together for six years,beginning in about,in an apartment that varoudakis helped britt purchase.britt said varoudakis bought her jewelry and furniture and took her on expensive vacations.
britt also testified that she allowed him to list her as the president,treasurer,clerk,and director of destinations,a corporation in which she had no financial interest.she said she knew about varoudakis dispute over rental payments with the destinations landlord.because her name was on the destinations incorporation papers,she wrote the rent checks.as she said at trial me and george varoudakis sic communicated a lot if something came up.britt also testified that she heard varoudakis discussions with a potential buyer for destinations.she signed the destinations bankruptcy petition.
the government also did not need the car fire evidence to prove varoudakis knowledge or intent relating to the destinations arson.varoudakis denied setting the fire at all,rather than arguing that he burned destinations unknowingly or unintentionally.there was no evidence suggesting that varoudakis was an innocent tool of others in the arson conspiracy like the defendant in,at.the absence of a dispute on these issues weighs against admitting the evidence under.see gilbert,at citing as a factor weighing in favor of exclusion that four of the five issues adduced by the government in support of admitting the prior bad act evidence do not appear to be much in dispute in this case.lynn,at while we do not undermine the government substantial burden of proof,we do note that in this instance,intent,while technically at issue,was not really in dispute,greatly reducing any need for the jury to know of the previous conviction.footnote omitted.
we recognize that our analysis must evaluate the trial court decision from its perspective when it had to rule and not indulge in review by hindsight.old chief,at.at the start of the trial,the district court denied varoudakis motion in limine to exclude the car fire evidence.when the government began to ask britt about t
