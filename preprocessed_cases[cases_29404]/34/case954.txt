defendant dominick pizzonia appeals from a judgment of conviction for conspiracy to violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,which was entered on october,by judge jack weinstein after a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.see c d.presently incarcerated serving a prison term,pizzonia invokes the statute of limitations to challenge his conviction.he contends that the indictment limited the scope of the charged conspiracy to seven predicate acts.because the jury found only two of these acts proved,both of which fell outside the relevant limitations period,pizzonia submits that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to.
the argument is unconvincing for several reasons the indictment alleged that it was the pattern of the conspiracy consisted of the charged predicate acts a racketeering conspiracy is a concept distinct from a the pattern of racketeering through which the conspirators agree to participate in the affairs of the charged enterprise,and b the predicate acts that may evidence the pattern while predicate acts within the limitations period can demonstrate the racketeering conspiracy existence during that time,this temporal requirement can also be satisfied by other evidence a jury properly views predicate acts in light of the totality of the circumstances to determine whether they manifest the threat of continued criminal activity essential to prove a pattern of racketeering,and such circumstances,no less than the predicate acts themselves,can prove a conspiracy existence beyond the conclusion of the last predicate act and in any event,a racketeering conspiracy,like any other conspiracy,is presumed to continue until it achieves its criminal object,and the object of a racketeering conspiracy is to conduct the affairs of a charged enterprise through a pattern of racketeering,not to commit discrete predicate acts.
as judge weinstein correctly observed,even though the predicate acts proved in this case were outside the statute of limitations,other trial evidence permitted the jury to conclude that both the charged racketeering conspiracy and pizzonia membership in it continued into the limitations period.see sentencing tr.at.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of conviction.
background 
a.the relevant limitations period 
on may,a federal grand jury in the eastern district of new york returned an indictment against pizzonia for the racketeering conspiracy at issue in this case.thus,all parties agree that pursuant to the statute of limitations established by,the government was required to prove pizzonia participation in the conspiracy sometime after may.
b.the fourth superseding indictment 
pizzonia ultimately stood trial on a fourth superseding indictment returned on december,the indictment.thus,we focus on the language of that pleading on this appeal.
the indictment charged that from approximately through september,pizzonia,alfred dicongilio,and others employed by or associated with a specific enterprise,to wit,the gambino organized crime family of la cosa nostra,indictment,conspired to conduct and participate,directly and indirectly,in the conduct of the affairs of that enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity,id.the indictment stated that the principal purpose of the gambino crime family was to generate money for its members and associates through a wide range of criminal activities,including extortion,illegal gambling,interstate transportation of stolen goods,loansharking,narcotics trafficking and robbery.id.to further these criminal moneymaking activities,gambino members and associates would engage in still other crimes,some involving the use and threatened use of physical violence,including murder.id.the indictment identified a number of secondary enterprise objectives for which gambino members and associates also employed criminal means,including violence and murder,to settle personal grievances and vendettas,to prevent detection by law enforcement,and to coordinate criminal activities with other organized crime families.see id.
the indictment alleged that the gambino family operated through various crews,which consisted of a number of made family members sometimes referred to as soldiers as well as associates.id.each crew was headed by a captain.each captain reported to the family boss,who was himself assisted by an underboss and a consigliere in supervising and protecting the family overall activities.id.at various times,pizzonia served as a captain,acting captain,soldier or associate within the gambino family.id.
the indictment charged that the pattern of racketeering activity through which the defendants agreed to conduct the affairs of the enterprise consisted of seven numbered racketeering acts,some of which were divided into lettered subparts.id.emphasis added.these predicate acts were as follows 
act one,a from through june,pizzonia,dicongilio,and unnamed others conspired to murder frank boccia.
act one,b in june,pizzonia,dicongilio,and unnamed others murdered frank boccia.
act two,a from september through december,pizzonia and unnamed others conspired to murder rosemary and thomas uva.
act two,b on december,pizzonia and unnamed others murdered rosemary uva.
act three on december,pizzonia and unnamed others murdered thomas uva.
act four between and,pizzonia and unnamed others conspired to use extortionate means to collect extensions of credit from john doe.
act five between december and may,pizzonia and unnamed others conspired to use extortionate means to collect extensions of credit from john doe.
act six,a between and june,pizzonia and unnamed others made extortionate extensions of credit to john doe.
act six,b between and june,pizzonia and unnamed others used extortionate means to collect and attempt to collect an extension of credit from john doe.
act seven,a between january and january,pizzonia,dicongilio and unnamed others participated in an illegal gambling business.
act seven,b between january and january,pizzonia,dicongilio,and unnamed others profited from the same illegal gambling activity.
at trial,the prosecution offered extensive testimonial and physical evidence that convincingly established the existence of the charged enterprise its moneymaking purpose and its members use of various criminal means to achieve that purpose and to protect the enterprise from internal disloyalty,outside rivalry,and law enforcement detection.similarly,ample evidence was adduced demonstrating pizzonia association with the charged enterprise,including his induction as a made member of the gambino family in,and his eventual promotion to the role of captain in.because the sufficiency of this evidence is not challenged generally,but only as it pertains to the statute of limitations,we do not review it further except as necessary to address pizzonia timeliness challenge on appeal.
to establish pizzonia participation in a conspiracy to conduct the affairs of the gambino family through a pattern of racketeering activity,the government sought to prove the charged predicate acts.the jury found proved pizzonia involvement in only two of the seven acts the conspiracy to murder rosemary and thomas uva act two,a and the substantive gambling offense act seven,a and b while these crimes,on their face,may appear distinct and complete,the jury concluded from the totality of the evidence that,in fact,they manifested the relationship and continuity essential to form a pattern of racketeering.see nw.bell,d.
further,although the proved predicates ended well before may,the jury found that the charged racketeering conspiracy continued after that date and,specifically,into the limitations period.on this point,the district court instructed the jury that the government could not satisfy the statute of limitations simply by proving that the gambino family continued to operate after may.the jury had to find that pizzonia knowingly participated after that date in the charged conspiracy.without objection,the court instructed the jury as follows 
the statute of limitations for the racketeering conspiracy charged in count one is five years as to defendant pizzonia,you must determine whether the rico conspiracy charged in count one,and pizzonia participation in the charged conspiracy,continued beyond may.even if you find that the gambino family existed beyond may,you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant pizzonia knowingly participated in the charged rico conspiracy,that count one,beyond may.
tr.at.to confirm the jury comprehension of this instruction,the court interrupted its delivery of the charge to ask do you understand that,everybody id.at.it then noted on the record that e verybody on the jury is nodding in agreement.id.
among the evidence offered by the government to prove pizzonia participation in the charged conspiracy after may,was testimony from former gambino captain michael dileonardo that,in late or,pizzonia,then also a captain,served on a gambino family committee charged with the duty to shake the trees,which dileonardo explained meant to increase the collection of proceeds from family members illegal activities.id.at.
defendant rule motion for a judgment of acquittal 
after the jury returned its verdict finding pizzonia guilty of racketeering conspiracy,defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to.on the ground that the government failure to prove a charged predicate act after may,necessarily precluded it from carrying its burden on the statute of limitations.the district court denied the motion,observing that ample record evidence supported a jury finding that both the charged conspiracy and pizzonia membership in it continued into the limitations period.see sentencing tr.at,pizzonia never abandoned the conspiracy.he never withdrew from it.and the conspiracy continued up to and through the time of the trial.
the district court sentenced pizzonia principally to fifteen years incarceration.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that,on a defendant motion after verdict,the court must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.a.pizzonia argues that the district court erred in denying his rule motion because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove the existence of the charged conspiracy or his participation in it anytime between may,and may,the relevant limitations period.specifically,he asserts that by pleading that the pattern of racketeering activity consisted of the seven alleged predicate acts,the indictment so defined the scope of the charged conspiracy and,thus,temporally limited the conspiracy to the predicates.because the proved predicate conspiracy to murder the uvas,which concluded with their deaths on christmas eve,and the substantive gambling operation,which was alleged to have occurred between and not extend into the limitations period,pizzonia insists his conviction can not stand.
we review the denial of a rule motion de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see united states amico,cir.applying this standard,we reject pizzonia construction of the indictment because it conflates the crime of conspiracy to violate rico,see d,with the pattern element of the substantive rico violation that the conspirators intended to commit,see id.c.like the district court,we conclude that,in proving the existence of the charged rico conspiracy within the statute of limitations,the government was not limited to the predicate acts that were pleaded to demonstrate the intended pattern.we further conclude that the totality of the evidence permitted a reasonable jury to find that the charged conspiracy did continue beyond may,and therefore into the limitations period.see united states abdulle,cir 
b.the temporal scope of the rico conspiracy was not limited to the charged or proved predicate acts 
rico,specifically c,makes it a substantive crime for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.section d,in turn,makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to violate the substantive provisions of rico.when read in conjunction with the language of c,rico conspiracy provision thus proscribes an agreement to conduct or to participate in the conduct of the enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity 
pizzonia does not challenge this articulation of the law.rather,he contends that the prosecution narrowly defined the scope of the charged conspiracy by specifying in the indictment that the pattern of racketeering activity consisted of seven enumerated predicate acts.pizzonia submits that,on such a pleading,a conspiracy to participate in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering can not,as a matter of law,temporally extend beyond the commission of the last proved predicate.we are not persuaded.
at the outset,we note that the indictment alleges that the pattern of racketeering the conspiracy of the specified predicates the pattern of racketeering activity through which the defendants dominick pizzonia and alfred dicongilio agreed to conduct the affairs of the enterprise consisted of the racketeering acts set forth below as racketeering acts one through seven of this superseding indictment.see indictment.the distinction is significant.as this court emphasized in united states persico,cir,the agreement proscribed by section d is a conspiracy to participate in a charged enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering,not a conspiracy to commit predicate acts,id.at.thus,in persico,even though the last predicate acts ascribable to the defendants occurred more than five years prior to the date of the indictment,we concluded from the totality of the evidence that the government amply demonstrated that the conspiracy to conduct the affairs of the enterprise charged in that case continued until,and well after the date the superseding indictment was filed,id.at.on that basis,we upheld the defendants convictions for rico conspiracy 
just as the evidence used to establish the enterprise and pattern elements may in particular cases coalesce,united states turkette,d see also united states eppolito,cir,so too may the evidence used to prove those elements and a conspiratorial agreement to engage in racketeering,see united states martino,cir prosecution of rico substantive and conspiracy charges expectedly involves considerable overlap in the evidence.citing iannelli united states,d.the concepts of racketeering conspiracy,enterprise,and pattern,however,are not interchangeable.as we explained in united states russotti,cir,it is neither the enterprise standing alone nor the pattern of racketeering activity by itself which rico criminalizes,but r ather,the combination of these two elements,id.at emphasis omitted.it follows,then,that the pattern element of racketeering can not by itself define a d conspiracy.to understand the scope of the jointly undertaken scheme,one must also consider the enterprise that the conspirators agreed to conduct through a pattern of racketeering.in short,a rico conspiracy is never simply an agreement to commit specified predicate acts that allegedly form a pattern of racketeering.nor is it merely an agreement to join in a particular enterprise.rather,it is an agreement to conduct or to participate in the conduct of a charged enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering.see united states persico,at.for that reason,while a rico conspiracy existence within the statute of limitations may well be proved by evidence of predicate acts occurring within the limitations period,see united states yannotti,at observing that proof of predicate acts by established continuation of charged conspiracy into limitations period,that is not the only means by which the law temporal requirement can be satisfied,see united states persico,at.
pizzonia nevertheless insists that by specifying in the indictment that the pattern of racketeering consists of the seven enume
