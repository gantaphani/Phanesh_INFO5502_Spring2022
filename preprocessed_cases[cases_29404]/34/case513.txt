we are called upon today to determine the legitimate scope of a congressional enactment aimed at the vexing problem of internet predation.the statute in question,b,criminalizes the use of any instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce,such as the internet,to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.we conclude that,in enacting section b,congress said what it meant and meant what it said.consequently,we reject the appellant thesis that section b should be interpreted to include,as an additional element of the offense,an intent that the underlying sexual activity actually take place.
in view of this holding and our determination that the government adduced sufficient evidence to support the appellant convictions on all the counts that were tried,we affirm the judgment below.the tale follows.
background 
because this appeal involves a challenge to the sufficiency of the government proof,we rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,consistent with record support.see united states carroll,cir.
for a period of approximately ten months beginning in the spring of,matthew dwinells engaged in extensive internet contact with three different correspondents thought to be teenage girls.in fact,the girls were histrionic law enforcement officers.that misconception proved to be the appellant undoing.
the first electronic with whom the appellant communed was maria,whose profile made her out to be a living in dayton,ohio.but profiles can be misleading,and maria was in actuality a persona developed by two dayton police detectives.
in april of,maria entered a yahoo chatroom dedicated to musings about love and lust there,maria met the appellant,who truthfully identified himself as matthew dwinells,a man from lawrence,massachusetts.the conversation quickly accelerated through the mutual use of instant messaging,which allows internet users to contact each other for private,conversations.after only two chats,the appellant voiced his desire to marry maria once she turned eighteen.
further intimacies soon were exchanged.for example,the pair chatted about the style and color of maria panties,and maria sent the appellant a picture of herself in a cheerleading outfit.thereafter,the appellant declared that he wanted to have a baby with her.
all in all,the appellant conversed with maria over the internet on more than one hundred occasions.in addition,he initiated several telephone calls.after maria responded positively to an inquiry as to whether she would like to see the appellant penis,he sent her a picture of it by computer and then asked her in graphic detail exactly what she wanted to do with it 
in various chats,the appellant promised maria that he would teach her how to swallow his ejaculate and asked her whether it was ok for him to take her virginity.he also stated that he wished maria was with him,that he wanted her in his bed,and she would mail him her would start a clothes drawer for her in his house.in response to repeated requests of this sort,the detectives posing as maria sent the appellant feminine undergarments and a series of staged photographs.
the appellant amorous conversations were not characterized by much in the way of.he mentioned gifts of a diamond ring and a toe ring but never sent either one.similarly,he said that he would give maria a prepaid cellular telephone but never made the gift.he offered to buy,but did not actually purchase,lingerie for her.he promised her a weekly allowance but failed to forward any cash.and on three separate may,july,and august of made and then scuttled plans to visit her 
the appellant apparently had a wandering eye.beginning in july of,he also started to chat electronically with paige,whose profile described her as a girl from south carolina paige was a shared nom de plume for a local south carolina police detective and a federal agent a postal inspector investigating sex crimes to whom he handed off the persona.
the appellant met paige in a chatroom labeled i love older men,where paige engaged in a sexually explicit conversation with him and said that she had sexually revealing pictures of herself.the appellant rose to the bait and expressed interest in these depictions.paige requested,and received,his address in lawrence,massachusetts.the appellant went on to ask for paige underwear,and the pair discussed how the appellant might visit paige.
plans for a south carolina rendezvous never came to fruition.the two agreed that they would meet in august,and,on august,the appellant promised to visit in two weeks.on august,the visit was rescheduled to august.but on august,the appellant informed paige that obligations precluded the assignation.
notwithstanding this setback,the talk about a rendezvous persisted.in september,the couple discussed the possibility of paige visiting the appellant in boston.the appellant proposed that they meet at south station boston principal ground transportation hub and signaled his intentions by observing that if i get caught im in jail.paige replied that she would keep their rendezvous secret and then began to mention specific flight and bus schedules that could take her to boston.the appellant helped paige make sense of the schedules,checked to ensure that paige had identification that would allow her to fly,and repeatedly assured her that he would send travel money.he continued to press her to transmit more photographs.the last conversation between the two occurred on september.the travel money never arrived.
the same postal inspector later developed a new persona ashley,paige cousin from south carolina.on september,ashley and the appellant met.the appellant immediately sought to obtain pictures of her.in a chat less than three weeks later,ashley expressed a fear of the roving sniper who was then terrorizing washington.the appellant gallantly told her to come here so that he could keep her safe.he offered her travel money but worried aloud that if she came,it would be rape if they slept together.ashley assured him that she would consent and,thus,avoid the stigma.apparently grateful for this concession,the appellant promised ashley that should she become impregnated,she would receive as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy.
in the end,ashley never received any travel money from the appellant.he did,however,buy lingerie for her in exchange for a promise to send him the underwear she was wearing as well as some photographs.on two in and again in appellant made vague promises that he would visit ashley.neither trip materialized.
on march,federal authorities conducted a search of the appellant home.the appellant was present at the time of the search.a dresser drawer in the appellant bedroom contained greeting cards,lingerie,and pictures sent by maria.
after having been arrested,the appellant agreed to speak with a law enforcement officer.among other things,he confessed to having movies and photographs of child pornography on his computer.
in a later sworn statement,the appellant admitted that his actions were wrong,but vouchsafed that he had acted just for fun and had thought of the internet as fantasy land.he said that his intentions were strictly fantasy and that he never intended to meet any of the young girls,engage in sex with them,or do anything more than chat.
in due course,a federal grand jury indicted the appellant on three counts of attempted enticement of a minor.see b.the indictment charged that the appellant had attempted to entice the three young girls one per count into engaging in acts that would violate either a massachusetts statute prohibiting sexual intercourse with minors under sixteen years of age.laws ch,or a massachusetts statute prohibiting unnatural and lascivious acts with such minors,id.ch.a superseding indictment added two more charges one for receipt of child pornography,a,and one for possession of child pornography,id.a b.
after some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,the appellant pleaded guilty to the two child pornography counts and proceeded to trial on the three enticement counts.the trial lasted six days.the appellant testified on his own behalf,advancing both an entrapment defense and a fantasy defense.under the latter theory,he left himself room to maneuver he either knew that his correspondents were adults or believed that their conversations constituted mutually entertained fantasies,in which proposals for assignations and lurid descriptions of sexual acts were merely fanciful embellishments in an elaborate game.the jury was not buying it rejected these defenses and found the appellant guilty on all three counts.the district court denied his renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and,on march,sentenced him to months in prison.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
before us,the appellant propounds two claims of error.one relates to statutory interpretation the other relates to alleged evidentiary insufficiency.we discuss them separately.
statutory interpretation.
the appellant most touted ground of appeal concerns the interpretation of the statute of conviction.that statute reads in relevant part 
whoever,using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce,or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states knowingly persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of years,to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,or attempts to do so,shall be punished as provided.
plainly,the statute requires that a defendant possess the specific intent to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor into committing some illegal sexual activity the appellant contends that an additional intent element should be read into the statute an intent that the enticed conduct actually take place.ably represented,he musters a plethora of arguments in support of that position.
the appellant first strives to convince us that a double intent requirement,such as he envisions here,is not a curiosity.we agree to some extent with his premise reading a criminal statute to provide for a double intent would not be without analogues in the law.many statutes criminalize an act when paired with an intent to perform some other,distinct act.a common example is breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.see.laws ch.yet,typically,such statutes provide explicitly for that additional element of intent.see,cal.penal west penal law mckinney.
seen in this light,the appellant premise does not take him very far.in stark contrast to the of statutes involving heterogenous intent requirements,there is nothing on the face of section b providing for an added intent element.thus,the appellant analogues have a boomerang effect.section b appears to be the opposite of what the appellant statute in which congress deliberately refrained from including an additional intent element.
the appellant next asks us to take into account the substantial jail to fifteen to violations of section b.it would be implausibly draconian,he maintains,for a incarcerative sentence to attach to an attempt to entice unaccompanied by a corresponding intent to consummate the underlying sexual activity.
this is a shell argument that hinges on matters of policy,not on statutory construction.absent eighth amendment none are apparent is not the proper function of the courts to act as,passing judgment upon congress penological determinations.see,neal united states,d.
another observation seems pertinent in response to this plaint.congress recently amended section b,see adam walsh child protection and safety act of,stat,marking the third consecutive increase in the maximum available sentence for violations of section b.see,stat,establishing maximum imprisonment term of ten years,stat,increasing maximum term to fifteen years,a b b a,stat,inserting mandatory minimum and increasing statutory maximum to thirty years.to us,this suggests a crystallizing vision on congress part of the need for stern punishment in this milieu.
perhaps more importantly,by the time congress passed the most recent amendment to the applicable penalty provisions,every court of appeals that had reached this issue had determined that section b does not include an additional intent element.see united states thomas,cir united states patten,cir united states murrell,cir united states bailey,cir.assuming,as we are inclined to do,that congress keeps itself apprised of developments in the federal courts,we find the most likely inference to be that congress fully intended to treat acts like those attributed to the appellant with the utmost gravity,whether or not the accused intended that the enticed sex acts be consummated.
the appellant further suggests that his proposed interpretation of the statute is desirable because of either the rule of lenity or the principle of constitutional avoidance.these suggestions are unpersuasive.
the rule of lenity provides that in a criminal case,a court must resolve statutory ambiguity in favor of the accused.bifulco united states,d united states nippon paper indus,cir.but the sine qua non for the rule application is genuine ambiguity,and a statute is not ambiguous simply because litigants or even an occasional court question its interpretation.united states ahlers,cir see united states jimenez,cir explaining that genuine ambiguity requires more than a possible alternative construction.
the appellant tries to paint a picture of uncertainty by arguing that the courts of appeals have split over the interpretation of section b.but the case law does not support that gloomy assessment.although two courts of appeals,whilst upholding convictions under section b,have mentioned the defendant intent to engage in sexual acts,see united states meek,cir united states farner,cir,such a finding was not necessary to the decision in either instance.equally as significant,neither court sought to resolve the issue of what kind of intent was required by the statute.those decisions are,therefore,of no assistance to the appellant.
insofar as we can tell,the decisions that are on point uniformly reject the double intent hypothesis.see united states brand,cir thomas,at patten,at murrell,at bailey,at.we consider this view the recent decision in united states goetzke,cir.there,the ninth circuit seems to have held that section b does not require proof of an intent that the sexual acts take place.see id.at.
that ends this aspect of the matter.because the rule of lenity applies only when the meaning of a criminal statute is genuinely uncertain,ahlers,at,the rule simply does not pertain here.
the canon of constitutional avoidance is equally inapposite.that canon teaches that congress is presumed to legislate in accordance with the constitution and that,therefore,as between two plausible constructions of a statute,an inquiring court should avoid a constitutionally suspect one in favor of a constitutionally uncontroversial alternative.see ashwander tva.brandeis,concurring united states nascimento,cir.the appellant asseverates that,without a requirement that the accused intend consummation of the enticed sex acts,section b would threaten speech protected by the first amendment and,accordingly,that we should read that additional element into the statutory text.
this asseveration rests upon a porous foundation.for one thing,the doctrine of constitutional avoidance does not come into play unless alternative constructions of a statute are fairly possible.united states video,d.here,the absence of any ambiguity defeats the constitutional avoidance argument.see,jones united states,d noting that,as a precondition to application of the canon of constitutional avoidance,the statute in question must be fairly susceptible to differing constructions nascimento,at courts simply are not free to interpret statutes as becoming inoperative when they approach constitutional limits.internal quotation marks omitted.
for another thing,implementation of the doctrine of constitutional avoidance also requires the presence of substantial constitutional questions.video,at.but there is no realistic danger that section b,as we have interpreted it,criminalizes protected speech.speech intended deliberately to encourage minors participation in criminal sexual conduct has no redeeming social value
