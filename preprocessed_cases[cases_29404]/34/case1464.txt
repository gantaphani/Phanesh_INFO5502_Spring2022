opinion of the court 
we begin with the closing argument of the prosecutor 
s tanding here knowing what date september,today is i am very,very reluctant to use the term i going to use,but,frankly,i think this defendant warrants that term,and that term is terrorist.
there are many different kinds of terrorists.we all know too well the kinds of terrorists that caused the attacks of the anniversary we will mark tomorrow.but there are very different kinds of terrorists,and i think this defendant is one of them.
as you heard the evidence today,i think this evidence can show you that he inflicted terror upon belinda newcomer and her family,upon brittany newcomer and upon belinda son brandon newcomer.
you heard testimony that he was forcing kids to do drug transactions for him.what kind of person does that 
the kind of person that does that,is,of course,a very bad person.indeed,the government hyperbolic closing argument crowned its trial strategy of pillorying defendant darrick moore before the jury.this fact,and fact it be,is best exemplified by the prosecutor direct examination of the government key witness,belinda newcomer,through whom he elicited the many ways in which moore was physically violent,seriously injuring both her and her son.it was also seen when the prosecutor,on redirect examination of belinda thirteen year old daughter,brittany,elicited testimony that moore punched,kicked and choked her after she refused to sell drugs for him.given all of this,could anyone disagree with the government that moore was a bad man if not some species of terrorist surely the jury did not it returned a guilty verdict after only minutes of deliberations.
before placing our stamp of approval on the jury verdict,however,we must consider the issues that moore raises on appeal,and that the government,defense counsel and the district court simply ignored moore was not charged with forcing children or anyone else to deal drugs.neither was he charged with assault.nor drug possession.nor child abuse.nor terrorism.in fact,moore was not on trial for anything he may have done to belinda or her family.
moore was on trial for arson,in violation of i,and for possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon,in violation of g and a.any observer with even an elemental understanding of the federal rules of evidence should have wondered how the testimony about drugs,domestic violence,and child abuse was appropriate in an arson and gun possession trial.moreover,what justification could the prosecutor have had for raising the specter of september and calling moore a terrorist we can not conceive of any.we will reverse the judgment and sentence,and grant a new trial.
background 
on christmas eve of,a fire occurred at an apartment building located at north beaver street in york,pennsylvania,and a boy was injured.in of,belinda newcomer,moore,came forward to identify moore as the person responsible for the fire.in april,in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,moore was charged in a two count indictment with arson resulting in personal injury and with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
brittany newcomer,belinda daughter,was the first of four witnesses to testify for the government.on direct examination,brittany testified that she saw moore with a gun when he lived with her mother.she further testified that moore warned her not to tell her mother about the gun or he would hurt her.on,defense counsel asked brittany why she had waited so long before telling her mother about the gun.brittany replied that she feared being hurt by moore.on,the prosecutor asked brittany if moore had hurt her in the past.brittany responded that he had hurt her because she had refused to sell drugs for him.presumably on the ground that moore had now been called a drug dealer who used children to sell his drugs,defense counsel objected t his is far beyond,and it beyond the scope of this trial.the prosecutor countered only that the defense had made an issue of why brittany had waited so long to tell her mother about the gun.the district court agreed,and overruled the objection.the prosecutor then proceeded to elicit from brittany that moore had punched,kicked,and choked her when she refused to sell drugs.on,brittany offered that moore not only wanted her to sell drugs for him,but also wanted her mother and brother to do so.
belinda newcomer took the stand after her daughter.belinda began her testimony by describing the nature of her relationship with moore.she testified that he was in anger management classes that her relationship with him was very violent that he was a very hostile man that he was a habitual drug user that he threw her down a flight of stairs with the result that she was hospitalized in critical condition that he repeatedly punched her in the face that he severely beat her son,cracking three of his ribs and leaving scars on his face and neck that her son was taken by child services for fear that he would again be hurt by moore and that she feared for her life and the lives of her children.defense counsel at no point objected and the district court did not intervene.
having set the scene with her description of moore violent behavior,belinda turned to the events which took place on christmas eve.she testified that moore awoke her the two were at that time living together and asked her to drive him to a location he did not then disclose.she agreed to do so.moore first directed belinda to a gas station,where he filled a red plastic gas can with fuel,and they then drove to north beaver street.moore got out of the car with the gas can,instructed belinda to stay in the car,and disappeared behind the building.minutes later,he came running back,smelling of gasoline,and instructed her to drive them away.as they drove off,moore remarked to belinda that he had finally gotten even with someone he had been angry at and that no one is going to f with 
two other witnesses took the stand.melissa strunk layer,who was then incarcerated on drug charges,testified that she knew moore from dealing in crack cocaine.she had not seen moore since having a disagreement with him about the purchase of of crack.presumably,it was this dispute that motivated the arson on christmas eve of,melissa strunk layer lived at beaver,the location of the fire.
finally,york city police officer troy cromer offered into evidence a gun retrieved by police from moore former place of employment,a gun that fit the description given by belinda and brittany of the gun to have been in moore possession.officer at trial as an expert investigator of the origins and causes of testified that the fire was set intentionally,and that a red plastic gas can was recovered from the scene.
the government rested its case,and moore followed suit without calling any witnesses.closing arguments were then presented to the jury.the prosecutor launched into his closing argument by calling moore a terrorist.again,no objection was made by defense counsel.
the court then instructed the jury,and the verdict was returned in minutes.
ii.discussion 
moore urges us to overturn his conviction on two grounds first,he contends that the district court improperly admitted the testimony of brittany and belinda newcomer concerning his alleged prior bad acts,in violation of federal rule of evidence b second,he contends that the prosecutor closing argument unfairly prejudiced him.
standard of review 
the federal rules of evidence require a timely and specific objection to evidence erroneously admitted.a.where an objection is properly made,we review a district court ruling for abuse of discretion.united states givan,cir.where,however,a party fails to object in a timely fashion or fails to make a specific objection,our review is for plain error only.united states boone,cir.see also united states sandini,cir holding that failure to object with specificity does not preserve a rule b issue for appeal.it is that to establish plain error,a defendant must show error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the
