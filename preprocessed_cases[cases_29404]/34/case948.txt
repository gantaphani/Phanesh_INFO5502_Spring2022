defendant damion townsend defendant appeals from his conviction for conspiracy to distribute,and possess with intent to distribute,fifty grams or more of cocaine base crack,and an unspecified amount of cocaine,in violation of b a,b c,and,entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york keenan.we assume the parties familiarity with the facts,procedural history,and scope of the issues presented on appeal.
sufficiency of the evidence 
defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.specifically,defendant contends that the government key witness was not credible,that there is no evidence that defendant planned the drug transaction,and that there is insufficient evidence that defendant was a knowing participant in any illegal conduct and rather that he was just an innocent man driving his friends around.
standard of review 
a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction bears a heavy burden,because this court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.united states gaskin,cir.reversal is warranted only if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.in other words,a court may grant a judgment of acquittal only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged was nonexistent or meager.united states jackson,cir internal quotation marks omitted omission in original.
discussion 
in light of this highly deferential standard of review and the evidence proffered against defendant,this ground of appeal is meritless.the record includes evidence that defendant had a relationship with an alleged,ismaiyl jones,discussed a drug sale with,drove his around as they planned a drug sale and picked up drugs,went with jones to pick up cocaine,and helped to turn the cocaine into crack.
defendant argues that the case against him all depends on jones being a credible witness and contends that jones was not credible.to be sure,a great deal of the government case relies upon jones testimony,and because jones was a paid informant and cooperator,one might reasonably question his credibility.but that does not warrant an acquittal on appeal.for one thing,much of jones testimony was corroborated by eyewitness accounts from law enforcement officers,transmissions heard by a dea agent,physical evidence,and recordings.moreover,it is not for us to evaluate the credibility of a witness,a task better left to the jury.see united states thompson,cir per curiam.the jury that saw jones testify voted unanimously to convict,and we must accordingly draw all inferences,including inferences as to credibility,in favor of conviction.
defendant also makes two slightly more specific and related points,that there is no evidence that defendant planned the drug transaction,and that there is insufficient evidence that defendant was a knowing participant in any illegal conduct and rather was just an innocent man driving around his friends.neither of these arguments,however,have any merit.it is necessary that there be evidence that defendant knew of the existence of the scheme alleged and knowingly joined and participated in it.united states rodriguez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is,however,in no way necessary that defendant have planned the encounter.and there is ample evidence that defendant role was a knowing role.defendant discussed drug prices,details of a drug transaction,and helped convert cocaine to crack.defendant contends that this is not enough to support a finding of knowledge on his part.but given our precedents,that argument is unavailing.see,united states nusraty,cir listing factors that distinguish innocent conduct from knowing participation in a conspiracy.
ii.admission of prior bad acts evidence 
defendant further argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence of prior firearms sales,in violation of rule b and rule.

discussion 
the federal rules of evidence prohibit admission of e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.the rules,however,do permit such evidence for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.id.to determine whether a district court properly admitted other act evidence,we consider whether the prior acts evidence was offered for a proper purpose the evidence was relevant to a disputed issue the probative value of the prior act evidence substantially outweighed the danger of its unfair prejudice and the court administered an appropriate limiting instruction.united states brand,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we take an inclusionary approach.united states lasanta,cir.
the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the prior bad acts evidence.that evidence now at issue was relevant and highly probative as to knowledge and intent,both of which were disputed.it showed the development of the relationship between defendant and jones,provid ing background for the events alleged in the indictment and enabl ing the jury to understand the complete story of the crimes charged,or how the illegal relationship between coconspirators developed.united states reifler,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted alterations omitted.that is especially true in a case,such as the one now before us,where the prior dealings between two conspirators show the basis for the trust between the.united states brennan,cir.it is also especially applicable in this case where,as defendant strenuously argues,some of the observed conduct might be nothing more than innocent acts of a friend,and not a knowing participation in a conspiracy.driving two friends around town might,for example,seem innocuous.see nusraty,at.prior gun sales,however,at least suggest that defendant was not an innocent pawn taken by surprise by the drug transaction.the evidence was also accompanied by a careful and thorough instruction limiting the evidence to relevant rule grounds.that instruction was delivered on several occasions during testimony as well as in clear jury instructions on the issue.in light of the purpose and value of the evidence,and of the limiting instructions,we find no abuse of discretion in deeming the evidence admissible under rule.
defendant further argues that even if this evidence was properly admitted under rule,it should have been excluded under rule.under rule,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.as discussed above,the prior gun crimes were probative insofar as they established the history of the conspiracy,trust between the parties,intent,and knowledge.indeed,they were especially probative insofar as one of the three charged counts involved possession of a firearm.the nature of jones and defendant friendship was very much at issue at trial,and now on appeal,insofar as defendant argued,and continues to argue,that they were mere friends and defendant assistance in any criminal activity was done without his knowledge.
to be sure,the admission of any evidence not directly related to the charged conduct has the potential to be prejudicial.but it does not appear that prejudice here was likely to be great.gun transactions are not especially worse or shocking than the transactions charged.and the district court gave several careful instructions to the jury regarding what inferences it could draw from the admitted evidence.see,paulino,at united states snype,cir noting that the law recognizes a strong presumption that juries follow limiting instructions.
the district court had first hand exposure to the witnesses,jury,and other evidence,giving it a superior position to evaluate the likely impact of the evidence.li canarozzi,cir.there is no good reason for us to second guess that determination in this case.moreover,in the case before us,defendant arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,the evidence was very strong.we conclude,therefore,that even assuming the district court erred,any such error was harmless.
iii.conclusion 
we have reviewed all of claims and find them meritless.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
mindful of the considerable deference accorded to a trial court evidentiary rulings,mindful as well of this court inclusionary approach to evidence under.b,and mindful of the standard for reversal,i respectfully dissent from part ii of the opinion.the trial court did not properly apply the standard for relevancy under rule b,and erred in performing.balancing of the probative nature of the firearms evidence versus its prejudicial effect.moreover,the trial court cautionary instructions and charge were not clear to the jury.this was a close case,and in my view,these evidentiary rulings were not harmless error.i would reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.
i.the charges against townsend and the rule b evidence 
townsend was tried for three offenses conspiracy to distribute at least grams of cocaine base and an unspecified amount of cocaine,possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,and possession of a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug transaction.those charges arose from his activities on july.on that day,townsend drove his close friend ismaiyl jones around the city area of the bronx.townsend was unaware at that time that jones had been cooperating with the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives and new york city police since early.another person in townsend car that day was darryl winfree.winfree had previously arranged the purchase of powder cocaine by jones from an individual known as scrap.after driving jones around city for a number of errands,townsend drove jones and winfree to meet scrap,and jones purchased the cocaine.jones then tried to convince townsend to drive to townsend apartment to cook the powder cocaine into cocaine base.ultimately,jones and townsend went to townsend apartment and processed the cocaine powder into cocaine base.townsend received no payment or drugs from jones or winfree for driving them around or for the use of his apartment.the two drug charges against townsend related to the powder cocaine purchase by jones from scrap and the processing of the powder into cocaine base.the firearms charge alleged that townsend had a pistol in a hidden compartment in his car on july the principal issue at townsend trial was whether he was simply present for the drug dealings involving jones,winfree and scrap,or whether he joined in the drug conspiracy.townsend was acquitted of possession with intent to sell the cocaine base and the firearms charge.the jury found him guilty of the drug conspiracy.
the.b evidence at townsend trial was the following in april,townsend had been asked by was cooperating with the same federal and local law enforcement officers as on july arrange for jones to purchase a handgun.townsend set up a meeting between jones and isaiah mercado,and jones bought a handgun from mercado.in june while jones was cooperating with law sold a handgun to jones.at trial,the court permitted jones and law enforcement officers to testify about both firearm transactions and also admitted both handguns as full exhibits.
ii.evaluation of relevance under rule b 
although the second circuit inclusionary approach affords broad latitude to the trial court regarding the admission of prior act evidence under rule b,this approach does not obviate the need to identify the fact or issue to which the evidence is relevant.united states figueroa,cir.there must be a clear connection between the prior act evidence and a disputed issue at trial.without such connection,rule general prohibition against offering character evidence to show propensity to commit crimes would be violated.for example,this court has held that when prior act evidence is offered to prove a defendant intent or knowledge,it must be similar to the charged offense.united states laflam,cir per curiam see also united states brand,cir government must show similarity or some connection of prior act evidence to charged crime,in order to establish that the prior act is relevant to a disputed element,such as intent united states gordon,cir probative value of evidence depends largely on whether or not there is a close parallel between the crime charged and the acts shown.rule b does not authorize the admission of any and every sort of evidence,gordon,at the other act must be sufficiently similar to the conduct at issue to permit the jury reasonably to draw from that act the knowledge inference advocated by the proponent of the evidence.id.citing united states peterson,cir.
one purpose for which prior act evidence has been permitted is to provide background information to a charged conspiracy,to explain how a criminal relationship developed.united states pipola,cir.prior act evidence has also been permitted to help the jury understand the basis for the relationship of mutual trust between.see,united states rosa,cir.in order for prior act evidence to be admissible under these theories,however,some particular aspect of the background or the relationship of mutual trust must be in issue and the proffered evidence must be particularly relevant to that issue 
none of these characteristics of admission of evidence as background or to show the basis of the relationship of trust between was present in this case.the charged conspiracy involving townsend,jones,and winfree had no similarity to the prior gun sales involving townsend and jones.the gun sales did not involve scrap or winfree,and townsend role in those sales was not offered to support a theory regarding his role in the drug conspiracy in the gun transactions,he was a broker or a seller,while in the drug transactions,he was merely a driver,and according to the government,in doing this driving and in allowing jones to process the cocaine in his apartment,townsend intended to join in the illegal agreement between winfree and scrap to sell cocaine to jones.more of a connection between the rule b evidence and the crimes under consideration is required.for example,in rosa the cooperating witness melendez was the former leader of a drug trafficking group known as the organization,and he testified at trial that years before the charged drug and gun conspiracy,he and the defendant had stolen cars and engaged in narcotics transactions together.at.the evidence was admitted under rule b to explain why melendez trusted rosa and subsequently appointed him a lieutenant in the organization,since rosa leadership role was a particular aspect of the conspiracy that was directly in issue in the case.id.similarly,in pipola,the defendant role as a leader and planner who worked through other was specifically at issue since he was not physically present at the scenes of the charged robberies.at.prior armed robberies,a burglary,and other acts involving pipola and the other admitted under rule b helped show his role as the true leader of the charged conspiracy and explain his absence from the crime locations.see id.in brand,the similarity or some connection requirement was satisfied by child pornography materials found on the hard drive of a computer belonging to a defendant charged with attempting to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor because a direct connection exists between child pornography and pedophilia an abnormal sexual attraction to children,and whether the defendant intended to have sex with the minor was at issue.at.in townsend case,the prior gun sales did not bear any relationship to the drug transaction that formed the basis for the charged conspiracy.there was no allegation that the gun sales were in any way a prelude or introduction to townsend role in the subsequent drug transaction,nor that townsend forged any new or different connection to jones,winfree or scrap by engaging in the gun sales.nor was the criminal activity involved in the prior acts related in subject matter to that involved in the charged conspiracy.
the prior gun transactions were also not particularly relevant to the development of mutual trust between jones and townsend.that strong relationship and friendship was undisputed,and was detailed by ample evidence at trial,including jones testimony that he and townsend had known each other since childhood that jones had lived in townsend apartment that they saw each other virtually every day during the spring and summer of that jones was the godfather of townsend daughter and that they had grown up together in city.the relationship of trust was not disputed by townsend at only disputed his intent to enter into the drug conspiracy with winfree and scrap during july of.it is perhaps enlightening,both as to the lack of connection between the prior gun transactions and the drug conduct of july and as to the strength of the government proof,that townsend was originally charged with the april and june gun transactions in the same indictment that charged him with the july drug conspiracy and related counts.the government had these two gun counts dismissed before trial,but introduced them as the b evidence 
iii.rule balancing test 
the district court also failed to correctly apply rule balancing of the probative value of the prior act evidence against its highly prejudicial nature.first,the district court indicated that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial only by being more inflammatory than the conduct charged in the indictment.united states townsend,no.cr.jfk,slip op.at april.the district court was correct in concluding that evidence which is more inflammatory than the conduct charged in the indictment would likely be unfairly prejudicial.however,the inflammatory effect of evidence is only one way in which it may cause unfair prejudice to a defendant.evidence may also be unfairly prejudicial when,even though relevant to a fact in issue,it also tends so strongly to show the defendant propensity to commit crimes that this tendency outweighs any probative value that the evidence might have.see,old chief united states,d the term unfair prejudice,as to a criminal defendant,speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,commonly,though not necessarily,an emotional one.emphasis added figueroa,at evidence is prejudicial only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.the prejudicial effect may be created by the tendency of the evidence to prove some adverse fact not properly in issue or unfairly to excite emotions against the defendant.internal citations omitted,emphasis added christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence ed describing unfair prejudice as either or based on misuse of evidence.
when relevant evidence has a prejudicial effect,rule requires the trial court to make a conscientious assessment of whether the probative value of the evidence on a disputed issue in the case is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial tendency of the evidence to have some other adverse effect upon the defendant.figueroa,at.the district court analysis of the potential for unfair prejudice to townsend from the admission of the prior gun sale evidence was limited to concluding,prior to trial,that the evidence of townsend dealings in firearms was not rendered prejudicial because it was no more inflammatory than the conduct charged in the indictment,and the recent shootings at virginia tech did not render the evidence of townsend dealings in firearms especially inflammatory.the district court also failed to consider or to reconsider at trial the other evidence actually offered at trial on the disputed issues in determining the probative value of the prior gun sales,such as jones extensive testimony about his relationship with townsend.see old chief,at.a district court should consider the actual available substitutes for the proffered prior act evidence when conducting the rule balancing,but the abuse of discretion standard on appeal of a rule decision is not satisfied by a mere showing of some alternative means of proof that the prosecution in its broad discretion chose not to rely upon figueroa,at determination of admissibility of prior act evidence should often be made at the conclusion of the defendant case.moreover,the district court admitted not only the testimony regarding those gun sales but also the guns themselves the admission of two handguns into evidence likely contributed to the substantial prejudicial effect of the testimony regarding the gun sales.the impact of the handguns as full exhibits far exceeded their very low probative value,especially since the law enforcement officers who received and retained the guns jones purchased corroborated jones testimony about the gun transactions.
finally,it seems germane to the rule inquiry that the two firearm transactions were initiated by the same government agents that instigated the drug transaction of july,and utilized the same cooperating witness,jones.as previously stated,the government had recruited jones in early to try to buy guns and drugs in city.the two gun transactions involving townsend were initiated by jones,who had much to gain from this cooperation.it would seem that other acts involving townsend,involving the sale of drugs rather than of guns,and not instigated by the government would have had more relevance to townsend intent to join in jones efforts to acquire cocaine in july.in any event,it is very unusual to have rule b evidence which was part of the same investigation as the charged offense,was originally included in the first indictment of the defendant,and then was removed by the government through a superseding indictment,to be offered instead as background evidence supporting the remaining conspiracy count.
iv.limiting instructions and jury charge 
even if the district court had properly admitted the prior gun sales and the guns,and even if the rule analysis had been properly conducted,the limiting instructions and jury charge were inadequate.first,the instructions were partially incorrect as to the proper scope of the jury consideration of the prior act evidence.as discussed above,townsend knowledge of the deal was never in issue during the trial,yet knowledge is one of the issues about which the trial court twice instructed the jury once at the beginning of jones testimony about the gun sales,and once before the admission of the guns into evidence.see trial transcript at,stating that you can consider this evidence only as background to prove and to show that the defendant was acting knowingly and intentionally if he committed the crimes with which he charged emphasis added there was no dispute that townsend was present for and knew of the agreement between jones and winfree and the drug purchase.the only issue was whether townsend agreed to join their conspiracy.
moreover,in delivering the first limiting instruction before jones testimony,the district court cited the charged events as occurring during the wrong time period you can consider this evidence only as background to prove and to show that the defendant was acting knowingly and intentionally if he committed the crimes with which he charged in june.trial transcript at emphasis added.in fact,the period of the conspiracy charged was in july the prior gun sales occurred in april and june.although normally such an oversight might have little importance,in this case it adds confusion as to which acts or agreeme
