glenn petersen and trevor dorsett appeal their convictions for possessing more than grams of cocaine with intent to distribute,and for aiding and abetting that possession.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgments of conviction.
factual background 
the circumstances leading to the defendants arrest and conviction began as virgin islands police officers angela brown and steve gibbons were monitoring surveillance cameras in a police station on the island of john.those cameras had been deployed in high crime areas in cruz bay and fed into the police station where officers monitoring them could zoom in and out of a scene by manipulating a joystick.the officers could also swivel the cameras in a complete degree circle,thereby tracking movements of anyone they chose to focus on.
while monitoring the cameras,officer brown recognized dorsett as she saw him standing on the sidewalk directly across from a post office.as the officers observed dorsett,petersen met him,and the two began walking toward cap place,a local bar.when the two left the bar,the officers saw that petersen had a drink in one hand and a plastic bag in the other.the officers zoomed in on the bag and saw that it contained a object that appeared to be heavy.as petersen and dorsett continued walking down the street to the first bank building,petersen passed the bag to dorsett.dorsett kept the bag until they reached a short cut that led to the julius sprauve school.they then moved out of camera range when they took that short cut.
officers brown and gibbons then left the station and walked towards the school.as they did,they saw dorsett and petersen get into a red mitsubishi car and drive past the officers.the officers then ran back to the station,got into a police car,and attempted to follow dorsett and petersen.as they attempted to pursue the mitsubishi,officer brown radioed other officers to be on the lookout for dorsett and petersen in the red car.
officer emile proctor was heading towards the red mitsubishi when he saw it fail to stop at a stop sign.officer proctor radioed to the other officers,informed them of what he saw,and told them that he was going to make a traffic stop.while attempting to catch up to the mitsubishi,officer proctor saw dorsett throw a clear plastic bag that contained a white substance out through the driver side window into an open gutter.after the clear plastic bag was thrown into the gutter,the mitsubishi turned into a street that officer proctor knew to be a dead end and proctor stopped at the entrance of the street to block the mitsubishi exit.while doing this,he was able to observe the clear plastic bag that had been thrown from the car into the gutter.the mitsubishi made a and then stopped in front of officer proctor police car at about the same time that officers brown and gibbons were arriving at the scene.they parked their car behind the mitsubishi.
officer proctor ordered dorsett and petersen out of the car as officer dennis vanterpool arrived and was informed about the clear plastic bag that was still in the gutter.as he retrieved the bag,vanterpool observed a substance inside.he opened the bag and smelled what he believed to be crack cocaine and then informed the other officers of his discovery.officers proctor and vanterpool then frisked petersen and dorsett.while conducting the,officer proctor noticed that both dorsett and petersen smelled of marijuana,and officer vanterpool recovered a bag of marijuana from petersen pants pocket.
after dorsett and petersen were secured,officers brown and gibbons looked inside the mitsubishi and immediately noticed the odor of marijuana coming from inside.as officer brown continued his visual inspection,he noticed what appeared to be the plastic bag that he had previously seen dorsett and petersen carrying as they walked down the street.brown inquired about the bag,but both dorsett and petersen denied any knowledge of it.officer brown retrieved the bag and saw that it contained objects covered by a white powdery substance.dorsett and petersen were then arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.
ii.district court proceedings 
on january,a grand jury returned a two count indictment charging both dorsett and petersen with possessing cocaine base count one and cocaine hydrochloride count two with intent to distribute within feet of a public school,in violation of a and,as well as aiding and abetting each other and unknown others in the commission of those offenses,in violation of.
after the district court denied their motions to suppress physical evidence,they proceeded to trial before a jury.the government evidence at trial included the testimony of eric jordan,a forensic chemist employed by the united states drug enforcement agency.he testified that the bricks the defendants were carrying contained cocaine hydrochloride that had a gross weight of nearly one and a half kilograms grams.officer mark joseph,a virgin islands police department detective who is assigned to the drug enforcement task force,testified that the drugs were packaged in a manner that was not consistent with personal use.
at the conclusion of that trial,the district court granted the defendants motions for judgment of acquittal and dismissed count one of the indictment.the jury could not reach a verdict on count two and a mistrial was declared.
at the ensuing retrial,both defendants were convicted on the charges contained in count two and sentenced to lengthy prison terms after the court denied their post trial motions.these appeals followed.
iii.discussion 
dorsett argues that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion,that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction,and that the district court erred in refusing to give his proffered jury instruction on aiding and abetting.petersen also challenges the district court denial of his suppression motion.he also contends that the district court erred in sustaining his conviction for a offense because no lesser included offense instruction was given to the jury.
the defendants challenge to the denial of their suppression motions does not warrant discussion.their only argument in support of that claim is that all of the evidence seized by the officers should have been suppressed because the evidence established that officer proctor did not see the mitsubishi run a stop sign.thus,according to the defendants,the traffic stop violated their fourth amendment rights in united states mosley,cir,we noted that the supreme court has established a rule that any technical violation of a traffic code legitimizes a stop,even if the stop is merely pretext for an investigation of some other crime.id.at citing whren united states,d.
petersen and dorsett contend that surveillance videotape evidence established that officer proctor did not see their car run a stop sign.however,officer proctor clearly testified that he did see the mitsubishi run a stop sign,and the district court credited the officer testimony and held that the traffic stop was proper.it is not for us to weigh the evidence or to determine the credibility of witnesses.united states dent,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the district court did not err in denying the motions to suppress.
dorsett argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction does not merit much discussion either.officer brown testified that she saw dorsett handling the bag containing the cocaine,and surveillance videotape established that dorsett had actual possession of the bag.that same plastic bag was found in the vehicle just a few minutes later during the stop.this is more than sufficient to sustain the conviction for possession with intent to distribute.
we also reject both appellants challenges to the district court jury instructions,although those claims require more discussion.
count two of the indictment states 
on or about december,at john,in the district of the virgin islands,the defendants,glenn petersen and trevor dorsett while aiding and abetting one another,and others unknown to the grand jury,knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute a schedule ii narcotic controlled substance,that is,more than five hundred grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine hydrochloride,in violation of title,united states code,section a,within feet of a public school,that is,the julius sprauve school.
all in violation of title,united states code,a,b b iii,and title,united states code.
as noted at the outset,dorsett and petersen were on count two after their first trial resulted in a mistrial because the jury could not agree on a verdict.the district court asked the second jury to complete special verdict forms which contained three questions.those questions were identical for each defendant except for the name on the form.the first jury interrogatory was 
do you unanimously find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant individual defendant name knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute a mixture or substance containing cocaine 
the jury answered yes,on the verdict slips for both defendants.
the second interrogatory was 
do you unanimously find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant individual defendant name was within one thousand feet of a school when he knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute a mixture or substance containing cocaine 
on both defendants verdict forms,the jury answered no.
the third interrogatory was 
do you find that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the quantity of a mixture or substance containing cocaine that the defendant individual defendant name knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute was grams or more 
on both defendants verdict forms,the jury answered yes.accordingly,petersen and dorsett were acquitted of charges related to possessing more than grams cocaine with intent to distribute within feet of a schoolyard in violation of a,but they were both convicted of possession with intent to distribute in violation of a.
following trial,petersen moved for a judgment of acquittal,or in the alternative,for a new trial he argued that since he was charged with a single count of a violation of the schoolyard statute,the jury verdict constituted an acquittal because the government failed to prove an essential element of the crime charged.he further argued that conviction of possession with intent to distribute was inappropriate because the district court never instructed the jury that it could convict him of a offense.
the district court denied petersen motion and ruled that petersen was properly convicted of the offense of possession with intent to deliver even though the court did not give a offense charge to the jury.petersen now claims that was error.we disagree.
petersen claim of error is as ironic as it is misguided.he not only failed to request a offense charge in the district court and failed to object to the charge that was given during the charge conference,petersen specifically declined a offense charge that the court offered to give.thus,we review the instruction that was given for plain error.united states gordon,cir 
under plain error review,relief is not warranted unless there has been an error that is clear and affects substantial rights.jones united states,d.the error must be an egregious error or a manifest miscarriage of justice.united states price,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as we have suggested above,even if all of these prerequisites are met,we will not exercise our discretion to reverse a case for plain error unless the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.jones,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted,alteration in original.
we review jury instructions as a whole and in light of the evidence.when so viewed,jury instructions must fairly and adequately submit the issues in the case to the jury.united states hart,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.nevertheless,a district court has broad discretion in fashioning a jury charge as long as it communicates the substance of the law so the jury is not misled or confused.united states mcgill,cir.
the statute at issue here,a,provides,in relevant part,as follows 
any person who violates section a of this title by distributing,possessing with intent to distribute,or manufacturing a controlled substance in or on,or within one thousand feet of,the real property comprising a public or private elementary,vocational,or secondary school,or a public or private college,junior college is subject to twice the maximum punishment authorized by section b of this title and at least twice any term of supervised release authorized by section of this title for a first offense.
section a provides,in relevant part 
except as authorized by this subchapter,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally 
to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense a controlled substance 
section is therefore a substantive offense that requires proof of an element that is not included in proof that the distribution,possession or manufacturing occurred within feet of a schoolyard.united states mcquilkin,cir.
accordingly,a is a offense of a.united states jackson,cir see also id.at because a conviction under a only requires a finding of one additional element,the foot proximity to a school,we agree that the possession of cocaine base with the intent to distribute under a is a offense of possession with intent to distribute within feet of a school under a.
accordingly,a jury can not find a defendant guilty of a without first concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has established every element required under a.see also united states beltz,cir in fact one of the statutory elements of requires that a have been violated.
federal rule of criminal procedure c provides,in relevant part,as follows lesser offense or attempt.a defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged.in schmuck united states,d,the supreme court explained that one offense is not necessarily included in another unless the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the charged offense.where the lesser offense requires an element not required for the greater offense,no instruction is to be given under rule c.
the government contends that neither rule c nor supreme court precedent explicitly requires a offense charge if the instruction that is given includes the greater offense.however,keeble united states,d,seems,at first blush,to suggest otherwise.
there,a native american was charged with assault with intent to commit serious bodily injury under the major crimes act of.that act authorized the federal prosecution of a native american charged with committing certain specifically enumerated offenses on a reservation.assault with intent to commit serious bodily injury was one of the specifically enumerated offenses.keeble was charged with assault with intent to commit serious bodily injury after getting into a fight with his.
at the close of his trial,keeble asked the district court to instruct the jury that it could convict him of simple assault.the district court refused because simple assault is not an offense specifically enumerated in the act.accordingly,keeble could not have been tried for simple assault in federal court.the district court was affirmed on direct appeal,and the supreme court granted certiorari limited to the question of the validity of denying the requested instruction.at.
the supreme court held that a lesser included offense charge should have been given,if supported by the evidence.id.at.the court explained 
although the lesser included offense doctrine developed at common law to assist the prosecution in cases where the evidence failed to establish some element of the offense originally charged,it is now beyond dispute that the defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find him guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.
