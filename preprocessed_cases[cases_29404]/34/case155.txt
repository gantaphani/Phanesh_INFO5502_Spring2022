a jury convicted carlos burgos of one count of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana,in violation of.burgos challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction and also claims that the district court erred in giving a willful blindness instruction.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.
backgrounda.relationship between burgos and ramos 
burgos worked as a uniformed patrol officer for the city of worcester,massachusetts.between and march,he was assigned to a specific beat known as route,which encompasses a area known as main south.in addition to uniformed police officers,members of the worcester police department vice squad and gang unit regularly patrol the area.
burgos worked at an automobile repair shop located in main south,g v general auto repair g v.both during and after this time,rolando ramos also worked at g v ramos was not a mechanic,but rather helped by taking money to the bank,pick ing up parts that were needed in the shop and driving the lift.burgos described ramos as the shop tow truck driver.in addition to his legitimate work at g v,ramos also ran a marijuana distribution network although ramos never met his suppliers at g v,he did meet with customers and transact sales at that location.ramos testified that he spoke to at least one of his at g v about his illicit drug business but that he did not discuss his drug business with,or conduct any sales in the presence of,burgos 
while his worked at g v,burgos would go to the garage very frequent ly to visit and to have his car repaired on one of these occasions,ramos overheard burgos tell his that the area was hot,which ramos took to mean that it was being watched by the police 
sometime before april,burgos stopped working at g v,and,consequently,burgos used g v less frequently for repairs the mechanics at g v continued to give burgos a discount however,the extent of the discount varied among the mechanics,who worked on commission and set their own prices for car repair services.
ramos characterized his relationship with burgos as a friendship.ramos met some members of burgos family,but never went into his house the only time that ramos went to burgos house was to tow a car.burgos never went to ramos house.on one occasion,ramos helped burgos sister and her infant son by towing her car and repairing a flat tire,which he did without charging her.the only indication of a personal relationship,rather than a professional relationship,is a phone call from burgos to ramos on christmas day in on other occasions,burgos purchased from ramos a gps navigation system for his father and a laptop computer.ramos sold both items to burgos for less than retail price burgos also purchased a discounted set of vehicle tire rims at g v.according to the record,the rims were displayed in the garage with a for sale sign on them it is unclear whether ramos personally was selling the rims or merely rang up the sale as an employee of g 
in late,ramos noticed that a police officer who was known to work with the worcester police department gang unit was watching g v through binoculars the next day or so,ramos told burgos that someone was watching the garage,and burgos told him that it could be that the place was hot.ramos understood hot to mean that g v was being watched he told burgos,i be careful.
ramos later testified that he told his drug customers that he had the protection of a police officer,although he did not mention that person by name.these statements convinced at least one individual that it was safe to purchase marijuana from ramos.at trial,ramos disclaimed any truth to these statements w henever i was high,i was trying to bluff and appear as if i was the king.ramos characterized his statements as bragging or gloating and explained that,contrary to what he told people,he did not have a cop under his wing.after being arrested,ramos told one of his drug customers,who also had been arrested,that he d id understand why the cop burgos got arrested with them.ramos also testified that he never told burgos that he was a drug dealer,never discussed drugs with him and did not engage in any drug deals when burgos was present because he did not want burgos to know about his drug business 
investigation of ramos 
beginning in early,a drug task force began investigating ramos drug distribution network.officers from several agencies,including the worcester police department,the massachusetts state police,the drug enforcement administration dea and the united states postal inspection service conducted surveillance of ramos at g v,as well as at other locations.as part of their surveillance efforts,the officers drove unmarked vehicles.of particular relevance to this appeal is that worcester detective kellen smith drove a white ford explorer,worcester detective jeff carlson drove a maroon dodge intrepid and massachusetts state police officer nicholas nason drove a green ford escape.
on the morning of january,the officers conducting surveillance on g v saw burgos marked police vehicle parked in a parking lot on the same street as the garage they watched as ramos vehicle drove up next to burgos,and the two men proceeded to have a five or conversation.according to ramos later testimony,ramos had seen burgos sitting in his marked police vehicle he pulled next to burgos and told him he was being followed by cars,one red and one white,and he asked burgos who was following him at the time he asked,ramos was to percent certain that they were police cars.ramos later testified that he wanted to make sure that he knew who it was that was following him.according to ramos,the meeting was not prearranged when asked why ramos turned to burgos to obtain that information,he testified i do know.i saw him,and i went up to him and asked him.burgos told ramos that he was going to find out what they were.
later that day,ramos called burgos that conversation was captured by an existing wiretap.that transcript,which was introduced at trial,reads as follows 
burgos aside hold on,no hello 
ramos tell me,carlos.
burgos how are you what up 
ramos tell me,did you find out about that for me,or not 
burgos uh yes,but no i do know if for there there were two.uh the white one and the red one.
ramos yes,but i saw that one already,there the white one and a green van,too.
burgos unintelligible.
ramos a green one.did you hear 
burgos but i do know if it is for over there,but,uh they down there,yes.
ramos i know they down here.
burgos yes,so let take it easy for now.
ramos yes,i know,i know,i know that why i told you that.i know.
burgos yes,yes,yes 
ramos okay.
burgos okay 
ramos okay.
burgos okay.bye.
ramos later testified that he understood that burgos was telling him that police were observing either ramos or g v and telling him t hat he had to take it easy if he was doing something against the law.about an hour after that conversation with burgos,ramos called his marijuana supplier and informed him that police were in the area.shortly after that,ramos called a customer and gave him similar information.after these conversations,which also were captured by the wiretap,the officers changed their surveillance vehicles.at no point in their investigation did the officers focus any surveillance efforts on burgos.
after additional investigation,the officers executed search warrants on ramos house,where they recovered marijuana,cocaine and a firearm.
district court proceedings 
a grand jury charged burgos with one count of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana.ramos and detectives smith and carlson were the chief witnesses for the government.in addition to the events set forth above,detectives smith and carlson testified concerning their interactions with burgos while serving on the police force together.
detective smith testified that he began working in route when he was serving in the community impact division.he explained that he concentrated a lot of effort and time there in the antiviolence unit,and in the vice squad we do a lot of work down there as well.before he joined the vice squad,detective smith would see burgos quite frequently,but did work directly with burgos on many occasions.as an officer on the vice squad,detective smith saw burgos s everal times a week he stated that a typical area that i would run into carlos was at the the pumps,by which detective smith meant t he gas pumps at the worcester police headquarters.detective smith also provided general information about the vice squad.detective smith testified that the vice squad conducts n arcotics investigations,prostitution investigations,and illegal gambling investigations.he further stated that the vice squad spends approximately ninety percent of its time on narcotics investigations,nine percent on crimes and a very small fraction on illegal gaming and that he was familiar with those percentages before joining the vice squad 
detective carlson,who has worked his whole career in the main south area,both in the community impact division and in the vice squad,testified that,w hen he was assigned to the impact division,he would encounter carlos almost on a daily basis throughout the day.when detective carlson was assigned to the vice squad,burgos congratulated him and told detective carlson to do a good job up there.after detective carlson joined the vice squad,however,he and burgos did really work on operations together.detective carlson explained that they 
would encounter each other on the street on a fairly regular basis.again,route officers frequently assist the vice squad with stops and arrests and if there was some type of emergency call and i was tied up doing vice squad duties,i would certainly go to that area and assist route officers with their their call.
at the close of the government evidence,burgos moved for acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.the district court denied the motion.burgos did not call any witnesses.at the request of the government,and over burgos objection,the court gave the jury a willful blindness instruction it stated 
the second element that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant knew the essential purpose or nature of the conspiracy charged in the indictment.
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the essential purpose and general aim of the conspiracy was to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute it or to distribute a controlled substance.although you need not find that the defendant knew that the conspiracy involved marijuana specifically,you must find that he knew it involved a controlled substance.it is not enough for the government to prove merely that the defendant knew that the conspiracy involved something illegal.
it is,of course,impossible to prove directly the inner workings of the human mind.thus,in deciding whether the defendant acted knowingly,you may consider his statements and actions,the surrounding facts and circumstances,and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts and circumstances.
you may infer that the defendant had knowledge of a particular fact if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that he deliberately avoided learning a fact that otherwise would have been obvious to him,under the circumstances outlined below.
in order to infer knowledge of a fact under such circumstances,you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has proved two things 
first,that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the existence of a fact and 
second,that the defendant consciously and deliberately avoided learning of that fact that is,that he willfully made himself blind to the existence of the fact.
you may draw that inference,but you do not have to it is entirely up to you.
conscious and deliberate avoidance of knowledge may be established by proof that the defendant deliberately refused to ask questions about,or make inquiries about,or investigate,suspicious activities once his suspicion had been aroused.
mere negligence or mistake in failing to investigate or learn a fact is not enough.thus,it is not enough that a reasonable person in the defendant position would have known a fact,or would have made further inquiry you must find that the defendant consciously and deliberately remained ignorant of that fact.
it is not enough for the government to prove that the defendant knew,or was willfully blind to,the fact that something illegal was occurring.rather,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew,or was willfully blind to,the fact that the illegal activity involved a controlled substance.
this instruction applies only to the knowledge element of the conspiracy.the third element of a conspiracy that the defendant willfully joined the conspiracy can not be established by willful blindness.
the jury convicted burgos on the single count of the indictment,and the district court denied his renewed motion for acquittal.burgos timely appealed.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal,viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states pérez meléndez,cir.the ultimate question for this court is whether the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,and all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational jury to conclude that the government had proven each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
standard for sufficiency of the evidence 
although the standard of review incorporates overtones,appellate oversight of sufficiency challenges is not an empty ritual.united states ortiz,cir.this is because the standard is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error.in re winship.as the court explained in winship,
the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.the accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interest of immense importance,both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.accordingly,a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt to this end,the standard is indispensable,for it impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue.
id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.the standard not only gives concrete substance for the presumption of innocence,id.at,but also gives the citizenry confidence in the fairness of its criminal justice system 
u se of the standard is indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community in applications of the criminal law.it is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned.it is also important in our free society that every individual going about his ordinary affairs have confidence that his government can not adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty.
despite the importance of the reasonable doubt standard in safeguarding the rights of criminal defendants,the term has eluded clear definition.united states olmstead,cir.indeed,we have observed that m ost efforts at clarification result in further obfuscation of the concept.id.nevertheless,we have attempted to describe the level of certainty necessary to support a criminal conviction.morgan dickhaut,cir.we will not give credence to evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.leftwich maloney,cir quoting united states spinney,cir.the existence of some metaphysical doubt,however,does not require a verdict in favor of the accused it is enough that all reasonable doubts be excluded.stewart coalter,cir.a verdict satisfying this standard may be supported by circumstantial evidence alone,morgan,at,but we also have noted the limitations of circumstantial evidence w e are loath to stack inference upon inference in order to uphold the jury verdict.united states valerio,cir.in the end,
i f the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged,this court must reverse the conviction.this is so because where an equal or nearly equal theory of guilt and a theory of innocence is supported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.
united states flores rivera,cir alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,burgos was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana.to affirm his conviction,we must determine whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime a conspiracy existed,burgos had knowledge of the conspiracy and burgos knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.united states dellosantos,cir.with respect to the second element,the government must establish that the defendant had knowledge of the crime charged.pérez meléndez,at.showing that the defendant had knowledge of generalized illegality is insufficient,the government must show that the defendant knew the conspiracy involved a controlled substance,but need not show that the defendant knew the specific controlled substance being distributed,id.at.
the government may satisfy its burden in two ways with evidence of actual knowledge or with evidence of willful blindness.id.willful blindness serves as an alternate theory on which the government may prove knowledge.to establish willful blindness,the government must prove that burgos was aware of a high probability of the existence of a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and that burgos consciously and deliberately avoided learning of that fact.united states lizardo,cir.the government can satisfy its burden with direct or circumstantial evidence,but,as we already have stated,charges of conspiracy can not be made out by piling inference upon inference.united states delutis,cir citing direct sales united states.
turning to the third element of the conspiracy charge whether burgos knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy the evidence must establish that the defendant both intended to join the conspiracy and intended to effectuate the objects of the conspiracy.dellosantos,at.a defendant must in some sense promote the conspiracy himself,make it his own,have a stake in its outcome.united states aponte suárez,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.although a financial stake in the success of the conspiracy is not essential to establish this element,united states isabel,cir,we have suggested that it is not reasonable to conclude that a defendant who is indifferent to the conspiracy was a member of it,see dellosantos,at.
burgos concedes the existence of a conspiracy he challenges,however,the government proof with respect to the second and third elements of the charged conspiracy.we turn first,therefore,to the element of knowledge.
evidence at trial knowledge 
the government maintains that the evidence presented at trial would allow a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that burgos had actual knowledge of,or was willfully blind to,ramos drug operations.the government points to three pieces of evidence that,it believes,taken together,create an inference of knowledge on burgos part.the government argues that,
g iven burgos regular interaction with the vice squad on his assigned patrol route,which was within an area replete with drug crime,and his comments to carlson,which suggested a familiarity with the work of the vice squad,a jury could reasonably have inferred that burgos knew that the vice squad investigated primarily drug crime.and given this inference,the jury could reasonably have inferred that once burgos discovered that the vice squad was surveilling ramos,burgos knew or was willfully blind to the existence of ramos drug distribution activity.
when we evaluate the evidence presented at trial,however,we are unable to conclude that the inferences drawn by the government,and apparently by the jury,are supported by the evidence.first,burgos regular interaction with the vice squad on his assigned patrol route did not establish burgos knowledge of the vice squad work distribution.detective smith testified that,once he was assigned to the vice squad,he encountered burgos s everal times a week,but that a typical encounter was at t he gas pumps at the worcester police headquarters.detective carlson related that,when he was assigned to the community impact division,he would encounter burgos almost on a daily basis throughout the day.once detective carlson joined the vice squad,however,he and burgos did really work on operations together.they did encounter each other on the street on a fairly regular basis detective carlson explained that route officers frequently assist ed the vice squad with stops and arrests,and,when vice squad members were available,they would assist route officers with their calls detective carlson did not quantify how many,or what percentage,of the arrests with which burgos assisted were drug arrests.nor did he further explain what percentage of their encounters on the street were incidents of detective carlson assisting burgos,as opposed to vice versa.from this evidence,a jury reasonably could infer that burgos knew detectives smith and carlson and that he also knew the types of crimes that the vice squad investigated.none of this evidence suggests,however,that burgos knew what percentage of the vice squad time and effort was devoted to drug crimes,as opposed to prostitution or gambling.
the same is true with the evidence concerning the area burgos patrolled.the government points to the fact that the main south area was an area replete with drug crime to establish that burgos must have known that the vice squad was investigating drug crimes at g evidence at trial established,however,that main south was known to be a high crime area and that not only drug crimes,but also prostitution and other crimes were prevalent 
the government also believes that burgos comments to detective carlson when he was promoted to the vice squad support the inference that burgos knew that the vice squad dedicated nearly all of its time to drug investigations.burgos vague laudatory statements congratulating two on their promotions you and kellen,you guys do a good job up there,suggest some familiarity with the vice squad,but hardly suggests that he was familiar with the distribution of the vice squad workload.
viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the government,a reasonable jury could conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that burgos knew that main south was an area of high crime,and specifically high drug crime,that the vice squad investigated crimes involving drugs,prostitution and gaming,and that the vice squad was surveilling g from this,a jury certainly could infer that burgos was aware that the vice squad was investigating g v for possible criminal activity that fell within its crimes,prostitution or gaming.none of the evidence,however,establishes,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the vice squad was investigating a drug crime,as opposed to prostitution or gaming.as we have stated previously,i f the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence of the crime charged,this court must reverse the conviction.flores rivera,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.without evidence that pointed to the likelihood that the vice squad was investigating drug crimes,the jury verdict can not be sustained.
the government next asserts that jury reasonably could infer that burgos,as an experienced police officer who patrolled a high crime area,was familiar with indicia of drug dealing.the government further contends that,g iven that surveillance officers observed activity occurring at g v,the jury could reasonably have drawn the further inference that burgos knew about or willfully blinded himself to the robust drug trafficking operation that ramos was running there.
the government,however,neither identifies what these indicia of drug dealing might be,nor points to any evidence of such indicia in the record.turning to the activity at g v that was observed by surveillance officers,the brief mentions only one instance ramos walking around in front of g v,apparently engaged in.burgos,the government continues,was on patrol in the area on the day that surveillance officers observed this behavior.notably,however,the government does not point to any testimony that burgos passed by g v in his patrol car while ramos was engaging in this activity,much less that burgos saw ramos or made any contact with him.the government points to no other activity that was seen by surveillance officers that also was seen by burgos.because the record does not establish that burgos observed any activity at g v,his observations can not be a basis for establishing his knowledge or willful blindness to such activity.
the government asserts that,based upon the nature and frequency of burgos and ramos interactions,as well as burgos police work in an area rife with drug activity,burgos at the very least knew or willfully blinded himself to ramos daily cocaine and percocet use.the evidence establishes that,once burgos left g v sometime before april,burgos visited g v with less frequency.ramos estimated that burgos brought his car in n ot often,once a year,or once a month depending on what it was he stated later in his testimony that he thought burgos came in a bout three times after his left g the government does not point to any other evidence that suggests that burgos visits were more frequent.moreover,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that burgos and ramos interacted socially with one another.the record similarly is devoid of any testimony concerning the physical characteristics of regular cocaine or percocet users and whether ramos displayed any of those characteristics.consequently,contrary to the government assertion,this is not the type of close relationship that can,as part of a larger package of proof,assist in supporting an inference of involvement in illicit activity.ortiz,at involving a defendant who was to another conspirator united states dimarzo,cir holding that,t ogether with the incriminating circumstantial evidence,the fact that the defendant,the lookout,was brother to the pointman permitted a rational jury inference that the defendant well knew he was involved in a drug deal 
the government next argues that,based on ramos questions to burgos about police surveillance,it is reasonable to conclude that burgos knew of,or was willfully blind to,ramos drug distribution efforts.the government invites the court attention to two pieces of evidence.first,in late,ramos noticed that an individual who worked with the gang unit was watching the garage through binoculars when ramos told burgos about seeing the officer,burgos told him that it could be that the place was hot.ramos understood hot to mean that the garage was being watched he told burgos,i be careful.second,on january,ramos asked burgos about the white,red and green vehicles that he had noticed following him.the relevant conversation was captured by a wiretap,and the transcript reads as follows 
to this point,we have addressed the probative value of individual pieces of evidence introduced by the government.it is,however,the cumulative probability of guilt created by all the evidence,rather than the probability of guilt created by a single piece of evidence,that is the touchstone in deciding whether a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states williams,cir.we find that in evaluating the evidence as a whole,however,we must stack inference upon inference in such a way as to make the conclusion that burgos had knowledge of,or was willfully blind to,ramos drug distribution too speculative to sustain burgos conviction.these inferences include that,by virtue of his experience as a police officer and his work in the main south area,burgos knew the workload distribution of the vice squad,that,given his friendship with ramos,burgos must have known about ramos drug use and,therefore,further should have suspected his drug dealing,that,by virtue of his patrolling the main south area,he must have seen indicia of drug activity at g v and that,because ramos asked if he was being watched,and burgos confirmed that surveillance officers were in the area and stated let take it easy for now,burgos must have been privy to ramos drug distribution activities.as we concluded in delutis,t he piling of these unfounded and unsupported inferences on top of each other by the government is clearly contrary to our own case law and that of the supreme court.at.
indeed,we perceive little to distinguish the type of evidence at issue here from that in pérez meléndez,which we concluded was insufficient to sustain the conviction for aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute cocaine.in pérez meléndez,based on an anonymous tip,dea agents approached a truck driven by pérez meléndez and,after securing pérez meléndez consent to search the vehicle,discovered forty kilograms of cocaine hidden in pallets containing reams of paper.at.in his statement to the agents,pérez meléndez stated that he was an independent truck driver,who had received a telephone call from rivera ríos that morning to determine if pérez meléndez could work as a truck driver that day.id.at.pérez meléndez statement was not consistent with respect to who had rented the truck,who he or rivera ríos had received the calls from the individual giving delivery instructions and the extent to which he and rivera ríos had worked together in the past.id.at.although acknowledging that much of the transaction was suspicious,we nevertheless concluded that the government had not met its burden of establishing the elements of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute narcotics 
some of the inferences the district court draws are certainly plausible,but their significance is limited.a rational factfinder could have drawn a plausible inference that appellants knew they were involved in an illegal activity because appellants statements and omissions concerning their job and the manner in which they were hired for and performed that work earlier the same day are suspicious.however,we find that a rational factfinder could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants committed the charged crime because reasonable doubt should have remained that appellants knew that the precise nature of that activity involved controlled substances generally or cocaine specifically and appellants were aware of a high probability that illegal drugs were packaged within the pallets and consciously and deliberately avoided learning of that fact.
any conclusion by the jury beyond that,specifically imputing to appellants knowledge of or willful blindness to the contents of the pallets,was the product of pure speculation.this is particularly true when one considers that the burden is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
the evidence the government presented in this case would have been just as consistent with that of a case involving the smuggling of contraband other than a controlled substance.this contraband could plausibly have been other goods,such as weapons,stolen jewels or computer chips,counterfeit currency,diamonds and other precious minerals from africa,cigars from cuba,fuel,or child pornography.here the government presented no evidence at trial that could have led a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellants knew whatever contraband may have been present involved a controlled substance or appellants were aware of a high probability that illegal drugs were packaged within the pallets and consciously and deliberately avoided learning of that fact.
