background 
i.the confrontation and altercation 
the parties give somewhat different versions of the confrontation and ensuing altercation that resulted in mcclellan arrest and prosecution.because the differences are critical to the disposition of this appeal,we set them forth separately.
mcclellan version 
on november,at,mcclellan was unloading grocery bags from his automobile,which was parked directly in front of his house at washington avenue,rensselaer,new york.he was standing as close as possible to his car while unloading the bags and handing them to his girlfriend,michelle cristo,who carried them into the house.at some point in the unloading process,as mcclellan was leaning into the driver side with the door open and his back to washington avenue,smith drove by in the lane where mcclellan was parked.as he passed,smith honked his horn and gestured to mcclellan with his middle finger.mcclellan returned the gesture,whereupon smith abruptly turned his car around in a driveway a short distance away and drove back toward mcclellan.as mcclellan finished unloading and closed his car door,smith suddenly turned his car into the lane of incoming traffic and stopped at a degree angle to mcclellan car and only inches away from it.smith mirror grazed mcclellan hand,and mcclellan was essentially trapped in the triangular area where the two cars met.witnesses confirmed mcclellan assertion that smith car at this point was parked at an angle and blocked oncoming traffic.
after he stopped his car,smith yelled and cursed at mcclellan saying who the f are you you just gave me the finger.you know who i am i am a cop.although it turned out that smith was indeed a detective sergeant in the city of rensselaer police department,he wore no uniform and his car bore no police markings.he appeared agitated,and his eyes were bloodshot and glassy and he was.mcclellan was concerned that smith had been drinking.mcclellan did not believe,given the circumstances,that smith was a police officer and requested identification.smith responded that he did not have to show any f ing id and attempted to exit his car by pushing the door into mcclellan.mcclellan,in an effort to avoid a physical confrontation,held smith door closed with his hands and body,and advised smith that he would not let him out until he produced identification.smith continued trying to push his way out of the car,threatening to kick mcclellan f ing ass and to arrest him.during the altercation,mcclellan heard smith use the word backup but was not able to see a radio or other police equipment in smith car or determine who he was talking to.eventually,mcclellan yelled to cristo to call the police.
ultimately,smith was able to push mcclellan out of the way with his car door and by punching him in the face.smith apparently struck his face on the car door as he exited.after wrestling with smith,and without throwing a punch,mcclellan was able to hold smith down over the hood of mcclellan car.at that point,mcclellan noticed that smith was bleeding profusely from the injury to his face and saw him speak into a radio and say that he was being beaten which was not true and needed backup.mcclellan then told smith that he would release him if he promised to stop fighting.smith said he would stop,and mcclellan released him and walked toward his house.as he did so,smith grabbed him and told him to wait.mcclellan once again asked for identification and once again was rebuffed.the rensselaer police arrived moments later and smith directed an officer to arrest mcclellan.en route to the police station,mcclellan told the police officer that he did not know smith was a police officer and was only trying to restrain him from getting out of the car in order to avoid a fight.
smith version 
on november,at about,smith was driving on washington avenue in the city of rensselaer,where he served in the police department as a detective sergeant.he was wearing street clothes and driving an undercover vehicle with a portable police radio between the two front bucket seats.the radio was at all times receiving transmissions from fellow officers.as he drove,smith saw a vehicle ahead of him swerve and then saw mcclellan in the middle of the road with the door to his car wide open.perceiving that mcclellan was impeding traffic and putting himself in danger of being struck,smith beeped his horn twice on approaching mcclellan.as he passed,smith saw,in his rear view mirror,mcclellan extend his middle finger and shout f you.smith also observed another car behind him swerve to avoid mcclellan.
smith thereupon turned his vehicle around and returned to where mcclellan was standing for the purpose of advising him to get out of the road.smith pulled up alongside mcclellan and parked at an angle so that the right side and rear of smith vehicle extended into the other lane.the left side of the vehicle was about four feet from mcclellan car and the rear of the vehicle was across the middle of the other lane.as he pulled up alongside,smith rolled down his driver side window and told mcclellan he was a cop.mcclellan replied i do give a f who you are.mcclellan then started swinging at smith while smith was still seated and struck him in the left side of the head.smith leaned away from mcclellan and called for backup on his portable radio.
smith then tried to exit his vehicle and told mcclellan he was under arrest.mcclellan stood in front of smith car door and pushed against it to prevent smith from exiting his vehicle.smith finally opened the door and got his left foot out.at that point,mcclellan pushed the car door in such a way that the top of the door struck smith face,causing a deep facial laceration.smith was able to exit the car with his portable radio in hand,having used it to call for assistance.mcclellan grabbed him and threw him face down across the hood of mcclellan vehicle,holding him in that position with the weight of his body.at that point,other officers arrived at the scene.smith believed that mcclellan was in violation of the vehicle and traffic law when he stood on washington avenue with his car door open,impeding traffic and endangering himself.
ii.the state charges against mcclellan and their disposition 
immediately following the incident described above,mcclellan was charged with four violations of the new york penal law aggravated assault on a police officer assault in the second degree resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.he was arraigned before a judge of the rensselaer city court on the morning following the incident and held without bail.a preliminary hearing was held four days later in the city court,which determined that there was reasonable ground to believe that a felony had been committed.on the day following the hearing,the rensselaer county court,pursuant to mcclellan application,set bail at,bond or cash.mcclellan posted a bond after having been confined for six days.
on february,the case against mcclellan was presented to a rensselaer county grand jury.the presentation was conducted by an assistant district attorney from washington county because of a conflict of interest arising from the employment of smith as a investigator in the office of the rensselaer county district attorney.both mcclellan and cristo testified before the grand jury.the grand jury returned a no true bill,and all charges against mcclellan were dismissed.smith reported to the chief of his department t hat the washington county da office presented the case and it was no billed,and i was very happy with the district attorney.i think he was very young and that he was unqualified,not qualified to present it.
smith continued his interest in the case,having,in his supervisory capacity,appointed a new investigator to replace detective michael smith because he felt that michael smith was handling the investigation properly.he instructed the new investigator,officer gerald amedio,to recanvass the neighborhood where the incident occurred.at some point in the continuing investigation,smith was advised by assistant district attorney mark loughran of rensselaer county that the case could be presented to a new grand jury on the basis of new evidence if a judge so ordered.
in the search for new evidence,smith discovered that one dan malark,confined to the rensselaer county jail,was willing to testify to a purported admission made by mcclellan during his confinement in the jail.smith reported to district attorney patricia deangelis that malark would testify in return for a deal in his prosecution on a domestic relations charge.deangelis refused to bargain with malark.eventually,amedio and smith came up with the name of ronald fordley,another inmate who purportedly had heard mcclellan admission.another inmate of the county jail,larry fuller,also provided a statement relative to the alleged admission by mcclellan.however,it was fordley affidavit that constituted the newly discovered evidence that formed the basis for the may,order of the rensselaer county court allowing the case against mcclellan to be submitted to a second grand jury.
the second grand jury heard the case against mcclellan as presented by the rensselaer county district attorney office,smith having previously terminated his employment there.mcclellan and cristo again were among those who testified,but this time the grand jury returned an indictment charging mcclellan with the following violations of the new york penal law aggravated assault on a police officer assault on a police officer and assault second degree.the jury impaneled in rensselaer county court for the trial of the charges contained in the indictment found mcclellan not guilty on all counts on june.the trial was conducted for the prosecution by the saratoga county district attorney,smith having by the time of trial returned to his employment by the rensselaer county district attorney on a basis.
iii.proceedings in the district court 
the action giving rise to the appeal at bar was commenced by the filing of a complaint on september.invoking the provisions of,mcclellan alleged causes of action against smith arising out of the incident as follows false arrest malicious prosecution unlawful search and seizure and unlawful imprisonment.causes of action also were pleaded against the city of rensselaer for failure to train and failure to supervise.as previously noted,the city of rensselaer is not a party to this appeal.issue was joined by the filing of an answer on november.following disclosure and discovery,smith filed his motion for summary judgment on june,and mcclellan filed his opposition to smith motion and his own motion for partial summary judgment on july.following additional submissions by the parties,the district court rendered a decision dated september,granting summary judgment to smith dismissing the complaint and denying mcclellan motion for partial summary judgment with prejudice.mcclellan thereafter made a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied in a decision dated october.
in its decision granting summary judgment,the district court opined that mcclellan fourth amendment claims for false arrest,malicious prosecution,unlawful imprisonment,and unreasonable search and seizure all arise from mcclellan allegation that he was arrested without probable cause and that the existence of probable cause to arrest would prove fatal to all of mcclellan claims.the court noted that new york law provides that indictment by a grand jury establishes a presumption of probable cause for arrest in the absence of a showing of fraud,perjury,suppression of evidence,or other bad faith police conduct.finding that mcclellan has failed to show that variations in smith testimony resulted from bad faith rather than mere confusion or lapse of memory regarding a fast moving series of events,and further finding that it is without consequence that the first grand jury returned a no true bill,the district court concluded that there was a failure to rebut the presumption arising from the second grand jury finding of probable cause.the court therefore determined that mcclellan fourth amendment claims fail as they relate to these three assault charges.
turning to the charges of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct for which mcclellan was originally arrested but never indicted,the district court observed that the facts surrounding the incident are heavily disputed,that the question of probable cause is predominantly factual,and that the court therefore would not determine whether there was probable cause to arrest mcclellan for resisting arrest or for disorderly conduct.however,the court did find that smith was entitled to qualified immunity on an objective reasonableness standard because a reasonable jury could only conclude that reasonable officers could disagree on the constitutionality of the seizure.the district court therefore found that smith is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the remainder of mcclellan fourth amendment claims.
on reconsideration,the district court reviewed the three errors that mcclellan claimed were made by the district court in granting summary judgment that the court misapplied the facts in finding that smith was entitled to qualified immunity that the court misapplied the facts and the law in determining that mcclellan had failed to rebut the presumption of probable cause created by the grand jury indictment and that the district court misapplied the law by holding that the presumption of probable cause arising from the grand jury indictment applies to mcclellan false arrest claim.
in rejecting the claim that it misapplied the facts to the issue of qualified immunity,the district court considered the following facts established 
mcclellan admitted that smith identified himself as a police officer and that mcclellan heard smith call for backup while outside the police car and say the word backup while inside the police car.mcclellan also admitted to restraining smith by his wrists on top of mcclellan car,and although mcclellan did not witness mcclellan car door hit smith in the face,mcclellan admitted to seriously injuring smith.
upon these facts,the court stated that the only rational conclusion a jury could reach is that reasonable officers would disagree about the legality of smith conduct and that therefore smith was entitled to qualified immunity.
as to the grand jury indictment establishing a presumption of probable cause for the arrest,the district court cited new york court of appeals authority for the proposition that the presumption applies only in cases of malicious prosecution but also cited lower court authority for application of the presumption in false arrest cases.the court rejected the claim that the presumption was overcome by variations in smith grand jury testimony,noting that the variations all arise from the detailed,series of events that occurred in the course of the altercation.but even if the presumption did not apply to false arrest,according to the district court,smith is entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claim as it re
