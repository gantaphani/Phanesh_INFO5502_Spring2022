joshua pled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting a bank robbery in violation of and a.he entered his plea after the district court denied his motion to suppress his confession.his plea bargain expressly reserved the right to appeal the court suppression order,which he does here.
the theory presented is an unusual one that a defendant who has given a valid miranda waiver may seek to suppress his later voluntary and uncoerced statements to the police on the grounds that arguably misleading statements by the police invalidated his miranda waiver.on the facts,we reject this theory and affirm.
on the afternoon of september,a man armed with what appeared to be a handgun robbed the citizen bank in hooksett,new hampshire.after the robber left the bank,he was seen by two customers as he ran toward a car,a white geo storm,leaned into the vehicle to speak with the driver,and then ran off.one customer wrote down the car license plate number and then watched the geo storm drive across the street and park at a donuts.the driver got out and went into the donuts.police arrested the driver of the car,who was the defendant.
was taken to the hooksett police station.he was interviewed by two police officers,detective owen gaskell and bow police chief rod forey.consented to having the interview recorded,after which he was read his miranda rights and given a form which he initialed and signed indicating he understood those rights.see miranda arizona,d holding that certain warnings must be given before a suspect statements made during custodial interrogation may be admitted in evidence.
after being told of his right to a lawyer,and that if he could not afford a lawyer one would be appointed for him,but before signing his waiver form,asked it not going to happen right now gaskell replied 
no,we do have a lawyer right now.we do have one sitting there.if you,you can refuse to answer any questions or stop giving this statement at any time you wish,which means that if you decide that at some point you want to stop,you stop and we wo do it any further.
then replied okay.he then stated that he understood his rights and agreed to waive them and talk to the officers.concedes that his waiver at this time was valid.
after executing his waiver form,then had the following exchange with the officers 
jbp so if i requested a lawyer,there would be one that would come right now 
rf well what we do is if you did want to answer a question,you do answer the question.
og ah go ahead and explain it to him if you want,whatever um,
rf yeah i mean,the josh,you already told me you know the system.you been through the system.you have a right to an attorney if you want.you have to hire your own lawyer.we like to ask you some questions.and actually we just want to get your version of what happened.your involvement,you,you telling me,you mentioned something before detective gaskell got in here that you know,you re a convicted felon and you re in a white car and you at the wrong place at the wrong time,well that what we want to talk about.we want to get your version.if we have a question that you do want to answer,say i do want to answer that.it as simple as that.
the statement you have to hire your own lawyer is grist for his later argument.
after this exchange,the officers began to question about the bank robbery.at the beginning of the interrogation,maintained that he did not know anything about the bank robbery.the police then told some of the evidence they were going to examine to see if that was true,such as checking his car to see if the actual robber prints were on it,and viewing videos from the bank.responded by saying that regardless of whether he was involved or not,he was going to get convicted 
i gon na have to go to trial,because i know you not gon na let me go.i not stupid.you know.i know i not going home.i gon na have to take the trial or take a plea bargain.a plea bargain says oh,well if you just say you did it,then you can go home a little bit earlier.so i only do five more years,but if i do say i did it,then i probably go to trial,all the jurors are just gon na sit there,twiddle their thumbs,not listen to anything i said and give me seven and a half to fifteen.you think i am a retard i know i ai going home for a long time 
detective forey,in turn,then asked i f you know that,why you telling me the story he told that there was a difference in culpability between someone who is merely the driver in a robbery,and someone who actually commits the robbery.he also told that they had a lot of evidence against him that led to his arrest.when asked how that happened,forey said how about a plate number.how about witnesses.how about driving around the bank.how about going the other way.how about you pick the bank that there happen ed to be a state trooper sitting having a coffee behind in the field.
defendant also objects to certain police statements about the truth helping him,which were made in the context described above.forey next told the situation as the police saw it 
if you the wheel man and the guy that went in and pointed the gun at all those people with all those cameras going on.drop ped the clip and did everything you should do in a bank robbery.if you that guy,you may be in serious trouble.so do you think you r buddy that all muddy now from running through and getting tracked down by the dogs,that you know is sitting down there,do you think he gon na tell us what happened because that was like,well my daughter gets caught with her hand in the cookie jar.i mean his is a done deal.do you want to help yourself out that entirely up to you.we not,the old days when we used to beat people up and take their lunch money is long over,but it up to you.you know what happened.we know what happened,but you need to either come to the plate and say you know what rob,i was the wheelman and i did go in the bank.that puts you in a whole different situation and when we talk to your ppo,and when we talk to the dist,the county attorney,there is a different scenario here and you know it.you know it.you know the guys that go into state prison and do short time,easy time and you re right,two,two and a half years.you could do,you could do that standing on your freaking head.
about an hour into the interrogation,officer gaskell again explained the situation to 
if i had the powers to work things and make deals i would believe me.i wish i could cuz it would make my job so much easier.to sit there and you already said it,you can help yourself or attempt to help yourself by whatever you say and you give us to at whatever level.i ca tell you how much that will help you but there the bottom line.
also near the end of the first round of questioning,forey told that t he truth opens doors,and that the truth from you is what i need.and if i have that then i can run and then do what i can to help you.later on,forey stated 
you know and i know whether you like it or not or whether you agree with it or not,the truth does help and it is going to help you in the long run and if your ultimate goal is to get soon as possible,the only thing that going to help you is the truth.
these statements form the last prong of defendant argument.continued to say that he could not tell the officers anything about the robbery,and they ended the first round of questioning.
after the first round of questioning,was booked and made a telephone call to his mother.about two and a half hours after the previous interrogation ended,the officers began interviewing again.they did not reread him his miranda warnings,although they did advise him that he continued to have his constitutional rights.stated he understood,then confessed to the crime.that confession is the subject of the motion to suppress.
on november,was indicted on one count of aiding and abetting a bank robbery in violation of and a.subsequently moved to suppress his confession.the parties agreed not to have a hearing on the issue,as the entire interrogation had been tape recorded and the tape was admitted into evidence.first argued that the officers undermined his miranda waiver of his right to counsel by falsely telling him,in the first interrogation session after
