police officer james arlio sued the acting chief of the trumbull police department,marlin lively,in the united states district court for the district of connecticut arterton,for violation of his first and fourteenth amendment rights.arlio claimed that lively,a republican,suspended him on charges because arlio had the temerity to support local democratic candidates for office.after trial,a jury found for arlio and awarded him in compensatory and punitive damages.because we find that the district court abused its discretion by allowing into evidence irrelevant and prejudicial testimony concerning a state arbitration board prior findings in arlio favor,we vacate and remand for a new trial.
as this case comes to us after a jury verdict,we view the facts in the light most favorable to arlio,the prevailing party.see kosmynka polaris,cir.
background 
in the fall of,a contentious municipal election divided the police department of trumbull,connecticut.seeking an edge in a tight race,republican candidate for first selectman kenneth halaby sought the official endorsement of the union representing trumbull police officers.instead,the union rebuffed halaby and endorsed a local democrat,allegedly for fear that,if elected,halaby would install a political ally,ann moore,as police commissioner.moore had antagonized trumbull police in the past over the arrests of her children.
nevertheless,halaby prevailed and the union fear soon came to pass.moore was quickly appointed chairperson of the trumbull board of police commissioners despite a complaint by police officers to the town ethics commission.moore then handpicked lieutenant marlin lively to serve as acting chief of police.
lively presided over a department splintered along partisan lines.officers known to be democratic supporters claimed to suffer baseless disciplinary actions and arbitrary scheduling changes indeed,seven detectives ultimately brought a separate action against lively and moore in the district of connecticut for violation of their first amendment rights to political expression.those claims were settled out of court in january.
sergeant james arlio was not a party to that suit.arlio was a year veteran of the department and a shift supervisor.he had never been disciplined or accused of misconduct.arlio aspired to make lieutenant,and had for some time competed in a rigorous civil service examination process.in february,arlio finally completed the written component and qualified to proceed to the oral test in april.his ambition was within his grasp.unfortunately for arlio,he was also a democratic supporter and had been of the union that had refused to endorse halaby.
on the morning of april,arlio was working the graveyard shift in the radio communications center at the police station.at around,lively entered the building and proceeded directly to the hallway outside the communications room.the door was shut.lively spotted officer targowski and beckoned him over.lively asked targowski to confirm his suspicion that snoring was coming from inside the communications center.targowski responded that he heard no such thing.
without opening the door to the radio room,lively returned to his office and issued an order to fetch arlio.when arlio arrived,lively suspended him for sleeping on the job,effective immediately.arlio was given no opportunity to respond to the charge.lively later furnished arlio with a written notice of the suspension.months later,a copy of that notice somehow worked its way onto the trumbull times news desk.the times reported arlio alleged somnolence and resulting suspension,humiliating arlio and his family.
the timely intervention of the police union allowed arlio to take his lieutenant oral examination as scheduled.however,the union deal with the city was reached only at the eleventh hour,leaving arlio little time to study and prepare.arlio failed.in the end,arlio was suspended without pay for days.he remains a sergeant.
after a frustrated attempt at pursuing relief through the union grievance process,arlio filed a complaint with the state of connecticut board of mediation and arbitration the arbitration board.arlio and lively both testified and presented evidence at board hearings.the sole issue in that proceeding was whether lively had just cause to suspend arlio under the union collective bargaining agreement with the municipality.
the arbitration board ultimately agreed with arlio and issued a written decision finding that arlio suspension was not for just cause and awarding him back wages.feeling that his constitutional rights had also been violated,arlio turned for redress to the federal courts.
the federal court proceeding 
in november,arlio sued lively under in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,alleging that lively unconstitutionally suspended him because of his political opinions in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.he also pressed a state law cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
in april,lively made a motion in limine to exclude from evidence,inter alia,any mention of the prior arbitration proceeding where arlio had prevailed.lively argued that such evidence was irrelevant to arlio constitutional claims because the arbitration board decision was limited to the propriety of arlio suspension under the union labor agreement and overly prejudicial because the jury would be strongly inclined to defer to a prior determination on the incident by an expert state agency.
at a pretrial conference,the district court initially suggested that the arbitration board decision just is relevant.the court,however,decided that the jury should know why arlio was not seeking back pay which had been awarded by the arbitration board.the court felt that withholding this information would just invite the jury to speculate about the white elephant in the corner.thus,the court asked lively to prepare a jury instruction explaining that back wages had already been awarded in the arbitration.
the district court ultimately found lively proposed jury instruction lacking.now itself distracted by the white elephant,the court permitted arlio to testify about the arbitration proceeding and his damage award.specifically,arlio stated that he was awarded back pay and he added that the arbitration board had the power to determine that his suspension had not been for just cause.the court then provided the jury with a limiting instruction,noting that,while the arbitration board had revoked arlio suspension,it never addressed his constitutional claims.
at the close of evidence,lively claimed qualified immunity as a state actor and moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court reserved decision.
the jury ultimately found for arlio on all counts and awarded him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.in september,the district court denied lively renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law as well as his motion for a new trial.
lively now appeals.
discussion 
lively presses two central contentions before this court that the district court should be reversed and the action dismissed because he was entitled to qualified immunity as a government actor performing a discretionary function and that a new trial is required because the district court abused its discretion by admitting testimony regarding the arbitration board proceeding.while we find lively qualified immunity argument meritless,we agree with his second contention.
qualified immunity 
we review a denial of qualified immunity de novo.anderson recore,cir.
a district court should not grant judgment as a matter of law unless the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,is insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find in his favor.realty dev,cir.
qualified immunity shields government officials from liability for civil damages as a result of their performance of discretionary functions,and serves to protect government officials from the burdens of costly,but insubstantial,lawsuits.lennon miller,cir.such actors are sheltered only insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasona
