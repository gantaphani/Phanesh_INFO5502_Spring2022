background 
factual background 
on october,shannon mandel was hired as an inside sales and customer relations coordinator by m q packaging corporation m q,which manufactures and sells packaging film.mandel claimed that,throughout her employment from october,to may,she was sexually harassed and discriminated against by male managers,supervisors,and owners in alleged incidents such as being referred to as woman,darling,the woman,fluffy,missy,hon,and toots having her body,clothing,and physical appearance commented on being told that she was foolish not to use her assets being told by systems manager david benetz,when she asked for directions to a meeting at corporate headquarters,that f or you the meeting will start at my house tonight and we will conclude our part of it tomorrow morning maybe we may need to postpone the meeting with everyone else a few hours to finish up being told by quality manager harold brenneman that he fantasized about her while he was having sex with his wife being told in a review by managing director and later president coo michael schmal that she was too female and too emotional being solicited for dates by vice president of sales curt rubenstein even after she told him she was not interested being told to clean the bathroom and make coffee when male employees were not asked to perform such tasks and being paid less and given less vacation time than a male manager.
mandel reported to george schmidt from october,until or,to vice president jack menges until february of,and finally to schmal until may.mandel contends that schmal,department manager larry dahm,plant manager ernest bachert,and human resources manager jack conway also reported to menges during the same time period and were her peers.neither menges nor schmidt ever harassed mendel.
on april,during a meeting regarding sample orders,bachert became angry,repeatedly called mandel a bitch,and screamed shut the fuck up.bachert had previously referred to mandel as a bitch,both in and out of her presence.as a result of the meeting,mandel resigned on may,by submitting a letter with two weeks notice to schmal.when mandel resigned from m q,she accepted a position with yuengling.
in her resignation letter,mandel did not complain of harassment or discrimination,apparently because she was concerned she would be denied her vacation time.she did,however,refer to the employee handbook.the employee handbook included an equal employment opportunity policy,which informed employees that they should contact the personnel manager in this case,conway if they felt they were being discriminated against.the employee handbook also included an open door policy,which directed employees to discuss any issues first with their supervisor and then with the personnel manager.mandel testified in her deposition that she understood the policies in the employee handbook but felt uncomfortable going to conway or schmal with her complaints.conway testified in his deposition that other than giving each employee a copy of the employee handbook,there was no training regarding discrimination or sexual harassment.
although mandel complained to schmidt about being told to make coffee,she did not complain to her supervisors about other alleged incidents of harassment or discrimination.mandel occasionally used profanity and sent emails containing sexual humor.mandel also called bachert gay on a few occasions,apparently as a joke in reference to jealous husbands who claimed bachert made advances to their wives.mandel was never disciplined during her employment with m 
procedural history 
mandel completed equal employment opportunity commission eeoc questionnaires dated july,which were received by the eeoc on september.on the questionnaires,mandel checked boxes indicating i want to file a charge.the eeoc processed the forms and issued a charge of discrimination charge on december.that same day,mandel requested that the charge be dual filed with the pennsylvania human relations commission phrc.on october,the eeoc issued a dismissal and notice of rights,indicating the eeoc is unable to conclude that the information obtained establishes violations of the statutes and informing mandel of her right to sue within days of receipt.
on january,mandel filed a complaint against m q,alleging discrimination,sexual harassment,and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et counts i and ii,and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.et count iii,as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress in violation of pennsylvania law count iv.
on august,the district court partially granted m q motion to dismiss pursuant to.b.the district court found that mandel had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies because she indicated on the eeoc questionnaires that she did not take action for fear of reprisal and thus any claim of retaliation was not encompassed in the eeoc charge.the district court also found that the allegations did not constitute the type of clearly disparate and ultra extreme conduct actionable under an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.the district court,therefore,dismissed counts i,ii,and iii to the extent they alleged claims of retaliation and dismissed count iv in its entirety.
on july,the district court granted m q motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims.the district court excluded evidence of certain alleged incidents because mandel did not testify to them in her deposition,although she discussed them in her eeoc questionnaires.the district court found all of mandel claims under the phra time barred,as well as all claims under title vii for incidents that occurred prior to november.the district court then considered the remaining incidents on the merits and granted summary judgment in favor of m 
mandel appealed,and the eeoc filed an amicus brief.
ii.discussion 
motion to dismiss 
mandel argues that the district court erred in granting m q motion to dismiss all claims of retaliation.we exercise plenary review of an order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to.b.newman beard,cir.we accept all factual allegations as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.
a plaintiff must exhaust all required administrative remedies before bringing a claim for judicial relief.robinson dalton,cir.to bring a claim under title vii,a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc and procure a notice of the right to sue.see id.at.the same is required to bring a claim under the phra.atkinson lafayette,cir claims under the phra are interpreted coextensively with title vii claims.t he parameters of the civil action in the district court are defined by the scope of the eeoc investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination,including new acts which occurred during the pendency of proceedings before the eeoc.ostapowicz johnson bronze,cir citations omitted.a plaintiff claim must thus fall fairly within the scope of the prior eeoc complaint,or the investigation arising therefrom.antol perry,cir.
mandel contends,as she did before the district court,that she was constructively discharged due to intolerable work conditions after she complained of sex discrimination and sexual harassment.the district court found that the retaliation claims were not within the scope of the charge,explaining that although there was substantial factual overlap between the charge and the complaint,they contradicted each other on the facts supporting the retaliation claims.in particular,the district court noted 
plaintiff complaint alleges she took action by complaining to the general manager and suffered consequent reprisal.her eeoc charge indicates that she did not take action for fear of reprisal.it can not reasonably be expected that the eeoc investigation would encompass a claim of retaliation for engaging in statutorily protected activity where plaintiff charge states that she refrained from activity that might be protected,nor is there any indication that a retaliation claim was in fact investigated.
the district court correctly concluded that the factual statement in support of the charge did not encompass claims of retaliation.mandel herself concedes that the box for retaliation was not checked on the charge.mandel urges this court to construe the charge liberally,however,because it is nearly always drafted by a.a n unsophisticated,inartfully drafted charge should not be dispositive of a plaintiff rights.such an argument is inapt here because mandel,even as a,could have easily checked the box for retaliation on the charge but failed to do so.she also failed to allege any retaliatory conduct in the charge.when asked in the questionnaires whether she had reported the alleged harassment to her employer,she responded no and again failed to check the box for retaliation.because mandel failed to exhaust her remedies for any claims of retaliation,we will affirm the district court dismissal of counts i,ii,and iii to the extent that they allege claims of retaliation.
motion for summary judgment 
mandel appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in m q favor on the phra claims,the title vii hostile work environment claim,and the title vii sex discrimination claims.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same standard as the district court.doe indian river sch,cir.summary judgment should be granted if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.a.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that party favor.id.
phra claims 
to bring suit under the phra,an administrative complaint must first be filed with the phrc within days of the alleged act of discrimination.h.the district court found all phra claims time barred,reasoning that more than days had passed from mandel resignation on may,to her of a complaint with the phrc on december.
mandel contends that the day period should instead be calculated from september,the date on which the eeoc received her questionnaires.the district court rejected that argument,explaining that the filing of a charge with the eeoc in itself is not sufficient to comply with the phra.we have previously addressed dual filing with the eeoc and the phrc,explaining 
t he worksharing agreement which divides responsibility for processing claims that have been dual filed with both the eeoc and the phrc allows a plaintiff to proceed in court under title vii without first filing with the phrc.that,however,does not mean that a plaintiff can initiate phrc proceedings as required by the phra merely by filing with the eeoc.whether a plaintiff has initiated phrc proceedings under the phra is a state law issue eeoc procedures are not a sufficient surrogate for phrc remedies.
woodson scott paper,cir footnotes omitted.the district court correctly concluded,therefore,that the mere filling out of an eeoc charge information questionnaire can not be in itself sufficient to comply with the phra.moreover,as the district court noted,the questionnaires did not contain any indication of dual filing.mandel further argues that the day period should be enlarged to days because pennsylvania is a deferral state.the district court agreed that pennsylvania is a deferral state and thus the statute of limitations for the charge was extended to days.see e defining time for filing a charge as days,enlarged to days where the complainant initially instituted state proceedings.the district court properly rejected mandel argument,however,because the day extended statute of limitations applies only to the charge,not to the phra filing.see id.we conclude that mandel phra claims are time barred and thus affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in m q favor on the phra claims count iii.
title vii claims 
under title vii,it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.
statute of limitations 
to bring suit under title vii,a claimant in a deferral state,such as pennsylvania,must first file a complaint with the eeoc within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.e.d iscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.passenger morgan,d.a discrete act in itself constitutes a separate actionable unlawful employment practice.id.at.discrete acts include,for example,termination,failure to promote,denial of transfer,or refusal to hire.id.
under the continuing violation doctrine,discriminatory acts that are not individually actionable may be aggregated to make out a hostile work environment claim such acts can occur at any time so long as they are linked in a pattern of actions which continues into the applicable limitations period.city of newark,cir citing morgan,at explaining court may consider entire scope of a hostile work environment claim so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.a hostile work environment claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice and can not be said to occur on any particular day.morgan,at.to allege a continuing violation,the plaintiff must show that all acts which constitute the claim are part of the same unlawful employment practice and that at least one act falls within the applicable limitations period.see morgan,at see also west phila,cir explaining plaintiff must show that at least one act occurred within the filing period and that the harassment is more than the occurrence of isolated or sporadic acts of intentional discrimination.
prior to the decision of the supreme court in national railroad passenger morgan,d,we had adopted from berry board of supervisors,cir,a list of three factors to aid in distinguishing between the occurrence of isolated acts of discrimination and a persistent,ongoing pattern.in particular,our opinions in west philadelphia electrical,cir,and rush scott specialty gases,cir,contained dicta explaining that the fifth circuit court of appeals considered the subject matter frequency,and degree of of the underlying acts to distinguish continuing violations from isolated occurrences see west,at discussing berry,at see also rush scott specialty gases,cir same.citing west,the district court applied the berry factors and determined that mandel claims met the subject matter and frequency requirements but failed the permanency requirement because mandel should have been aware of the need to assert her rights but did not pursue her claim with reasonable diligence,and thus she is precluded from using the continuing violation theory.
following morgan,however,permanency is not required to establish a continuing violation 
it is precisely because the entire hostile work environment encompasses a single unlawful employment practice that we do not hold,as have some of the circuits,that the plaintiff may not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran on such conduct.the statute does not separate individual acts that are part of the hostile environment claim from the whole for the purposes of timely filing and liability.and the statute does not contain a requirement that the employee file a charge prior to or days after the single unlawful pr
