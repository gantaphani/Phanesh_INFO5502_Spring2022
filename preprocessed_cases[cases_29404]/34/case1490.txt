opinion of the court 
introduction 
the law firm of zeichner ellman krause llp the zeichner firm,and two of its attorneys,philip rosen and stephen ellman,appeal sanctions the district court imposed under.the sanctions were largely based upon the court conclusion that rosen deliberately misrepresented facts to the court chambers.the court came to this conclusion by taking judicial notice of the contents of two telephone conversations that the court did not personally hear,and was not a party to.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse.
ii.background 
this dispute arose out of a mortgage foreclosure action.lasalle national bank lasalle held a recorded first mortgage on several apartment houses in east orange,new jersey that were owned by first connecticut holding company first connecticut.first connecticut defaulted on its loan obligations to lasalle around november of.lasalle thereafter retained the zeichner firm to represent lasalle interests in the mortgage foreclosure action that lasalle brought against first connecticut in the district court of new jersey.
the lasalle mortgage was not the only encumbrance on the east orange properties.james licata,a principal in first connecticut,had previously entered into a joint venture with peter mocco,and first connecticut and its holdings were part of that joint venture agreement.hamilton park health care center hamilton park had taken a second recorded mortgage on the east orange properties to secure advances it made to the joint venture.in time,the relationship between licata and mocco deteriorated to the point that mocco sued licata in new jersey superior court over a dispute related to their joint venture.see mocco licata,docket no.the mocco litigation the law firm of hellring lindeman goldstein siegal,llp the hellring firm represented hamilton park and mocco in that litigation,but lasalle was not a party to the mocco litigation.
rosen and ellman filed the aforementioned federal foreclosure action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of lasalle based upon that court diversity jurisdiction.both rosen and ellman were aware that the mocco litigation involving the status of the east orange properties was already pending in the new jersey superior court.on february,the new jersey superior court heard oral argument regarding the appointment of a rent receiver for the east orange properties in the mocco litigation.both rosen and ellman attended that oral argument.however,that court refused to appoint a receiver,and instead appointed a special fiscal agent.
rosen asserts that before he filed lasalle complaint in the district court,he researched the issue of who should receive notice of the foreclosure action.he claims that his research included a treatise that indicated that only those parties that would be adversely affected by the receivership such as an owner of the property,or parties having a contractual relationship with the lender were entitled to notice.rosen performed a title search and found that the sole record owner of the property was first connecticut.purportedly in reliance upon his research,rosen therefore concluded that first connecticut was the only party entitled to notice of the federal receivership application.accordingly,before filing the foreclosure action in district court,rosen contacted first connecticut general counsel,pieter de jong,and informed him that he rosen was about to file a complaint in foreclosure and a motion for appointment of a rent receiver.de jong told rosen that first connecticut would not oppose the rent receivership as long as new vistas corporation was recommended as the receiver.ellman then informed the hellring firm that the zeichner firm would be filing the motion.
on june,rosen filed both a complaint in foreclosure and a motion for appointment of a rent receiver along with an accompanying proposed order the complaint named first connecticut,james licata,hamilton park,and other relevant parties as defendants.however,the motion for a rent receivership and the accompanying proposed order named first connecticut as the sole defendant and provided for service only on first connecticut.the foreclosure action was assigned to the faith hochberg.thereafter,rosen prepared an order to show cause why a rent receiver should not be appointed directed at first connecticut,and forwarded it to the judge chambers.
it is undisputed that rosen subsequently had two telephone conversations with the judge law clerk pertaining to the order to show cause.however,the substance of those conversations is very much in dispute.in the first conversation,rosen claims that he told the law clerk that borrower counsel did not object to a receivership so long as new vistas was appointed receiver.rosen claims that his use of the term borrower counsel referred solely to first connecticut as mortgagor.as we will discuss below,the court concluded that rosen told the law clerk something quite different.
rosen also submitted a certification from stephen williams,vice president of gmac commercial mortgage corporation williams certification in conjunction with his motion for a rent receiver.the williams certification was an page document containing a single footnote.that footnote informed the district court of the dispute between licata and mocco relating to their joint venture,and further informed the district court of the ongoing litigation in new jersey superior court.the footnote mentioned that lasalle was not a party to the dispute,and that the state court had appointed a special fiscal agent.
rosen then had a second telephone conversation with judge hochberg law clerk the same afternoon as the first one.according to rosen,the law clerk told him that the court wanted confirmation from borrower counsel that the proposed receivership was unopposed.rosen relayed that request to de jong,and de jong thereafter supplied a letter stating that first connecticut as borrower did not object to a rent receivership so long as new vistas was appointed receiver.rosen forwarded that letter to judge hochberg chambers the next day,and on june,the court granted the motion and appointed new vistas as the rent receiver using the proposed order that rosen had drafted.the proposed order provided for notice only to first connecticut as follows 
this matter having been opened to the court by zeichner ellman krause llp,attorneys for plaintiff,upon notice to the,first connecticut holding group,xxiii,upon motion for the appointment of a rent receiver 
emphasis added.paragraph of the proposed order also stated that a conformed,executed copy of this order shall be served by plaintiff counsel upon counsel for,first connecticut holding group,xxiii.in issuing the proposed order,the court made certain handwritten changes to the language rosen had submitted.most importantly for our purposes,the court added a sentence stating defense counsel submitted a letter to this court indicating that it does not object to the entry of this order.emphasis added.
after the order came to the attention of the hellring firm two attorneys from that moloshok and james rosen and informed him of their displeasure with the receivership order.on july,scarpone sent a letter brief to judge hochberg chambers informing the judge that hamilton park objected to the appointment of a receiver.the letter also informed the judge that hamilton park had not received notice of the receivership petition,and that,contrary to the judge understanding,hamilton park did oppose the receivership.the letter also advised the court of the litigation in the new jersey superior court and specifically mentioned that the superior court had already denied one motion for the appointment of a receiver and was currently considering a second motion for appointment of a receiver.the letter noted that the attorneys from the zeichner firm had attended the hearing for the appointment of a receiver in superior court,and that the hellring firm was going to file a motion asking the district court to abstain under the princess lida doctrine in light of the pending state court litigation.the next day,the zeichner firm sent a letter to the court in which the firm defended the propriety of its actions in obtaining the receivership in the district court and argued against application of the princess lida doctrine.
the district court then,sua sponte,scheduled a hearing for july to determine whether the receivership order should be vacated,whether it should refrain from acting under the princess lida doctrine,and the extent of the zeichner firm knowledge of the state court proceedings.at the hearing,the court expressed understandable concern that rosen and ellman had misrepresented that the receivership application was unopposed given the communication the court had subsequently received from agents of hamilton park the following exchange occurred between rosen and the court 
the court rosen,i am mystified,shocked,you name it,that a matter that was presented to this court as unopposed,when there was no defense counsel that in fact consented to the entry of the order that you sought.
rosen judge,let me address that.
the court.no.just tell me.did any defense counsel in this case consent to the entry of your motion for a rent receiver 
rosen yes.i was advised by dejong sic that he had authority to bind the owner and that he indicated there would be no opposition to the motion.
the court but he not counsel in this case.correct and he told you that.
rosen he told me that he a registered agent,has authority to bind the owner of the property.
the court and further did you have consent from any of the other defendants who you sued in this action to your motion for appointment of a rent receiver 
rosen no,because i did not think that that was required.
rosen explained that he sought consent only from first connecticut because he believed,based upon his research,that only the owner of the property first connecticut could object or consent to the appointment of a receiver.the court,however,told rosen in no uncertain terms that consent must be obtained from all defendants to properly represent to the matter as unopposed 
the court let me tell you right now,that if you inform a court that a motion is unopposed,unless you say to that court,defendant x,y,z takes the following position,but i do believe it relevant,then it my determination,and not yours,rosen,as to who has a right to be heard on a motion.the only reason that the order was entered was based upon your representation that there was no opposition to the motion for appointment of a rent receiver from the defendants in this case.all defendants are entitled to notice of motions,as you well know.and in this case you presented the consent of one person which was misleading,and that he is not even appearing in this action.and the other defendants did not give you consent,and yet you represented that the motion was unopposed.this is misleading to the court,rosen.the motion is vacated.the appointment of the rent receiver is hereby vacated based upon your misrepresentations to this court.
rosen judge,i would just say that there was absolutely no intent whatsoever to deceive or mislead this court.in my experience with rent receivers,i never had a situation where notice had to be given to anyone other than the owner of the property.the documents i have in my file,which i submitted to this court,evidence that there only one owner of the property.
the next day the district court entered an order vacating the receivership,and taxing all costs resulting from the receivership as of that date against the zeichner firm.
the court also sua sponte issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed under for unreasonably multiplying the litigation,and a show cause hearing was held on july.william marshall,another partner at the zeichner firm,represented rosen and ellman at the show cause hearing.during that hearing the court quickly made it very clear that it believed that rosen had misrepresented the circumstances surrounding the receivership petition during discussions with the judge law clerk.rosen took the stand and testified about those discussions as follows 
q did you have any conversation with anyone from the judge chambers 
a i did.i explained to the law clerk again that i had a conversation,i do not believe i ever referenced dejong sic name.the way i stated it was i had a conversation with borrower counsel.i explained to her that initially we were seeking sutton and edwards as a rent receiver.but that first connecticut did feel that they were an appropriate receiver,but that new vistas corporation would be more appropriate.that we confirmed with our client that it would be appropriate to utilize new vistas,and that based upon that that they had told me,they being the borrower counsel,that they would not be objecting to the entry of the receivership application.the law clerk suggested that she would advise the court of that,and i left.
q okay.and did there come a time when you had subsequent contact with the law clerk 
a yes.that afternoon being the afternoon of june,i received a call from the law clerk,who suggested that the court would like,either by way of a letter or some other communication from borrower counsel,that in fact the statement that i had made to the court was true,that they were not objecting,and to secure that,and then fax it over,and she indicated that the court does really accept faxes,but for this purpose i could get the letter and fax it over.i hung up from the law clerk and called dejong sic to explain the instructions that i had.dejong sic was not available.i left a voice mail message and the morning of june,which was the next morning,that being a friday,i send you the letter in about two hours.i got the letter,stuck it in the fax machine and sent it to the law clerk.
did you ever make the representation to the court either directly to the court or through the court clerk,the law clerk,that you had the consent of all parties to the action to the receivership 
a no,i sorry,marshall,no,i did not.
did you ever intend to deceive the court in connection with your application 
a i never intended to deceive the court.
rosen specifically denied ever using the term defense counsel in speaking to the judge law clerk.
q did you ever use the term defense counsel in dealing with the court chambers 
a no,sir,i did.
the law clerk was never called to the stand to testify.the law clerk version of events,therefore,was never placed on the record,and rosen counsel was not able to cross examine her regarding any inconsistencies with rosen account,or explore whether differing recollections merely resulted from an innocent misunderstanding.consequently,the only sworn testimony regarding the communications between the law clerk and rosen came from rosen.nevertheless,the court rejected rosen testimony outright.the court did so by taking judicial notice that rosen had used the term defense counsel rather than borrower counsel in his communications with the law clerk.the following exchange reflects the court reasoning 
the court i can tell that the reason that the words defense counsel appear in handwriting is because that what was requested,that rosen provide a letter stating that defense counsel does not object.that is,as you know from years of litigation,the very standard way in which one demonstrates.
marshall well,your honor,not to be argumentative,but it is contrary to the first page of the order.
the court no,the first page talks about notice.i talking about the representation to chambers.rosen was.rosen,as you conceded earlier in our colloquy,represented to chambers that the matter was unopposed,and you earlier said yes,that right.
marshall well 
the court and then he was told,because i was told about this,to get a written statement,either certification or letter from defense counsel,so stating.and that why the words defense counsel appear in the order.because in response to that,that when the letter came in.there was never distinction sic made by borrower counsel and defense counsel.
marshall i believe that rosen testimony was he talking sic in terms of borrower.
the court that what he now says.but the words that were used by chambers were to provide a letter from defense counsel and without that being corrected the letter comes in and it is only natural for the court to assume that he complied with the request to provide a letter from defense counsel,which is why the words defense counsel appear in that,a handwritten notation editing the form of the order.
marshall but those are not his words,your honor.those are the words at the time the order was issued,not at the time that he prepared this order and 
the court no,those were the words that reflect the court direction to him,that he is to produce a writing from defense counsel.
marshall your honor,i believe this was prepared after the court received the letter,because it says the court,i sorry,and defense counsel having submitted a letter to the court.
the court exactly.
marshall a letter,which letter on its own face says that he only general counsel to first connecticut.
the court marshall,i know you trying the best you can,but that letter does say i not defense counsel.it does say i not making an appearance in this action.and that letter was produced,i am telling you as a matter of fact,of which i take judicial notice,that that letter was produced by rosen in response to an oral request from my chambers to produce either a certification or a letter from defense counsel stating that there was no opposition.
emphasis added.
on august,the court entered an order and accompanying published opinion sanctioning rosen and ellman under.rosen and ellman were ordered to personally pay attorneys fees to the hellring firm for time it spent working on the receivership issue in the amount of.rosen and ellman were also ordered to personally bear the costs of the rent receiver in the amount of.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
we review the district court imposition of attorney sanctions under for an abuse of discretion.see in re orthopedic bone screw products,cir zuk east.pennsylvania psych,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when the court bases its opinion on a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an erroneous legal conclusion,or an improper application of law to fact.see in re prudential ins.am.sales practice litig.agent actions,cir.moreover,inasmuch as a district court finding of bad faith on the part of an attorney is a finding of fact,we review it for clear error.see hackman valley fair,cir.
any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the united states or any territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
the statute thus limits attorney sanctions imposed thereunder to those situations where an attorney has multiplied proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously thereby increasing the cost of the proceedings with bad faith or with intentional misconduct.see in re prudential,at.the sanctions that may be imposed under are also limited to excess costs and expenses that are incurred because of such conduct.
the sanctions are intended to deter an attorney from intentionally and unnecessarily delaying judicial proceedings,and they are limited to the costs that result from such delay.see zuk,at.although provides a court with a mechanism for sanctioning vexatious and willful conduct,courts should exercise this sanctioning power only in instances of a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice.ford temple,cir,quoting overnite transp.chicago industr.tire,cir.
the power to sanction under necessarily carries with it the potential for abuse,and therefore the statute should be construed narrowly and with great caution so as not to stifle the enthusiasm or chill the creativity that is the very lifeblood of the law.mone commn r of intern.revenue,cir see also ford,at the uncritical imposition of attorneys fees can have an undesirable chilling effect on an attorney legitimate ethical obligation to represent his client zealously.baker industr.cerberus,cir th e bad faith requirement is necessary to avoid chilling an attorney legitimate ethical obligation to represent his client zealously.
consequently,sanctions may not be imposed under absent a finding that counsel conduct resulted from bad faith,rather than misunderstanding,bad judgment,or zeal.see zuk,at ford,at baker,at.in baker,we approvingly noted the bad faith standard adopted in colucci new york times.the colucci court stated that under,an attorney conduct must be of an egregious nature,stamped by bad faith that is violative of recognized standards in the conduct of litigation.baker,at,quoting colucci.at.thus,we have stated that the bad faith requirement is necessary for a finding of liability,otherwise an attorney who might be guilty of no more than a mistake in professional judgment in pursuing a client goals might be made liable for excess attorneys fees baker,at 
rosen and ellman conduct 
the sanctions imposed on rosen and ellman were based upon the following findings rosen and ellman failed to provide notice to all defendants that lasalle was seeking a receivership the judge law clerk told rosen to supply a letter to chambers from defense counsel that the motion was unopposed the de jong letter that rosen provided only reflected the position of one defendant and with the exception of the aforementioned footnote in the williams certification,rosen papers did not disclose the simultaneous state court litigation.however,it seems clear to us that the district court requisite finding of bad faith rests primarily,if not entirely,upon the court conclusion that rosen intentionally misrepresented that the receivership was unopposed in his discussions with the court law clerk.moreover,to the extent that the court finding of bad faith does not rest solely on that factor,it certainly appears to have been colored by it.that conclusion,in turn,results from the judicial notice that the court took of what rosen told the law clerk during his telephone discussions with her.rosen insists that his discussions with the law clerk referred only to borrower counsel,but the court took judicial notice and found as a matter of fact that he had deliberately and falsely stated that defense counsel did not object.
federal rule of evidence b defines a judicially noticed fact as one that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy can not reasonably be questioned.fed.evid.b.for all practical purposes,judicially noticing a fact is tantamount to directing a verdict against a party as to the noticed fact.see werner werner,cir,citing united states jones,cir.
here,there was clearly a disputed issue of fact as to whether rosen referred to borrower counsel or defense counsel in speaking to the judge law clerk,and whether the clerk had requested a letter from borrower counsel as opposed to defense counsel.as noted above,rosen took the witness stand at the show cause hearing and testified under oath that he used the term borrower counsel when speaking to the court chambers.the record from that hearing shows that,without any contrary testimony whatsoever,the district court rejected rosen account and thereafter based a conclusion of bad faith under upon a finding that rosen explanation was not credible.as noted above,the court explained its rejection of rosen account as follows i am telling you as a matter of fact,of which i take judicial notice,that the de jong letter was produced by rosen in response to an oral request from my chambers to produce either a certification or a letter from defense counsel stating that there was no opposition.emphasis added.
the court finding of fact of the content of the disputed conversations between rosen and the law clerk understandably colored the court view of rosen conduct here.the court took judicial notice of those two conversations even though the court did not hear any part of the disputed conversations and had no way of knowing what was said other than asking the law clerk the only participant other than rosen.we must,therefore,conclude that the judge certainty as to the substa
