defendants stephen caracappa and louis eppolito appeal from final judgments entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york after a jury trial before jack weinstein,judge,convicting both defendants of racketeering conspiracy,in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,d,and distribution of and conspiracy to distribute narcotics,in violation of a and,and convicting eppolito of money laundering,in violation of a b.in finding caracappa and eppolito guilty of rico conspiracy,the jury found that they had committed numerous predicate acts of racketeering activity,including many direct,accessorial,or conspiratorial acts of murder,kidnaping,and tampering with or retaliating against witnesses.caracappa was sentenced principally to imprisonment for life plus years eppolito was sentenced principally to imprisonment for life plus years.on appeal,caracappa contends principally that he was deprived of a fair trial because of the admission of evidence of an statement by the government key witness and because of improper remarks by the government in summation he also challenges,inter alia,the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions on the narcotics counts,and he contends that the sentence imposed on him on those counts is excessive.eppolito contends principally that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by reason of his attorney failures to communicate with him,to investigate and call favorable witnesses,and to inform him of his right to testify at trial.finding no merit in defendants contentions,we affirm the judgments of conviction.
background 
this matter was previously before this court in united states.eppolito,cir eppolito ii,rev g in part d eppolito i,cert.denied,in which we reversed the district court dismissal of defendants racketeering conspiracy convictions.the events leading to the prosecution are recounted in detail in eppolito ii,familiarity with which is assumed.we summarize below,in the light most favorable to the government and in accordance with the jury verdicts,the evidence most pertinent to the present appeals.
a.the mafia cops 
caracappa and eppolito are former police detectives who were employed by the new york city police department nypd until the early.in,while so employed,they were also a partnership employed by anthony casso,the underboss,second in command,of the lucchese crime of the five organized crime families in the new york city area.the government key witness at trial was burton kaplan,who was a former associate of the lucchese crime family,a close friend of casso,and the main intermediary between casso and.kaplan testified to the following events.
had gained the trust of kaplan in early by helping to commit a murder for him.kaplan suspected that israel greenwald,a collaborator in one of kaplan own criminal schemes,was about to become an informant.determined greenwald whereabouts,followed him on a highway,and used flashing lights to cause him to pull over telling greenwald they needed to take him to the police station for a lineup in a case,they instead took him to another location where he was shot and killed.for their efforts,caracappa and eppolito were paid more than.
in,there was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of casso in nypd precinct.eppolito was assigned to that precinct,and caracappa was a member of a task force whose members included local detectives and agents of the federal bureau of investigation.kaplan recommended caracappa and disclosing their casso as a possible source of information on casso attackers.casso learned defendants names in,when eppolito published his autobiography entitled mafia cop and included pictures of himself and caracappa.in response to the ensuing request,gave kaplan a packet of police reports that included a photograph of jimmy hydell,an associate of the gambino crime family,and the information that hydell was one of the men involved in the attempt on casso life.after kaplan described the methods had used with greenwald,casso hired caracappa and eppolito to kidnap hydell.caracappa and eppolito themselves were not to kill hydell,however,but only to deliver him to casso so that casso could extract information from him and then kill him.the hydell mission was successfully completed,and were paid nearly.thereafter,at eppolito request,casso placed on retainer at the rate of per month in exchange for their using their positions to collect all the information they could about investigations on any of the five organized crime families,including the identities of informants,the locations of wiretaps,and any imminent arrests,and passing that information to kaplan for casso.caracappa and eppolito were to be paid extra for murder contracts.one such for the murder of edward eddie lino,whom hydell had identified in as one of the three gambino crime family members who ordered the attempt on casso life.
the retainer agreement required caracappa and eppolito to work exclusively for casso and not deal with members of other crime families.when had information about other families,they gave it to kaplan,who passed it on to casso.casso relayed the information to those families.
when informed kaplan of persons giving,or believed to be giving,information to law enforcement authorities about casso or the lucchese family,casso had the informants killed.for example,soon after caracappa and eppolito were placed on retainer,casso asked kaplan to have them find out whether john otto heidel,a lucchese crime family associate,was cooperating with the authorities.determined that heidel was cooperating and they passed that information to casso through kaplan.casso had heidel killed.heidel had in fact been cooperating with the authorities,secretly recording incriminating conversations.eppolito,while officially and ostensibly investigating heidel murder,removed the incriminating audio tapes from heidel apartment and gave them to kaplan to give to casso.
casso similarly suspected lucchese crime family member anthony dilapi,who was on parole,of having become a government informant.casso summoned dilapi to a meeting,but dilapi instead fled new york.casso had kaplan ask caracappa to determine dilapi whereabouts.caracappa,through dilapi parole officer,located dilapi in california.casso had him killed.on another occasion,eppolito informed kaplan of an impending indictment in which lucchese crime family capo bruno facciola would be named as an unindicted rather than a defendant,leading eppolito to infer that facciola was a government cooperator.casso had facciola killed.kaplan testified that eppolito said he liked doing business with kaplan and casso because when eppolito provided casso with information,people got taken care of that deserved it eppolito ii,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in may,informed kaplan that casso and lucchese crime family boss victor amuso,among others,were about to be arrested.kaplan alerted amuso,who alerted casso by the next day,both amuso and casso had fled.while casso was a fugitive,he maintained contact with kaplan,who continued to relay to him sensitive law enforcement information received from and to deliver a month from casso to.eppolito retired from nypd in early,and caracappa retired from nypd in they remained on retainer until caracappa retired.
after retiring from nypd,eppolito moved to las vegas,where he started a business writing screenplays caracappa,who also eventually moved to las vegas,was a vice president of eppolito film company.in that business,eppolito would agree to write a screenplay for members of organized crime or drug gave him in cash and eppolito would send the investor percent of whatever amount was received from the screenplay sale.see eppolito ii,at.eppolito told stephen corso,a government informant,that many such investments were made by members of the gambino crime family.see,id.at.
corso had been assisting in a lengthy government investigation in las vegas that did not initially involve caracappa or eppolito.in the fall of,however,members of the gambino crime family and the bonanno crime family were attempting to raise money for the actual production of a movie written by eppolito,and they urged corso to meet eppolito and to persuade corso supposed clients to invest in the movie.instructed by his government first refused to see eppolito,stating that eppolito was a cop corso was thereafter instructed to agree to meet with eppolito,having been assured by one of the bonanno crime family members that lou was one of us,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
eppolito told corso that million would be needed to produce his movie,more than was available from crime family members.see,id.at.corso thereafter had numerous meetings with eppolito caracappa with respect to other possibilities for funding the movie.caracappa and eppolito were arrested in march,after corso had,for several months,taperecorded their conversations,see,id.at,including an attempt by caracappa and eppolito to secure other investors by supplying them with controlled substances,see part.below.
b.the flight,return,arrest,and cooperation of kaplan 
in the meantime,in,casso was arrested.in march,judd burstein,kaplan attorney,telephoned kaplan to alert him that casso had probably begun to cooperate with the government.within hours,kaplan left new york and went into hiding.in that month there were articles in new york city newspapers stating that casso had two officers on his payroll.at least one article identified the officers as caracappa and eppolito.shortly after reading these articles,kaplan told burstein that he,kaplan,had been the intermediary between casso and.
in,after learning that casso would not be used as a government witness after all,kaplan returned to new york.he was soon arrested and charged with narcotics offenses,having conducted a flourishing drug trafficking business for many years in his best year,distributing more than six tons of marijuana and earning some million.kaplan resisted repeated government attempts to gain his cooperation,and he proceeded to trial.he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute marijuana and was sentenced principally to a prison term of years.
in the fall of,by then over years of age and having spent the previous nine years in jail,kaplan decided to cooperate with the government in the prosecution of caracappa and eppolito.principally on the basis of the testimony of kaplan and corso,caracappa and eppolito were convicted of rico conspiracy,in violation of d.in connection with their activities in las vegas after retiring from nypd,caracappa and eppolito were also convicted,largely on the basis of the testimony of corso,of distributing narcotics in violation of a,and conspiring to do so in violation of and eppolito was convicted of money laundering in violation of a b.
ii.caracappa 
on this appeal,caracappa contends principally that the trial court erred in allowing burstein to testify to kaplan statement that kaplan had been the intermediary between casso and that statements by the government in summation improperly bolstered burstein testimony and that the government in summation improperly introduced consideration of religion.caracappa also contends that the government of one of his witnesses was improper,that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the narcotics counts,and that his sentence on those counts is unreasonable.we find no basis for reversal.
a.the admissibility of kaplan statement 
after kaplan had testified and described relaying information received from caracappa and eppolito to casso and relaying to them instructions and payments from casso,and after defendants had kaplan at length,challenging the veracity of that testimony,the government was allowed to call burstein as a witness to testify that kaplan told him in that kaplan had been the conduit between and casso.caracappa contends principally that the burstein testimony was inadmissible hearsay and that,in any event,it should have been excluded because defendants had not received advance notice of the statement by kaplan and thus could not kaplan with respect to that statement.these contentions have no merit.
the federal rules of evidence specify the circumstances in which a prior statement by a witness is to be considered nonhearsay.rule d provides,in pertinent part,that a statement is not hearsay if t he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to concerning the statement,and the statement is consistent with the declarant testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.d b emphases added.in addition to these stated preconditions,there is imbedded in the rule a temporal limitation that permits the introduction of a declarant consistent statements to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive only when those statements were made before the charged recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.tome united states,see,united states,cir united states forrester,cir united states quinto,cir.
to come within rule d b,the prior consistent statement need not be proffered through the testimony of the declarant but may be proffered through any witness who has firsthand knowledge of the statement.see,united states mcgrath,cir,cert.denied,graham,federal practice procedure,at interim ed.graham.further,where the declarant has already testified and the prior consistent statement is proffered through the testimony of another witness,the rule subject to requirement is satisfied if the opposing party is not denied the opportunity to recall the declarant to the stand for concerning the statement.see,united states piva,cir graham,at.
we review the district court decision to admit a statement into evidence under rule d b for abuse of discretion.see united states burden,cir,petition for cert.filed,june,united states mcgrath,at.we see no abuse of discretion here.
at trial,much of the conducted by defendants was directed toward their defense,which asserted that after caracappa and eppolito retired from nypd and moved to las vegas,their rico conspiracy with kaplan ended,and that the present prosecution for their activities in new york was untimely.but defendants also aggressively challenged the truth of kaplan testimony as to the criminal activities of caracappa and eppolito while they were nypd detectives,questioning him at length about his cooperation agreement with the government and his anticipated gain from testifying against caracappa and eppolito,and repeatedly asking whether his testimony was being given in the hope that the government would appreciate his assistance and would move to reduce his sentence.the district court found that defendants ha d insinuated,directly and indirectly during the opening and during the that kaplan motive to lie arose from his desire to be released from prison tr,and it construed that line of questioning as a charge that kaplan testimony was being given for an improper motive see id.at.
although defendants contended that the temporal aspect of rule d b was not satisfied,arguing that kaplan had a motive to fabricate from the moment he learned that casso had been arrested,the district court rejected that contention.pointing out that kaplan was not in prison in when casso attempted to cooperate id.at,the court stated that 
f or defendants theory to hold,kaplan must have believed in that he kaplan would eventually cooperate with the government,hoping that his testimony against the defendants would be called into question and knowing that if he told burstein of his involvement,his account would have increased merit.
that sequence of events,which is farfetched on it s face,is undercut by what actually happened in when casso cooperated.far from running to the government to cooperate,kaplan went on the lam for approximately two years,returning only after he learned that casso could not be used as a government witness 
id.at.the court ruled that the preconditions of rule d b were satisfied and that burstein would be allowed to testify to kaplan statement.see id.at see also id.at,not allowing burstein to testify to a statement kaplan made to him after being arrested.in response to defendants complaint that,had they known of the statement in advance they could have kaplan on that statement,the court stated,you can recall him if you like.id.at.
having reviewed the record,we see no error in the district court findings that defendants had expressly or impliedly suggested that kaplan testimony was fabricated because of his desire to get out of prison.nor do we see any error in the court finding that kaplan statement to burstein,made while kaplan was on the lam and some two years before he was arrested,was made before kaplan had a motive to fabricate.
the record also amply shows that defendants could have kaplan on that statement.first,the court expressly stated that it would allow them to recall kaplan as a witness.second,the record shows that the material produced to defendants prior to kaplan,see,included an investigative report stating that burstein,kaplan attorney,told kaplan in march that casso had become a government witness,and that thereafter,after a newspaper article appeared naming eppolito and caracappa as the two hit men in the ed die lino homicide,kaplan told his attorney,in sum and substance that he had been the intermediary between eppolito,caracappa and casso government exhibit at.thus,defendants had in fact been informed of kaplan statement prior to trial and could have kaplan on it before burstein testified.
finally,although caracappa also contends that the government in summation improperly used burstein testimony to bolster that of kaplan,rather than using it solely to counter the suggestion that kaplan testimony was motivated by an improper purpose,we see no misuse by the government.prior consistent statements that are admissible under rule d b are substantive evidence.the prior statement is consistent with the testimony given on the stand,and,if the opposite party wishes to open the door for its admission in evidence,no sound reason is apparent why it should not be received generally.advisory commit tee note see,united states brennan,cir statements admitted under rule d are not hearsay and therefore are admissible as substantive evidence.
b.the challenges to the government rebuttal summation 
in the government rebuttal summation,the assistant united states attorney ausa made statements about kaplan statement to burstein,to which caracappa takes exception on appeal.the ausa stated,inter alia,i submit to you that based on the circumstances of the case and the circumstances of what kaplan told him,you can completely trust everything burstein said percent,percent tr,and burstein told you the truth.he is an officer of the court id.at.caracappa contends that the government thereby improperly vouched for burstein veracity.in addition,the ausa pointed out that all major religions such as islam,judaism,and catholicism have rites of penitence he analogized the privilege to the privilege and argued that it would make no greater sense for kaplan to have told burstein,his attorney,falsely,that he had committed a crime than it would for persons practicing catholicism,seeking forgiveness through the intermediary between themselves and their god,to admit something they did do.id.caracappa seeks a new trial on the ground that this constituted vouching for burstein credibility by using burstein testimony to bolster kaplan credibility through an appeal to religious faith.caracappa brief on appeal at emphasis omitted.
a defendant bears a substantial burden in arguing for reversal on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct in the summation.see,united states young,united states millar,cir.in determining whether an inappropriate remark amounts to prejudicial error,we look to the severity of the misconduct,the measures adopted to cure the misconduct,and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct.united states spinelli,cir,cert.denied.flaws in the government summation will require a new trial only in the rare case in which improper against the entire argument to the be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair trial.see united states forlorma,cir united states millar,at united states rodriguez,cir,cert.denied.
further,in the absence of an objection at trial,a claim of improper vouching is reviewable only for plain error.see,united states rodriguez,cir.b.under the standard set by united states olano,for applying rule b,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,quoting olano,at.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at quoting olano,at which was quoting united states young,at other internal quotation marks omitted.
in the present case,although caracappa counsel and eppolito counsel,respectively,objected to other aspects of the government rebuttal summation,neither of them objected to the statements described above or sought any cautionary instruction to the jury,and we can not see that any of these statements warrants a new trial.the ausa statement that the jury could trust burstein percent based on the circumstances of the case and based on the circumstances of what kaplan told him does not constitute vouching it is merely an argument that the evidence indicates that burstein testimony was completely truthful and accurate.nor can we agree with caracappa contention that the analogy drawn between the privilege and the privilege was in any sense an appeal to religion rather,it was plainly an argument that,in seeking aid from an advisor,it makes no sense to claim guilt falsely.the statement that burstein should be believed because he is an officer of the court may have been improper either as a suggestion that burstein should be viewed as something other than a witness for the prosecution or as a suggestion that attorneys always tell the truth but that isolated statement,even if improper,clearly did not affect defendants substantial rights.accordingly,the test has not been met.
caracappa other contentions 
caracappa also contends that the government of one of his witnesses was improper,that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the narcotics counts,and that his sentence on those counts is unreasonable.these contentions do not warrant extended discussion.
the witness shanahan 
caracappa called as a defense witness his former nypd partner detective leslie shanahan to testify to their official duties stretching into the day lino was shot and killed,apparently to permit the jury to infer that caracappa,who had gone off duty at approximately that morning in manhattan,could not have been one of the men who shot and killed lino in brooklyn at approximately that evening.on,the government asked shanahan numerous questions as to police procedures,his knowledge of caracappa personal life,and various driving times and distances.caracappa complains that no effort was made to confine the examination to the form appropriate for a direct examination.caracappa brief on appeal at.
while the of shanahan was somewhat more than the direct examination,the trial court is accorded broad discretion in controlling the scope and extent of.united states wilkerson,cir.quoting united states fabian,cir,cert.denied.although c should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.b,t he court may,in the exercise of discretion,permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination,id.it is,of course,unrealistic to expect that direct examination and will be perfectly congruent the latter need only be reasonably related to the former,and matching the two requires the district court to make a series of judgment calls.macaulay anas,cir.most of the questioning on was reasonably related to the questions put to shanahan on direct,and we can not conclude that the leeway granted by the trial court overall was an abuse of discretion.
sufficiency of the evidence on the narcotics counts 
caracappa contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for the jury to find him guilty of distributing and conspiring to distribute a controlled substance in violation of u.a and.a defendant who makes such a challenge bears a heavy burden,since he must show that no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,united states schwarz,cir see,united states payne,cir,petition for cert.filed,april,and since,in determining whether he has made that showing,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all permissible inferences in the government favor and deferring to the jury assessments of the witnesses credibility,see,united states sabhnani,cir united states parkes,cir,cert.denied.
the government evidence on the narcotics counts was presented principally through the testimony of corso and was described in eppolito ii as follows 
corso testified that at a dinner with eppolito and caracappa in,he told them he was expecting a visit from four hollywood clients,each of whom was interested in investing in eppolito film project,and that his clients wanted to purchase designer drugs tr,specifically ecstasy and crystal methamphetamine.corso testified that eppolito responded that tony,his son,could handle it both eppolito and caracappa said that guido bravatti,a young associate of caracappa,could handle it.later that night,eppolito called corso to give him bravatti telephone number.
on the following evening,corso had dinner with tony and bravatti.corso told them that his clients wanted an ounce of crystal methamphetamine and six to eight ecstasy pills bravatti said there would be no problem.tony and bravatti indicated that they wanted to do all they could to facilitate investments by corso clients in eppolito film project.
the next day,tony and bravatti made a partial delivery at corso office,saying that they had had some difficulty in obtaining what corso requested.they handed him an envelope containing somewhat less than the requested ounce of crystal methamphetamine,and corso paid them proportionately.the parties stipulated at trial that that envelope had contained grams of methamphetamine.
at emphases added.this evidence was ample to permit the jury to find caracappa guilty of conspiring to distribute,and distributing,a controlled substance.
the prison terms imposed for the narcotics counts 
for caracappa convictions of conspiring to distribute and distributing narcotics in violation of and a,respectively,the district court sentenced caracappa to,inter alia,consecutive prison terms of years on each count,the maximum authorized by b b.caracappa contends that the total,years imprisonment,is excessive and represents cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the constitution.although these sentences are severe,on the record in the present case we find no basis for disturbing them.
in the aftermath of united states booker,we review sentences for reasonableness,a deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a challenged sentence is inside,just outside,or significantly outside the guidelines range.united states jass,cir quoting united states jones,f d,cir other internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.further,t he eighth amendment forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime,and in a noncapital case,it is exceedingly rare to uphold a claim that a sentence within the statutory limits is disproportionately severe.united states yousef,cir quoting rummel estelle,other internal quotation marks omitted emphasis ours see also united states olson,cir in felony convictions,a particular sentence that falls within legislatively prescribed limits will not be considered disproportionate unless the sentencing court abused its discretion.united states organek,cir a sentence within the statutory maximum set by statute generally does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment internal quotation marks omitted.
in the present case,the district court explained the severe sentences imposed on caracappa and eppolito as follows 
for many years,these two defendants,while members of the new york city police force,were employed by the mafia to murder,to reveal fbi and police files to criminals,to conduct surveillances as directed by mafia bosses,and to undertake other duties on behalf of mobsters.they were paid substantial retainers,with added amounts for the commission of specific criminal acts,including murders,collecting large sums of money over many years.
sentences are now imposed pursuant to the united states sentencing guidelines,relevant case law,and applicable statutes.see a united states eppolito,cir,cert.denied.
the critical elements of the applicable statute in this case are general deterrence to discourage similar acts by others,and just punishment.see a a b.on june,the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant pursuant to a were described as follows by the court 
it is hard to visualize any more heinous offenses a heavy sentence is required to promote respect for the law,to provide just punishment for the offenses and to deter like conduct by any person who might be in the position of these defendants.it is necessary to deter their own criminal conduct as revealed by the circumstances of the events as late as and when,as the court of appeals has now found,they continued to conspire to commit crimes with criminal mobsters.
it is necessary under the statute to protect the public from further crimes of these defendants.a sentence would not be appropriate.
hr g tr,june.
in addition to committing cruel murders and engaging in a dangerous racketeering conspiracy in violation of section d of title of the united states code rico,these two defendants have committed what amounts to treason against the people of the city of new york and their fellow police officers.
they are sentenced to the maximum sentence of imprisonment and to the maximum fine for each crime of which they have been convicted,imposed consecutively.
judgment dated march,at alterations in original emphasis added.
although caracappa contends that the district court explanation of its reasons for the sentence,quoted in part in the judgment,was inadequate to support the sentence imposed,he voiced no such objection in the district court.thus,his present objection is reviewable only for plain error.see,united states villafuerte,cir.we see no such error,and no prejudicial effect on caracappa substantial rights.
while caracappa argues that the transaction reflected in the record was a small one and that there is no reason to believe that caracappa had solicited,wanted or even anticipated that steven sic corso would propose a drug transaction as a condition precedent for what was represented to be a legal negotiation coming to fruition caracappa brief on appeal at,the evidence as to that transaction,quoted in part above,reveals that caracappa unhesitatingly agreed to have his associate supply drugs as requested by corso.further,as the district court noted,the activities of caracappa and eppolito in las vegas were a continuation of their business of providing illicit services.as noted in eppolito ii,
t he jury was entitled to view the offers of eppolito and caracappa to provide assistance to members and associates of organized crime as general and and thus as encompassing defendants conduct in las vegas,which included eppolito offers and attempts to launder the proceeds of narcotics trafficking and other organized crime activities,and eppolito and caracappa involvement in narcotics trafficking in order to induce investors to give them money for a film in whose funding members of organized crime were integrally involved.
at.it was within the discretion of the district court to view caracappa narcotics trafficking as an integral part of his and eppolito criminal activity,rather than in isolation,and to impose the maximum punishment authorized by law.
iii.eppolito 
eppolito,on this appeal,contends principally that he did not receive constitutionally effective assistance of counsel.he argues that his attorney bruce cutler did not communicate with him adequately failed to investigate,call favorable witnesses,or introduce and mars
