arturo castellanos conditionally pled guilty in the middle district of north carolina to conspiracy to distribute cocaine.his sole challenge on appeal is to the district court denial of his motion to suppress the cocaine,which had been found in the gas tank of a ford explorer as the vehicle was being transported on a commercial car carrier.we agree with the government that castellanos failed to prove he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on september,captain kevin roberts of the reeves county,texas,sheriff department,was conducting a routine patrol at a truck stop near pecos,texas.he observed a direct auto shippers das commercial car carrier at a fuel filling station,and became suspicious that one of the vehicles being transported on the car carrier,a ford explorer the explorer,bore a dealership placard in lieu of a regular license plate.
upon questioning the driver of the car carrier about the explorer,roberts was provided shipping documents identifying the owner of the vehicle as wilmer castenada.the documents also reflected a trip origin in california with a final destination for delivery of the vehicle in greensboro,north carolina.roberts attempted to contact castenada using the phone number provided to das,but received no answer.he then attempted to verify the origin and destination addresses provided to das,but the california address was not associated with anyone bearing castenada name,and the north carolina address matched two unrelated businesses.when roberts contacted those businesses,their representatives each stated they had never heard of castenada and were not expecting delivery of a vehicle.
unable to contact castenada,roberts asked the driver of the das car carrier for permission to search the explorer.the driver consented,and roberts opened the explorer and began to search the interior of the vehicle.he immediately noticed grass and stuff in the utility area,which,in his view was inconsistent with the explorer coming from a dealership.he also noticed the strong odor of bondo,a compound commonly used in the repair and alteration of vehicles.roberts observed fresh tool marks where the rear seats were anchored to the floor,indicating those had recently been removed or installed.when he pounded on the rear floorboard,roberts noticed an inconsistency in the sound on the passenger side above the gas tank.
roberts then inserted a fiber optic scope into the explorer gas tank in order to peer into its interior.when he did so,roberts observed several blue bags floating in the tank.he then asked the car carrier driver if he roberts could take custody of the explorer.the driver consented and roberts,with other officers,took possession of the explorer and transported it to another location for further examination.when roberts and other officers examined the explorer in more detail,they found that the gas tank had been opened and resealed with bondo,and recovered bricks of cocaine with a street value of approximately million.
subsequently,das informed roberts that someone claiming to be castenada had been calling das to inquire about the delivery of the explorer.using new contact information for castenada received from das,roberts called the telephone number claiming to be an employee of a wrecker service in texas.roberts falsely informed the individual claiming to be castenada that the driver of the das carrier had been arrested and his cargo impounded so that castenada would be required to travel to texas in order to claim the explorer.a few days later roberts learned that someone,later identified as arturo castellanos,had arrived locally and was waiting for a ride to the wrecker service to claim the explorer.
police located and detained castellanos,who had in his possession the title to the explorer,the das tracking number for that vehicle,and a piece of paper bearing roberts phone number from the earlier calls.castellanos waived his rights,and told roberts that he was in the process of purchasing the explorer from castenada,who lived in north carolina.he then explained that castenada advised him to go from castellanos home in california to texas to retrieve the explorer,then drive it to castenada in north carolina where castellanos would pay castenada for the vehicle.castellanos would then drive the explorer back to california.after roberts expressed considerable skepticism at his story,castellanos terminated the interview.
police also seized two duffle bags that a not party to this appeal left at a local motel front desk.castellanos,who claimed to be traveling alone,denied that either of the bags belonged to him.when roberts opened one of the bags,he found,in addition to other items,a contoured neck pillow.feeling a foreign object inside the pillow,roberts opened it and discovered a cellular telephone in a plastic bag.when roberts turned the phone on,he found that the number of the telephone matched the number provided by das that he had been using to contact castenada.
castellanos and other individuals not party to this appeal were later indicted in the middle district of north carolina on one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine hydrochloride,in violation of,a,and b a.
prior to trial,castellanos moved to suppress the items contained in the duffle bag and the cocaine found in the gas tank.the government evidence adduced at the suppression hearing consisted entirely of testimony from roberts,who detailed the search and seizure of the vehicle and the subsequent investigation that lead to the arrest of castellanos.
notably,castellanos did not introduce any evidence to show that he owned the explorer at the time roberts conducted the warrantless search or had permission to use the vehicle.although castellanos appeared in texas with a title document to the explorer,he did not put the title into evidence or otherwise attempt to demonstrate any ownership or possessory interest in the vehicle.castellanos statements,as relayed by roberts,made clear that castellanos himself maintained that castenada was a different person,insofar as he claimed the purchase of the explorer from castenada was an incomplete transaction.castellanos made no showing that he and castenada were one and the same person or that castenada was his alias.
after hearing argument,the district court issued a short ruling from the bench.the court stated that 
i going to deny castellanos motion as to both the duffle bags,and with regard to the automobile,which had been given over to a common carrier with addresses which were ascertained to be false addresses.there was no legitimate expectation of privacy at that point.the shipper address was false.the person who was to receive it was a false address.
the court did not make any findings of fact.
prior to trial,castellanos entered into a conditional plea agreement with the government and pled guilty to the sole count of the indictment,conspiracy to distribute cocaine hydrochloride.pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure,castellanos reserved the right to appeal the district court adverse decision on his motion to suppress.castellanos was sentenced to months imprisonment and noted a timely appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the sole assignment of error raised by castellanos on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence of the cocaine discovered in the gas tank of the explorer the government rejoins,however,that as a threshold matter,castellanos can not challenge the search because he failed to show a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle gas tank.if the government is correct,that issue is dispositive on appeal so we address it first.
we review de novo the district court legal conclusions on a motion to suppress.see united states cardwell,cir.normally,we would review the district court factual findings in the suppression context for clear error.see id.here,however,the court made no findings of fact.it is,of course,the better practice for the district court to make such findings,but where the district court fails to do so,we assume the district court construed the evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevails on the suppression motion below,in this case,the government.
the fourth amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.a government agent search is unreasonable when it infringes on an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.united states jacobsen,d.in order to demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy,castellanos must have a subjective expectation of privacy,united states bynum,cir,and that subjective expectation of privacy must be objectively reasonable in other words,it must be an expectation that society is willing to recognize as reasonable,united states bullard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the burden of showing a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched rests with the defendant.rawlings kentucky,d.
the government argues that castellanos lacked any expectation of privacy in the explorer because the record failed to establish that he actually owned the vehicle or established any legitimate possessory interest in it.in the absence of such evidence,the government argues,castellanos is essentially seeking the protection of the fourth amendment vicariously and such a status is inadequate upon which to raise a fourth amendment claim 
the fourth amendment protects people,not places.katz united states,d.accordingly,fourth amendment rights may not be vicariously asserted.united states rumley,cir quoting rakas illinois,d.a person who is aggrieved by an illegal search and seizure only through the introduction of damaging evidence secured by a search of a third person premises or property has not had any of his fourth amendment rights infringed.rakas,at citing alderman united states,d.conversely,suppression of the product of a fourth amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were violated by the search itself,not by those who are aggrieved solely by the introduction of damaging evidence.alderman,at.the capacity to claim the protection of the fourth amendment depends upon whether the person who claims the protection has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place.rakas,at.
for the reasons explained herein,we agree with the government and hold that castellanos has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that,at the time of the search,the evidence showed that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the explorer 
when attempting to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in property that is held by another,we consider such factors as whether that person claims an ownership or possessory interest in the property,and whether he has established a right or taken precautions to exclude others from the property.united states rusher,cir.here,castellanos asserted to roberts that he was purchasing the explorer,but his claim is not substantiated in any way by the record.castellanos did not enter the title of the explorer into evidence,nor did he establish that he purchased the vehicle with a bill of sale,division of motor vehicles registration,or anything else.and there is no evidence that,if he purchased the explorer at all,he did so prior to the search.
parties other than owners may possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of a vehicle.see,united states jones,d observing that although the defendant was not the registered owner of the searched vehicle,he was the exclusive driver and the court thus did not consider the fourth amendment significance of jones status.however,castellanos offered no evidence that he had any such interest,though he bore the burden of proof.for example,castellanos presented no evidence that castenada or anyone else had granted him permission to use the vehicle or act as his agent with das,or any other right of any kind to the vehicle.this is not a case,like jones,where the defendant has established an ownership,or even a possessory interest in the vehicle.id.describing jones rights as similar to those of a bailee.accordingly,this is not the type of case where a defendant has established such a close connection to the vehicle that is subject to search that he may claim a possessory interest in it.
furthermore,although i ndividuals may assert a reasonable expectation of privacy in packages addressed to them under fictitious names,united states villarreal,cir,we note that castellanos adduced no evidence at the suppression hearing demonstrating that the name wilmer castenada was simply an alias.instead,castellanos position was that he and castenada were two separate individuals engaged in a sale transaction as testified by roberts.indeed,castellanos represented to the trial court that there is no factual dispute here questioning the facts as rendered by detective roberts.in the absence of evidence that castenada was castellanos alter ego or a fictitious name,this case is more closely aligned with united states givens,cir per curiam,a case in which we held that a defendant lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in a package that was addressed to a third party.
in sum,the evidence heard by the district court at the suppression hearing failed to support a conclusion that castellanos had anything more than a distantly attenuated connection to the explorer.castellanos bore the burden to show that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy,and he has not done so having failed to carry his burden,castellanos can not challenge the warrantless search of the explorer.
finally,our good colleague in dissent makes a few points that we feel warrant a response.first,the dissent contends we focus our attention on how the facts appeared to captain roberts at the time of the search,post at,thus misapplying the proper standard for determining whether castellanos had a subjective expectation of privacy that is objectively reasonable.to the contrary,our analysis focuses on the facts in the record,rather than the facts as they may have appeared to captain roberts.the evidence in the record,of course,is based in large part on roberts testimony,which was not supplemented or controverted by any proffer from castellanos.the explorer title,highly relevant to the question of whether castellanos owned or had a sufficiently close connection to the explorer,was never entered into evidence.nor was there any evidence,other than his claim that,at some point he purchased the vehicle from castenada,that castellanos had an interest in the explorer at the time it was searched.
in addition,the dissent argues that certain facts,known to the government and presented to the district court,establish that wilmer castenada was in fact merely an alias of castellanos.specifically,the dissent posits that although the address listed on the bill of lading was not associated with castellanos personally,it was near a towing company where the explorer may have been destined roberts testimony was equivocal on that point,and that someone,who may have been castellanos,had inquired within about the whereabouts of the explorer.
we first observe that the theory upon which the dissent bases its conclusion appears for the first time in the dissenting opinion.castellanos opening brief on appeal is bereft of any analysis of the standing question,and despite the government argument on brief that he lacked standing,castellanos filed no brief in reply we therefore question the extent to which castellanos can be the beneficiary of an argument he has never made.
even granting castellanos the benefit of the doubt,and assuming that the explorer was in fact destined for the montlieu avenue towing company in greensboro,and that castellanos did in fact inquire therein about the explorer whereabouts,castellanos is no closer to establishing that he has a sufficient connection to the explorer to establish standing.instead,the evidence shows at best that castellanos asked about the explorer at the place where it was to be delivered.it does not establish either that castellanos was castenada,or that,contrary to the bill of lading,castellanos was the intended recipient.in sum,nothing in the dissent alters our conclusion that castellanos interest in the explorer is too attenuated to demonstrate that any expectation of privacy he may have had in the explorer gas tank was reasonable.
for all of the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
we are all familiar with the old legal saw 
when the facts are against you,hammer the law.when the law is against you,hammer the facts.when both are against you,hammer the table and yell like hell.
in re fischer.
the facts and the law can not be ignored in this appeal.nor can the pounding they take from the majority denude them of the power they possess.
the record before the district court established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that wilmer castenada was the alias of appellant,who had a possessory interest in,and an undisputed right to exercise dominion and control over,the ford explorer.thus,contrary to the holding reached by the majority abbreviated analysis,the proper result on the record before us is that the district court erred,procedurally and substantively,factually and legally,in reaching its conclusion that appellant failed to establish an objectively reasonable,a legitimate,expectation of sufficient to maintain his fourth amendment challenge to the warrantless,nonconsensual search of the vehicle.
first,the district court never called on appellant before or during the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress to prove his standing to challenge the search of the explorer.see infra.it did not do so,most likely,because the facts known to the government and the facts before the district court,prior to the suppression hearing,demonstrated that appellant had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle.rather than call on appellant at the outset to offer evidence of his standing evidence that was already in the record,the district court proceeded directly to the merits of the suppression hearing by requiring the government to put on evidence.see id.
second,like the district court,the government never called on appellant to prove his standing to challenge the search of the explorer.it did not do so because the prosecuting assistant united states attorney knew full well that appellant,as a member of the narcotics conspiracy charged with seeing to the delivery from california to north carolina of the cocaine hidden in the gas tank of the explorer,had standing to challenge the search of the vehicle.indeed,the record raises a serious question as to whether the prosecutor affirmatively misled the district court,through her selective presentation and advocacy of certain evidentiary facts,into making its erroneous determination of the legitimacy of appellant expectation of privacy.see infra.
third,as a matter of law,the government and the district court misapprehended the nature and the character of the evidence necessary for appellant to establish his standing to challenge the search of the ford explorer.as an initial matter,the court and the government erroneously believed that standing could only be established by evidence formally introduced by appellant.that is not and has never been the law.see infra part.furthermore,by obsessively and narrowly focusing on the state of mind of the law enforcement officer who conducted the challenged search,the government and the district court erroneously failed to apply the appropriate fourth amendment test for standing,a test that hinges on objective reality at the time of the search,not on a law enforcement officer subjective belief about the state of facts surrounding search and seizure issues.see infra part.viewed as it must be,in this and any case,from an objective perspective as of the time of the search,the issue of standing is easily and correctly resolved in favor of appellant.
fourth and finally,the district court finding and conclusion that appellant use of a common carrier to ship narcotics hidden in a constitutionally protected effect,the gas tank of an automobile,coupled with the use of an alias,delegitimizes his expectation of privacy,constitutes clear factual error and manifest legal error.see infra parts d.the evidence in this record shows that the district court committed clear error in finding that t he shipper address was false whatever that means and that t he person who was to receive the ford explorer was a false address sic.see infra part.indeed,directly contrary to the district court finding,the government effectively proved that its sole suppression hearing witness had erroneously concluded that the intended destination of the ford explorer was an address other than that identified on the bill of lading.
at bottom,as a matter of law,appellant did not relinquish,and society is not prepared to extinguish,the objective reasonableness of his undisputed subjective expectation of privacy simply because he used an alias to conceal his involvement in a narcotics trafficking conspiracy 
respectfully,and for all of the reasons set forth herein,i dissent.
the majority opinion erroneously regards the relevant narrative of this case to commence on september,when captain kevin roberts,of the reeves county,texas,sheriff department,happened upon million in cocaine hidden in the gas tank of a ford explorer he searched without a warrant and without valid consent.rather,as the government advised the district court in its written opposition to the motion to suppress,the story begins sometime in.as the government explained to the district court 
during in or about,the greensboro resident office of the drug enforcement administration gro dea initiated an investigation into the suspected drug trafficking activity of juan manuel lopez.the investigation continued into,and in august,dea agents obtained court authorization to install a global positioning satellite gps tracking device on a burgundy chevrolet silverado pickup truck utilized by juan manuel lopez.
at footnote omitted thus,the government had been investigating the greensboro narcotics trafficking operation of which appellant was a part for more than a year prior to the serendipitous intervention of captain roberts in texas on september.indeed,as set forth above,for approximately a month prior to the events in texas,the united states had been able to surveil one of the greensboro,north carolina,participants in the conspiracy through the use of gps tracking technology.through the use of that technology and other undisclosed investigative activity,the lead investigator,agent razik,came to anticipate the arrival of the ford explorer in greensboro,and learned that appellant,arturo castellanos,was using the alias wilmer castenada in his management,on behalf of the conspiracy,of the shipping and delivery of the ford explorer from california to north carolina.in short,by the time of captain roberts search of the ford explorer,the united states had at least one of the participants in the drug conspiracy charged in this case,of which appellant was a part,well in its sights.
the government proffer of evidence to the district court in its opposition to the motion to suppress continued as follows 
on september,agents monitoring the gps tracker followed lopez vehicle first to the intersection of montlieu avenue and market street in greensboro,north carolina.approximately minutes later,he traveled to a restaurant near high point road and meritt drive in greensboro.surveillance agents saw lopez leave the restaurant with two other men,later identified as auturo castellanos and raul hernandez.the three traveled together in lopez vehicle to four seasons mall in greensboro.surveillance footage from the mall was obtained by dea agents.
because he was familiar with a business located in the montlieu avenue and market street area of greensboro that receives shipped vehicles from das auto shippers,special agent razik contacted the business and asked if anyone had been in on that day inquiring about a vehicle.the agent was advised that a hispanic man had just been in making inquiry about a ford explorer.agent razik was advised that the same man had been in several times since september,asking about the vehicle.the man left telephone number as a contact number.
on september,the montlieu avenue business notified agent razik that the same hispanic man had called again about the ford explorer and the man identified himself as wilmer.the man stated he was going to contact das directly.das auto notified dea later on september,that the ford explorer was seized in texas on september.
on september,an employee at the montlieu avenue business notified agent razik that the hispanic man had again come to the business inquiring about the ford explorer.the employee advised that the man had presented a tracking number and a copy of the title for the explorer.agent razik went to the business and obtained a copy of the vehicle title.he also showed the two employees who spoke with the hispanic man a photograph that was taken from the video footage at four seasons mall on september.both employees identified defendant auturo castellanos as the man who had been to the business between september and september,inquiring about the ford explorer.
at emphases added.
thus,at the time of the suppression hearing in this case,on july,the government knew full well that appellant had appeared in greensboro,north carolina,at the actual montlieu avenue address where the ford explorer was to be received by appellant,who at all times was using his alias,wilmer,and who was using a phone assigned the number.in short,the government knew at the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress that appellant was wilmer castenada.the government also knew that during the period between september and,appellant was in greensboro,north carolina,not in california.and,the government knew that appellant was a member of a conspiracy that had been under investigation for narcotics trafficking,with a california source,for approximately one year.
as the majority opinion recites,the disputed search of the ford explorer on september,transpired in parallel with the above described events in greensboro.captain roberts became suspicious while at a local truck stop when he came upon a commercial car carrier which,on the top rack of the trailer,was loaded with an older model ford explorer that was being transported from california to greensboro,north carolina.this was the vehicle that appellant and his associates had been awaiting in greensboro,and which appellant regularly inquired about at the montlieu avenue address in greensboro beginning no later than september.roberts examined the shipping documents for the ford explorer wilmer castenada,appellant alias,was listed as both the shipper and recipient.regardless of whether appellant or some other member of the conspiracy was the actual shipper in the sense that he had been in california when the ford explorer had been loaded onto the das trailer he was,unmistakably,the recipient in greensboro.
roberts attempted to contact appellant at the phone number listed on the shipping documents,but there was no answer.roberts then determined from an unspecified database that appellant had no apparent connection to the california address.roberts also determined apparently using law enforcement or commercial databases not identified in the record that two unidentified businesses could be associated with an address on montlieu avenue in greensboro,north carolina,where the ford explorer was to be delivered to wilmer castenada.but when he called those businesses,no one at either was familiar with the name wilmer castenada,and no one to whom roberts spoke could confirm the anticipated delivery of a ford explorer it was upon these facts and,apparently,these facts alone that the district court erroneously concluded that appellant had lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy at the point the ford explorer had been given over to a common carrier with addresses which were ascertained to be false addresses.
of course,as set forth above,and as the government well knew at the time of the suppression hearing even though roberts did not know it at the time he searched the vehicle on september,roberts was seriously mistaken in his attempt to investigate the destination of the explorer.as the government response to the motion to suppress made clear,a business located in the montlieu avenue and market street area of greensboro receive d shipped vehicles from das auto shippers,and a hispanic man had visited the business several times since september,asking about a ford explorer.
captain roberts,having been stymied in his efforts to allay or confirm his suspicions regarding the explorer,decided to roll the constitutional dice and worry about the consequences later that is,he proceeded to search the vehicle without probable cause to believe it contained contraband or evidence of a crime without a warrant and without the consent of any person with actual or apparent authority to consent to the search upon searching the vehicle,he discovered the following evidence of consequence in this case the heavy odor of bondo,which is used for vehicle repairs and the construction of aftermarket compartments evidence that the vehicle seats had been removed and the gas tank accessed and,ultimately,using his fiber optic scope,more than twenty bricks of cocaine,valued by roberts at million dollars,wrapped in plastic floating in the gas tank.
one week after roberts had searched and seized the vehicle,on or about september,after putting in place a ruse with the assistance of das,the vehicle transport company,roberts finally had contact with appellant,calling from the number and identifying himself by his alias,wilmer castenada in a phone conversation on that day,roberts advised appellant that he would have to arrange to retrieve the vehicle from texas.appellant agreed to do so and arrived in texas sometime on or about october,when he and one of his coconspirators were arrested.appellant was in possession of the title document to the explorer and tracking information from das,and a cell phone using the same number he had used to communicate with roberts over the preceding several days 
meanwhile,back in greensboro,agent razik had successfully uncovered the story of the undelivered ford explorer,when he returned to the towing business on montlieu avenue in greensboro and learned that appellant had been the man inquiring about the ford explorer between september and september.in fact,according to roberts hearing testimony,agent razik had telephoned roberts on or about september,and the two conferred regarding what was now their joint investigation of the north drug conspiracy 
on the,i believe it was,of september,i spoke with agent razik he was aware of the ford explorer.matter of fact,he was waiting for the ford explorer to arrive in north carolina.the vehicle never showed up.through his investigation,he was able to come to the conclusion that it had been apprehended and seized in texas and that where he got my name and phone number and contacted me.
id.at.the government response to the motion to suppress further elaborated on the cooperation between the two law enforcement officers 
on september,agent razik spoke with captain kevin roberts who confirmed that the vehicle had been seized from the das car carrier after kilograms of cocaine were found in the gas tank.captain roberts advised agent razik that the vehicle bill of lading stated the vehicle was being shipped from gardenia,california,to wilmer castaneda in greensboro,north carolina.the telephone number listed for castaneda on the bill of lading was.
the sum and substance of the only rational version of the interstate narrative shown by this record,as of the time roberts conducted his warrantless and nonconsensual search of the ford explorer on september,is that appellant job as a coconspirator in the charged conspiracy was to exercise joint possession,dominion,and control over the ford explorer and see to its safe delivery to himself,in the person of his alias,wilmer castenada,at montlieu avenue,greensboro,north carolina 
on february,a federal grand jury in the middle district of north carolina indicted castellanos and others for conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine hydrochloride,in violation of and.on april,he pled not guilty.
on june,c
