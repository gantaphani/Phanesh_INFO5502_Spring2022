background 
leng,a native and citizen of the people republic of china prc,entered the united states in april on a visa.on january,leng applied for asylum and withholding of removal based on his political opinions.specifically,he claimed that he had become involved in the china democratic party while in the united states,his wife and child,who had remained in the prc,had been harassed by authorities of the prc based on his actual and perceived political beliefs,and due to his political activities,he feared harm or mistreatment if returned to the prc.
leng,through counsel,conceded his removability at a hearing held on april.at a hearing held on january,leng presented the ij with evidence in support of his claims.the documentary evidence leng submitted included a supplementary affidavit from leng stating that he did not apply for asylum until because a his claim was based on political activities he had undertaken in the united states from late onwards and b he underwent major surgery in august a country conditions report issued by the department of state copies of leng various postings to the china democracy party website photographs documenting leng participation in political rallies a statement,dated january,from the executive chairman of the china democratic party organization development center,declaring leng the executive official of the china democratic party,wuhan committee,hubei province,see joint app.leng other evidence consisted of his own testimony and the testimony of xie wan jing,a purported cdp official.
leng testified that he joined the cdp in,following an episode in april of that year where authorities of the become aware of his collaboration with xie on an art arrested his wife and interrogated her about his involvement with a reactionary organization.id.at.according to leng,he was a secret party member until october,still residing in the united formally joined the cdp by publishing an article on the party website.id.at.leng stated that he later learned that his wife had been arrested and detained again in the prc after this episode.finally,leng described his participation in various protests in the united states from january onwards.on the basis of these events,leng stated that he was sure that authorities of the prc knew about his political activities and would arrest and persecute him if he returned to the prc.id.at.leng did acknowledge,however,his claimed fear of had gone to the prc consulate in new york,in may,to renew his prc passport.in response to questions about the discrepancy between the date he claimed to have joined the cdp and the date given on his cdp membership document,leng explained that the document was dated january because it had to be reissued following structural changes within the cdp.leng also explained that the cdp expected him to recruit members from hubei province in the united states until such time as the chinese government recognized and accepted the cdp.id.at.
xie,who identified himself as the chairman of the chinese democratic party,testified that leng had asked to join the cdp in but was not invited to be a member until.he further testified that the cdp was the number one,opposing target of the prc,and that,given the chance,authorities of the prc would jail leng because leng was a very active member of the cdp.id.at.xie also,however,testified that the government of the prc did not know the identity of most cdp members.
the ij noted that leng and xie disagreed about when leng became a member of the cdp,and that leng documentation of his participation in the cdp was contemporaneous with his application for asylum,clearly indicating that leng appears to have manufactured his political activity in order to suit his asylum claim.id.the ij also noted that leng claim that the chinese government is aware of his membership and his activities appeared to be in conflict with leng testimony under oath,that on two occasions he applied for the renewal of his chinese passport,first in and again in with the chinese government here in new york city.id.at.as the ij observed,whether leng applied for the passports he first did not go himself to apply for these documents,as he later claimed,
the bottom line is this petitioner who claims that he is known as a subversive and dissident in the people republic of china was comfortable enough to approach this government on two different occasions to renew his passport,even though he did not have a pressing need to do so,and was not planning allegedly to travel to the people republic of china.
on this basis,the ij found that leng was not credible or plausible,id,that his testimony was not sufficiently detailed,believable,and consistent to adequate ly support his claim s,id.at,and that leng had clearly failed to make a showing that he will be subjected to future persecution if forced to return to the people republic of china,id.at.the ij also determined that leng august surgery did not fully justify his failure to apply for asylum until.accordingly,the ij concluded that leng had failed to establish that he qualified for an exception to the filing deadline for asylum set forth in or was otherwise eligible for relief.
the bia adopted and affirmed the decision of the ij.as an initial matter,the bia determined that the ij adverse credibility finding was supported by the evidence of record.id.at.the bia also determined that,even assuming the veracity of leng testimony,leng had failed to explain adequately why he did not file his asylum application until january years after the alleged arrest of his wife and his alleged decision to join the cdp.finally,the bia agree d with the immigration judge alternative finding that,even if the asylum application had been timely filed,it must be denied for lack of evidence of past persecution or a fear of future persecution.id.
