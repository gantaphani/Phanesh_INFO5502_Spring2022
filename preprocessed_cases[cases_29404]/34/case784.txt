after two successive traffic stops in vermont and massachusetts,defendant appellant michael foreste was found to be in possession of oxycodone,a controlled substance.he entered a conditional guilty plea,but preserved his right to challenge the district court denial of his motion to suppress.on appeal he argues that the duration of the two successive traffic stops was unreasonably intrusive in violation of the fourth amendment,and that the district court erred in denying his discovery request for the field performance records of the narcotics canine whose alert provided the probable cause for his arrest.
for the reasons below,the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and vacated and remanded in part for discovery of the narcotics canine field performance records.
on april,defendant michael foreste was traveling from new york city to vermont in a rental car driven by telly cesar.as the two were traveling north on interstate,massachusetts state trooper rachel loiselle pulled the vehicle over for speeding at in hatfield.
trooper loiselle testified that when she approached the vehicle and began speaking with cesar and foreste,she quickly became suspicious.cesar mumbled his response to loiselle request for his license and registration when she asked cesar to repeat himself,foreste answered and,without being asked,foreste proceeded to explain the details of their trip to vermont.foreste also gave trooper loiselle a rental agreement for the car that she testified was expired by quite some time,perhaps as much as a month.supplemental app.
trooper loiselle returned to her police cruiser to review the paperwork and,suspecting that the two might be involved in criminal behavior,contacted sergeant eric albright of the vermont state police.loiselle thought sergeant albright might have additional information on cesar or foreste because foreste is a vermont resident and the rental car was registered in his name.albright told loiselle that he did not know anything about cesar or foreste,but said that he would call some of his contacts and try to find out more.
trooper loiselle also called her dispatch officer.she was concerned that the vehicle might have been stolen and asked her dispatch officer to contact the rental car company about the expired rental agreement.loiselle then returned to the stopped vehicle to explain that there would be a delay because of the expired rental agreement.at that point foreste handed loiselle a second rental agreement,also expired,but which had expired more recently than the first.
within a few minutes,the rental car company confirmed that there was no problem with the expired rental agreement as long as the vehicle was ultimately returned.the driver,cesar,was issued a ticket for speeding,and trooper loiselle released the car at approximately.the stop lasted a total of minutes.
after the vehicle departed,sergeant albright returned trooper loiselle call.albright had contacted detective dan merchand of the burlington police department and learned that,according to detective merchand confidential informant,foreste was a known cocaine and oxycodone dealer who transported large quantities of drugs from new york city to the burlington area in rental vehicles.
sergeant albright decided to drive from the brattleboro barracks to i,near guilford,hoping to encounter cesar and foreste as they continued north into vermont.given the information he had obtained about foreste suspected drug trafficking,albright decided to try and find a motor vehicle violation if at all possible,supplemental app,in order to justify a stop of the vehicle.at the same time,albright called special agent thomas doud of the drug enforcement administration.albright had learned from detective merchand that special agent doud was investigating foreste in conjunction with merchand,and albright hoped that doud might have additional information on foreste or cesar.albright,however,was unable to reach doud and so left him a voice mail.albright also called inspector mark heberts from the vermont department of motor vehicles.inspector heberts is a canine handler who works with a canine named duchess corrie.albright asked heberts to start driving in albright direction so that he would be available in the event albright needed a dog.when albright spoke with him,heberts was in londonderry,vermont,about an hour away from albright location.
at approximately,sergeant albright located foreste rental car at the welcome center in guilford,vermont.albright saw the vehicle roll through a stop sign while exiting the parking lot and also observed an item hanging from the rearview mirror both violations of vermont motor vehicle laws.at approximately,albright stopped foreste car on i northbound after following the vehicle for one to two miles.
sergeant albright approached the vehicle and spoke with cesar and foreste.albright requested cesar driver license and noticed that cesar mumbled when he spoke and was somewhat difficult to hear.albright also observed what he believed to be marijuana chafe on cesar pants.he ordered cesar to get out of the car to further investigate whether or not he was in possession of narcotics under the influence and operating the vehicle as such at that point.supplemental app.albright then asked cesar whether he had anything on his person that could hurt albright,and,when cesar indicated that he did not,the two proceeded to albright vehicle.as the two sat in albright car,albright examined the rental agreement,reviewed cesar license,and checked for warrants.albright also questioned cesar about his occupation,his relationship with foreste,and the details of his trip.albright gave cesar a written warning for the obstructed windshield and for failing to stop at the stop sign,and the two exited the police vehicle.the interaction with cesar lasted approximately seven to ten minutes.
sergeant albright then reapproached the car to speak with foreste,who remained seated in the vehicle.albright asked foreste a series of questions similar to those he had posed to cesar where the two men were traveling,whether cesar was in possession of marijuana,and whether cesar may have smoked marijuana earlier.as he questioned foreste,albright observed that foreste hands were shaking and that his abdomen was pulsating heavily.during their conversation albright also noticed white residue on the hair inside foreste nostrils,which he deemed consistent with someone who has nasally ingested cocaine or other powdered narcotics.
at around,sergeant albright asked foreste for consent to search the vehicle,which foreste refused.at this point,albright testified,they were kind of in a holding pattern because albright knew that inspector hebert was on his way with duchess corrie,and he wanted to wait for the dog to arrive.supplemental app.at approximately,while detaining foreste and cesar,albright had a telephone conversation with special agent doud.doud informed him,as had detective merchand earlier,that foreste was involved in cocaine and oxycodone distribution in the burlington area.doud also told albright that narcotics canines had positively alerted to the odor of narcotics on three rental cars returned by foreste in the past few months.after speaking with doud,albright explained to foreste and cesar that he planned to wait for a narcotics canine to arrive and sniff around the outside of the car.
inspector heberts and his narcotics canine,duchess corrie,arrived at when they performed an exterior scan of the vehicle,the dog alerted to the presence of narcotics at a number of locations on the vehicle,including the driver side door seam,the trunk,and the passenger side door.inspector heberts testified that when the dog approached the open passenger window where foreste was seated,she got up on the door sill,stuck her head in,took a deep inhalation,and alerted to the presence of drugs by scratching with her paw.sergeant albright then advised foreste that under vermont law he could either consent to a search of the car or require albright to seek a search warrant.foreste refused consent,and so albright secured the vehicle for towing by asking foreste to exit the vehicle,detaining him in handcuffs,and calling to request a wrecker to tow the vehicle to the barracks pending application for a warrant.at,albright detained foreste for transportation back to the barracks.
sergeant albright detained foreste in a holding cell at the state police barracks while waiting for the search warrant to issue.a vermont state judge signed a warrant to search foreste vehicle at approximately.the ensuing search uncovered prescription pills not in their designated container,one of which was a controlled substance under vermont law and illegal to possess without a valid prescription.albright then arrested foreste and searched him incident to that arrest.when sergeant albright searched foreste underpants,he found two bags containing over oxycodone pills.
foreste was charged in the united states district court for the district of vermont with knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute oxycodone,a schedule i controlled substance.foreste did not contest his guilt,but argued that the evidence against him should be suppressed because the successive detentions by the massachusetts and vermont state police were unreasonably intrusive in violation of the fourth amendment,and that he should be given access to the narcotics canine field performance records in support of his defense that the dog was insufficiently reliable.
following a suppression hearing and a special hearing for of the narcotics canine handler,the district court rejected both arguments.united states foreste,cr,wl.may.the court sentenced foreste to twelve months and one day of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release foreste conditional guilty plea preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress and motion for discovery.
foreste motion to suppress 
foreste concedes that separate traffic infractions supported the massachusetts and vermont stops.nor does foreste contest the government assertion that reasonable suspicion of criminal activity supported extension of the stops for investigatory purposes.instead,foreste argues that the two stops combined duration was unreasonably intrusive in violation of the fourth amendment and that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from him as a result of those stops.
traffic stops are presumptively reasonable under the fourth amendment if the officer has probable cause to believe that a traffic infraction has occurred.whren united states,d.if an officer has observed a traffic violation,his actual motivation for stopping the vehicle is irrelevant to whether the stop is constitutionally reasonable.id.at.during a stop,an officer may question the occupants of a vehicle about matters unrelated to the stop as long as the inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.arizona johnson,d.a traffic stop may be extended for investigatory purposes if an officer develops a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity supported by specific and articulable facts.see united states glover,cir.
whether successive stops should be evaluated jointly or separately 
before assessing the reasonableness of foreste investigatory detention,we must first resolve what in most cases is a straightforward question how long was the relevant detention period the two stops lasted only about and forty minutes respectively,but their combined length totaled about an hour.foreste argues that the stops must be considered as one because they occurred less than half an hour apart and were,in his view,part of a joint drug investigation by trooper loiselle and sergeant albright.he reasons that even if the stops would have each been individually reasonable,the stops combined length was unreasonably intrusive in violation of the fourth amendment.
the government,by contrast,argues that the reasonableness of each stop must be considered separately.in its view,the stops should be individually evaluated regardless of any collaboration between the officers because each stop was supported by independent probable cause speeding in massachusetts and a rolling stop in vermont and,under whren united states,a traffic stop is justified regardless of the subjective motivations of the officer,at.
this court has not previously addressed the issue of successive investigatory detentions,but the idea that successive police stops may at least sometimes warrant collective consideration finds support in the decisions of our sister circuits.most instructive is the eight circuit decision in united states ilazi,cir.in that case officers observed two suspicious men while conducting routine surveillance to intercept drug traffickers at a minneapolis airport.both of the men were staggering as they walked,the officers noticed the men sniffing and inhaling deeply after placing their fingers near their noses,and one of the men was walking with some difficulty,continually stomping both feet as he went.the officers approached the men near an airport bar,inquired about their travel plans,and then thanked the men for their cooperation and left.id.at.
after leaving the bar,the officers explained the situation to two dea agents who were also on duty at the airport.the dea agents watched the two men as they left the bar and,like the officers,they noticed that one of the men walked with a strange gait like a child with a dirty diaper.id.at.based on this observation and their conversation with the officers,the dea agents approached the men,asked to see their travel papers,and inquired about their trip.during this second round of questioning,the agents noticed a bulge in the right boot of one of the men,which a subsequent search revealed to be heroin.
in considering whether the investigatory stops were properly limited in scope and duration,the court observed that to consider the reasonableness of each investigatory stop individually would allow for gamesmanship.officers could conduct successive,limited stops based on the same reasonable suspicion in order to circumvent constitutional limitations on duration 
here we have not one stop,but two.both must be limited in scope and duration.to end our inquiry here,however,would allow law enforcement officials to circumvent these requirements by subjecting an individual to successive stops,each sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigatory seizure,but collectively so intrusive as to be tantamount to an arrest.
id.at.to prevent such gamesmanship,the ilazi court considered the stops jointly and required that they be reasonable both individually and in combination.id.at.other circuits have reached similar conclusions,holding that a second stop violates the fourth amendment where the reasonable suspicion justifying it has already been dispelled by a prior stop,united states peters,cir,and that successive stops based on the same information strongly indicate that an arrest has taken place,united states morin,cir,abrogated on other grounds,see united states corral franco,cir.
we share these courts concern regarding the intrusiveness of successive investigations based on the same reasonable suspicion and conclude that where the suspicion justifies successive investigations,and the officer conducting the subsequent investigation is aware of the prior investigation and the suspicion that supported it,the investigations duration and scope must be both individually and collectively reasonable under the fourth amendment.
successive traffic stops based on separate traffic infractions 
the government argues that even if successive investigations should be considered collectively where the second is essentially an extension of the first,the two investigatory detentions at issue in this case should be analyzed individually because each traffic stop was supported by independent probable cause.to look beyond the probable cause justifying the stops,reasons the government,would run afoul of whren,under which a traffic stop based on probable cause is justified regardless of the officers subjective motivations.at.
but this argument misses the point.everyone agrees that it was constitutionally permissible for both trooper loiselle and sergeant albright to
