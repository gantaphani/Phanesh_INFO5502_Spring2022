opinion of the court 
marvin goldberg ran an outfit called equihealth products that sold veterinary grade prescription drugs to horse owners so long as they affirmed that they were using the drugs to treat their own horses and that under their state law owners treating their own horses were considered veterinarians.because his clientele made these affirmations,goldberg argued that equihealth could legally dispense these drugs without proof of prescription,a proposition he supported by citation to food,drug,and cosmetic act provisions permitting veterinarians to transfer prescription drugs to other veterinarians without a prescription.specifically,goldberg argued that since equihealth,which had a veterinarian on staff,was selling to owners who were recognized as veterinarians under their states laws,equihealth activities involved a legal transfer,and thus were exempt from the prescription requirement.
the food and drug administration and its state counterparts took a dim view of goldberg argument,repeatedly notifying him that this explanation was nothing more than an excuse for dispensing prescription drugs illegally.because equihealth continued to rely on this transfer rationale even after hearing from these agencies,and thus continued to dispense drugs without the required prescription,the federal bureau of investigation launched an investigation that eventually led to goldberg indictment for crimes related to equihealth operations,as well as for crimes related to his role in supplying his brother,a race horse trainer,with anabolic steroids for use in the brother training operation.at trial,the jury rejected goldberg theory as to the legality of equihealth instead that he was in the business of illegally dispensing prescription further found him guilty on all the counts 
on appeal,goldberg accepts that equihealth activities were illegal,but argues that his conviction was nonetheless flawed and that the district court erred in calculating his sentence.for the reasons stated below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate goldberg sentence.
factual and procedural background 
this case stems from the formation of equihealth products which was an operation dedicated to circumventing the general ban on dispensing certain drugs without a prescription and to circumventing the agreements equihealth had with some of its suppliers not to distribute commercially the drugs that it received.
although he never explained why it was permissible to mislead his suppliers,at trial goldberg contended that equihealth activities were legal under the because it is perfectly permissible for veterinarians to transfer drugs amongst themselves without prescriptions and the definition of veterinarian is governed by state law,which generally permits animal owners to practice veterinarian medicine on their own animals,without the need for an educational degree or license,propositions that he took to mean that transfers of drugs from equihealth to animal owners,for use exclusively on their own animals,are transactions that need not be accompanied by a prescription.goldberg op.br.
relying on this view of the law,goldberg repeatedly sold prescription veterinary drugs to any visitor to his website who affirmed that,where he or she lived,owners treating their own horses were considered veterinarians and that these drugs were to be used accordingly.from the outset,the was aware of equihealth operations and its purported,goldberg actually called the to get its approval for the transfer theory on which equihealth was relying.but despite these overtures,the never approved the operations of equihealth or its view of the law to the contrary,it told goldberg on multiple occasions that equihealth activities were illegal.indeed,the twice warned equihealth that it was violating the because,as goldberg charitably puts it,the agency disagreed with the notion that animal owners are veterinarians with respect to their own animals,and viewed equihealth as dispensing drugs without the requisite prescription from a veterinarian.id.at.various state boards of veterinary medicine also wrote equihealth to tell it the same thing this was not a permissible way to dispense prescription drugs.unwilling to cede to the federal and state agencies views,goldberg his counsel responded in writing to each of these administrative warnings,restating the argument that equihealth activities were legal under the transfer exception,and thus that it would continue to sell drugs without proof of prescription.id.at.while he was battling with the and its state counterparts,goldberg used his position at equihealth to obtain anabolic steroids for his brother,a race horse trainer who used them in his training operation.one such transaction involved the purchase of stanozolol,an anabolic steroid marketed as winstrol.according to goldberg version of events,equihealth resident veterinarian jack wilkes ordered the drugs,had them sent to equihealth main office goldberg home,and then,once they arrived,goldberg sent them on to his brother.however,on a call recorded by agent greg tremaglio,with whom wilkes was cooperating,the veterinarian offered a very different version of events,accusing goldberg of stealing his wilkes drug enforcement administration number and placing the order without his knowledge.
a jury convicted goldberg of wire and mail fraud based on his transactions with luitpold pharmaceuticals,an equihealth supplier with whom goldberg had an agreement not to resell commercially the drugs that he received counts possession with intent to distribute stanozolol,an anabolic steroid counts two counts of introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce counts and and misbranding counts and.he now appeals 
a.the response to the jury question 
we turn first to goldberg claim that the district court erred in responding to a question posed by the jury concerning the possession with intent to distribute charges.during deliberations,the jury asked if they had to find that the events recounted in the indictment second that defendant marvin goldberg used wilkes drug enforcement administration dea number to order and receive controlled substances from pet health pharmacy in youngstown,arizona without the knowledge and consent of wilkes existed in order to convict,asking 
for counts through the counts related to the stanozolol possession,does paragraph of the indictment count as an element of the charges,or do we need to only consider elements pertaining to distribution and possession in other words,do we need to find guilty on all four elements for an overall guilty verdict on counts through.
goldberg wanted the district court to respond by instructing the jury that it must find that he illegally possessed the stanozolol because implied in the term possession is illegal possession.the district court refused,concluding that by giving goldberg proposed instruction it would erroneously add another element to the crime,illegal possession,when under the law either legal or illegal possession would suffice.after so ruling,the district court made the following statement to the jury about the elements needed to convict 
one,that the defendant,marvin goldberg,possessed stanozolol,the controlled substance described in the indictment.
two,that the defendant knew that the substance charged in the indictment was a controlled substance.
and,three,that the defendant intended to distribute the controlled substance alleged in the indictment.
those are the three essential elements for each of these offenses.
paragraph of the indictment is,as i indicated from the outset,the indictment is not evidence.it what the government is alleging that took place.it not an element of the offense charged.
so you have to determine whether or not the government has proven these three elements on each of these three counts.these are the most crucial factors.
on appeal,goldberg argues that the district court failure to give his proposed instruction led the jury to convict even though a critical element,illegal possession,was absent 
although we are not certain that goldberg proposed instruction was appropriate given its attenuated relationship with the question,we put this aside to focus on the larger issue whether possession,as it is used in possession with intent to distribute,is limited to instances of illegal possession.goldberg cites no law in support of his argument that it is,and our own survey has not found any either.that said,we have found an abundance of precedent to the contrary,generally involving pharmacists facing charges of possession with intent to distribute after being caught moonlighting as drug dealers.in this context,the earliest case in which we found an argument equivalent to goldberg was united states goldfine,in which one such pharmacist argued that because his possession was legal,he could not be convicted of possession with the intent to distribute,cir.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit flatly rejected this argument,explaining that possession,when used in this context,encompasses both its legal and illegal variants,a proposition that every other court of appeals confronting this issue over the past years has either explicitly or implicitly agreed with.see,united states gurgiolo,cir reviewing the case of a pharmacist convicted of possession with intent to distribute after he admitted selling to individuals who lacked valid prescriptions united states lartey,cir.
as a result,we believe that illegal all that is required to sustain a charge of possession with intent to distribute.therefore,we conclude that the district court refusal to give goldberg proposed response was entirely proper.
whether hearsay testimony introduced at trial violated the constitution confrontation clause 
the irrelevance of the possession distinction ties directly into the next issue we consider whether the admission of wilkes hearsay testimony suggesting that goldberg possession of the steroids was illegal violated the confrontation clause of the constitution.
during the course of its investigation of equihealth,the government reached out to wilkes,equihealth then veterinarian who was weakened by illness and unable to care for himself at the time that the spoke with him.as a result of his circumstances,we surmise that wilkes was more than willing to cooperate with the investigation in order to avoid arrest incarceration for his role in equihealth operations,and accordingly view his statements made under the circumstances with a degree of suspicion.
during the course of his interview,wilkes told the agent what he did for equihealth on a basis,and then disclosed an incident where goldberg obtained stanozolol for his brother to use on racehorses in his care.in order to prove that his story was true,wilkes agreed to place a call to goldberg that would be surreptitiously recorded.during that conversation,goldberg freely admitted that he had obtained steroids for his brother after a call involving wilkes,goldberg,and goldberg brother.in response,wilkes told goldberg that he did not remember that call,implying instead that goldberg had actually obtained the prescription by forging his signature and number on the order form submitted to the wholesaler.wilkes stated,i do understand how you got my dea number.in response,goldberg recounted to wilkes the following chain of events you called pet health and gave it to them i called you and told you that i wanted to use it for,uh,my brother horses,and you said okay you called p et h ealth,and you gave them the number,you never gave the number to me.
later in the same conversation,wilkes accused goldberg of lying about his qualifications,saying,you told me you had a license to practice in pennsylvania,t o sell drugs in pennsylvania.again,goldberg responded with his version of events naw,i did,i am not a vet,doc,and further explained that he had no license to dispense drugs at the behest of a veterinarian,saying,i never told you i am a pharmacist,i do have a pharmacy.wilkes retorted,well that what i was led to believe,that all.
although wilkes died before trial,the government sought to introduce the tape and succeeded in doing so,which it relied on during its closing argument to prove that wilkes did not know that marvin goldberg had his dea number,that he did know that marvin goldberg was repeatedly using that number in order to obtain stanozolol from pet health pharmacy,and that goldberg had lied to wilkes about being licensed.put another way,the government offered wilkes,statement to prove the matters asserted.the parties and we agree that this amounted to a violation of goldberg rights guaranteed by the confrontation clause.as a result,we are only concerned with the harm visited by this event,and will reverse unless the government proves this misstep was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,united states toliver,cir.
the steroids transaction that we are concerned with here is the same one that is discussed above,the stanozolol transaction that led to the possession with intent to distribute charges.relevant to our analysis,we note that the elements of the offense are knowing or intentional possession with intent to distribute of a controlled substance.united states lacy,cir.for the same reasons that we disagreed with goldberg claim that the jury had to be told that possession really meant illegal possession,we disagree with his claim that the salient issue was whether wilkes prescribed the stanozolol in the amounts ordered,and whether he used his dea number to obtain it.goldberg op.br.instead,we view the key issue to be whether goldberg possessed legally or illegally a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it.
the conflict between wilkes statement and goldberg version of events centers solely on the legality of his possession,which,as we explained above,has no bearing since a conviction for possession with intent to distribute can stand whether it is predicated on legal or illegal possession.because wilkes statements are irrelevant to whether he had committed this crime,its admission into the mix of information the jury was considering in relation to this charge was harmless.government of virgin islands joseph,cir.
that said,we do consider the effect that wilkes statements,which undoubtedly impugned goldberg credibility,could have had on the trial as a whole.to that end,we note that goldberg credibility is simply not at issue in this balance of the charges can be grouped into two categories,those based on false certifications that the drugs would not be resold and those based on dispensing prescription drugs without a veterinarian order.at trial,the evidence supporting the jury finding that goldberg lied about his intention not to resell the drugs was overwhelming,so these convictions still stand.further,the remaining charges stem from dispensing drugs without a prescription,which is something that goldberg readily acknowledges that he did,meaning that there were no credibility determinations that needed to be made as to these counts.in this context,the government error was harmless.see joseph,at.
c.the felony misbranding convictions 
counts deal with goldberg misbranding activities,and specifically equihealth filling of two orders submitted by agent tremaglio.while goldberg admits selling these drugs to tremaglio,he argues that he can not be convicted of misbranding because the drugs were not misbranded,and in any event not misbranded before they were sold.further,he argues that even if what he did was misbranding,it was misdemeanor misbranding because there was no evidence that he acted with any intent to defraud or mislead.accordingly,his appeal raises two issues was there sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that goldberg misbranded these drugs held them for sale while they were misbranded and if so,was there sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that he acted with an intent to defraud or mislead so as to make the convictions felonies we consider each issue in turn.
misbranding 
misbranding is governed by k,which in pertinent part prohibits the doing of any act with respect to a food,drug,device,or cosmetic,if such act is done while such article is held for sale whether or not the first sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded.
although goldberg admits selling these drugs without a valid prescription,he argues that he did not misbrand them,since as a technical matter he never misbranded or adulterated the drugs in question.goldberg op.br.in other words,goldberg argues that misbranding prohibits alter ing the product in some merely dispensing to an without a prescription.id.at emphasis deleted.however,goldberg is a bit loose in his argument,because two paragraphs later he admits that dispensing a drug without a prescription is misbranding.id.at.and his second instinct is the correct one misbranding does encompass dispensing these drugs without a prescription.b see,united states arlen,cir any prescription drug that is dispensed without a prescription is deemed misbranded as a matter of law.united states bradshaw,cir 
however,goldberg stands by his argument that there is a temporal problem because a drug can not be dispensed while it is held for sale,because it can not be delivered and held for sale at the same time.goldberg op.br.this argument gets him nowhere because the statute clearly states that t he act of dispensing a drug contrary to the provisions requiring a prescription shall be deemed to be an act which results in the drug being misbranded while held for sale.f c.as a result,whatever temporal confusion comes with the misbranding provision,it is resolved by the relatively straightforward declaration that dispensing drugs without a prescription means that those drugs were misbranded while they were held for sale.id.
we also reject goldberg argument that he can not be properly convicted under k because this provision was enacted to regulate the drug distribution chain,not dispensing to the end user.goldberg op.br.to the contrary,the supreme court ruling in united states sullivan notes that the purpose of k misbranding prohibition was to extend the act coverage to every article that had gone through interstate commerce until it finally reached the ultimate consumer.discussing.accordingly,there is no reason grounded in legislative intent not to apply k to goldberg sales to end users.
based on the analysis above,we affirm goldberg misbranding convictions.
requisite intent 
because we conclude that goldberg was properly convicted of misbranding,we turn to whether the evidence shows that he acted with an intent to defraud or mislead as he conducted these misbranding activities.the presence or absence of intent is important since willful misbranding is only a misdemeanor unless there is the intent to defraud or mislead.a.then it is a felony.
although the jury found such an intent,goldberg claims that this finding has to be wrong.there was,he contends,undisputed evidence showing that f ull disclosure was given to equihealth customers about the drugs sold,the nature of the transaction,and equihealth status as a party,and he was open and transparent with the fda and the various state agencies that inquired about equihealth.goldberg op.br.
the government offers three reasons to affirm on this issue.first,it claims that the product and use disclaimer,which customers signed and supplied to goldberg,was misleading as to,among other things,the rights of the customer to treat his or her own animal under the various state law provisions governing the practice of veterinary medicine.in making this argument,the government overlooks that the disclaimer is not an affirmative representation by goldberg,but rather by the customer,meaning that any misrepresentation occasioned by the statements was caused by the customer lying about the applicable law in his or her home state,not the misbrander goldberg that merely received the statement.as a result,it can not be said that goldberg misled anyone via the statements his customers made.
next,the government points to s ales literature assert ing that the company veterinarian actually would prescribe the drugs.government br.this is easily dealt with,as the literature in question has no tie to the four counts of misbranding that goldberg was charged with.agent tremaglio was repeatedly told that the drugs he was ordering would not be provided pursuant to a prescription,were not prescribed by a veterinarian,and that he would not be able to consult directly with one either before or after he placed his order.as a result,the only way that we could deem goldberg conduct misleading would be to hold that when a vendor permits outdated sales literature to continue to exist in some form,even though it told customers not to rely on the representations therein,the vendor has misrepresented its activities.we are not prepared to do this,and therefore we deem that this argument does not justify goldberg felony convictions.
finally,the government argues that by having his suppliers believe that they were sending him drugs pursuant to valid prescriptions,and that he would not resell the drugs,goldberg acted with deception or an intent to mislead in his misbranding activities.id.at.whatever the merits of this argument,there is no factual basis for it.nothing in the record shows that goldberg made those statements or implied them in relation to the drugs he sold to tremaglio.as a result,this argument,unsupported by any evidence we found,can not justify goldberg felony misbranding convictions.
this leaves the government without any persuasive argument in favor of sustaining goldberg felony conviction for misbranding.beyond that,our own independent review of the record has not yielded any trace of an intent on goldberg part to avoid detection or misrepresent what he was up to.instead,the evidence demonstrates that goldberg conducted his admittedly illegal ventures in the open,and at least as far as the drugs that led to the misbranding counts with which he was charged in accordance with all the agreements he made.as a result,we vacate his felony misbranding convictions,making these convictions instead misdemeanors.
d.the sentencing challenges 
goldberg raises two challenges to his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in the way it calculated the losses associated with equihealth conduct,and in imposing an enhancement based on his disregard of numerous agency letters that informed him of the illegal nature of equihealth activities.we address each in turn.
loss calculation 
the district court enhanced goldberg sentence by sixteen levels pursuant to b,providing for such an enhancement when the losses associated with the conduct in question are between and million.while goldberg does not contest the general applicability of b to his situation,he argues that the district court erred when it used equihealth million in total gross profits as a proxy for the losses suffered,and thus erred in relying on those profits to calibrate the b enhancement.
to this end,goldberg correctly argues that b calls for a calculation based on the actual loss occasioned by his conduct,unless there is a loss but it reasonably can not be determined.id.cmt.b.further,he is correct insofar as he argues that the record produces scant,if any,evidence of actual harm,and further provides little reason to suspect that the losses occasioned by his fraudulent conduct bear a logical relationship to equihealth gross profits.goldberg op.br.
that said,he fails to appreciate that these provisions are not designed for offenders like him.instead,the way to account for his conduct is established by cmt.f v,which reads 
v certain other unlawful misrepresentation a case involving a scheme in which iii goods for which regulatory approval by a government agency was required but not obtained,loss shall include the amount paid for the property,services or goods transferred,rendered,or misrepresented,with no credit provided for the value of those items or services.
as admitted by goldberg and established by the numerous agency letters,approval was required for these drugs to be were prescription drugs after all.there was no such approval because the drugs were misbranded.this means goldberg was selling goods for which regulatory approval was required but not obtained.therefore,under cmt.f v,the district court gross profits methodology was proper.
administrative order enhancement
