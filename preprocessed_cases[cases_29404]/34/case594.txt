a jury convicted the defendant of being a felon in possession of a handgun.g.the defendant came into possession of the gun during a physical confrontation with a police officer.the district court concluded that the defendant fell within the ambit of the armed career criminal act,e,and imposed a sentence of months,the low end of the applicable guideline range.the defendant now appeals both his conviction and his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in admitting certain identification evidence refusing to instruct the jury on the defendant theory that he took the police officer handgun in applying the armed career criminal act even though the government had not supplied court records for one of the defendant previous convictions and concluding,for sentencing purposes,that the defendant had possessed the handgun in connection with a crime of violence.after a careful review of the record,we affirm the defendant conviction and reject his allegations of sentencing error.
because the defendant principal claim is that the district court failed to instruct the jury on,we review the facts relating to that theory in the light most favorable to the defendant.see united states flores,cir.although the defendant also raised a misidentification defense,he does not challenge on appeal the jury rejection of that defense.for narrative convenience,we review the trial evidence relating to identification in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states george,cir.we draw the facts relevant to the defendant challenge to the pretrial identification procedures from the district court unchallenged factual findings at the motion to suppress.see united states monteiro,cir.we reserve,for the moment,the facts relevant to the sentencing.
at about on a balmy july night,boston police officers john lydstone and terence pennington observed the defendant and six other women and four a park in the roxbury section of boston.several people in the group were drinking beer,but the defendant was not.as it turned out,the defendant was in the park independently from the group of drinkers.because it was illegal to possess alcohol in a boston city park,lydstone and pennington exited their patrol cruiser and told the drinkers to put their beers down.everyone complied.pennington asked the group if anyone had a weapon.when no one responded,he announced that he was going to everyone present.pennington four of the men and then began the defendant.the defendant was compliant,and pennington later testified that he did not have any particular concern that the defendant possessed a weapon.
while pennington was the defendant,lydstone observed one of the women drop something behind a stone wall.he yelled for pennington to hold up a second.pennington stopped the defendant before he had checked the defendant waist area for contraband.lydstone then handcuffed the woman and directed her to his cruiser.as this was happening,a man with a video camera entered the park and began filming the interaction between the police and the group of beer drinkers.alarmed,pennington told the man with the video camera to shut the camera off,and that by videotaping the scene he ran the risk of being hurt or shot.lydstone approached the man with the camera and tussled with him briefly in an unsuccessful effort to take the camera.lydstone then told the cameraman to wait with the group of beer drinkers.
pennington decided to see what the woman had dropped behind the stone wall.he found a bag of marijuana and a revolver.pennington yelled to lydstone,gun,gun,gun,waved the weapon he had found in the air,and told everyone to get on the ground.at about the same time,the defendant ran away from the other people in the park,down a slope,and towards some nearby woods.
lydstone gave chase and caught the defendant roughly two to three seconds after he had run off.lydstone grabbed the defendant shirt and wrestled him to the ground.the two men rolled down the slope,and the defendant ended up on top of lydstone.lystone attempted to get the defendant off of him,and the two men fought.lydstone tore the defendant shirt,punched him in the face,and attempted to push him away.despite these efforts,lydstone did not gain control over the situation,and the defendant remained on top of him.then,lydstone testified,he saw a shiny object in the defendant waistband.lydstone reached down and retrieved his own handgun and placed his gun directly under the defendant chin.his finger was not on the trigger,but the gun was positioned so that,if fired,it would send a bullet through the defendant brain and out the back of his head.
the defendant shouted no,no,no he grabbed for lydstone gun.after a struggle,the defendant seized the gun.he stood up and pointed the gun at lydstone.lydstone rose to his feet to run away from the defendant.as lydstone was getting up,the defendant fired at least one shot which did not cause any damage the defendant disappeared from the scene.the next day,a connecticut department of transportation worker found lydstone handgun in the southbound breakdown lane of interstate.
officers lydstone and pennington described the defendant as an man with dreadlocks and burn marks on his face.the police gathered information that appeared to implicate the defendant.they prepared an array of photographs.the district court later described the array as follows 
the defendant has generally dark skin but a very noticeable patch of lighter skin in the areas of his chin,nose,and eyes the police produced a series of pictures in which all of the men are of similar build,four of the men are black with skin discoloration though none of the four has the dramatic skin pattern that the defendant has and the remaining four males have hairstyles similar to the defendant dreadlocks.although none of the men shown in the array are likely to be readily confused with the defendant,they do resemble,to varying degrees,the description that pennington and lydstone gave before the array was assembled.
lydstone and pennington both identified the defendant with certainty.roughly two weeks after the incident in the park,deputy marshals arrested the defendant in atlanta,georgia.he returned to boston,initially to face state assault charges.later,the state charges were dismissed.the case was tried in federal court on the felon in possession charge alone.
the district court rebuffed the defendant effort to suppress the officers identification of him,reasoning that the photographic array had not been inappropriately suggestive.the case proceeded to trial.the defendant presented no witnesses.his principal theory of defense was police officers had described lydstone assailant as a man much larger than the defendant,and there were discrepancies in their versions of the facts the defendant also sought to show that he had acted in reasonable fear for his life in seizing lydstone gun.the district court refused,however,to instruct the jury on a or necessity theory.the court reasoning,drawn from the pattern jury instructions for this circuit was that the defendant waived any justification defense by failing to provide evidence that there was no alternative but to violate the law.
despite the district court refusal to give any justification instruction,the jury gave some indications that it was prepared to consider the defendant proposed theory.during its first day of deliberations,the jury sent the court questions asking,willing possession,does it have anything to do with being threatened with death,and an officer and,do you have the right to touch a gun in if you are a convicted felon the district court responded by reminding the jurors of its definition of the felon in possession law and telling them that they should avoid resorting to other sources of information you might have or ideas you might have about what the legal principles were.the next day,after several additional hours of deliberation,the jury returned a guilty verdict.
a.the motion to suppress 
the defendant contends that the photo array constructed by the police was impermissibly suggestive,in violation of the due process clause.see neil biggers,d.he asserts that the district court should have suppressed pennington and lydstone identifications and barred them from identifying him in court.
we have said that identification made before trial and in the be suppressed as a matter of due process only in extraordinary cases.united states henderson,cir.identification evidence routinely is admitted in federal courts.see.d c.when identification evidence is suppressed,it is primarily to avoid an unfair trial.united states bouthot,cir.an identification based on a photo array must be suppressed as a matter of due process only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification.biggers,at.when the conviction is based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph,we will reverse on a constitutional basis only if the very substantial likelihood of misidentification was irreparable,despite the defendant opportunity to the witness about the accuracy of the identification.see simmons united states,d.
both as to pretrial identifications and identifications,our analysis takes two steps.we look first to see if there was anything impermissibly suggestive about the identification procedure and,second,if there was impermissible suggestiveness,to decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.henderson,at internal quotation marks omitted.our review of the district court denial of a motion to suppress a photo identification is plenary.united states brennick,cir.
the first prong of the the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive can be broken down into two constituent parts that concerning the suggestiveness of the identification,and that concerning whether there was some good reason for the failure to resort to less suggestive procedures.lefave,criminal procedure.ed.a photo array suggestiveness normally is evaluated by determining whether it so far as practicable include d a reasonable number of persons similar to any person then suspected whose likeness is included in the array.model code of procedure.see also united states carter,cir brennick,at.
as the district court noted,constructing a fair photographic array that included the defendant posed an unusual challenge.
the defendant was present at the hearing on the present motion,and i had the opportunity to observe his features.it is fair to say that he has a highly distinctive appearance.it is important to note that it is not just the fact of the skin discoloration,but its pattern,that is so distinctive.it can be said,as lydstone remarked,that at first glance it appears the defendant is wearing a mask.he is,it must be acknowledged,highly recognizable.
in fact,the district court stated,the defendant appearance was so unusual that i t would be unreasonable to expect the police to find pictures of eight other men who not only shared his age,weight,hairstyle,and ethnicity,but in addition had a similar pattern of facial discoloration.as a result,there was some truth to the defendant argument that the photo array used with officers pennington and lydstone was the equivalent of showing them a single photograph because the defendant appearance is so different from the other individuals shown in the array.having reviewed the photo array,we agree with the district court that the defendant facial pigmentation set him apart from the other men depicted in the array.
in the circumstances,however,a better photo array was not a practicable alternative.the police officer who constructed the photo array used a sophisticated database of digital booking photographs.the database allowed him to search for photos of people with facial pigmentation.he performed at least a dozen searches for black men with facial pigmentation in constructing the photo array at issue here,steadily increasing his parameters for age,height,and weight,and removing any restriction as to hairstyle.having found only four suitable photos,the officer filled in the remaining four spots in the array with men who had hairstyles similar to the defendant.no other photo database was accessible to him.this was an unusual situation in which there may have been no way to construct a model photo array there was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress.
justification 
the defendant and the government disagree about the availability of a justification defense in this case.to analyze this disagreement,we explain some terminology relevant to the defendant theory that justification defenses may be available in a felon in possession prosecution and why the facts of this case did not entitle the defendant to a jury instruction on those defenses.
terminology 
at trial,the defendant asked that the court instruct the jury on.the district court rephrased the issue as one of necessity.in a sense,both views are correct.we agree with the defendant that seems the best term for his theory as to why he was justified in taking the gun from lydstone.the defendant claims that he had to seize the gun an act of force to protect himself from lydstone purportedly unnecessary and unwarranted act of placing the gun against his head an act of force.in other words,the defendant claims that he resorted to force against an assailant in order to avoid the imminent danger of his own death at the hands of that assailant,the classic scenario in a case.see united states bello,cir discussing pattern jury instructions on see also boget state,concluding that is not limited to assaultive crimes united states panter,cir refusing to decide in a felon in possession case whether the proper label for this defense is or necessity model penal code.
however,we also agree with the district court that the defendant would have had to show some legal justification for keeping the gun after he had seized it,under the rubric of a necessity or duress defense it was not error for the district court to focus on the requirements of such a defense in analyzing the defendant arguments.
availability of the defenses 
we have not decided whether a defendant charged with being a felon in possession of a handgun may assert as an affirmative defense that he was justified in his possession,though we appear to have assumed that such a defense is available.see united states diaz,cir discussing,but not deciding,who bears the burden of persuasion in a justification defense to a felon in possession charge.the circuits that have decided the issue have unanimously allowed a justification defense to a section charge.see united states bell,cir united states gomez,cir united states singleton,cir c ommon sense dictates that if a previously convicted felon is attacked by someone with a gun,the felon should not be found guilty for taking the gun away from the attacker in order to save his life.united states paolello,cir panter,at see also united states perrin,cir united states vigil,cir.the defendant asks us to follow these cases.the government assumes their validity.
after oral argument in this case,the supreme court provided some additional guidance on defenses in section cases.in dixon united states,d,the court considered whether the government or the defendant bears the burden of proof on a duress defense to a section charge the court concluded that the defendant bears the burden.while the court did not explicitly evaluate whether duress and the justification defenses are available in a section case,the court did say that it would be unrealistic to read the statute and its legislative history as implicitly doing away with a defense as strongly rooted in history as the duress defense.id.at.nevertheless,the dixon court merely assumed arguendo that a defense of duress was available.id.at.we too will simply assume arguendo that congress intended to allow the defenses of necessity,duress,and self defense in a section prosecution.as we will explain,that assumption does not help the defendant.
no basis for an instruction here 
as we indicated above,to prevail on the theory that he terms,the defendant would have had to show legal justification both for his seizure of lydstone gun and for keeping the gun as long as he did this case doe
