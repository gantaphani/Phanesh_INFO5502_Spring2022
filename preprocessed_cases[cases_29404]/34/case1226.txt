the delaware state police obtained search warrants for paul pavulak email account and workplace after receiving information that he was viewing child pornography on his workplace computers.the evidence that was seized confirmed pavulak involvement in child pornography,and a jury subsequently convicted him of possessing and attempting to produce child pornography,attempting to entice a minor,and committing crimes related to his status as a sex offender.the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment on the conviction and to months imprisonment on the remaining counts.
pavulak now contends that the district court should have suppressed the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrants.he argues that the magistrate lacked probable cause to issue the search warrants.those search warrants were supported by an affidavit that pointed to pavulak prior convictions and labeled the images,which had been reported by informants,simply as child pornography.no further details concerning the images content appeared in the affidavit.we conclude that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause for child pornography.however,because the officers reasonably relied on the warrants in good faith,we agree that the district court properly denied suppression.pavulak remaining challenges to his convictions and life sentence are meritless.we will therefore affirm his convictions and sentence.
factual background 
this is not paul pavulak first encounter with the criminal law.he has twice pled guilty to unlawful sexual contact in the second degree under delaware law once in june and again in april.the first conviction was for molesting the daughter of his girlfriend from september through january.as a result,the delaware superior court sentenced pavulak to four years probation.while on probation for that conviction during the summer of,pavulak repeated similar conduct with the daughter of his new girlfriend,resulting in a second conviction in and two years in prison 
these state convictions required pavulak to register as a sex offender and to keep his residential,work,and email addresses up to date with the delaware state police.after being released from prison on july,pavulak purported to do exactly that.he informed the delaware state police that he was unemployed and staying at the fairview inn in wilmington,delaware.throughout the remainder of the year,pavulak maintained this account of unemployment and hotel living.
but the delaware state police soon discovered that pavulak was not telling the whole story.in october,delaware state police detective robert jones received a hotline call from erica ballard.ballard informed the police that her husband curtis mack,an employee at concrete technologies,cti,had observed pavulak working and living at the cti office since his release,information that his registration did not include.ballard also told the police that pavulak was planning a trip to the philippines where he intended to meet women.detective jones followed up with mack,who not only confirmed his wife tip but also provided additional details.according to mack,pavulak was using an unregistered email address,was accessing sexually suggestive images of children on computers at the cti office,and had scheduled a trip to the philippines between december and.detective jones also contacted another cti employee,jahdel riggs,who confirmed all of mack information except pavulak email address.
through investigation,the delaware state police successfully corroborated some of the information provided by mack and riggs.as confirmed by federal agents and pavulak updated delaware sex offender registry address,pavulak was in the philippines from early december to january.by subpoenaing,the police also discovered that the email account was created by a paul pavy,was accessed from the cti office on december,and was accessed from the philippines from december,through january.the police further verified the existence and location of the cti office,its ownership by pavulak adult children,and his delaware state convictions leading the police to obtain an arrest warrant for pavulak failure to register his employment at cti.
armed with the informants information and the results of their investigation,detective nancy skubik of the delaware state police child predator task force applied to the delaware superior court for new castle county for warrants to search the cti office and the account for child pornography.in her for both warrant applications,detective skubik described the two tips,pavulak prior delaware convictions from and,and the information corroborated by her investigation.the affidavit relayed that riggs had seen pavulak viewing child pornography of females between and years old and mack had seen images of females between the ages of to years on pavulak computer that had been sent to pavulak via email.but the affidavit neither defined what was meant by the label child pornography nor provided any further details about the images content.
based on that affidavit,the delaware superior court issued search warrants on january,for the cti office and account.early in the morning of january,delaware state police officers,including detectives jones and skubik,executed the search warrant at cti office.the police arrested pavulak,the only person present in the cti office,based on outstanding warrants for failure to register his employment at cti and his email address.after receiving his miranda rights pavulak admitted that he worked for cti and used the email address while in the philippines.
during the search,officers seized two computers.the first,a hewlett packard laptop,was found in a rear office where pavulak appeared to be living a bed,his clothing,and toiletries were in the room.the laptop was locked by a single windows user account.the second computer,a hewlett packard desktop,was recovered from the receptionist area.each computer contained thousands of images of child pornography.
yet the search uncovered more than just the images of child pornography.evidence recovered from the computers revealed that,in august,pavulak used his username to create a profile on,a website allegedly used by sex tourists for soliciting prostitutes in the philippines.this website led him to ara duran,a philippine woman and mother of jane doe emails that pavulak sent duran showed his immediate interest in the age and sex of duran child.pavulak told duran via email that he was looking for a wife with an aggressive and very active open sex desire similar to his own and who was willing to experiment with different possibilities about sex.on october,duran responded,believing them to be a good match and indicating that she bought more panties for herself and her daughter.pavulak looked forward to dressing duran and her daughter.the two made plans to meet around christmas during pavulak trip to the philippines.he reserved a hotel room for their meeting,preferring the matrimonial room as his first choice because it had a king size bed in which the three of them would fit fine.while awaiting their rendezvous,pavulak reall y want ed to see pictures of duran and jane doe a request that duran obliged.
while pavulak was in the philippines,he visited several women he met online and spent time with duran and jane doe.he took photographs of duran and jane doe,some of which depicted duran or pavulak nude or engaging in sexual activity.he also recorded videos of his sexual activity with duran,one of which portrays duran performing oral sex on pavulak.that video,as pavulak tells her,will be jane doe training video so duran can show her how to perform oral sex.
during pavulak return to the united states,he sent duran several text messages about including jane doe in their sexual activities.he hope d that jane doe would like it too asked duran to teach her everything indicated he would perform oral sex on jane doe and instructed duran to do so in the interim so she likes it and wondered if duran really good instruction of jane doe would allow jane doe to perform oral sex on pavulak next december.pavulak believed that duran could make it all work out for the three of them to have a happy sex life.eager to see them again soon,pavulak scheduled an online webcam chat with duran for the morning of january.
that morning,pavulak chatted with duran using the laptop from the cti office.they discussed jane doe involvement in their sexual activities.we regret the need to recite in detail several of these chats,but the content is necessary to some of the conclusions we reach in our discussion below.

the delaware state police recovered these chat logs between pavulak and duran from the laptop computer.in addition,the police discovered that of the child pornography images and images of pavulak and duran were accessed and edited using windows photo gallery between september,and november.
procedural background 
with the discovery of those chat logs in addition to the images,the united states took over pavulak prosecution.in april,the united states indicted pavulak on five counts in the united states district court for the district of delaware failing to update his registration as a sex offender in violation of a possessing child pornography in violation of a b attempting to produce child pornography in violation of a and e attempting to coerce and entice a minor in violation of b and committing a felony offense involving a minor while registered as a sex offender in violation of.
before trial,pavulak moved to suppress the evidence seized from the cti office and his account.he made two arguments first,that the search warrants were not based on probable cause because they did not provide the with any details about what the alleged images depicted,and second,that he was entitled to a hearing under franks delaware,d,to challenge the veracity of several facts alleged in the affidavit.the district court denied his motion.the court concluded that there was probable cause,and even if there were not,the officers reasonably relied on the warrants in good faith.the court also denied pavulak request for a franks hearing after determining that pavulak did not make a substantial preliminary showing that any misstatements or omissions affected the analysis.
pavulak proceeded to trial in september.after a trial,the jury found him guilty on all counts.in january,pavulak moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts under federal rule of criminal procedure based on insufficient evidence.in addition,pavulak argued that mack and riggs trial testimony was inconsistent with the information they provided for the affidavit.and this inconsistency,according to pavulak,justified a franks hearing to challenge the veracity of mack and riggs tips in the affidavit,leaving the search warrants without probable cause and ultimately entitling pavulak to a new trial under rule.the district court denied these motions.
pavulak report psr gave rise to several objections.as to pavulak conviction,the probation office advised that his prior delaware convictions subjected him to mandatory life imprisonment under e as a repeat sex offender.pavulak objected to this recommendation,arguing that his maximum statutory sentence was fifty years and that apprendi new jersey,d,thus required a jury to determine whether his prior delaware convictions could justify any increase beyond that maximum.the district court rejected that argument.because pavulak maximum sentence was life imprisonment,the court reasoned that apprendi did not apply.consequently,the district court found that pavulak prior convictions triggered mandatory life imprisonment under e for his conviction and sentenced him accordingly.as to his other counts,the district court sentenced pavulak to a consecutive term of months imprisonment for committing a felony offense involving a minor while registered as a sex offender and months imprisonment for the remaining counts to run concurrently with each other and the count.
pavulak timely appealed both his convictions and life sentence 
according to pavulak,the affidavit submitted in support of the applications did not establish probable cause because it lacked any details about what the alleged images of child pornography depicted.on appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress,we review a district court factual findings for clear error,and we exercise de novo review over its application of the law to those factual findings.united states coles,cir.here,we can not say that the affidavit provided a substantial basis for the magistrate conclusion that there was a fair probability of evidence of child pornography in the cti office and pavulak account at the time of the search.united states vosburgh,cir quoting illinois gates,d.but suppression is ultimately inappropriate because the officers relied on the warrants in good faith.
when faced with a warrant application to search for child pornography,a magistrate must be able to independently evaluate whether the contents of the alleged images meet the legal definition of child pornography.new york video,d.that can be accomplished in one of three ways the magistrate can personally view the images the affidavit can provide a sufficiently detailed description of the images or the application can provide some other facts that tie the images contents to child pornography.united states miknevich,cir see also vosburgh,at holding that probable cause supported a warrant where the affidavit tied the images of child pornography to the defendant using his ip address,a fairly unique identifier.
in this case,the applications alleged that pavulak was dealing in child pornography in violation of.that statute prohibits transmitting,receiving,and possessing depictions of a child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or the simulation of such an act.a prohibited sexual act includes a wide range of sexual activity,including nudity depicted for the purpose of sexual gratification of any individual who may view the depiction as well as lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any child.id.e.
to show that evidence of pavulak dealing in child pornography existed at the cti office and in his account,the affidavit relied on three pieces of information.first,pavulak had two prior convictions for child molestation.second,the affidavit stated that mack and riggs had seen pavulak viewing child pornography of females between twelve and eighteen years old,though the affidavit did not provide any further details about what the images depicted.third,officers were able to corroborate pavulak ownership of the email account,his trip to the philippines,and his presence at the cti office.
despite our great deference to the magistrate determination,gates,at,these pieces of information do not establish probable cause to believe that the images contained child pornography.the label child pornography,without more,does not present any facts from which the magistrate could discern a fair probability that what is depicted in the images meets the statutory definition of child pornography and complies with constitutional limits.the affidavit does not describe,for instance,whether the minors depicted in the images were nude or clothed or whether they were engaged in any prohibited sexual act as defined by delaware law.as we said in miknevich,that kind of insufficiently detailed or conclusory description of the images is not enough.at.presented with just the label child pornography,the most the magistrate could infer was that the affiant concluded that the images constitute child pornography.
the problem with that inference is that identifying images as child pornography will almost always involve,to some degree,a subjective and conclusory determination on the part of the viewer,and such inherent subjectivity is precisely why the determination should be made by a judge,not the affiant.united states brunette,cir.otherwise,we might indeed transform the magistrate into little more than the cliche rubber stamp.doe goody,cir.other circuits agree that a affidavit must contain more than the affiant belief that an image qualifies as child pornography.united states doyle,cir holding that there was no probable cause where the affidavit did not provide anything more than a description of the photographs as depicting nude children brunette,at holding that there was no probable cause where an affidavit involved an affiant legal conclusion parroting the statutory definition of child pornography absent any descriptive support and without an independent review of the images by a magistrate.
the government cites several cases for the proposition that the label child pornography,by itself,is sufficient.all but one of those cases,however,fall far short of supporting the government argument.although the affidavits in miknevich and vosburgh did not describe the contents of the images,the circumstances of those cases required no such description.in miknevich,the affidavit identified the contents of the computer file as child pornography through a sexually explicit and highly descriptive file name referring to the ages of the children and implying that they were masturbating.at.the file digital fingerprint also marked it as one known to contain child pornography.id.at.we upheld that warrant,reasoning that the file name was explicit and detailed enough so as to permit a reasonable inference of what the file is likely to depict.id.no such indication is present in this case.
vosburgh involved a defendant who tried to download a link to a video described on the website as depicting a performing oral sex a video that contained only gibberish because it had been planted by law enforcement.at.the officer tracked the download attempt to the defendant computer and obtained a warrant to search for child pornography.id.we upheld that warrant because the defendant deliberate attempt to download child pornography established a fair probability that he possessed other images of child pornography.id.the determination there,unlike this case,was not based on the affiant knowledge that the defendant possessed child pornography,so there were no illicit depictions to describe in the affidavit.id.so,too,in united states simpson,cir.there,the affidavit described the defendant agreement to send a computer diskette with numerous scenes of prepubescent children under the age of thirteen to an undercover officer in exchange for a videotape containing scenes of child pornography.id.at.finally,the government reliance on united states grosenheider,cir,and united states budd,cir,is unhelpful.those cases do not specify what information was presented in the affidavits.
that leaves the government position dependent entirely on united states grant,cir.in grant,the eighth circuit upheld a warrant to search for child pornography based on an officer conclusion that images observed by an informant met the statutory definition of child pornography.id.at.we decline to adopt the eighth circuit approach.magistrates not affiants or officers bear the responsibility of determining whether there exists a fair probability that the images meet the statutory and constitutional definitions of child pornography.video,at reviewing the affidavit to ensure that the magistrate was given more than enough information to conclude that there was a fair probability that the movies satisfied the first and third elements of the statutory definition of obscenity emphasis added.in any event,we believe the supreme court decision in video,together with our own precedent in vosburgh and miknevich,compel us to require more than a conclusion by an affiant that the images constitute child pornography.
nor does combining the label child pornography with the rest of the information in the affidavit produce something greater than the sum of its parts.pavulak prior convictions are not sufficient to establish or even to hint at probable cause as to the wholly separate crime of possessing child pornography absent any allegation of a correlation between the two types of crimes.virgin islands john,cir.that correlation between the two crimes is the missing linchpin that differentiates this case from the eighth circuit decision in united states colbert,cir.there,the defendant was pushing a girl whom he did not know on a playground swingset while talking to her about movies and videos the man had at his home.john,at describing colbert,at.based on that information,officers obtained a warrant to search his home for child pornography.colbert,at.the eighth circuit upheld the warrant,concluding that the combination of the defendant specific desire to watch movies at home with an unrelated girl and his contemporaneous attempt to entice her established probable cause to believe those movies contained child pornography.id.by contrast,detective skubik affidavit did not link pavulak prior acts of child molestation to the images.see john,at distinguishing colbert on this basis.his criminal history thus does not provide any additional reason to believe that these specific images met the legal definition of child pornography under delaware law.
likewise,the successful corroboration of certain details about pavulak other activities does not save the warrants.to be sure,a tip conveying a contemporaneous observation of criminal activity whose innocent details are corroborated can establish probable cause of that criminal activity.united states torres,cir quoting united states wheat,cir.but the details corroborated in this case pavulak email account,his trip to the philippines,and residence and employment at the cti office did not increase the likelihood that the images contained lascivious depictions of nude minors or minors engaging in sexual acts prohibited by delaware law.as a result,the label child pornography without any details about what the images depict or any other connection to child pornography is beyond the outer limits of territory.
even though the warrants in this case transgressed that boundary,the evidence should not be suppressed because the officers relied on the warrant in good faith.suppression is not justified when officers act in the reasonable belief that their conduct d oes not violate the fourth amendment.united states leon.ordinarily,the mere existence of a warrant suffices to prove that an officer conducted a search in good faith.united states steam,cir quoting united states hodge,cir.yet there are situations in which,although a neutral magistrate has found probable cause to search,a lay officer executing the warrant could not reasonably believe that the magistrate was correct.id.those four rare circumstances occur when 
the magistrate issued the warrant in reliance on a deliberately or recklessly false affidavit 
the magistrate abandoned his judicial role and failed to perform his neutral and detached function 
the warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable or 
the warrant was so facially deficient that it failed to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.here,pavulak invokes only the third exception that the affidavit was so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render the executing officers belief unreasonable 
the threshold for establishing this exception is a high one,messerschmidt millender,d,and pavulak has not overcome that burden here.the affidavit in this case is not a bare bones affidavit.it does not rely on an officer unsupported belief that probable cause exists.see united states ritter,cir see also gates,at identifying the affidavits in nathanson united states,and aguilar texas,d,as bare bones affidavits because each contained only an officer belief that probable cause existed without providing any factual details.it does not rely on a single piece of stale evidence.see united states zimmerman,cir.and it does not rely on an uncorroborated or unreliable anonymous tip.see united states williams,cir.
rather,the affiant also one of the executing officers knew that the affidavit had been prepared using information from mack,a fellow employee who provided reliable and current knowledge of pavulak activities at the cti office information that was confirmed by another employee,riggs.the affiant also knew that some of the information mack and riggs provided had been corroborated and that this information had been circulated in a police memorandum and reviewed before the warrants were sought.in short,the officers reasonably relied on the warrant even though the supporting affidavit did not contain details about the content of the images.
and their reliance on the warrant despite the lack of those details is defensible in light of the state of circuit law at the time.hodge,at.the warrants were sought and issued in,but the cases leading us to conclude that the affidavit was insufficient vosburgh,john,and miknevich were not decided until and.in fact,the affidavit allegations would have been sufficient in the eighth circuit at the time.see grant,at,upholding a search warrant based on an officer conclusion that a witness description of the images met the definition of child pornography under the state statute.
pavulak counters that the exception is inapplicable because the affiant,detective skubik,was also involved in executing the search.that is not the law.to be sure,we have acknowledged that it is somewhat disingenuous to find good faith based on a paltry showing of probable cause,particularly where the affiant is also one of the executing officers.zimmerman,at.similarly,the supreme court has observed that an officer who both prepared the application and carried out the search was familiar enough with the warrant to have noticed its deficiency upon even a cursory reading or just a simple glance.groh ramirez,d.those observations,however,simply reinforce the longstanding rule that paltry affidavits preclude good faith.neither the supreme court nor this court has created a new exception to good faith based entirely on the identity of the executing officer,and pavulak fails to cite any court that has interpreted the supreme court observation in groh so broadly.the officers reasonably relied on the warrants in good faith and the district court correctly denied pavulak motion to suppress.
pavulak also claims that the district court erred by denying his request for a franks hearing.the fourth amendment prohibits the intentional or reckless inclusion of a material false statement or omission of material information in a affidavit.united states yusuf,cir.in franks,the supreme court held that a defendant may be entitled to challenge the truthfulness of facts alleged in support of a application.franks,at.the right to a franks hearing is not absolute,however.the defendant must first make a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant knowingly or recklessly included a false statement in or omitted facts from the affidavit,and demonstrate that the false statement or omitted facts are necessary to the finding of probable cause.yusuf,at.
we have not yet identified the standard of review for a district court denial of a request for a franks hearing,and our sister circuits are divided on the correct approach see united states falso,cir recognizing split united states becton,citing united states dale,per curiam same.we conclude that this case does not require us to enter the fray.even under de novo review,none of the alleged errors identified by pavulak would have changed the determination.
pavulak first says the affidavit omitted crucial information although indicating that his prior delaware convictions occurred in and,the affidavit did not explain that the conduct underlying both of those convictions occurred between and.this,pavulak says,was calculated to portray him as a persistent threat even though at the time of the affidavit,he had not committed an offense for roughly years.appellant br.at.yet when we add this counterfactual information to the affidavit,it does not change our determination.yusuf,at the omitted information is introduced into the affidavit in order to determine whether the omission was material.as we concluded earlier,pavulak prior convictions of child molestation did not establish probable cause for the wholly separate crime of possessing child pornography.john,at see supra part ii.given that the convictions themselves do not change either the reasonableness or determinations,when his underlying conduct occurred is similarly irrelevant.consequently,pavulak has failed to show that there would have been no probable cause but for the omission of when his prior conduct occurred.see united states frost,cir.
the false statements pavulak identifies are no more availing.he challenges paragraph of the affidavit,which stated that pavulak was viewing child pornography in october in cti office located at quigley blvd,new castle de.according to pavulak,cti office was in newport,delaware,at that time and did not relocate to new castle until later that month.see appellant br.at.that mistake,though,does not undermine the existence of probable cause the import of that information was that pavulak was viewing child pornography in cti only office wherever it was located using cti computers and using his online account.see,united states corral corral,cir holding that inclusion of an innocent error about the defendant address in the affidavit was insufficient to satisfy the defendant burden under franks.this alleged misstatement did not meet pavulak burden.
finally,the officers internal memorandum stated that pavulak molested the daughter of his russian wife a statement pavulak claims is false because his russian wife did not have a daughter.see appellant br.at.using this statement to challenge the search warrant,however,turns franks on its head.the internal memorandum was not submitted in support of the application,and this statement about a daughter of his russian wife was not mentioned in the affidavit.see oral arg.fr.at.if franks means anything,it means that the fourth amendment is not violated when officers choose to omit information of questionable veracity from their applications.that is precisely what franks encourages and exactly what the officers did here.in sum,pavulak was not entitled to a franks hearing.
pavulak further claims that the prosecutor closing argument denied him due process.donnelly dechristoforo,d.to determine if that is true,we must weigh the prosecutor conduct,the effect of the curative instructions and the strength of the evidence.moore morton,cir citing darden wainwright,d.where,as here,the defendant did not object to the alleged misconduct,we review the prosecutor statements for plain error.united states lee,cir.
although pavulak complains that three of the prosecutor statements infected his trial,we detect no fatal infirmity.first,pavulak claims that the prosecutor improperly relied on his trip to las vegas as the basis for the charge.that argument mischaracterizes the record.to prove that pavulak violated the sex offender registration and notification act sorna by failing to update his registration,the prosecutor had to show that pavulak was a sex offender required to register under sorna who traveled in interstate or foreign commerce after sorna enactment and knowingly failed to update his registration as required by sorna.see united states pendleton,cir citing a.after pointing out pavulak status as a sex offender the first element,the prosecutor relied on pavulak trips to las vegas and the philippines to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement the second element.the prosecutor then turned to the third element,relying on pavulak failure to update his registration while living in and employed at the cti office.see now,the problem for the defendant is that he never registered that address,that cti address,as either a place of employment or a place that he was living.emphasis added see arguing that pavulak was living and working at the cti office.the prosecutor thus argued that pavulak time at the cti office,not his las vegas trip,required him to update his sorna registration.
second,the prosecutor momentary focus on the big picture did not improperly invite the jury to cumulate the evidence of the separate charges.the prosecutor began his closing argument by telling the jury that pavulak had been charged with four different crimes and then discussed the law and evidence for each count separately.see,inviting the jury to walk through the charges and the evidence that proves the defendant guilty of each of them see id.discussing count discussing count,discussing count,discussing count.as he was wrapping up,the prosecutor made the following comment 
the other thing you see in the presentation from the defense is a divide and conquer strategy.they take four different crimes and they want to separate them and they want you to look at each one with blinders on.they do want you to look at the big picture,because the big picture,folks,is really ugly for pavulak.same modus operandi.
although this comment is where pavulak places the weight of his argument,this comment can not shoulder that load.such a single,ambiguous remark ameliorated by our presumption that the jury followed its instruction to consider the evidence for each charge separately,see united states edmonds,cir,and the overwhelming evidence against pavulak on each constitute plain error.united states riley,cir the type of counsel misconduct that warrants granting a new trial is not generally a single isolated inappropriate comment,but rather repeated conduct that permeate s the trial.citation omitted see also united states brown,cir a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury,sitting through a lengthy exhortation,will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.citation omitted.
third,the prosecutor discussion of the harm caused by production of child pornography was unobjectionable.the prosecutor stated 
as the thousands of images of child pornography on defendant computers prove,physical and digital images can live on indefinitely.and think about the story behind each of those pictures.
the day before he was arrested,the defendant tried to have duran put jane doe on the webcam,exposing her vagina.he could have recorded that image,detective willey told us.if so,we have yet another image of child pornography,another file that memorializes the actual sexual abuse of a real child,and the story in this case,the story that you heard last week,would lie behind that image forever,because each image memorializes the sexual exploitation of an actual child.that why congress has banned any person from producing,distributing,receiving,or possessing an image of child pornography.
these statements parallel congress reasons for criminalizing the production and attempted production of child pornography.see.besides,this explanation preempted pavulak argument that jane doe brief nudity on a webcam would not have meaningfully harmed her.see at appellant br.at calling pavulak actions minor,to the point of approaching triviality.in short,none of the prosecutor remarks constitute plain error.
pavulak also challenges whether the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his and possession convictions we review a claim de novo.united states flores,cir citing united states brodie,cir.in doing so,we examine the totality of the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,and interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the verdict winner.united states starnes,cir quoting united states miller,cir.if all the pieces of evidence,taken together,make a strong enough case to let a jury find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,then we must uphold the jury verdict.brodie,at quoting united states coleman,cir.
here,pavulak challenge to his conviction for knowingly possessing child pornography falls short of its extremely high burden.starnes,at quoting united states iglesias,cir.to prove possession of child pornography under a b,the evidence must show that pavulak knowingly possesse d,or knowingly accesse d with an intent to view,any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography with the requisite connection to interstate commerce.pavulak concedes that the images recovered from the depict child pornography.but he argues that no rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed those images.see appellant br.at.
the jury,though,had ample evidence to infer otherwise.the laptop had only a single windows user account and contained photos of pavulak,pavulak claimed that the laptop was his computer,and the police recovered the laptop from the part of the cti office in which he was living.simply put,pavulak was the laptop likeliest user.
and pavulak was also the likeliest person to have accessed the images on the laptop.they were not buried away where an innocent user could have overlooked them.of them were found in windows photo gallery,which could have occurred only if the user had accessed the image and modified it in some way.and the laptop user edited the images between september and november,usually in the evening and on the weekends when pavulak had access to the laptop and other cti employees did not.indeed,on two occasions,several of the images and pictures of pavulak were edited within hours of each other.compare gov t exs,depicting images of pavulak created on september,at approximately,with gov t exs.depicting an image of child pornography created on september,at approximately compare gov t ex.depicting an image of pavulak created on november,at approximately p,with gov t exs,depicting images of child pornography created on november,at approximately.by contrast,no one accessed these images of child pornography when pavulak left the laptop in the united states during his trip to the philippines.the weight of this evidence prevents us from overturning pavulak conviction for possessing child pornography.
likewise,we can not say that no reasonable juror could accept the evidence as sufficient to find pavulak guilty of attempting to produce child pornography.miller,at quoting united states lacy,cir.the crime of attempt requires the specific intent to commit a crime here,producing child pornography in violation of a and a substantial step towards the commission of that crime.united states nestor,cir describing attempted enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of b.under a,a person is guilty of producing child pornography if he employs,uses,persuades,induces,entices,or coerces any minor to engage in or has a minor assist any other person to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct.
here,pavulak repeatedly insisted that duran display jane doe vagina via a live webcam feed during their january,chat session.see telling duran to take ur panties off hon and show me ur pussy,stating no now and jane doe too when duran initially declined,and again demanding now jane doe after duran gave in to his request to see her vagina emphasis added.duran declined to expose jane doe vagina because she was wearing a diaper but offered to display jane doe naked the next morning.pavulak agreed,typing ok.that evidence was enough to constitute a substantial step towards coercing jane doe to engage in any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct.a see,united states lee,cir upholding a guilty verdict for attempted production of child pornography where the evidence showed that the defendant repeatedly request ed sexually explicit photographs and sent a photograph of his own.
moreover,there was plenty of evidence that pavulak specifically intended for duran to display jane doe vagina to excite lustfulness or sexual stimulation.see united states knox,cir explaining that lascivious exhibition of genitals or pubic area is one variety of sexually explicit conduct proscribed by the statute.during that chat,pavulak described various ways that he intended to sexually abuse jane doe in the future,including 
digitally penetrating her at age five 
hoping that she likes performing oral sex on him 
wanting to see her use a vibrator 
ejaculating in her mouth during his next trip to the philippines and 
wanting duran to continue instructing jane doe on how to perform oral sex.
pavulak text messages and the training video confirm his desires.his own text messages to duran indicate that pavulak wanted to perform oral sex on jane doe,to see both duran and jane doe naked on the cam using the v i brator,to have jane doe perform oral sex on him,and to have duran make it all work out for the three of them to be sic happy sex life.and pavulak created a training video for jane doe to learn how to perform oral sex.
urging us to characterize his chat with duran as facetious banter,pavulak claims that he lacked the specific intent to act on any of the illicit portions of his fantasies.appellant br.at.yet it is not for us to weigh the evidence.united states smith,cir quoting united states dent,cir.and even if that were one plausible interpretation of the evidence,his contention that the evidence also permits a less sinister conclusion than guilt is not enough to overturn the verdict.id.quoting dent,at.pavulak fails to take the next step and explain why the government ample evidence does not support the jury verdict.the jury therefore had sufficient evidence to find that pavulak specifically intended to produce child pornography by directing duran to expose jane doe on the webcam.as a result,pavulak sufficiency challenges fail.
the district court did not err by denying pavulak motion for a new trial.according to pavulak,mack testified at trial that he saw pavulak viewing adult pornography,contradicting the affidavit indication that he saw pavulak viewing child pornography.this inconsistency,pavulak contends,entitled him to a franks hearing so he could show that the affidavit information was false.in turn,that falsity would justify suppression of the chat logs,photographs,and other evidence recovered from the cti office and his account and ultimately entitle him to a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure.
we normally review the denial of a rule motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see united states brown,cir citing united states saada,cir.because pavulak predicates his motion for a new trial on his entitlement to a franks hearing,we will directly evaluate the denial of his request for a franks hearing.accord united states rivera,cir taking this approach.he was entitled to such a hearing only if he made a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant knowingly or recklessly included a false statement in or omitted facts from the affidavit,and showed that the false statements or omitted facts were necessary to the finding of probable cause.yusuf,at.like his request for a franks hearing,we need not establish a standard of review because pavulak was not entitled to a franks hearing under any standard.
mack trial testimony was perfectly consistent with the information he provided for the affidavit.at trial,mack testified that pictures of women pavulak met in the philippines not the suspected images of child pornography looked of age.indeed,at trial,mack confirmed that the pornographic images to which he tipped off the police involved really young girls in their early teens.with no inconsistency between mack trial testimony and earlier tip,pavulak can not make the substantial preliminary showing that the information provided in the affidavit was false.and without identifying false information,pavulak was not entitled to a franks hearing and,consequently,to a new trial.
in addition to challenging his convictions,pavulak claims that the constitution required the jury,not the district court,to determine the facts that triggered his mandatory life sentence under e on the conviction.we exercise de novo review over these questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation.united states barbosa,cir citing united states williams,cir.
first,some background section e imposes a mandatory life sentence on a defendant convicted of a federal sex offense in which a minor is the victim if he has a prior sex conviction in which a minor was the victim.the trigger for this section a prior sex conviction in which a child was the victim includes specified federal sex offense s as well as state sex offense s that would be punishable by more than one year in prison and involve conduct that would be a federal sex offense if there were federal jurisdiction.e a b.
thus,determining whether e mandatory life sentence applies to pavulak turns on whether his prior delaware convictions for unlawful sexual contact in the second degree under also constitute a federal sex offense here,aggravated sexual abuse of a child under c.to make that determination,we must start with the formal categorical approach.that inquiry requires a district judge to evaluate whether the elements of the statutory state offense,not the specific facts underlying the defendant prior conviction,would automatically constitute a federal sex offense.jean louis att y of,cir.here,the delaware crime of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree is not necessarily congruous with the federal crime of aggravated sexual abuse of children under c.there are at least two differences 
section c requires the victim to be less than twelve years old,whereas requires the victim to be less than eighteen years old.
section c contains an additional element a requirement that the defendant intentional touching occur with an intent to abuse,humiliate,harass,degrade,or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person that.does not require.compare d defining sexual act to include this requirement,with f defining sexual act without any requirement.
given these differences,the delaware law under which pavulak was previously convicted does not necessarily involve conduct that would be a federal sex offense under the formal categorical approach.see,singh ashcroft,cir reaching the same conclusion in comparing the delaware crime of unlawful sexual contact in the third degree with the federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor because the federal crime required a victim under twelve years old while the delaware crime did not contain an age.consequently,we can not conclude,as a matter of law,that pavulak prior state convictions necessarily constitute a federal sex offense.
our inquiry does not end there the trier of fact might find sufficient facts underl
