a jury convicted lorenzo liburd of violating and attempting to violate a.liburd appeals,arguing that his trial was marred by prosecutorial misconduct which denied him due process of law.we agree,and will vacate the judgment of conviction.
on october,liburd entered cyril king airport on thomas,united states virgin islands,with the intention of boarding a flight to atlanta.he passed through the airport customs and border protection and agricultural checkpoints without incident.at the transportation security administration tsa checkpoint,however,an scan revealed two large organic masses in his bag.tsa officer tamika martin,who was operating the scanner,referred liburd to fellow officer wendell grouby for further inspection.grouby job was to check for large amounts of liquids,weapons,and anything harmful to the plane or passengers.he was not trained to detect narcotics.grouby found two suspicious,rectangular,objects in liburd bag.liburd told him that the bricks were cheese.we will refer to this claim as the cheese statement.cheese was not,for grouby purposes,a prohibited substance,so he left the bricks in the bag and proceeded with his inspection.he also found a white plastic bag containing two bottles of shampoo,which he discarded because they were not allowed on the flight.liburd eventually cleared the checkpoint and proceeded to the waiting area.
while liburd stood in line for his flight,tsa officer josina green approached him for a random inspection.according to green,liburd appeared nervous,avoided eye contact,and would not respond to her initial request to step out of line.green directed him to tsa officer eric brown for inspection.while brown searched liburd bag,liburd uttered something along the lines of,there something in my bag.brown search uncovered two bricks which,combined,contained more than two kilograms of cocaine.liburd was arrested and charged with possession with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine,in violation of a and b b ii ii,and attempted importation of the same,in violation of a and.in discovery,the government disclosed evidence concerning the statement,there something in my bag,but it disclosed nothing about the cheese statement.
liburd moved to suppress both the cocaine and any statements he had made,including the statement,there something in my bag.the district court asked the prosecutor,everard potter,whether the government intended to introduce that statement at trial.potter response was unequivocal 
potter no,your honor.any statement that liburd may have made was made prior to any miranda warnings being given.
the court so you do do intend to rely on that,or present the statement 
potter i do intend to rely on any statement that liburd made.
the court twice confirmed with the parties that liburd statement was off the table,and based on that understanding,declined to rule on that aspect of the motion to suppress.
at trial,liburd argued that he did not know that there were bricks of cocaine in his bag.he theorized that someone a ramp agent observed near the scene of his slipped the bricks into his bag sometime after he cleared the tsa checkpoint.of course,that theory suffered from two major weaknesses.the first was officer martin testimony that the scan at the tsa checkpoint revealed two large organic masses in liburd bag.the second was the fact liburd had acknowledged that there were bricks in his bag,and told officer grouby that they were cheese.both facts undermined liburd contention that there were no bricks in his bag when he passed through the tsa checkpoint.recognizing the first weakness,liburd posited that the masses revealed by the tsa scan were not bricks of cocaine but rather the shampoo bottles that officer grouby discarded.while that theory could not explain the cheese statement,potter had promised not to introduce anything liburd said before his arrest.so long as that promise was kept,the jury would never hear about the cheese statement,and liburd theory remained plausible.
unfortunately,potter wasted no time in breaking his promise.in his opening statement,he noted that liburd told officer grouby that the bricks in his bag were cheese.liburd objected.at sidebar,potter reiterated that he had no intention of introducing anything that liburd said.with the issue apparently laid to rest,the trial proceeded.the next witness was officer grouby,who testified that he found two suspicious rectangular objects in liburd bag and that he determined that those objects were blocks of cheese.potter asked,how did you come to the conclusion that the masses were blocks of cheese over liburd objection,grouby testified that the passenger,liburd told him so.potter pursued the same line of questioning on redirect examination,blatantly prompting grouby to remind the jury about the cheese statement 
okay.why,sir,did you remove the items from the defendant bag 
to the best of my recollection from what i remember,i was led to believe that those two rectangular items were blocks of cheese.
q.who led you to believe that,sir 
a.the passenger.
liburd moved for a mistrial,arguing that potter deliberate elicitation of testimony about the cheese statement unfairly prejudiced his defense.he also faulted the government for not disclosing the cheese statement in discovery.
potter admitted that the cheese statement had not been disclosed,but claimed that he had only learned of it on the eve of trial.when the court reminded him of the promise he made at the suppression hearing,potter responded that his promise not to rely on any statement that liburd made referred only to the statement,there something in my bag.he insisted that it was not meant to exclude every single thing that liburd may have said to an agent at the time that he was at the cyril king airport.the court was skeptical,rightly noting that potter promise at the hearing was pretty sweeping and broad.nevertheless,it declined to grant a mistrial instead,the judge instructed the jury as follows 
during the course of this trial,you have heard certain statements attributed to the defendant regarding cheese in the defendant bag.those statements are improperly before you.you are therefore instructed to disregard any such statements in their entirety.that means,that you may not consider such statements in any form or fashion.
liburd was convicted on both counts and sentenced to months in prison.he raises several arguments on appeal,but his primary argument is that the prosecutor use of the cheese statement was misconduct that this misconduct violated his right to due process and that the district court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial once the cheese statement was introduced 
we exercise jurisdiction under.we review liburd claim that the district court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion.see united states rivas,cir.however,our review of the underlying legal potter conduct deprived liburd of due plenary.united states dees,cir.our analysis proceeds in two stages.first,we must determine whether potter committed misconduct.because we conclude that he did,we will proceed to consider the due process implications of that misconduct.
liburd argues that potter use of the cheese statement at trial was misconduct because it violated his promises not to introduce evidence of anything liburd said at the airport.we agree.potter promise not to rely on any statement liburd made required him do exactly that.instead,he invoked the cheese statement three times once in his opening statement and then twice more in his examination of officer grouby.this was plainly improper.
the government emphasizes that it did not know about the cheese statement at the suppression hearing,and argues that it could hardly have promised not to rely upon evidence of which it was unaware.it maintains that at the suppression hearing,it merely promised not to use the statement,there something in my bag,and points out that it kept that promise.as an initial matter,we reject the premise that a prosecutor could never make a promise governing his future use of evidence.but we note also that the government argument fails even on its own terms.potter promise at the suppression hearing
