on may,miguel,the puerto rico administrator for the administración de instituciones juveniles aij from until may,was indicted on charges of extortion and money laundering.a jury acquitted him of the extortion charge but convicted him of money laundering.after the jury rendered its verdict,moved to set it aside,arguing that the government had not submitted sufficient evidence to support the conviction.the district court denied this motion.on appeal,attacks his conviction on several grounds.after careful consideration,we affirm.
we relay the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states castellini,cir.
during tenure as administrator,the aij published a request for proposal rfp for a contract to build a juvenile penal institution in puerto rico.correctional services corporation csc,a corporation specializing in the process,submitted its proposal for the project at a site in salinas,puerto rico.in november,aij awarded csc the project and on december,the parties entered into a contract to design,develop,and build a juvenile correctional facility in salinas,puerto rico.
in the fall of,asked henoc dávila,a contractor,to recommend a subcontractor for the salinas project.dávila recommended josé cobián,a friend who owned a general contracting company.at request,dávila contacted cobián by telephone to schedule a lunch meeting for,dávila,and cobián to discuss the project.within two to three weeks,cobián,and dávila met at el hipopótamo,a restaurant in río piedras.
according to cobián,arrived at the restaurant with an air of power,escorted by two or three men.during the meeting,explained that csc was planning to build a prison in salinas and that the company needed a contractor for the project.the government introduced testimony that indicated that the contract was not subject to the bidding process,and that when cobián expressed interest in the job,responded by saying,well,it going to cost you.having paid bribes in order to secure contracts in the past,cobián testified that he understood this to mean that he would have to pay money to secure the contract.he further testified that had he not paid nearly,he would have been denied the opportunity to work on the salinas project.
although cobián agreed to pay,he explained that his business did not operate in cash.cobián testified that in response,said,do worry,i take care of that,and that at a later meeting,asked cobián to pay him for the contract.
according to cobián,devised a scheme whereby payment would be made through repairs services,a company owned by father,miguel.under the scheme,would submit fraudulent invoices to ingenieros proyectistas,a company owned by fernando vigil,cobián friend.because vigil owed cobián money,he agreed to pay the invoices to repay that debt.
the government introduced evidence that vigil made the payments without ever meeting or his father,that vigil never asked what the invoices were for,and that none of vigil equipment was ever repaired by.at trial,admitted that his company never repaired equipment belonging to ingenieros proyectistas and that he did not know vigil.also testified that he prepared fake invoices because his son asked him to prepare them.
and cobián met again several times to exchange fraudulent invoices for payments.during one of their meetings,cobián gave a check for prepared by vigil from ingenieros proyectistas,dated december.that check was purportedly intended to cover two invoices for equipment repair work,one dated august,for,and another dated september,for.the check was deposited in bank account at rg premier bank.after this first payment,csc and cobián construction company,cobián,agustín ramos,entered into a contract to build the salinas juvenile institution.
in march,three additional invoices totaling were submitted to ingenieros proyectistas,one for,another for,and the last for.as before,ingenieros proyectistas issued a check for to in payment for the fraudulent invoices.combined with the first payment,the total amount paid by cobián to,through vigil,was approximately.the government introduced evidence that,father,gradually transferred the monies to,which were used to purchase a luxury vehicle,make a down payment on a new house,and make home improvements.
the government also introduced evidence that never reported any income from the near received from cobián,or made mention of any business arrangements with cobián in the financial report he was required to submit to the aij ethics committee.also ignored a request by the ethics committee for more information about his finances,including the provenance of the money he used for the down payment on his house.
all told,cobián company received three contracts with csc,totaling approximately million.after working on the salinas project,cobián worked on various remodeling projects in bayamón,which he admitted to having obtained after bribing csc representative,ramón horta 
on may,a grand jury returned a indictment against count one charged that unlawfully obtained by extortion,under color of official right,approximately from cobián,in violation of the hobbs act,count two charged with money laundering,in violation of.
the case went to trial.after nearly two days of deliberations,the jury returned a not guilty verdict on the extortion count and a guilty verdict on the count.
after the verdict was announced,moved orally for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,arguing that the jury verdict was inconsistent.the court requested the motion be made in writing,and on september,filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict on the charge.the government filed an opposition to the motion on september,and on october,the district court denied motion.on january,was fined and sentenced to a term of imprisonment,followed by a term of supervised release.
ii.discussion 
appeals his conviction on four grounds.first,he argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to support the conviction.second,contends that the government engaged in at least three instances of prosecutorial misconduct that prejudiced him at trial.third,he argues that the district court erroneously excluded testimony that would have justified his use of fraudulent invoices.and finally,argues that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on specific elements of money laundering for a second time.we discuss each of these claims in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence 
first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of money laundering.on challenges to sufficiency of the evidence,we take all the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict and ask whether a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.castellini,at citing jackson virginia,d.
to sustain the conviction under a,the government must show that knowingly engaged or attempted to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than,and derived from specified unlawful activity.however,i n a prosecution for an offense under this section,the government is not required to prove the defendant knew that the offense from which the criminally derived property was derived was specified unlawful activity.id.c.
argues that the government failed to prove that the laundered money derived from specified unlawful activity,in this case,extortion under the color of official right.contends that the only evidence introduced in support of extortion was the inconsistent,inherent ly unrealiable,and insufficien t testimony of two cooperating witnesses.appellant br.points out that the jury acquitted him of the extortion charge,and argues that although that acquittal does not automatically bar the conviction,it serves as evidence that the government failed to prove that the laundered money derived from specified unlawful activity beyond a reasonable doubt.
the main problem with argument is that it does not actually test the sufficiency of the evidence the government introduced in support of the extortion charge.first argument that the government evidence was insufficient because it was not credible is essentially irrelevant on appeal.in reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim,we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see castellini,at.thus,as long as there was sufficient admissible evidence to support all of the elements of the crime charged,we will affirm the conviction.
the second argument advances is equally unhelpful.this circuit has specifically upheld convictions in cases where there is an actual acquittal of the underlying predicate offense.for example,in united states richard,we noted that the fact that the jury did not convict the defendant on the relevant underlying charges does not undermine the convictions.the only relevant question when reconciling inconsistent verdicts is whether there was enough evidence presented to support the conviction,cir quoting united states whatley,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted accord united states acosta,cir a jury in a criminal case is not obliged to be consistent in its verdicts on virtually the same evidence the jury may acquit on one count and convict on the other.citing united states powell,d 
we think the government introduced sufficient evidence to support the jury conclusion that the laundered money was obtained through extortion.to establish extortion under color of official right under,the government must show that the defendant,a public official,has received a payment that he was not entitled to receive,with knowledge that the payment was tendered in exchange for some official act.evans united states,d united states,cir.
to that end,the government presented testimony that was the administrator of the aij,a public office,at the time he received money from cobián.with respect to the receipt of payment to which he was not entitled,the government introduced testimonial and documentary evidence that cobián paid close to to secure the contract with csc through the exchange of fraudulent invoices for payment.finally,the government introduced evidence that knew that the payment was tendered in exchange for some official act in the form of testimony that met with cobián to discuss the subcontract for the salinas project,and that in response to cobián interest in working on the project,responded,it going to cost you.the government also submitted evidence that based on cobián past experience working with public officials in puerto rico,the statement meant he would have to pay to get the contract.moreover,there was testimonial and documentary evidence that in an effort to cover up the payments,devised a scheme to filter the funds though his father company using fraudulent invoices,and that over the course of many months,prepared false invoices on behalf of to be submitted to ingenieros proyectistas at request.there was also evidence that excluded the receipt of that money from the aij ethics report.taken as a whole,this evidence suffices to support the jury conclusion that,a public official,received payments that he was not entitled to receive,with knowledge that the payment was tendered in exchange for some official act.see united states,cir since a plausible view of the evidence supports a finding that the appellant accepted the money in exchange for official acts,the proposition that the government failed to establish extortion under color of official right necessarily fails.
prosecutorial misconduct 
also argues that the district court should have dismissed the case or granted a mistrial based on three instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct the government comment on decision not to testify,the government failure to provide the defense with statements by the cooperating witnesses,and a prosecutor meeting with dávila and cobián both cooperating witnesses,in which she actively participat ed in a suggestive,improper manner in the discussion,refreshing their testimony so they could correct their conflicting version of the events as to.
fifth amendment violation 
first argues that the government violated his rights under the fifth amendment by commenting on his option to testify in an objection to defense counsel opening statement.we set forth the relevant exchange 
defense counsel now,who is my client,miguel,what will the evidence show about my client my client was born and raised in puerto rico.he graduated from high school in puerto rico at the age of.from there he went to the university,graduated with a degree in political science at twenty years of age.from there,he went to obtain a master degree in criminal justice,and he obtained that at the age of.
prosecutor your honor,may i object unless the defendant is going to testify 
argues that the prosecutor comment,unless the defendant is going to testify,violated his fifth amendment right to remain silent because it called attention to the defendant decision not to testify.we review de novo whether a prosecutor comment violated the fifth amendment privilege against,united states sullivan,cir.
a prosecutor comment is improper where,under the circumstances of the case,the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.united states hardy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we find that the prosecutor comment in this case did not violate right against under the fifth amendment mainly because we do not think the jury understood the objection to be a comment on failure to testify.
in united states sullivan,at,the defendant argued that a mistrial should have been granted after the prosecutor commented during his opening statement that the jury would meet the two defendants because the statement was an improper comment on his right not to testify.on appeal,we held that the prosecutor did not violate the defendant fifth amendment right against because,i n context,the prosecutor word choice did not naturally and necessarily comment on the defendants privilege against.id.at.
similarly in this case,we find that,in context,the prosecutor comment,unless the defendant is going to testify,did not violate fifth amendment right by impermissibly calling attention to his option not to testify.given that it immediately followed an objection,it is clear that the statement was intended to qualify the objection,rather than to comment on the defendant failure to testify.in fact,at the stage of the proceedings in which the comment was jury had no information as to whether would testify.as such,we find that the comment was at most a glancing brush rather than a blow against the privilege.united states procopio,cir.
brady violation 
further argues that the government delay in providing certain routinely used by the fbi to memorialize interviews of potential its refusal to provide other requested discovery violated his right to due process.see brady maryland,d holding that the prosecution violates due process when it suppresses material evidence favorable to the accused see also giglio united states,d concluding that the nondisclosure of certain impeachment information falls within the brady rubric.contends that because the government relied heavily on the testimony of cooperating witnesses,the lack of information about those witnesses impaired his ability to them effectively.we review the district court determination of whether the government failed to provide brady material for abuse of discretion.united states perkins,cir.
brady requires the government to disclose any exculpatory evidence which is material either to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.information is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,t here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case,and brady did not create one.weatherford bursey,d.instead,to establish a violation of brady,a defendant must provide the court with some indication that the information to which he needs access contain s material and potentially exculpatory evidence.united states brandon,cir.on appeal,has made no attempt to describe the information he sought from the government,much less explain its materiality or its potential to exculpate him.
furthermore,argument fails because he has not established prejudice.when brady or giglio information surfaces belatedly,the critical inquiry is not why disclosure was delayed but whether the tardiness prevented defense counsel from employing the material to good effect.united states devin,cir.although argues that his ability to mount an effective was impaired,he does not show how his defense was impaired.see id.a defendant who claims that his hand was prematurely forced by delayed disclosure can not rely on wholly conclusory assertions but must bear the burden of producing,at the very least,a prima facie showing of a plausible strategic option which the delay foreclosed.as such,we find that has failed to establish a brady violation.
improper coaching 
during dávila,he testified that immediately after he appeared before the grand jury on april,he met with assistant united states attorney ausa rebecca kellogg to discuss his testimony.his attorney,fbi agent brenda díaz,and cobián were also present.at the meeting,they discussed the payments made by cobián to.apparently cobián said that he had given a cash payment in an envelope at the restaurant el hipopótamo.dávila disagreed and told cobián that he did not see him give an envelope filled with cash at the restaurant.cobián responded that he had given in cash in bills,and dávila pointed out that in bills is bills,which would not fit in an envelope.dávila testified that at that point,his lawyer said that if the money was given at the el hipopótamo,it had to have been given in glad plastic bags.then,ausa kellogg intervened and allegedly told cobián and dávila that they both had a light memory and that the money was paid by check.dávila testified that she showed the checks to cobián.after the meeting,cobián testified before the grand jury that he never paid in cash,only checks.
argues that i t was highly improper for the prosecutor to set up a meeting with two cooperating witnesses at the same time,in order to discuss their testimony and refresh their recollections so that conflicting statements would be avoided.appellant br.
it is unsurprising that does not cite any case law in support of the argument that this meeting was so improper as to warrant a new trial.prosecutors and defense attorneys alike are entitled to prepare their witnesses.moreover,the allegedly coached testimony,which related only to the form of payment cash or check,is not central to the government case.admits to having received the and contests only what it paid for his defense does not depend on cobián form of payment.as such,even assuming that the meeting between the ausa and the cooperating witnesses was improper,it was not prejudicial because it did not so poison the well as to have likely affected the trial outcome.united states mooney,cir internal quotation marks omitted 
hearsay evidence 
also attacks his conviction on the ground that the district court erred in excluding evidence justifying his use of the fraudulent invoices.he argues that the district court should have allowed his statement to that he was providing consulting services to cobián,but since he was still a public official and could not hold other employment,payment would be effected through.appellant br.at trial,the government objected to that testimony,arguing that it was hearsay.the district court sustained the objection,finding that the testimony was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.after moved for reconsideration,the district court again denied the request,finding that the statement did not qualify under any exception to the hearsay rule.
the federal rules of evidence provide that an statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted commonly known as hearsay is inadmissible as evidence.see.however,this rule is subject to a series of exceptions.argues that the evidence should have been admitted under one of two exceptions as a statement of state of mind,under,or as a statement,under.d e.
state of mind exception 
rule authorizes the introduction into evidence of statements that concern the declarant then existing state of mind such as intent,plan,motive,design,mental feeling but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.
at trial,sought to introduce the statement justifying his request for false invoices as an alternative explanation for his agreement with cobián to exchange for services.however,the district court excluded the evidence as hearsay,finding that the statement did not qualify under the exception because the circumstances under which it was made were highly suspicious.
because disputes over whether particular statements come within a exception are fact sensitive,see united states cianci,cir,the trial court is in the best position to resolve them,colasanto life ins.of,cir.we will therefore find error in the district court exclusion of evidence only if the district court has abused its discretion.see united states,cir.
to be admissible under the exception,a declaration must mirror a state of mind,which,in light of all the circumstances,including proximity in time,is reasonably likely to have been the same condition existing at the material time.colasanto,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also horton allen,cir the premise for admitting hearsay statements evidencing is that such statements are reliable because of their spontaneity and the resulting probable sincerity.internal quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original.indeed,the advisory committee notes to rule require a substantial contemporaneity of event and statement when admitting an statement under the exception.advisory committee note emphasis added.advisory committee note rule is essentially a specialized application of rule,presented separately to enhance its usefulness and accessibility.this contemporaneity requirement is imposed to diminish the likelihood of fabrication or deliberate misrepresentation.see.advisory committee note.
given this contemporaneity requirement,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the exception did not apply to justification for his need of fraudulent invoices.in order to satisfy rule,statement must have been made contemporaneously with his demand to cobián for the,thereby mirroring state of mind at that time but evidence in the record confirms that statement to his father occurred well after his demand to cobián for the money.as such,the district court could have reasonably concluded that the statement was untrustworthy,and therefore unreliable,because had enough time to fabricate and misrepresent his statement.see united states naiden,cir excluding defendant statement to a friend that he did not believe his online victim was really fourteen because the statement was made a day after the defendant met the victim and it was therefore not made as an immediate reaction to his communication with her,but after he had had ample opportunity to reflect on the situation united states macey,cir excluding a statement justifying defendant request for fraudulent invoices in part because t he district court could have reasonably concluded that the defendant had time to fabricate a story in the four hours between his fraud and his statement to the employee.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the exception inapplicable to statement to his father.
