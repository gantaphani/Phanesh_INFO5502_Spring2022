this appeal presents two significant issues whether statements,made by a at his plea allocution,that arguably exculpate the defendant are admissible at the defendant trial and whether a jury determination as to the quantity of cocaine attributable to the defendant conspiracy was supported by the trial evidence.
after a trial in the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,a jury found defendant charles jackson guilty of conspiring to import kilograms or more of cocaine into the united states.although the district court denied jackson motion for acquittal as to the conspiracy,it did grant jackson motion for acquittal as to the jury drug quantity determination.the court concluded that jackson was guilty of the offense of conspiracy to import between grams and kilograms of cocaine.
jackson challenges his conviction on evidentiary grounds.he contends that the court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the entire plea allocution of steve brown.the government the district court grant of jackson motion of acquittal on drug quantity,contending that a reasonable jury could easily have found that jackson conspiracy involved at least kilograms of cocaine.
we find jackson evidentiary challenge meritless.we also conclude that the district court erred in granting jackson rule motion because there was more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that jackson conspired to import or more kilograms of cocaine.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of jackson rule motion and remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the jury verdict.
background 
jackson,steve brown,and sincerray gina sullivan were charged in a superseding indictment with one count of conspiracy to import or more kilograms of cocaine into the united states between october and march,in violation of a,b b.brown and sullivan ultimately pled guilty to this charge,as did several other in a series of separate cases.
i.the government case 
the proof at trial established that brown and lionel guthrie ran an organization that hired couriers from rochester,new york to smuggle cocaine from jamaica into the united states.the government called four to prove the existence of the conspiracy and to describe jackson role as a drug courier.lewis snowden,shatrina jackson a distant relative of the defendant,lakisha sinkler,and sullivan explained how the smuggling operation worked brown provided his couriers with round trips to jamaica.before leaving jamaica,the couriers were given pellets of cocaine,which they swallowed or hid on their persons.back in rochester,the couriers were paid for their efforts based on how much cocaine they imported,typically from to kilogram.
the testimony of lakisha sinkler was the most extensive.sinkler,jackson longtime girlfriend and the mother of one of his children,testified that she went on two smuggling trips to jamaica with jackson,as well as four smuggling trips on her own.these trips were coordinated and financed by brown.sinkler made her first smuggling trip in october.brown promised sinkler that she would be paid for importing half a kilogram of cocaine and for a whole kilogram.sinkler flew to jamaica,ingested cocaine tablets that she got from brown,and was paid upon her return.
two months later,jackson accompanied sinkler on her second smuggling trip to jamaica.jackson agreed to join her on this trip after discussing with her and brown how much cocaine jackson would be asked to import and the money he could expect for his efforts.prior to her second trip,sinkler and jackson obtained their birth certificates together in rochester and brown gave them spending money and plane tickets to jamaica.sinkler and jackson then flew to jamaica,stayed at the same hotel for a week and,on the night before their departure,swallowed the cocaine pellets they were given.sinkler estimated that jackson swallowed over cocaine pellets.sinkler herself ingested about pellets and carried the remaining pellets in her undergarments.when they landed in rochester,they were picked up at the airport by brown and his girlfriend,gina sullivan.they went to sinkler house,took laxatives,and passed the cocaine pellets.the following day,sinkler was paid between and,while jackson received for his efforts.
jackson took his second smuggling trip to jamaica two months later.according to sinkler,jackson went on this february smuggling trip alone because brown wanted only a kilogram of cocaine and did not want to spend the money on trips for two.having stayed in jamaica for a few days,jackson returned to rochester where brown met him at the airport.brown dropped jackson off at sinkler house.there jackson passed over cocaine pellets.sinkler best recollection was that brown paid jackson for this trip.
sinkler took her third smuggling trip to jamaica in may,this time going alone.brown paid her between and to smuggle slightly less than half a kilogram of cocaine.
according to sinkler,she and jackson took their second joint smuggling trip in august.as with their december trip,brown provided the plane tickets and spending money in advance.they stayed at the same hotel while in jamaica,swallowed and hid cocaine on their persons,and flew back to rochester together.on their return flight,jackson encountered shatrina jackson along with her smuggling companion,kyshea talbert.during a short discussion with shatrina,jackson learned that shatrina and talbert were also in the process of smuggling cocaine from jamaica on behalf of both brown and lionel guthrie.once back in rochester,sinkler was paid about,and jackson was paid.
sinkler also testified that,at some point in,jackson became dissatisfied with the money they were getting for their smuggling efforts.he told her that they should ask for more money because the key and a half of cocaine they were smuggling on each trip had a street value of about.
jackson agreed to go on another smuggling trip to jamaica with sinkler in november.as with the earlier trips,brown provided sinkler and jackson with plane tickets and spending money.the very night before they were set to leave,however,jackson told sinkler that he could not make the trip because another woman was giving birth to his child.sinkler ultimately went on this scheduled trip to jamaica alone.upon her return to rochester,brown paid her for smuggling cocaine in her undergarments.
gina sullivan corroborated sinkler version of all these events.sullivan testified that she was present when jackson met with brown the night before jackson was scheduled to leave and heard jackson tell brown that he would have to postpone his scheduled trip for one week.when brown later told guthrie about jackson change in plans,guthrie was disappointed,stating that jackson was like a dump truck because he could bring a kilogram of cocaine back from jamaica at one time.
jackson eventually rescheduled his own trip to jamaica for sometime in december.the night before he was scheduled to leave,however,he again suffered cold feet.he balked because of bad feelings about the trip,and offered to repay brown the money he had already spent.jackson later reneged,telling sullivan that brown would just have to take it as a loss.jackson later had sinkler return jackson unused plane tickets to brown.
some few months later,jackson told sinkler that he had made his last smuggling trip.sinkler,however,accepted another smuggling assignment in march.on her into the united states,she was arrested by customs and was found to possess grams of cocaine.she began cooperating with investigators immediately and ultimately pled guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government.
like sinkler,shatrina and her smuggling companion,kyshea talbert,were apprehended by customs in december following a trip to jamaica.they possessed about kilograms and grams of cocaine,respectively.shatrina,too,pled guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government.
besides the testimony of the,the government elicited testimony from veteran customs inspector william walker regarding narcotics smuggling.walker testified that couriers such as jackson are capable of ingesting a full kilogram of narcotics at a time.
the government put into evidence about kilograms of the cocaine it had seized from sinkler,shatrina,and other couriers during the course of the conspiracy.in addition,the government put into evidence customs,travel agency,bank and other documentary records relating to the series of smuggling trips taken by sinkler and jackson.
at the close of the government case,jackson moved pursuant to rule for a judgment of acquittal.the district court denied the motion as to the conspiracy charge,but reserved decision on the pivotal issue of drug quantity.
ii.jackson defense 
jackson made an effort to admit steve brown entire plea colloquy under federal rules of evidence b b based on brown unavailability to testify.the government indicated that it would not oppose jackson application under.b if the colloquy was limited to those portions that were of brown.defense counsel,however,sought to admit the entire plea colloquy,particularly those portions that appeared to exculpate jackson in addition to brown.the district court denied jackson application.
iii.the jury verdict 
after both sides rested,the district court instructed the jury on the elements of the charge.with respect to drug quantity,the court instructed the jury that jackson was responsible for the quantity of drugs that he himself conspired to import plus the amount of drugs that other conspirators conspired to import if jackson knew of the importation or could reasonably foresee that other were conspiring to import certain quantities of cocaine 
jackson only responsible for the amount of drugs for which he knew or reasonably should have known about.it must have been known or reasonably foreseeable to him that his would import drugs and a certain quantity of drugs.in considering and answering that question,you may consider the amount of drugs jackson imported when this conspiracy began,when he became a member of it,what he did,whether he knew all the other,and whether he knew about the drugs that were imported by other,and were other drugs that were involved,were they in furtherance of the conspiracy.
at the conclusion of its instructions to the jury,the district court gave the jury a series of offenses which varied from the charge in the indictment only with respect to the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.the jury,apparently crediting the testimony of the,returned a guilty verdict on the top count conspiracy to import or more kilograms of cocaine.this quantity is vigorously contested on appeal.
iv.jackson rule motion for acquittal 
after trial,the district court invited submissions from the parties on jackson pending rule motion for acquittal on the issue of how much cocaine was attributable to him.jackson argued that the evidence failed to support the jury finding that he conspired to import or more kilograms of cocaine.the government,on the other hand,contended that a rational juror could easily have found that jackson conspired to import or more kilograms of cocaine.
the controversy over drug quantity was hardly academic.under statute,jackson faced a mandatory minimum of years imprisonment since the jury found his conspiracy involved or more kilograms of cocaine.see b b.if the amount of cocaine attributable to jackson were less than kilograms,however,his statutory mandatory minimum was only years imprisonment.see b b.
after oral argument,the district court granted jackson rule motion,concluding that a reasonable juror could find that,at most,jackson conspired to import only between and kilograms of cocaine.therefore,the court threw out jackson conviction and instead found jackson guilty of the charge of conspiring to import between grams and kilograms of cocaine.
in arriving at this decision,the court reasoned that sinkler testimony about the cocaine that jackson himself smuggled was speculative and imprecise.the court further noted that the evidence did not support the finding that jackson was aware of all of the trips that sinkler and shatrina had taken,let alone the quantity of cocaine that they brought in.therefore,in the face of what it termed the estimation or opinion and imprecise calculation s of witnesses who were not scientists or mathematicians,the court concluded that the proof at trial was too speculative to sustain the jury verdict.
after rejecting jackson motion for a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances,the court sentenced jackson to months imprisonment and a year term of supervised release.
this appeal ensued.
discussion 
i.the exclusion of brown plea allocution statements 
on appeal,jackson contends that the district court improperly excluded brown plea allocution at trial.specifically,jackson challenges the exclusion of brown statement that brown never supervised jackson.he argues that brown plea allocution should have been admitted under one of the following exceptions to the hearsay rule former testimony statements against penal interest or the residual hearsay exception.none of these contentions has merit.
brown plea allocution 
it is not without significance that brown plea allocution was internally inconsistent as to the relationship between brown and jackson during the conspiracy.brown signed plea agreement expressly stated that brown managed and supervised various couriers,including jackson.at his oral plea allocution,the district court asked brown whether this statement from his plea agreement was true brown responded that it was indeed true.the district court then specifically asked brown whether he had any arrangements with jackson to bring drugs into the country.again,brown said yes.
to be sure,later in his plea allocution,brown claimed that he never supervised jackson or requested that jackson go to jamaica.when asked to clarify his relationship with jackson in light of his previous minutes earlier and in his written plea he had indeed supervised jackson during the conspiracy,brown waffled once again.brown now claimed that jackson smuggled cocaine only for guthrie.brown later conceded,however,that guthrie was the overall director of the smuggling operation and that he worked together with guthrie and others.
standard of review 
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see,united states yousef,cir per curiam.the district court has broad discretion regarding the admission of evidence,and the court evidentiary determinations will be reversed only if they are manifestly erroneous.united states skw metals alloys,cir.generally,we will not overturn a district court evidentiary rulings unless the court acted arbitrarily or irrationally.id.at quoting united states blanco,cir.
former testimony 
under rule b,an unavailable witness testimony from a prior hearing or proceeding is not barred by the hearsay rule 
if the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct,cross,or redirect examination.
b.this requirement operates to screen out those statements,which although made under oath,were not subject to the scrutiny of a party interested in thoroughly testing their validity.united states pizarro,cir.
here,both sides concede that brown was unavailable at jackson trial because he had properly invoked his fifth amendment right against.see,united states dolah,cir it is settled in this circuit that a witness who invokes the privilege against is unavailable within the meaning of rule b therefore,the core issue we must address is whether the government had an opportunity and similar motive to examine brown at his plea allocution.although we have not had occasion to address this issue,two of our sister circuits have found that the government has neither the opportunity nor a similar motive to examine a defendant at a plea allocution as it has at trial.see united states powell,cir united states lowell,cir.
although jackson concedes in his reply brief that o pportunity and motive to examine the declarant at a plea allocution may not technically be the same as at a trial,he nevertheless contends that the government did have the requisite opportunity and motive here.jackson attributes great weight to the fact that the government was permitted to ask brown one question during brown plea allocution regarding brown supervisory role over jackson.jackson attempt to equate the government function and motives during a plea allocution with those at trial reflects a misguided view of the nature and purpose of plea proceedings.
opportunity 
under,the purpose of a plea proceeding is to ensure that the defendant plea is knowing,voluntary,and grounded on a proper factual basis.see.b mitchell united states,d.under the rule,a plea proceeding is conducted solely by the district court judge who is primarily responsible for ensuring that the requirements of rule are satisfied.on the rare occasion where the prosecutor is permitted to address the defendant,the questions posed are usually formulaic and perfunctory.the government role at a plea proceeding is quite limited,and certainly does not include the opportunity to engage in the type of examination contemplated by rule b.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence a,at joseph mclaughlin,ed.if the opportunity to is lacking,the prior testimony must be excluded.as judge larimer wisely noted,if the rule were otherwise,plea colloquies would consume pages of examination exploring the minutiae of the defendant conduct.
similar motive 
nor does the government have a similar motive to examine a defendant at a plea allocution as it has at trial.we have held that the proper inquiry in assessing similarity of motive under rule b is to determine whether the party resisting the offered testimony at a pending proceeding had at a prior proceeding an interest of substantially similar intensity to prove or disprove the same side of a substantially similar issue.united states dinapoli,cir en banc.moreover,i f a fact is critical to a cause of action at a second proceeding but the same fact was only peripherally related to a different cause of action at a first proceeding,no one would claim that the questioner had a similar motive at both proceedings to show that the fact had been established or disproved.id.at.
we agree with the third and seventh circuits that the government does not have the same motive to examine the defendant at a plea hearing as it does at other proceedings.see united states lowell,cir united states powell,cir.here,the government had no reason to brown at his plea allocution about his supervision over jackson.that brown plea colloquy may have included misstatements or inaccuracies did not preclude it from providing an adequate factual basis for the plea.see lowell,at denial of receipt of payment from defendant,even if it were untrue,did not deprive his plea of guilty on the conspiracy charge of a factual basis.the district court,therefore,did not abuse its discretion in excluding brown plea allocution under rule b.
statement against penal interest 
jackson contention that brown plea allocution might be admissible under rule b is a stronger argument,but it too is ultimately without merit.
rule b allows the admission of a hearsay statement by an unavailable witness if that statement 
at the time of its making so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.
b.this exception rests on the notion that reasonable people,even reasonable people who are not especially honest,tend not to make statements unless they believe them to be true.williamson united states,d.
rule b further requires that,if the statement exposes the declarant brown to criminal liability and is offered to exculpate the accused jackson,the proponent of the statements must identify corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.id.at.the purpose of this corroboration requirement is to circumvent fabrication by the declarant.see.b advisory committee notes.to effectuate this purpose,we require corroboration of both the declarant trustworthiness as well as the statement trustworthiness.united states bahadar,cir emphasis in original.
although we have recognized that statements from a guilty plea allocution can be admitted under rule b,see,united states gallego,cir portions of plea properly admitted solely to establish a conspiracy,their admission is strictly circumscribed by the supreme court holding in williamson united states,supra.in williamson,the supreme court found that rule b does not allow admission of statements,even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally.at.in williamson wake,we have repeatedly emphasized that each particular hearsay statement offered under rule b must be separately parsed and must,itself,be.see,united states tropeano,cir united states sasso,cir.
here,jackson can not satisfy rule b.most significantly,the statements by brown that jackson sought to introduce at trial were not themselves as to brown.they did not,therefore,satisfy williamson.brown statements that he never supervised jackson and never asked jackson to go to jamaica to smuggle drugs did not in any way inculpate brown or expose him to criminal liability.accordingly,the separate guarantee of trustworthiness required by rule b is as to these statements.if anything,these statements were probably exculpatory as to brown as they minimized the number of people that he supervised during the conspiracy.
moreover,even if brown statements could be construed as,jackson has failed to satisfy the corroboration requirement of rule b.there is no question that during his plea allocution brown made conflicting assertions about jackson role in the conspiracy.for example,brown first asserted that jackson was a person with whom he had arrangements to smuggle drugs into the country.at another point,however,brown claimed that jackson smuggled cocaine into the country only for guthrie.these inconsistencies would properly make any district judge suspicious of the statement s reliability.bahadar,at.
finally,as judge larimer observed,brown own motives for making the statements exculpating jackson were highly suspect.because brown was aware at the time of his plea that there was a possibility that he could be called upon to testify at jackson trial he was on the government witness list,the district court sagely noted that brown apparent attempt to exculpate jackson may well have been an effort to avoid testifying against one of his.
accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to admit brown plea allocution statements under the rule b exception to the hearsay rule.
residual exception 
jackson final evidentiary contention,that brown plea allocution satisfies the residual exception to the hearsay rule,requires little discussion.rule provides that statements not covered by rule or but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness are not excluded by the hearsay rule if they meet certain requirements.here,because brown plea allocution statements lacked corroborating circumstances indicating their trustworthiness under rule b,the statements clearly lack equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness required under rule.see id.
ii.jackson rule motion quantity of drugs 
on,the government seeks to reverse the district court partial granting of jackson rule motion.the government focuses on the evidence regarding the specific cocaine that jackson himself conspired to import sinkler conspired to import on her smuggling trips to jamaica with jackson and sinkler and other of whom jackson had knowledge and could reasonably foresee would import cocaine.the government maintains that this evidence provided a basis for a rational jury to conclude that jackson conspired to import cumulatively or more kilograms of cocaine.thus,the government contends the district court erred by setting aside the jury verdict that defendant was responsible for importing or more kilograms of cocaine.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a rule motion based on a finding that the trial evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict.united states guadagna,cir.on appeal,we apply the same standard as the district court applied in its review of the evidence.
