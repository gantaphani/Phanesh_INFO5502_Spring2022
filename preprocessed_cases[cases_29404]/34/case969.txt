defendant horatio hamilton appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,convicting him,after a jury trial,of conspiracy to distribute,and possess with intent to distribute,more than kilograms of marijuana,in violation of.hamilton was sentenced to years imprisonment,ten years supervised release,and the forfeiture of plus any interest in a house associated with the conspiracy.he challenges the conviction on five grounds.he contends that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from a house in which he claimed a privacy interest on the ground that he lacked standing in receiving hearsay testimony in receiving expert opinion testimony without establishing the qualifications of the expert in instructing the jury on accomplice testimony without sufficient explanation of the witness interest and motive to testify falsely and in placing the burden of showing withdrawal from a conspiracy on the defendant.while we reject most of the defendant claims,we agree that the court could not properly deny the suppression motion on the grounds given without conducting a hearing.we remand for further proceedings.
background 
i.the evidence 
the evidence presented at hamilton trial,seen in the light most favorable to the government,see jackson virginia,d,showed the following.
hamilton arrest 
on october,the los angeles police department arrested hamilton and another man at los angeles international airport with pounds about kilograms of marijuana.hamilton and his partner had brought the drugs to the continental airlines cargo facility for shipment to newark,new jersey.the marijuana was wrapped in plastic and packed into cardboard boxes marked apel electronics.at the time of his arrest,hamilton was carrying the business card of steve garrigan,an employee of box brothers in redondo beach,california.he was also carrying a key card for the le parc suites hotel.at the time,hamilton was using an alias tony dumars and was carrying an ohio driver license in that name.

following his arrest,hamilton was charged under the name of tony dumars for possession of the seized marijuana.on november,he was released on bail.a warrant was issued for his arrest when he failed to appear in court as ordered on march.on april,hamilton acquired a new driver license from the state of florida,this time under the name romie robertson.
hamilton drug trafficking subsequent to the arrest 
denise pinnock,an accomplice witness,testified that hamilton continued to engage in drug trafficking after his arrest in october.pinnock knew hamilton because hamilton was a partner in the marijuana business of pinnock boyfriend,duwayne john.pinnock met hamilton,whom she knew by the alias romie,in or at the los angeles house of a man named ade.pinnock explained that hamilton packaged marijuana in ade house for shipment to the east coast.
pinnock role in the conspiracy was to operate stash houses in the bronx where marijuana was stored and distributed in smaller quantities to customers.she explained that the marijuana was shipped from los angeles to newark and then driven in vans to various locations in the bronx.pinnock testified that she saw hamilton at one of the bronx stash houses four or five times after she moved there in.on one occasion,hamilton was present when a shipment of marijuana came in on another,he gave pinnock three pounds of marijuana to sell on her birthday.once,she saw hamilton pay duwayne john brother irky in the basement of one of the stash houses after irky helped unload a shipment.
on at least two occasions subsequent to hamilton arrest in october,pinnock observed hamilton involvement in receiving drug proceeds sent back to the west coast.pinnock herself delivered the cash to the le parc suites hotel in los angeles three or four times.on one occasion,pinnock saw hamilton when he came to le parc suites to meet duwayne john the morning after pinnock gave john the money.on another occasion,john called pinnock to find what room she was staying in,and pinnock could hear john relaying the information to hamilton on a separate phone.
c.the search of the toquet house 
on january,police officers from the city of burbank in los angeles working on a drug interdiction task force came across a suspicious package at the federal express sorting facilities in the san fernando valley,california.the package was addressed to a mandy cook at toquet drive the toquet house in encino,california,a suburb of los angeles.the police called the contact number listed for mandy cook on the shipping label and reached the le parc suites hotel,but no person with the name mandy cook could be reached.
the officers decided to conduct a controlled delivery of the package.the toquet house was located on a in an upscale neighborhood.when the police arrived,they found five men standing in the driveway,one of whom was hamilton,still using the name romie robertson.one of the police officers identified himself and asked the men if they knew who lived in the house.the men stated that they did not live in the house and did not know who did,but one of them told the officers that a shane johnson owned the house.one of the men provided shane johnson phone number.the police did not find anyone named mandy cook,the addressee of the fedex package at the house.
the officers asked if there was anyone else inside the house,and received a response that someone named slick was inside.the officers noticed that multiple doors to the house were open,including a sliding glass door.they called out to slick and,upon receiving no response,entered the house.the officers came upon a man lying in bed in one of the bedrooms.he identified himself as mark handsom but later stated his true name was raymond foster.foster consented to have the officers search the house.the search turned up three loaded firearms and approximately nine pounds of marijuana,as well as a pile of empty cardboard boxes,packing materials,ten to fifteen jars of petroleum jelly large plastic tubs that smelled of marijuana,and a photo identification in the name of mark hibbert.the house had four bedrooms and was sparsely furnished,with a bed in three of the four bedrooms,and a couch,pool table,and tv in the living room.
while the police were conducting the search,a second package was delivered by ups.it was addressed to an allison ramsey and bore the same addressee phone number as was listed for mandy cook on the fedex package.the package had been sent from a suburb of atlanta,georgia.the men said that they were expecting neither the fedex nor the ups package.detective david kleinfeld later obtained a search warrant for both packages,and found cash in one and in the other.the reactions of trained dogs to the smell of the currency was interpreted by the dog handlers as identifying the smell of narcotics.
after the ups package arrived,two other men approached in a green hummer,but quickly tried to drive off when they spotted the police in the.the police stopped the vehicle and identified the driver as ade adeoye,the man pinnock had identified as the owner of the house where she first met hamilton.the police searched the vehicle but did not find any contraband.
the toquet house was registered at the time of the search to shane johnson,who was hamilton girlfriend and the mother of his child.
hamilton arrest in 
in mid to late,dea special agent eric baldus attempted to locate hamilton by checking hamilton criminal history and inquiring among informants.he testified that he received information that hamilton was living with his girlfriend shane on toquet street.tr.using a dea database,baldus later learned of the january search of the toquet house,and discovered that someone named romie robertson who fit the description of hamilton had been detained at the scene.in late,baldus obtained a photo of romie robertson from the florida department of motor vehicles and found that it was hamilton.
on january,dea agents arrested hamilton at los angeles international airport.hamilton had just flown from atlanta,place of origin of the ups package sent to the toquet house.hamilton had purchased a first class ticket using over in cash.at the time of his arrest,he was carrying the business card of a reservations manager at the le parc suites hotel.
hamilton evidence 
hamilton lawyer conceded in his opening statement that hamilton had participated in a marijuana distribution conspiracy at a much earlier time,but asserted that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy after his arrest in october,and had thereafter devoted himself exclusively to his music production company.he claimed that,as the result of his withdrawal,his indictment,filed on january,was barred by the statute of limitations.see a.the government countered that hamilton never withdrew from the conspiracy,and that even if he did,the statute of limitations was tolled on march,because he was fleeing from justice as of that date when he failed to appear in court on the october arrest.see.
hamilton called two witnesses in an effort to corroborate his abandonment of the drug business for the music industry.the first was james goring,a music executive who testified about hamilton involvement in the reggae business up until the time of his arrest.goring admitted on cross,however,that hamilton biggest musical series of concerts in jamaica called sashi began in august,which was prior to his arrest with over pounds of marijuana in los angeles.hamilton second witness was darrell thompson,an entertainment lawyer who testified about work he had done relating to hamilton music production company,loy.
ii.the district court proceedings 
during the period before trial,the government provided hamilton attorneys with disclosures pursuant to,and the court adjudicated pretrial motions.approximately five days before trial,the government provided further information to the defense pursuant to.on january,the court was prepared to swear in the jury and begin trial.at that moment,hamilton attorney moved orally to suppress the evidence seized at the toquet house on grounds that the police had entered the house without a warrant before receiving consent to conduct the search.the court exhibited understandable annoyance that the motion,perhaps requiring a hearing that would interrupt the progress of the proceedings,was made not only out of time but also at a highly inconvenient moment in the court administration of the jury.defense counsel offered the explanation that the government had not disclosed the,warrantless entry until the recent delivery of the material.counsel then made an attorney proffer of facts supporting hamilton claim of a privacy interest in the house.the court found that these facts,even if true,were insufficient to give hamilton standing to contest the search,and denied the motion without a hearing.
on january,the jury found hamilton guilty of the marijuana conspiracy,and rendered a special verdict that he had not withdrawn from the conspiracy.the jury found him not guilty of the firearms offense.
discussion 
hamilton standing to contest the search of the toquet house 
hamilton contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized from the toquet house for lack of standing.he contends he established a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises,which the district court was not at liberty to reject unless it determined at a hearing that the facts he alleged were untrue.
a defendant seeking to suppress the fruits of a search by reason of a violation of the fourth amendment must show that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched.rakas illinois,d.this inquiry involves two distinct questions first,whether the individual had a subjective expectation of privacy and second,whether that expectation of privacy is one that society accepts as reasonable.see katz united states,d harlan,concurring accord united states chuang,cir.a protected privacy interest has been found in a wide array of circumstances,ranging from ownership or regular occupancy of a home,united states villegas,cir,to status as an overnight guest in someone else home,minnesota olson,d,or even in someone else hotel room,united states wilson,cir,to a rental storage unit,united states johns,cir,to one business premises,mancusi deforte,d,including the desk drawers and file cabinets contained therein,ortega,d,as well as the contents of one office computer,leventhal knapek,cir.
hamilton proffered the following facts supporting his claim of a privacy interest in the toquet house hamilton had paid the for the purchase of the house the purchase was registered in the name of shane johnson,who was identified by counsel in making the motion as hamilton wife,his common law wife,and the mother of his child hamilton had free access to come and go as he pleased and he went there two to three times a week for years.tr.counsel noted that hamilton would be prepared to swear to these facts under oath.tr.in the ensuing colloquy,the assistant united states attorney ausa said,i do believe that they are married,and added that when the police arrived at the house,hamilton had denied living there.in response to questioning from judge chin,hamilton attorney acknowledged that hamilton did not have keys to the house,stating,he had access,but not keys.tr.the district court then denied the motion,ruling that hamilton had no more privacy interest than a mortgagee and therefore lacked standing to contest the search.the court said 
he does not have standing.it would be no different than if a bank provided money for someone to purchase a house.the bank has access in the sense that it can send a representative from time to time to inspect.here,in light of all of the circumstances,he did have keys.he did have control of the facility.they were not married.he was not on the deed.the mere fact that he provided money,assuming that to be the case,is not sufficient to establish standing.you add to that the fact that on the day the police searched he denied that he lived there,i find that he does not have standing.
we disagree with the district court view that hamilton claim to a privacy interest was no better than that of a mortgagee bank and therefore insufficient.while the burden was on hamilton to establish a protected privacy interest,the court was obligated to credit the facts he asserted,and could not properly deny his motion for lack of standing unless the facts he asserted,seen in the light most favorable to hamilton,were legally insufficient to sustain his burden.if the asserted facts,or the inferences to be drawn from them,were contested,the court would need to hold a hearing to determine the contested issues.see united states pena,cir.
acceptance of hamilton allegations as true,construing them in the light most favorable to him,would yield a picture of one who has not only free and frequent access,but also probably effective control,and a solid expectation of privacy at the toquet house instead of considering the facts hamilton asserted in the light most favorable to him,the court appears to have assessed the facts hamilton asserted in the light least favorable to him.although his allegations would support the inference that he effectively controlled the use of the facility,the court somehow concluded that h e did have control of the facility.tr.although his allegations explicitly stated that he had free access to come and go as he pleased,the court somehow concluded that he had no more freedom of access than a mortgagee,entitled to make occasional inspections,because hamilton admittedly did not live at the house,had no key,and was not named as owner on the deed.there is no authority for the proposition that one need live in the premises,or exercise control over them,in order to enjoy a privacy interest in those premises.privacy interests have been found with respect to business premises and storage lockers.see chuang,at it is that a corporate officer or employee in certain circumstances may assert a reasonable expectation of privacy in his corporate office,and may have standing with respect to searches of corporate premises and records.johns,at finding reasonable expectation of privacy in rented storage space.they have been found where one was merely a guest at the premises.olson,at.nor has possession of a key or a deed or lease in one own name been deemed indispensable to establishment of a privacy interest,where the claimant understanding with those in charge of the premises was the basis of the expectation of privacy.see also wilson,at.we conclude that the court erred in failing to draw reasonable inferences in hamilton favor from the facts he alleged and in denying hamilton motion without a hearing on the ground that he did not have a privacy interest protected by the fourth amendment.
it does not necessarily follow,however,that the motion to suppress should have been granted.the district court,relying on an invalid reason to deny the motion,did not reach other possible reasons for denial of the motion.for example,the court expressed frustration that the motion,possibly requiring a hearing,was not made until the start of beyond the time set by the court for motions.counsel offered as an excuse that he had not learned of the warrantless entry until the government recent disclosure of the material.however,it appears that the material was disclosed five days prior to the making of the motion.we do not know,assuming the court would accept counsel reason for not having made the motion within the time set by the court for motions,whether it would also accept the additional delay following delivery of the material,and excuse the failure to support the motion with an affidavit attested by hamilton.united states mendoza,cir w ithout an affidavit or testimony from the defendant,it is almost impossible to find a privacy interest.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.nor can we know whether,upon conducting a hearing,the court might find either that hamilton failed to sustain the facts asserted by his counsel,or that raymond foster consent to the search overrode the warrantless entry.see united states snype,cir holding that taint of illegal entry by police had dissipated before consent was given 
we accordingly simply rule that the reason given by the court for the denial of the motion to suppress can not stand,and we remand for further consideration of the motion,leaving it to the district court to consider in the first instance the various arguments that may be made for and against the motion.
ii.hearsay testimony by government witness 
hamilton claims that the testimony of special agent eric baldus that he had learned that the defendant was living with someone named shane,his girlfriend,somewhere in california on toquet street,was inadmissible and prejudicial hearsay.the government responds that this evidence was properly received not for the truth of what was stated but for the purpose of showing the government investigative efforts to find the defendant following his failure to appear in court after his arrest at the los angeles airport.this,the government argues,became relevant to rebut the defendant contention that his indictment in was not within the five years allowed by the statute of limitations following the termination of his involvement in the marijuana conspiracy.we agree with the government.
in his opening statement to the jury at the start of trial,hamilton attorney conceded that hamilton had been a part of a marijuana conspiracy up to the time of his arrest at the los angeles airport in,but asserted that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy at that time and had thereafter devoted himself to a career promoting reggae music.defense counsel asserted that,because hamilton ceased to be part of the conspiracy in,the indictment filed against him in was not within the five years allowed by the statute of limitations.while the government sought to counter this contention in part by evidence that hamilton continued to participate in the marijuana trafficking conspiracy after,the government also undertook to show that,even if the jury should find that he had withdrawn in,the period allowed for his indictment did not expire prior to his indictment because it was tolled during the time that hamilton was fleeing from justice.no statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.
this court has held that the nature and the extent of the efforts of government agents to locate the defendant is one factor to consider in determining whether the defendant was fleeing from justice.united states florez,cir quoting united states greever,cir.in accordance with these authorities,the government contends that,in order to persuade the jury that the statute of limitations was tolled,it needed to show the course of its investigations that eventually led to the capture of the defendant.
the government accordingly called agent baldus,the case agent or lead investigator,to testify to his efforts to find the defendant.baldus stated that,beginning in,he had been asking cooperating individuals if they kn e w where he was.tr.eventually he received some information.the ausa then asked,without telling me what the information was,did this have anything to do with his location or his whereabouts tr.baldus affirmed that it was about the defendant location and was permitted by the court to answer,whereupon he gave the answer which is the subject of this he learned the defendant was living with shane,his girlfriend,in california on toquet street.
the ausa then elicited how that piece of information eventually led to the defendant apprehension.at first,with only the name of shane and a street name,baldus had insufficient information with which to do anything.he continued,however,to inquire of cooperators and eventually was given a telephone number.a subpoena presumably to the telephone company revealed an address for that telephone number,which was toquet drive in encino,california.checking that address against criminal investigation databases revealed the police report of the incident in january at toquet drive.the report included descriptions of the persons encountered by the police at the toquet house,one of which matched the description baldus had for the defendant.that individual had used the name romie robertson.the agent knew that the defendant had used the name romie.the report also gave the number of romie robertson florida driver license.the agent obtained a photo from the florida motor vehicle authority,which confirmed that horatio hamilton and romie robertson were the same person.an analysis of telephone records related to the toquet address resulted in the identification of a cell phone which had previously been used in the los angeles area and was now making calls in the atlanta area.further inquiry of cooperators concerning romie robertson produced information that he would be flying from atlanta to los angeles on a particular delta airlines flight.baldus went to the los angeles airport and arrested the defendant as he deplaned.
we agree with the government that baldus testimony,including his report of the information he received that the defendant was living with his girlfriend shane on toquet street,was relevant to the government efforts to locate hamilton in support of the contention that he was a fugitive,whose limitation period was tolled while he was in flight from justice.the report linking him to the toquet house was relevant not for the truth of what was stated in the report,but rather for the purpose of showing the information baldus received and how he used that information in his continuing efforts to locate the defendant.these efforts to find the defendant became pertinent when,at the start of trial,the defendant raised the contention that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy in with the consequence that his indictment in was untimely.
