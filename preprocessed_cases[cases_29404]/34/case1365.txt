opinion of the court 
armando leyva was convicted in philadelphia court of common pleas of statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor.leyva,who was years old at the time,had engaged in a sexual relationship with a teenage girl who attended his church.he was sentenced to to months in prison,followed by three years of probation.
represented by new appellate counsel,leyva sought direct and collateral state court review of his conviction,asserting various claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.among these claims,leyva contended that trial counsel had a conflict of interest arising from his former representation of the complainant mother.he also claimed that trial counsel had received an offer from the complainant mother to drop the charges against leyva in exchange for.according to leyva,trial counsel was ineffective for failing to withdraw his representation in order to testify about these facts.pennsylvania courts denied review of some of leyva claims because he failed to submit affidavits that trial counsel or the complainant mother were available and willing to testify they declined to review other claims after leyva was released from custody.
leyva raised his ineffectiveness claims in a federal petition for habeas corpus.the district court dismissed the petition after concluding that leyva failure to comply with pennsylvania procedural requirements constituted a procedural bar to federal review.because we disagree,we will vacate and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
on july,armando leyva was tried before a judge in philadelphia court of common pleas on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse,statutory sexual assault,corruption of a minor,and indecent assault the prosecution principal witness at trial was an adolescent girl,who attended the church where leyva was an organist.according to her testimony,during the first six months of,when she was fourteen years old,the two carried on a consensual sexual relationship.according to leyva,the two had never engaged in any sexual conduct.
a central issue at trial was credibility.during,leyva attorney attempted to introduce evidence of a previous perjury.app.specifically,he questioned about a prior accusation of sexual assault she had made against wilfredo lopez her mother former boyfriend,but later recanted.lopez,it came to light,had been represented by leyva attorney at the time of the accusation,so the attorney was familiar with the surrounding facts.he questioned about whether she was pressured by her mother into making the accusation against lopez.maintained the accusation had been truthful,explaining that she later recanted it because she was afraid of lopez,and because leyva attorney asked her to say nothing happened.app.
at the conclusion of trial,the judge found leyva guilty of statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor,in violation of.stat.and,respectively.because of the evidence about recanted accusation,the judge gave leyva the benefit of the doubt as far as involuntary deviate sexual intercourse is concerned,finding him not guilty of that more serious offense.app.on september,he sentenced leyva to to months in prison,followed by three years probation.
on appeal,leyva retained a new attorney who submitted to the trial court a statement of matters complained of on appeal,as required under pennsylvania rule of appellate procedure b.notably,he included an affidavit from leyva wife stating that trial counsel told her and leyva that mother offered to drop the charges against leyva in exchange for in response,the trial judge issued an opinion concluding that leyva claims of ineffectiveness warranted a new trial.this opinion was without effect,however,because the case was already on appeal before the superior court 
on appeal,leyva argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to interview several potential witnesses failing to withdraw based on a conflict of interest because of his prior representation of lopez failing to present mother as a witness and failing to withdraw from representing leyva in order to testify at trial.
on october,the superior court affirmed leyva conviction.the court disposed of leyva first two claims on the merits,concluding that neither trial counsel failure to interview the witnesses identified by leyva,nor the alleged conflict of interest constituted error or prejudiced leyva.regarding leyva second two claims,the court declined to reach them on the merits,concluding that leyva had failed to present affidavits indicating that mother or leyva trial counsel would have testified 
leyva petitioned for reconsideration,and shortly thereafter petitioned the pennsylvania supreme court for allowance of appeal.both petitions were denied.on august,days before the expiration of his filed a petition for collateral relief under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra,raising additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.a few months later,however,the court of common pleas summarily dismissed the pcra petition because leyva was no longer in custody.
on the same day that leyva filed his pcra petition,he also filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court.his petition raised five grounds for relief 
trial counsel was ineffective because he a failed to withdraw in order to testify about the efforts of mother to obtain from leyva in exchange for dropping all the charges against him,and b failed to call mother as an adverse witness.
trial counsel was ineffective for a failing to withdraw his representation in order to testify after stated at trial that she was pressured by trial counsel to drop the charges against lopez,and b having a conflict of interest because he previously represented lopez.
trial counsel was ineffective and had a conflict of interest because he failed to present evidence that mother was motivated to lie and to pressure her daughter to lie because she was cooperating with the government in an unrelated case.
trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request evidence of mother cooperation agreement with the government in an unrelated case.moreover,the government failure to turn over this evidence rendered his conviction unconstitutional.
trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce evidence about previous accusation against jose rojas.
the district court referred leyva petition to a magistrate judge,who recommended denying relief for three reasons.leyva williams,wl,at.first,the magistrate judge concluded that claim a was procedurally defaulted because leyva failed to comply with pennsylvania affidavit rule when presenting his claim in state court.id.at.second,she concluded that claims b,a,and were procedurally defaulted because leyva failed to comply with pennsylvania custody requirement for bringing a pcra petition finally,reaching the merits of claims b and,the magistrate judge concluded that leyva had not demonstrated that the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law under d.leyva,wl,at.
leyva did not object to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and the district court adopted it in full.on november,we granted a certificate of appealability,requesting that leyva address whether his claims had been procedurally defaulted.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction 
a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a habeas petition under a only if a petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitution or federal law.defoy mccullough,cir see also obado new jersey,cir f or a federal court to have jurisdiction,a petitioner must be in custody under the conviction he is attacking at the time the habeas petition is filed.the term custody extends beyond physical confinement,and encompasses other significant restraints on liberty that are not shared by the public generally.jones cunningham,d.the requirement is satisfied when a petitioner is on probation.lee stickman,cir it is clear that being on probation meets the in custody requirement for purposes of the habeas statute.in making a custody determination,federal courts look to the date that the habeas petition was filed.barry bergen county probation,cir see also lee,at w hat matters for the in custody requirement is whether lee was in custody at the time his habeas petition was filed.
although leyva was in custody when he filed his habeas petition,he no longer is.after a petitioner release from custody,we consider his habeas case moot unless he can demonstrate he will suffer some collateral consequences if his conviction is allowed to stand.defoy,at.significantly,though,we may presume collateral consequences when a litigant challenges a criminal conviction.united states kissinger,cir citing sibron new york,d see also spencer kemna,d in recent decades,we have been willing to presume that a wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateral consequences.
in this case,the government does not dispute that leyva would suffer collateral consequences should his criminal conviction be allowed to stand.presuming such consequences,we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and,and that we have jurisdiction under and.see jacobs horn,cir.
standard of review 
when a district court rules on a habeas petition without an evidentiary hearing,our review is plenary.id.the government argues,however,that we should review only for plain error,because leyva failed to object to the magistrate judge report and recommendation in nara frank,we held that plain error review rather than de novo review is appropriate where a party fails to timely object to a magistrate judge report and recommendation in habeas corpus cases,cir.under plain error review,we reverse an error below only if it was clear or obvious,affect ed substantial rights,and seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at quoting united states olano,d citation omitted.
in nara,a magistrate judge issued a report recommending the district court grant a petition for habeas corpus.the recommendation gave the parties ten days in which to file objections to its determinations,warning that a f ailure to file timely objections may constitute a waiver of any appellate rights.id.at.the government failed to object,and the district court adopted the recommendation.id.over two weeks later,the government requested that the district court vacate the order on the grounds that it never received the magistrate report and recommendation.id.before the district court could rule on the request,the government appealed to this court.
on appeal,we applied plain error review,explaining that this standard of review would promote the effectiveness and efficiency of the lower courts by compelling parties to promptly contest dispositive issues before the magistrate judge and district judge.id.at.we also observed that the standard afford ed some level of appellate review to all dispositive legal issues raised by a report and recommendation,but g a ve substance to the warning that failure to timely object may risk the loss of appellate rights.id.at.
in spite of nara general rule,we decline to apply plain error review in this case.in nara,the government was proceeding with counsel and had received a clear warning from the magistrate judge that f ailure to file timely objections may constitute a waiver of any appellate rights.id.at.in contrast,there is no indication that leyva,a pro se litigant,was ever warned that his failure to object to the magistrate judge report would result in the forfeiture of his rights 
without such a warning,we believe it would be inequitable to deny a pro se litigant de novo appellate review.welch heckler,cir w e find that it would be inappropriate to require an objection in order to preserve a right of appeal,where the language of the magistrate report did not put a party on notice that he would be waiving his appellate rights by not filing objections below.indeed,some jurisdictions have allowed an exception to the waiver of appellate rights when such a waiver would defeat the interests of justice.see wirsching colorado,cir recounting approach of several circuits.
in particular,many jurisdictions provide an exception to the waiver of appellate rights when a magistrate judge fails to inform a pro se litigant of the consequences of failing to object.see moore united states,cir we join those circuits that have declined to apply the waiver rule to a pro se litigant failure to object when the magistrate order does not apprise the pro se litigant of the consequences of a failure to object to findings and recommendations.see,small sec y of health and human,cir a pro se party failure to object to a magistrate report and recommendation does not operate as a waiver of the right to appellate review unless the magistrate report explicitly states that failure to object will preclude appellate review and specifically cites certain relevant provisions.united states,cir requiring magistrate judges to give clear notice to litigants not only of the requirements that objections must be specific and be filed within ten days but that failure to file within the time allowed waives the right to appeal the district court order wright collins,cir a pro se litigant must receive fair notification of the consequences of failure to object to a magistrate report before such a procedural default will result in waiver of the right of appeal.wiley wainwright,cir party failure to object does not limit his right to appeal since he was not informed that objections had to be filed within ten days.although these cases address a waiver of appellate review,as opposed to a forfeiture,see supra note,we believe they support an exception to the restriction of our appellate standard of review.
in sum,it would be inequitable to apply plain error review,which is extremely limited,to the claims of a pro se litigant who was not warned of the consequences of failing to object.we will therefore review leyva claims de novo.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,leyva challenges the magistrate judge determinations that most of his claims were procedurally defaulted,as well as her merits ruling on part of his conflict of interest claim.as set forth further below,we reach the following conclusions.first,leyva failure to submit an affidavit to establish that his trial counsel or the complainant mother were available and willing to testify does not result in procedural default of claim,because an affidavit requirement is not an adequate state ground.second,leyva failure to comply with pennsylvania custody requirement does not bar review of claims a,and,because leyva noncompliance with this requirement did not result from any failure on his part.finally,we agree with the government that claim b,concerning trial counsel prior representation of wilfredo lopez,was properly denied by the magistrate judge on the merits 
after briefly laying out the applicable habeas jurisprudence,we will address each of our three bases for this decision.
procedural default 
a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus under unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.b a.to do so,a petitioner must fairly present all federal claims to the highest state court before bringing them in federal court.stevens delaware corr,cir quoting whitney horn,cir.this requirement ensures that state courts have an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of prisoners federal rights.united states bendolph,cir quoting duckworth serrano,d.
even when a petitioner properly exhausts a claim,however,a federal court may not review it on the merits if a state court decision rests on a violation of a state procedural rule.johnson pinchak,cir.this procedural bar applies only when the state rule is independent of the federal question presented and adequate to support the judgment.nara,at citing gray netherland,d,and coleman thompson,d.the requirements of independence and adequacy are distinct,see johnson,at,but only the adequacy requirement is at issue here.
a state rule is adequate for procedural default purposes if it was firmly established,readily ascertainable,and regularly followed at the time of the purported default.szuchon lehman,cir these requirements ensure that federal review is not barred unless
