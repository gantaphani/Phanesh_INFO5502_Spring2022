opinion of the court 
domingo mercado mercado appeals the district court order denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.because we find the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict,we will affirm the district court order.
on september,a grand jury indicted mercado and his two dionel and hiram,otherwise known as morrisette morrisette on one count of possession with intent to distribute grams or more of heroin,and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute,in violation of a and b b.the grand jury also indicted them on one count of possession with intent to distribute,and aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute,within feet of a school,in violation of a.pled guilty to both counts pursuant to a cooperation plea agreement.morrisette was scheduled to plead guilty on february,but instead absconded.mercado proceeded alone to trial on february.
at trial,the government presented evidence that the drug enforcement agency dea had been working with a confidential informant,whom knew as poppy.on two occasions prior to the charges in question,poppy completed controlled substance purchases from.on august,at,dea agents instructed poppy to contact and request grams of heroin.told poppy he did not have that much heroin but would travel to new york city to pick some up and call poppy when he returned.
however,did not go to new york city.instead,he contacted morrisette about getting heroin to sell to poppy.testified that he had never done business with morrisette before,but believed that morrisette could provide for his customer needs.
on august,starting at,dea agents set up surveillance at the block of east allegheny avenue across the street from residence.left his house at approximately.he made one stop and then arrived at a barber shop located at the intersection of front and lippincott in philadelphia at,less than three blocks from his house.stayed in the area around the barber shop for most of the afternoon,talking to numerous people.
although dea agents did not observe talking with morrisette or mercado in front of the barber shop,testified that he talked to them twice throughout the day.he said morrisette pulled up in a black ford taurus sometime before noon mercado sat in the passenger seat.stood outside the window of the car and spoke with morrisette about purchasing heroin.then,morrisette and mercado drove away.a short time later,morrisette dropped by the barber shop again with mercado in the passenger seat this time,morrisette was driving a maroon gmc envoy registered in his name.standing on the street and speaking to morrisette through the window,and morrisette further discussed which drugs morrisette had available to sell to.
testified that he and morrisette exchanged several calls over cellular phones throughout the day.originally,agreed to pay for each gram of heroin,but in a later call he asked morrisette if he could decrease the price to per gram.morrisette responded by saying he would patch on with the owner of the stuff.immediately thereafter,a new voice spoke into the phone and confirmed that the price was a gram.neither morrisette nor the owner ever identified the new voice by name.
another confidential informant called between and to ask if had succeeded in acquiring some heroin.responded that he was returning from picking up the heroin and was going to meet with poppy at the cousin supermarket parking lot across the street from his house.based on this information,law enforcement set up surveillance in the supermarket parking lot.
poppy and met at told poppy he did not have the heroin yet,but that poppy should come back in ten minutes.then left the parking lot,briefly stopped by the barber shop,and returned to his residence on allegheny avenue.waited on his stoop for morrisette to arrive with the heroin.
sometime later,morrisette pulled up in front of house in the black ford taurus.again,mercado was in the passenger seat.walked over to the window and reached into the car.someone handed him a wrapped package of heroin,which he put directly in his pocket.testified that he is unsure whether mercado or morrisette passed him the package.surveillance officers were also unable to see which one transferred the package to.
morrisette drove away.crossed the street to deliver the package to poppy,but dea agents arrested before he could.dea agents took inside his residence,executed a search of his house,and recovered the heroin package from his right,rear pocket,through a spanish interpreter,immediately began cooperating.he told the dea agents he received the heroin from a man named morrisette,which he had yet to pay for,and that he was supposed to call when he had the money.
at the dea agents direction,called morrisette at and told him to come pick up the money.a short while later,morrisette and mercado drove up,this time in the maroon gmc envoy.the dea agents arrested both morrisette and mercado.
testified that although he saw mercado with morrisette every time he saw morrisette that day,he never conversed with mercado.when asked if mercado had anything to do with the drugs,stated,i was dealing with that man.whatever they did among themselves,you know,morrisette the one that knows.it their business.
agent poules testified that after dea agents arrested,morrisette,and mercado,he confiscated their cellular phones.the phone he took from was registered to the same number poppy used to call.the number for morrisette phone was consistent with the number dialed to request that morrisette pick up the money.agent poules also retrieved mercado phone and subpoenaed the toll records relating to the three phones.
the toll records revealed that the phones registered to the parties exchanged several phone calls on august,before of course the toll records do not show that the parties themselves made these calls.relevant to this case,however,is the fact phone called morrisette phone two times that morning,both resulting in short voice messages.of particular note is the fact that before morrisette responded to,three short calls were placed between morrisette phone and mercado phone.only after those calls were made did morrisette respond to call there were no phone calls between mercado and between mercado and morrisette and morrisette and.
the government case also included three stipulations the package recovered contained heroin,the distance between the parking lot and the school is less than feet,and law enforcement maintained the proper chain of custody for documents recovered until the point the documents were introduced into evidence.
mercado moved for a rule judgment of acquittal after the government presented all of its evidence,save one witness.the district court listened to brief arguments on the motion,but deferred the ruling until after the jury verdict.the jury convicted mercado on both counts.
after the jury verdict,the district court asked counsel to reargue the motion,focusing their rule arguments on mercado potential liability as an aider or abettor or via constructive possession.it stated 
it no secret that i disagree with the jury verdict in this case.i not saying that the defendant is not guilty i think looking hard at the meaning of reasonable doubt,if i had been sitting as a juror,i would have voted for a verdict of not guilty.but that not the test.my disagreement with the jury verdict does carry the day for the defense,and yet i driven to this conclusion.by the government argument,i think the fact that the defendant was present four times takes this case out of the rule that mere presence,where the drugs are being delivered,and mere presence in the car in which they being delivered,is not enough.mere presence once,yes.mere presence four times,i say no.that prevents me from saying that no rational trier of the fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
thus,the district court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to,and we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
we apply a particularly deferential standard when determining if a jury verdict rests on sufficient evidence,because a reviewing cour
