this appeal concerns the sufficiency of a search warrant affidavit in establishing probable cause to search paul gifford gifford home for a marijuana grow operation.the united states government government challenges the district court suppression of evidence seized from gifford home,arguing that the search warrant affidavit did not omit information material to a probable cause determination.since we find that the search warrant in fact contained reckless material omissions,and the properly reformed search warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause,we affirm the district court in all respects.
background 
factual background 
on february,a new hampshire state court issued a warrant to search gifford home relying on a supporting affidavit submitted by new hampshire state trooper first class steven tarr trooper tarr.we quote at length from trooper tarr affidavit,based in part on information received from an unnamed informant as the core issue on appeal concerns its sufficiency for establishing probable cause 
during the month of november,the affiant received information reference sic the possible manufacture of the controlled drug marijuana at the following address south road town omitted,new hampshire.by a paul gifford dob omitted.
this information was provided through a reliable confidential informant with knowledge of gifford personal practices as well as knowledge of the inside of the residence.according to the confidential informant,gifford is a landscaper by trade but does not work on a regular basis.the informant explained that gifford considers growing marijuana to be his full time occupation and means by which to earn money.additionally,information received from this informant on february,revealed that gifford is currently in the process of growing marijuana at the residence and has leftover,finished marijuana from an autumn indoor grow within the residence.
this affiant gathered information relative to the resident of the home at that address through department of motor vehicle sic and town of town omitted,nh records.i learned that the following individual resides at that address paul gifford dob omitted.
on january,this affiant received a copy of a police report from the town omitted poilce sic department that had been generated by officer john ventura.the report related to a home visit made to the residence by officer ventura and lisa tyler of adult protective services.while officer ventura was at the residence to assist adult protective services,he made contact with gifford who met them at the front door of the residence and quickly shut the door behind him.officer ventura was immediately overwhelmed by the strong odor of burnt marijuana coming from paul person.later,when allowed into the home,officer ventura again detected the same odor of burnt marijuana.
this affiant drove to south road,town omitted,nh.i noted that the residence is a large building with an attached barn.it is located directly across the street from a school.
during this investigation,this affiant requested the power records from unitil corporation utilities company for south road,town omitted,nh.on november,unitil corporation was served with a subpoena for the electrical power records of south road,town omitted,nh.using the subpoena process,this affiant found that the electric utility bill for this residence is listed to paul gifford.
this affiant found that the electric usage for the home appears to be exceptionally higher than that of a home of a similar size.in fact,the electrical usage at the address during the past sixteen months averages approximately kilowatt hours per billing cycle.during this period,the residence used kilowatt hours during the lowest consumption billing cycle and kilowatt hours during the highest consumption billing cycle.a billing cycle encompasses approximately one month.
this affiant also obtained electrical power records from surrounding of unitil through the subpoena process.the electrical usage in these homes was significantly lower than that of south road.unitil records revealed that the residence of south road utilized an average of kilowatt hours per billing cycle with a lowest consumption cycle of kilowatt hours and a highest consumption of kilowatt hours.similarly,the residence of south road utilized an average of kilowatt hours per billing cycle with a lowest consumption cycle of kilowatt hours and a highest consumption of kilowatt hours.
as is evidenced above,the residence of south road,town omitted,nh utilized over three times the average electrical consumption per billing cycle than its neighbors.chart omitted.investigation has revealed that the residence at south road is heated by oil.there are no hot tubs,saunas or any other additional such items to explain a higher than usual electrical usage.
based upon this affiant training and experience,i know that high amounts of electricity are needed by indoor cannabis cultivators to power pumps,timers,heaters,air conditioners,fans and other electrical equipment as well as the watt lights necessary to grow cannabis.a typical grow schedule would show increasing then decreasing electrical use in a to day cycle unless the cultivator is rotating young,juvenile and adult plants in an effort to increase his yield.this would extend the periods of high electrical use depending on how many rotations of plants a grower has at a given time.
the rest of the affidavit details trooper tarr general knowledge of marijuana grow operations.
the search warrant was executed on february.based on the items seized from gifford home,he was charged in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire with manufacturing marijuana,possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute,and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.
procedural history 
following gifford indictment,he filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized at his home,arguing,inter alia,that the search warrant affidavit lacked probable cause.gifford claimed that the warrant was facially insufficient to establish probable cause.in the alternative,he argued that the affidavit had material omissions,including that one of the mentioned comparator houses for purposes of measuring electricity use was substantially smaller than the target house.
the government objected to gifford motion,but before the district court could address it,gifford and the government reached a plea agreement wherein the government agreed to dismiss the firearm count and gifford agreed to a month disposition on the drug charges.however,gifford withdrew his plea after the district court challenged the disposition at sentencing.specifically,the district court stated that it thought that a sentence of between and months was appropriate given that the count driving the high sentence was the firearm count,and if the defendant were to proceed to trial,it was unlikely to impose a sentence of more than months.
after gifford withdrew his plea,he refiled his motion to suppress.the district court convened a hearing on the motion.at the hearing,the government acknowledged that the affiant knew that one of the comparator houses,south road,was substantially smaller than the target house knew that south road was similarly sized to the target house and did not include the fact that south road was of a substantially smaller size in the affidavit.the government also conceded that the affiant knew that a horse boarding business operated out of the gifford home,but the affiant claimed that he saw no signs of its operation when he drove by the residence,even though a banner advertising the business hung outside based on these representations by the government at the hearing,the parties agreed that the court could rule on the suppression issue on undisputed facts,without receiving live testimony.
after hearing the parties arguments,the district court held that the suppression of the search of the target residence was warranted under franks delaware,d,because the affiant made a material omission from the search warrant affidavit in reckless disregard for the truth specifically,the court found that the affiant recklessly omitted from his affidavit the fact that the comparator house at south road was the size of the target house.the district court found this omission to be material because,in its view,if the information about south road had been included in the affidavit,that affidavit would have failed to establish probable cause for a search.the court additionally observed that there were insufficient indicia of reliability supporting the informant tip since very little information was provided about the informant.
compounding the insufficiencies,the court continued,was the fact that the affiant had not provided adequate corroborating facts from his own investigation to permit a probable cause finding.the statements in the affidavit regarding the marijuana odor,it found,were not corroborative of the informant tip because they demonstrated only that burnt marijuana may have been present,not that it was grown.the evidence of the electricity consumption was rendered meaningless,the court stated,because the omission of material information regarding the size of the comparator home at south road would leave only the comparison between the target house and south road.the court concluded that the information showing that south road used substantially less electricity than the target house was meaningless since there could be numerous innocuous explanations for the variation in electricity usage having nothing to do with a marijuana grow operation.
since neither the odor nor the electricity consumption corroborated the informant tip,the court concluded that the reformed affidavit including the omitted information lacked probable cause.the district court thus issued an order suppressing the evidence seized from gifford home.the government timely appealed the suppression order.

information supporting probable cause for a warrant is often set forth in an affidavit provided by a law enforcement officer,as happened here.see united states rigaud,cir.an affidavit supporting a search warrant is presumptively valid.id.but if a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement with reckless disregard for the truth was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause,the fourth amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant request.franks delaware,d.
for a warrant to be voided and the fruits of a search excluded,the defendant must show that the affiant in fact made a false statement or omission knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,make this showing by a preponderance of the evidence,and show that,with the recklessly omitted information added to the affidavit,the reformed affidavit fails to establish probable cause.united states tzannos,cir.an allegation is made with reckless disregard for the truth if the affiant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the allegations or where circumstances evinced obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the allegations in the application.burke town of walpole,cir quoting united states ranney,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the case of allegedly material omissions,recklessness may be inferred where the omitted information was critical to the probable cause determination.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
where the primary basis for a probable cause determination is information provided by a confidential informant,the affidavit must provide some information from which a magistrate can credit the informant credibility.united states barnard,cir.a probable cause finding may be based on an informant tip so long as the probability of a lying or inaccurate informer has been sufficiently reduced.united states greenburg,cir.we apply a nonexhaustive list of factors to examine the affidavit probable cause showing,which include,among others whether the affidavit establishes the probable veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information whether an informant statements reflect knowledge whether some or all of the informant factual statements were corroborated wherever reasonable or practicable,through police surveillance and whether a law enforcement affiant assessed,from his professional standpoint,experience,and expertise,the probable significance of the informant provided information.united states tiem trinh,cir.

we now turn to the questions directly on appeal whether the district court erred in finding the omissions in the search warrant of gifford home material,and if the reformed search warrant affidavit which includes the omitted material is sufficient to establish probable cause.
materiality of omissions 
the government argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding material the omission of information pertaining to the size of the comparator house at south road because,even if the size of the house were added to the affidavit,or,alternatively,the reference to the house were eliminated entirely,the affidavit would still establish probable cause.this is because,the government claims,there was ample recognized indicia that the informant was sufficiently reliable and there was enough corroborating information to support probable cause.
specifically,the government points to the affidavit description of the informant as reliable,suggesting that the affiant knew his identity and reducing the likelihood that the informant was lying.the government further suggests that a fact included in the affidavit provided by the informant that the defendant had stopped working as a landscaper to engage in marijuana production and that he was growing a new crop of plants and storing leftover marijuana for an autumn harvest was a detail that is sufficiently specific that it was likely obtained from personal observations or from a person statement to the informant that was against his penal interest.see united states zayas díaz,cir statements may support a probable cause determination.as corroboration for the informant statements,the government points to the following records obtained from unitil and the department of motor vehicles dmv confirming that gifford resided at south road a police report of a local police department visit to gifford home where the officer smelled burnt marijuana on his person and inside the house and unitil electricity records of gifford home indicating that electrical usage therein was three times the rate of the house at south road.
we are not convinced by the government arguments.first,we do not agree that the information in the affidavit would allow an issuing judge a sufficient basis for determining the informant reliability.while the factors enumerated in tiem trinh are,it nevertheless remains the case that none of them would favor a reliability finding.nothing in the affidavit indicates the informant basis of knowl
