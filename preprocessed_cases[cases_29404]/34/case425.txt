severin yelaun appeals from his conviction in the federal district court for various federal fraud related offenses committed during a scheme to collect insurance payments for medical tests.he also contests his sentence.the events that gave rise to the charges,drawing the facts primarily from the government evidence at yelaun trial,are as follows.
in yelaun and igor moyseyev started a clinic in physical therapy and rehabilitation,broadway to provide physical therapy and diagnostic services primarily to auto accident victims.moyseyev provided the funding,while yelaun recruited physicians and supervised most of the operations including billing matters an affiliate,global tech diagnostics global tech,was incorporated to handle administrative matters including billing insurers for broadway services.
two of the tests used by broadway are important to this case.one,the electromyogram emg,measures nerve and muscle function and,as it involves insertion of needles into the patient and real time interpretation,requires that a physician be present.the second,called a nerve conduction velocity test ncv,also measures nerve and muscle function but employs electrodes rather than needles.for insurance purposes it requires a prescription or request from a doctor,as does an emg,but unlike the emg does not require the doctor presence at the test.
although broadway did some legitimate testing,it also billed auto insurers for numerous emg and ncv tests that were not in fact performed.the emg tests were commonly painful the ncv tests involved shocks that could be painful.at yelaun trial a number of the patients for whom insurance reimbursement had been sought by global tech for such tests testified that they had gone to broadway for therapy but had no recollection of the needle insertion or electric shocks that were the respective hallmarks of the two tests.
a doctor affiliated with broadway,ranendra chatterjee,testified that his signature stamp had been used without authorization to stamp prescriptions for the tests and test reports he said that he had never used the stamp for tests he had conducted or reviewed.david tamaren,who worked at broadway,did not testify but prescriptions he wrote for emg and ncv tests were introduced.the government argued from internal evidence that the prescriptions were written after the fact or were otherwise fraudulent.
in,chatterjee discovered the misuse of his stamp and confronted yelaun,who chatterjee said admitted that the stamp had been used quite a few times without the doctor authorization.chatterjee complained to moyseyev and soon thereafter moyseyev severed his ties with yelaun.in november,yelaun with a new partner formed a new pair of physical therapy rehabilitation center as the provider and lynn diagnostics management for a new location.john montoni,a chiropractor who had worked at broadway and followed yelaun to the lynn clinic,testified at trial that he had written prescriptions for emg and ncv tests that had never been performed.the same pattern of billing insurers for tests never performed was thus repeated at least until some time in or.
in january,yelaun,moyseyev,montoni,and tamaren were indicted on numerous counts including mail fraud,wire fraud,id,health care fraud,id,conspiracy to commit an offense against or defraud the united states,id,money laundering,id.a a i and money laundering conspiracy,id.h.yelaun accepted plea bargains but yelaun went to trial and was convicted on counts of mail fraud and one count each of health care fraud,conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states,and money laundering conspiracy.
following his yielded a sentence of months in prison,a term of supervised release,and restitution of filed the present appeal.he does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence but challenges the admission of evidence against him,asserts a fatal variance as to one count of the indictment and contests his sentence.the standard of review for his claims varies with the issue.
yelaun first says that certain trial testimony by montoni was admitted in error.montoni testified that on a specific occasion yelaun approached him with a box of patient charts and asked him to sign prescriptions for emg and ncv tests for those patients.the tests had already been performed,and montoni therefore signed the forms without assessing whether the patients needed the tests or not.yelaun objects only to the doctor further testimony that he signed the prescriptions as yelaun requested because he felt intimidated by yelaun.
specifically,over objection montoni was allowed to explain that his reason for signing the prescriptions for tests that he had not authorized was that yelaun frightened him because,on a prior occasion,yelaun had showed anger when montoni had resisted doing what yelaun wanted.yelaun says that the testimony was irrelevant except for the forbidden inference of bad character,see.a,and was in any case highly prejudicial and therefore inadmissible.we will assume arguendo that the objections were all properly preserved.
with limited exceptions,evidence to show the defendant bad character is normally inadmissible in a criminal trial but the very same facts illustrating bad character can be admitted,with a limiting instruction if sought,to show something else that is relevant to the case.b.in this instance,the government had ample legitimate reason to explain why at yelaun behest montoni signed prescriptions for tests that he had not determined to be medically necessary.
absent some explanation as to why montoni willingly participated in a fraud at yelaun request,a jury might well infer that montoni was not credible but had made up the story to secure his plea bargain.inevitably,defense counsel was going to seek to impeach the doctor based on his own plea bargain with the also with montoni initial statements to police that he could not remember signing the emg and ncv prescriptions.both the admitted fraud and the initial denials underscored doubts about his credibility.
the explanation given by he was afraid of yelaun based on yelaun prior exhibitions of to make montoni main testimony about yelaun demand more plausible,countering any inference that montoni signatures had been supplied on his own and without yelaun involvement.the context also tended to counter any potential inference that had in some instances properly prescribed such tests for simply confused or mistaken about the episode in question.
case law supports the relevance and admissibility of such contextual testimony.united states bartelho,cir,cert.denied,d allowing defendant girlfriend to testify that she was intimidated by him to explain why she initially lied to the police and committed perjury united states balsam,cir,cert.denied,d defendant former girlfriend allowed to testify that she feared him to explain her reluctance to testify.in any event,the evidence was logically relevant for a reason other than bad character,which is rule b ultimate test.
of course,relevant evidence can be excluded under rule if it is substantially more prejudicial than probative,tending to prove a fact in issue,but this is a balancing judgment by the trial judge reviewed only for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.in this case,the fact that yelaun had a bad temper and that montoni feared him was relevant and at best minimally prejudicial the crime charged,after all,was fraud,not assault,and bad temper does not normally suggest a propensity to commit fraud.
yelaun more interesting claim of error is that there was a variance between the indictment count,which charged him with conspiracy to commit money laundering,and the proof at trial.count,on which yelaun was convicted,charged that from in or about january through in or after,yelaun and moyseyev 
did knowingly and unlawfully conspire with each other and with others known and unknown to the grand jury,knowingly to conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate and foreign commerce,that is,to engage in financial transactions involving united states currency and bank checks,which in fact involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,that is,mail fraud in violation of tit
