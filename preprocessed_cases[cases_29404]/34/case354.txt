in this appeal,rafael challenges his sentence following his conviction for participating in a conspiracy to distribute narcotics.the sentence currently on appeal was imposed on after a previous decision by this court,in which we affirmed the appellant conviction but vacated his sentence due to the sentencing court failure to make an individualized drug quantity determination.see united states,cir.after careful consideration,we affirm the appellant new sentence.
background 
as discussed in our prior opinion,the facts underlying this appeal arise from an investigation of the drug point known as las malvinas in the luis lloréns torres housing project in puerto rico.josé luis rivera gonzález,luis lloréns,luis lloréns ran the drug point from until his death in.the fbi and the puerto rico police department prpd investigated the drug point between the summer of and october.the investigation resulted in a grand jury indictment against nine individuals,including the appellant.was charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances,including powder cocaine,cocaine base,heroin,and marijuana,in violation of.role in the charged conspiracy was that of a wholesale supplier of drugs,particularly powder cocaine,to the drug point.
was tried jointly with josé ramos,a processor of drugs at las malvinas.in addition to asking the jury to render a verdict as to the defendants participation in the conspiracy,the judge also gave the jury a special verdict form asking it to decide whether or not the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy was at least five kilograms.the jury found and ramos guilty of conspiracy,and also found that the amount of cocaine in the conspiracy was at least five kilograms.
on december,the district court held a sentencing hearing for.the report psr recommended a base offense level bol of,based on the jury finding that the drug quantity in the conspiracy was at least five kilograms.the district court adopted this reasoning and assigned a bol of.had argued to the court that it needed to make an individualized drug quantity determination,but the court concluded that drug quantity was a matter reserved to the jury,and that the jury had rendered a sufficient finding.
also objected to the psr on the ground that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under.after the verdict and before the december,sentencing hearing,had submitted to the court a written statement admitting to participating in the sale of drugs at the lloréns torres housing project,stating that he was sorry for the damage he had done to society and to his family,and explaining that he had gone to trial only because the drug amount with which he was being charged overstated his role in the conspiracy.the probation officer who prepared the psr recommended that the adjustment not be granted because had gone to trial and because had indicated in an interview with the probation officer that he thought the government had a weak case.the court accepted the probation officer view and denied the adjustment,noting that went to trial at his own choice,with adequate counsel,and saying that it would not take into consideration the fact that the plea negotiations were not fruitful.based on a bol of and a criminal history category of i,the applicable sentencing guidelines sentence range gsr was calculated to be to months imprisonment the court sentenced to months.timely appealed.
in his first appeal,challenged both his conviction and his sentence.in challenging his conviction,argued,inter alia,that the judge erred in asking the jury to render a special verdict as to the cocaine amount.instead,argued,the judge should have asked the jury to render special verdicts as to the amount of cocaine each defendant handled individually.did not challenge the jury finding that the conspiracy involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.in challenging his sentence,argued that the district court should have made an individualized drug quantity determination for sentencing purposes.
in our decision in first appeal,we upheld his conviction,but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for.as to the conviction for conspiracy,we held that the court instruction to the jury to find the amount of cocaine did not constitute error because the amount was a factor in sentencing,rather than a factor in conviction,at.as to the sentence,however,we held that the district court failure to make an individualized finding as to drug quantity was reversible error.id.at.we noted that in a conspiracy case,the district court can rely on the drug quantity determination,rather than an individualized drug quantity determination,for the statutory maximum penalty.id.at emphasis added.specifically,we noted that any sentence longer than the maximum corresponding to the amount could trigger review under apprendi new jersey,d,and blakely washington,d,which require a jury to make an individualized factual finding for any element that increases a sentence beyond the statutory maximum,at.in case,however,the sentencing court relied on the jury drug quantity determination to calculate the actual sentence by using the quantity to compute the bol,rather than the maximum sentence.we found that this contravened our holding in united states that when a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a drug trafficking conspiracy,the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.united states,cir,quoted in,at.in reaching this conclusion,we further specified that all of the drugs in a conspiracy may not be automatically assigned to an individual defendant.id.emphasis added citing united states sepúlveda,cir.
because of the sentencing error,we remanded the matter of sentence for an individualized determination of drug quantity attributable to.id.at.however,w ith respect to all other matters,we affirm ed the district court.id.emphasis added.
upon remand for,the district court held a hearing on march,where new evidence bearing on drug quantity was presented,followed by a sentencing hearing on july,where legal arguments were made and a new sentence rendered by the court.the same judge who had presided over criminal trial also presided over the new round of and sentencing hearings.at the hearing,the court advised that the case had been remanded by the appeals court for the sole purpose of making an individualized drug quantity determination and that the prior objections to the psr had been addressed at the original sentencing hearing.nevertheless renewed his request for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.the court ultimately concluded,based on its examination of the sentencing memoranda and the evidence presented during the trial and the various sentencing hearings,that handled,anticipated handling,or could reasonably foresee the possession with intent to distribute of more than five but less than kilos of cocaine,and explained its reasons for the determination.as before,that determination corresponded with a bol of,which in turn resulted in a gsr of to months imprisonment.the court again selected the sentence previously imposed.now appeals this sentence.
as main argument on appeal challenges the district court individualized drug quantity determination for sentencing purposes,we summarize the evidence in the record relevant thereto.
testimony of ángel obregón 
one of the government key witnesses at both criminal trial and at the hearing was ángel obregón obregón.obregón testified at the march,hearing that he worked under luis lloréns at las malvinas.obregón testified about drug sales at las malvinas in various proceedings before the grand jury in,at criminal trial,and at the march,hearing.at the criminal trial and before the grand jury,obregón indicated that there were at least four retail drug sellers at the drug point.obregón also testified at the trial that luis lloréns told him that the drug point sold kg of cocaine per week.obregón testified at the hearing that he saw at the drug point almost everyday,and that whenever came to the drug point,luis lloréns would pay with money from drug sales at the drug point.
obregón testified about cocaine sales to luis lloréns a total of six times in various proceedings.on each occasion he was asked in what quantity sold cocaine to luis lloréns.on the first occasion,before the grand jury in,obregón said provided kilogram quantities eighths.however,in later proceedings,obregón testified that supplied cocaine in both eighths and kilogram half quantities.furthermore,at the criminal trial,obregón admitted that he did not know the difference between an eighth,a half,and one kilogram of cocaine.obregón also gave inconsistent testimony about how many times he saw sell cocaine to luis lloréns.at the trial,obregón initially said he did not remember how many sales he witnessed.later,he said he saw more than sales.later still,he testified that he had only seen sell drugs a couple of times.
at the march,hearing,on by counsel,obregón admitted that he had an extensive history of violent crimes and that he was cooperating with the government.defense counsel also challenged obregón credibility by pointing out that at the trial,obregón said he did not know the difference between one eighth,one half,and one kilogram.obregón responded that he did know that an eighth of a kilogram is less than one kilogram.obregón was also unable to correctly calculate his age,claiming he was or in but that he was only as of march.
testimony of héctor luis 
héctor luis was the nephew of luis lloréns.he testified at the march,hearing that he worked as a drug peddler at the drug point for a total of days,from april,until he was arrested for robbery on may.testified that while he worked at the drug point,it was open every day and that it sold cocaine,crack,heroin,and marijuana.he identified as a wholesale supplier of drugs to the las malvinas drug point.said that sold cocaine to luis lloréns on credit.also said he saw at the drug point twice a week.
provided certain details about the packaging of cocaine.the government asked him,specifically referring to cocaine,powder cocaine,how cocaine was packaged and sold.testified that luis lloréns would give him packages of powder cocaine containing baggies each,which would retail for per baggie.testified that he sold five,six,or seven packages worth of cocaine per week.after asking about the packaging of cocaine,the government asked,w hen you would sell cocaine at that drug point,were you the only seller selling for your uncle at that drug point at the time said that he was not the only seller,and that three or four other people would sell for luis lloréns at the drug point.
testimony of fbi special agent william ortiz and puerto rico police agent héctor.
fbi special agent william ortiz ortiz and puerto rico police agent héctor testified at the march,hearing.both agents participated in the investigation into drug sales at las malvinas.agent ortiz testified that was one of four wholesale drug suppliers to las malvinas.both agents testified that they frequently observed at the drug point.on,both agents conceded that did not appear at all in the hours of surveillance tape the fbi took at the drug point.however,agent orta testified that would always enter the drug point through the rear entrance,where there were no surveillance cameras.
recording by jesús samuel 
agent orta also testified about the contents of a recording secretly made by jesús samuel,who worked for luis lloréns at the drug point in the recording,can be heard talking with luis lloréns about the packaging and processing of cocaine,as well as about when luis lloréns would pay for cocaine the latter had supplied.is also overheard saying that a pot that was being used by one of luis lloréns workers to cook crack cocaine had broken.
e.other evidence 
the judge heard allocution at the march,sentencing hearing.stated that he had always intended to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge,but that he went to trial on the advice of his trial counsel because he could not reach an agreement with the prosecution on the amount of drugs he handled.in order to explain his presence at las malvinas during the period of the investigation,introduced into evidence a certificate from the puerto rico department of housing and public administration showing that he was a resident of the lloréns torres housing project from until.
defendant sentencing memo 
on april,prior to the sentencing hearing,filed a sentencing memorandum with the court argued that the proper amount of cocaine that could be attributed to him for sentencing purposes was one and kilograms.he reached this number by multiplying of a lowest amount that obregón testified to seeing sell to luis maximum number of times obregón said sold cocaine to luis then adding the of a kilogram amount mentioned in the recording by.based on this figure,argued that his bol should be.
g.the district court sentence 
the district court held the sentencing hearing on july,wherein it recognized its obligation,pursuant to this court mandate,to make an individualized finding as to the amount of drugs attributable to in the instant offense of conviction.the district court then stated its determination that handled,anticipated handling,or could reasonably foresee the possession with intent to distribute more than five but less than kilos of cocaine,and proceeded to recount its reasons for that determination.the court first noted that evidence obtained from the drug point indicated that each baggie of cocaine sold at the point contained of a gram of cocaine.testified that each package contained twenty five baggies,meaning that each package contained grams of cocaine.based on testimony that he sold from five to seven packages per day,the district court concluded that even using a conservative figure would distribute at least packages a week,for a total of grams of cocaine.however,the court also noted that both and obregón testified that there were four to five sellers at the point.thus,the court held that the evidence presented certainly corroborates the testimony of both and obregón that at least one eighth of a kilogram,or grams of cocaine was sold per week at the drug point.
the court then recounted the testimony of agents orta and ortiz that they both observed at the drug point on multiple occasions during the course of their investigation,which began in the summer of and was continuing until at least august of.the court also relied on the recording by,in which is heard discussing retail drug sales and the breaking of the pot that was being used to cook crack cocaine.the court noted that is heard saying that he was waiting to be paid for an eighth of cocaine he had sold to luis lloréns.based on this evidence,the court found that knew the amount of drugs being distributed could reasonably foresee that those amounts were being sold at the drug point supplied by him.in reaching its conclusion,the court also found that had extensive knowledge of the drug trafficking activities that took place at the las malvinas drug point.
in determining the proper guideline range,the court stated 
t he applicable case law indicates that in a drug conspiracy the applicable statutory maximum imprisonment term is derived from a perspective.that does not mean that the defendant must have personally handled the drugs for which he is being held responsible.he could be held responsible for relevant conduct,which could include the acts of other conspiracy members,as long as their conduct was reasonably foreseeable for the defendant.
based on its finding that knew how much cocaine was being sold at las malvinas,the court held that if at least one eighth of cocaine was sold every week during the ten month conspiracy should be held responsible for at least five but not more than kilos of cocaine.when combined with a criminal history category of i,the court explained,this amount of cocaine triggered a bol of and a corresponding gsr of to months.
the court then said that it had reviewed the applicable guideline adjustments and considered the other sentencing factors set forth in a.the court also stated that it found the report psr to have adequately applied the guideline computations and satisfactorily reflect ed components of the offense.the court had previously held,at the march,hearing,that since the psr had not changed since the original sentence was handed down,any objections to the original report that had already been ruled on were taken care of and ruled upon by the court.ultimately,the court sentenced,as before,to months.
ii.discussion 
makes two main arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court committed reversible error in its drug quantity determination because the evidence does not support attributing five kilograms of cocaine to him.second,argues that the district court erred in failing to state its reasons for denying his request for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility does not challenge the jury original finding that the conspiracy as a whole involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.
applicable law and standard of review 
a trial court approximation of drug quantity will be upheld as long as it represents a reasoned estimate of quantity.united states huddleston,cir quoting united states webster,cir.such a determination need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.sepúlveda,at.moreover,the drug quantity determination is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate.united states rodríguez,cir.
however,as we explained in previous appeal,in a conspiracy case,the sentencing court can not automatically assign the amount to a defendant.see,at.rather,the sentencing court must make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.id.quoting,at.when determining the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes,the district court may examine the charged conduct plus the relevant uncharged conduct.united states garcía,cir internal citations omitted emphasis added.relevant uncharged conduct is conduct that is reasonably foreseeable by the defendant and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.thus,each is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.rodríguez,at quoting united states santos,cir.
we review the sentencing court interpretation of the sentencing guideline de novo and its determination of facts for clear error.united states sicher,cir.the application of the guidelines is reviewed on a sliding scale between de novo review and clear error review depending on whether the trial judge conclusion is more or more.id.at.here,the application of the relevant sentencing guideline requires a drug quantity determination,which is a purely factual issue therefore,it may only be set aside if it is clearly erroneous.united states olivero,cir see also santos,at united states sklar,cir.under the clear error standard,w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.tsoulas liberty life assur,cir quoting anderson bessemer city,d.
drug quantity determination 
in previous appeal,this court vacated his sentence and remanded to the district court with instructions to make an individualized finding as to whether he either handled or anticipated handling five kilograms of cocaine or could reasonably foresee that the conspiracy would handle that amount,at.in the instant appeal,argues that the district court again failed to properly carry out this obligation,and thus,clearly erred in basing his sentence on the five kilogram amount.first,argues that the district court improperly relied upon the testimony of obregón and in determining drug quantity,as these witnesses lacked credibility.second,he argues that the court erred in its calculations underlying its drug quantity determination.in particular,he argues that the court erred in calculating both the drug amount he personally handled and the amount of cocaine sold at las malvinas each week.finally,he argues that the district court wrongly concluded that he could reasonably foresee the full amount of cocaine distributed by the conspiracy.we address these arguments in turn.
credibility of obregón and 
first,argues that the district court erred in relying on the testimony of obregón and as the basis for its drug quantity determination because they were unreliable witnesses.points out that obregón gave inconsistent testimony both as to the number of times sold cocaine to luis lloréns and as to the amount of cocaine involved in each sale.also argues that obregón lacked the intellectual capacity to be a reliable witness,as manifested by his inability to calculate his own age.furthermore,argues that obregón had a motive to lie because he was a cooperating witness facing charges for involvement in the conspiracy,and that he was receiving payment for his testimony.finally,points to obregón extensive criminal history.
as for,points out that testimony is based on his selling drugs at the drug point for only days.moreover,only personally observed one sale by to luis lloréns all of his other knowledge was hearsay testimony based on what luis lloréns,who died in,purportedly told him.
a district court has broad discretion to make credibility judgments relevant to sentencing.see,huddleston,at webster,at.we will overturn a district court credibility determination only if we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states jones,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a mistake may have been made if d ocuments or objective evidence contradict the witness story,or if the story is so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable would not credit it.united states henderson,cir quoting anderson,at.
we find that w ithin wide limits,not exceeded here,it was the exclusive role of the trial court to decide the weight to give obregón and testimony and whether to use it as the basis of its drug quantity determination.rodríguez,at holding that sentencing court did not clearly err in relying on testimony of witness who was not especially exact in his description of dates,times,weights,and numbers.we acknowledge that there are some internal inconsistencies in the testimonies as to the number of times sold cocaine and the amount of cocaine sold each time.in particular,we note obregón inconsistent testimony about the quantity of drugs sold to luis lloréns.however,the judge,as the finder of fact at sentencing,was free to disregard inconsistent portions of the testimony and credit the relevant credible portions.see united states lara,cir stating that are not required to discard testimony that appears to contain internal inconsistencies,but may credit parts of a witness testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions.
there is,moreover,a further distinction here.the sentence in this case was not based on the amount of cocaine individually handled.rather,the sentence was based on ability to foresee the amount of cocaine.with respect to this aspect of the case,obregón and testimonies are generally consistent,are not implausible on their face,and are not contradicted by the other evidence in the record.both witnesses testified to seeing at the drug point frequently,and this testimony was corroborated by agents ortiz and orta.both witnesses also testified that sold cocaine on credit to luis lloréns,which is something that himself admits.furthermore,as we discuss in more detail below,obregón and corroborated each other testimony about the amount of cocaine retailed at las malvinas.because the testimony of obregón and was consistent as to the two important factors in amount,and the fact that could foresee that do not find the trial court reliance on their testimony to be unreasonable.see huddleston,at holding that n otwithstanding some minor discrepancies in witness testimony,we do not think it unreasonable to believe that the testimony of a man experienced in drug deals was sufficient to establish an appropriate drug quantity quoting united states natanel,cir.
calculations underlying drug quantity determination 
next argues that even if the district court properly credited obregón testimony,it was obligated to calculate the drug quantity attributable to using the lowest amount that obregón said sold per was of a kilogram.relies on the third circuit decision in united states miele,cir,in which that court remanded the case for because of the lower court failure to explain why,when deciding the defendant sentence,it chose to rely on the larger of two drug quantities testified to by a witness.in the present case,argues,the district court should have multiplied of a kilogram by the number of times sold cocaine and then added the of a kilogram referenced in the recording by.this would yield one and five sixteenth kilograms,not five,and result in a bol of only instead of.
we need not reach this issue because the district court did not base its drug quantity determination on the amount of cocaine that personally handled.instead,the court arrived at the five kilogram figure based on its determination that the minimum total amount of cocaine sold at the las malvinas drug point in the course of the conspiracy was five kilograms.because,as explained below,we find no clear error in the district court determination that could foresee that five kilograms of cocaine were involved in the conspiracy,we need not concern ourselves with how much cocaine personally supplied to the operation.we need not address miele because miele deals with a drug quantity determination that was based on what the defendant personally handled,rather than on what the defendant could foresee.at.
also argues that the district court performed shoddy arithmetic in calculating that the drug point sold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine per week.first,argues that the district court incorrectly calculated the amount of cocaine individually sold by.the court noted that according to evidence seized at the drug point,a gram of cocaine would be packaged into ten bags of cocaine,meaning that each bag would contain a tenth of a gram.however,testified that the baggies he sold retailed for.therefore,argues,each of the baggies sold must have contained one twentieth of a gram,not one tenth.thus,if each package contained baggies and sold between and packages per week,then himself sold between and grams of cocaine per week,far less than the minimum of grams that the court calculated.
then notes that the district court reached its figure of one eighth of a kilogram sold per week by multiplying the amount of cocaine sold by the number of retail sellers that said were working at the drug point.argues,however,that doing so was clearly erroneous because did not explicitly state at the march,sentencing hearing that the other sellers sold powder cocaine.it is undisputed that the drug point sold heroin,crack,and marijuana as well as cocaine.argues that because did not clearly state that the other sellers sold cocaine,the district court was obligated to calculate total cocaine sales assuming that was the only person at the drug point who sold powder cocaine.this would mean that there were weekly sales of only grams of cocaine,which is roughly one sixteenth of a kilogram rather than one eighth.
we find no clear error in the district court determination that the drug point sold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine per week.argument hinges on the fact that did not explicitly state at the march,hearing that the other sellers at las malvinas sold cocaine.however,it is clear from the record that the government examination of at that hearing explicitly focused on cocaine.at no point in his testimony did suggest that he was the only seller of powder cocaine.in addition,there is no evidence to indicate that the other sellers did not sell cocaine,or to indicate that they sold substantially less cocaine than.it is therefore reasonable to interpret testimony as indicating that the other sellers sold cocaine in similar quantities.thus,even using figure of between and grams sold by,it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude that all four sellers combined sold at least grams per week.moreover,the gram figure was corroborated by obregón testimony.finally,we note that the district court calculation is consistent with the jury finding that the overall conspiracy involved at least five kilograms of cocaine,although the jury finding was insufficient alone to determine the amount reasonably foreseeable.given that the district court calculation of grams per week was a perfectly permissible view of the evidence,we can not say that it was clearly erroneous,and hence we will not overturn the district court finding.see tsoulas,at.
there is another,essentially independent point.as we discuss below,the district court ultimately concluded that could reasonably foresee the total amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.thus,the quantity of cocaine that is relevant in this case is the total quantity of cocaine,not merely the amount retailed at las malvinas in powder form.the jury in criminal trial found that the amount of cocaine was at least five kilograms,and this finding has never been questioned in either of appeals.therefore,even if the district court erred in its calculation of how much powder cocaine was sold per week,and we do not believe it did,we would still uphold the sentence so long as we found that the district court correctly attributed the amount to.as discussed below,we find that the court was correct.
attribution of amount to 
finally,argues that attributing the full amount of five or more kilograms of cocaine to him was clearly erroneous as it was not established that the amount was foreseeable by him.the district court based its determination that could reasonably foresee five or more kilograms on two primary factors.first,the court noted that was frequently seen at or near the las malvinas drug point.second,the court noted that in the recording made by,could be overheard asking luis lloréns about cocaine sales and discussing the pot that broke while joey oreja was using it to cook crack.
does not dispute that he was occasionally present at or near the drug point or that he talked to people at the drug point.however,he argues that his mere presence at las malvinas can not be used to tie him to drug sales.he notes that he had lawful reasons for being at las malvinas,as he lived in the lloréns torres housing project.he was also a friend of luis lloréns and other persons involved with las malvinas,and at one point was also romantically pursuing a woman who lived in the area.therefore,he argues,his presence at the drug point can not be considered relevant conduct,garcía,at,for the purposes of sentencing.
also argues that the district court improperly used his presence at las malvinas to tie him to retail drug sales,which were beyond the scope of his role in the conspiracy as a wholesale drug seller.although his brief is unclear,appears to argue that where a sentence depends on quantity,a person charged for a particular role in a conspiracy can only be sentenced for the quantity if he had a supervisory role or had multiple roles in the conspiracy.he makes this argument by attempting to distinguish his case from other cases in which this court has upheld the attribution of amounts to defendants who had multiple roles or roles in a conspiracy.see united states,cir court attributed full amount of financial loss in a credit card fraud scheme to defendant who was both a purchaser of merchandise for the scheme and a bodyguard for one of the scheme leaders united states rodríguez,cir court attributed full amount of crack cocaine in conspiracy to defendant who controlled the drug point at which the narcotics were distributed.here,does not dispute that he was at times present at las malvinas for illegal activity.however,he argues that there is no evidence that he participated in retail sales at las malvinas or that he could reasonably foresee the quantity of cocaine sold there.he notes that in hours of videotape collected by the fbi,he was never seen at the drug point at all,much less seen retailing drugs.he admits that he went to the drug point to collect money,but he argues that this was because he sold cocaine to luis lloréns on credit and had to go to the drug point to be paid.argues that this arrangement also explains why he was recorded asking luis lloréns how much money luis lloréns could make from selling cocaine on the street,and asking,w here are my washingtons 
since his sole role in the conspiracy was as a wholesaler,argues that he can not be sentenced for the full five kilograms of cocaine unless he either personally supplied or conspired to supply that amount to the drug point.the government conceded at the sentencing hearing that it could directly attribute less than two kilograms of cocaine to.furthermore,the testimony of various government witnesses indicated that there were at least three other suppliers,and there was no evidence that conspired with them.therefore,argues,the district court should have determined the amount attributable to him by dividing five kilograms by the total number of suppliers to the point.
we find no error,let alone clear error,in the district court finding that i t is evident that knew could reasonably foresee that at least five kilograms of cocaine would be sold at las malvinas.we acknowledge that was sometimes present at las malvinas for lawful purposes,that there is no evidence of cooperation between him and the other suppliers to las malvinas,and that there is no evidence he was involved in retail sales at the point.nevertheless,the evidence relied on by the district court is clearly sufficient to support the court conclusion that had extensive knowledge of the drug trafficking activities that took place at las malvinas.the district court noted that was frequently seen at las malvinas,that he sold cocaine to luis lloréns on credit,and that he was recorded discussing the intricacies of the drug trade.in light of this evidence,we find no error in the district court conclusion.
that only role in the conspiracy was as a wholesale supplier,as opposed to a retailer,is of little importance to this case.in a drug distribution case,the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant for sentencing purposes is bounded initially by the sum of the charged conduct plus his relevant uncharged conduct.united states bradley,cir emphasis added.in this case,the conspiracy charged was a conspiracy to distribute drugs at las malvinas,rather than to las malvinas.thus,retail drug sales could clearly be relevant uncharged conduct for the purposes of the drug quantity determination.what matters in this case is whether the retail sales were acts that were reasonably foreseeable by in furtherance of the conspiracy to distribute drugs at las malvinas.sepúlveda,at.because we find no error in the district court determination that the retail sales were acts reasonably foreseeable by in furtherance of the conspiracy,we find no error in the attribution of the full five kilograms of cocaine to we therefore affirm the district court calculation of a bol of.
denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility 
argues that the district court committed reversible error by failing to explain why it denied his request for a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to.argues that his eligibility for the reduction was a disputed issue of fact,and hence that the district court violated.i b by failing to rule on his request 
under.i b,the sentencing court must,for any disputed matter,rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary.we review a district court compliance with.de novo,and will remand if an error occurred that was not harmless.united states,cir.we review a district court judgment about acceptance of responsibility for clear error.united states deppe,cir.
here,we find no error in the district court compliance with.i b.the psr before the district court upon remand for was the same report that was used in original sentencing.at the march,hearing,the court stated that because the psr was the same as the last time any objections that were made at the last time and taken care of were taken care of and ruled upon by the court.the court then allowed counsel to present her objections again,if she feels it necessary.in response,counsel stated that she and her client renew ed their request for granting points sic for acceptance of responsibility.
it is clear that the request for a reduction at the march,hearing was not a new objection,but rather a reiteration of a previous objection.therefore,it was correct for the district court to rest on its previous resolution of this issue.moreover,the district court properly complied with.i b when it addressed the responsibility issue at the original sentencing hearing.at that hearing,the court had noted that went to trial at his own choice,with adequate counsel.had argued that the fact that he went to trial should not be held against him,because he could not reach an agreement with the prosecutor regarding drug quantity.however,the court had said that it would not take into consideration the fact that the plea negotiations were not fruitful.as we note below,a criminal defendant choice to go to trial weighs very heavily against granting a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility only in rare circumstances can the defendant overcome this effect,and the failure of plea negotiations is generally not such a circumstance.in light of this reality,we find the district court discussion of the responsibility issue at the original hearing sufficient for the purposes of rule i b.because the district court had already ruled on the responsibility issue in compliance with rule i b at the original sentencing hearing,we find no error in the district court decision not to address the issue again at the march,hearing.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the district court sentence.
also challenged his conviction on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of his participation in the conspiracy.we rejected this argument,noting that there was abundant evidence in the record of participation in the conspiracy.id.at.
the recording itself was also part of the record before the sentencing court.
submitted a second sentencing memorandum on may,that expanded on the facts presented in the first memo and provided additional legal arguments.
makes two additional arguments,neither of which merits serious,he argues that the district court violated c by failing to explain why it chose a bol of.however,c does not require the court to explain why it chose an offense level.rather,once a court has determined a gsr based on the offense level,if the sentence range exceeds months,c requires the court to explain why it chose a particular sentence.thus,c does not come into play until after a decision is made on the appropriate offense,argues that the district court committed a technical violation by not stating in section iv b of the statement of reasons why it chose to impose a sentence in the middle of the guideline range,and that this violation constitutes reversible error.does not indicate how he was prejudiced by this supposed technical violation in any way.nor does he provide any support for his argument that this constitutes reversible error.we therefore treat this argument as waived.see united states zannino,cir it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.
a slang term for bills.
moreover,contrary to argument,this court has never held that a quantity attributable to a conspiracy member is dependent on either the number of roles he had or the supervisory nature of his role.the cases on which relies to support this proposition,if properly read,do not help him.in,we did not hold the defendant responsible for the financial damages merely because he had multiple roles rather,we held that because the defendant was a friend of one of the heads of the scheme and served as his bodyguard,the defendant was in a position to know how much money was being stolen.at.in rodríguez,defendant rodríguez role as controller of the drug point made it clear that he could foresee how much crack was sold there.at.
also argues that the alleged failure to ru
