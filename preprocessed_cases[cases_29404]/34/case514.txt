opinion en banc 
manuel appealed from his conviction on one count of armed carjacking,and two counts of related weapons offenses,id.c a,k,asserting various trial errors.he also appealed from his prison sentence of months,which represented an upward variance from the sentencing guidelines range of to months that would otherwise have applied to him.
a panel of this court affirmed vega conviction and sentence,remanding only to correct a discrepancy between the written and oral judgments.united states,wl cir.we granted rehearing en banc to consider the panel ruling that the district judge must provide notice to litigants before imposing a sentence outside the guideline requirement that the panel found satisfied in this case.
the facts in detail can be found in the panel opinion,at,wl,at.pertinently,here the district judge to the sentencing regime established by the supreme court,united states booker,d see also united states,cir en banc to impose a sentence above the range applicable under the sentencing guidelines.he did so after weighing the sentencing factors outlined in a in particular,the nature of the offense and the background of the offender.neither the presentence report nor the government submissions had suggested varying from the guidelines.
the question before us is whether a district court,before sua sponte imposing a sentence outside the recommended guideline range,must automatically provide advance notice to the parties of its intent to do so and its contemplated reasoning.the circuit courts being divided the supreme court is now likely to decide the issue,united states irizarry,cir,cert.granted,d,but until it does,district judges in this circuit are entitled to guidance on an issue potentially present in every sentencing.our answer is that notice is sometimes,but not always,required.
much of the dispute among our sister circuits has concerned the applicability of federal rule of criminal procedure h.the rule provides that 
before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party prehearing submission,the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.the notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.
prior to booker,the guidelines were mandatory save for departures that could be allowed by the district judge only in accordance with rules imposed both by the governing statute and the guidelines themselves.the term departures refers specifically to just such deviations.rule h speaks explicitly of departures,a term with a precise legal meaning.cmt.e united states,cir.departures continue to be available after booker and it is to them that rule h is addressed.
booker has created new latitude for district judges by permitting them to treat the guidelines as advisory and,after calculating the guideline sentence including any departure,to impose a different sentence based on the broader criteria identified in the statute.such deviations have been variously labeled variance is one common they are not departures either in technical terminology or in common parlance.on its face,rule h can not apply of its own force to variances,a distinct concept developed after the rule was promulgated.
it is far from clear whether the drafters of the rule would have included variances within the rule if they had then existed,but it does not matter a formal rule can be changed through the statutorily prescribed rulemaking process,which includes congressional oversight of proposed changes,but it can not be rewritten ad hoc by an individual judge or panel.a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d.so,too,with formally adopted rules.
the more difficult question is whether the reasoning that prompted burns united states,d the decision that rule h be extended without qualification to this new context to establish a judicially created rule requiring automatic advance notice for variances.the supreme court could,and might in the end,choose to do so.but this would be an expansion of burns holding,which was specifically directed to departures 
the court in burns held that courts may not depart from the guidelines if neither the presentence report nor the submissions of the parties had requested such a departure,unless reasonable notice is provided.that requirement was said to be implicit in the demands of a federal rule giving parties the right to comment on matters relating to the appropriate sentence.without notice,the court reasoned,counsel will be unprepared to comment meaningfully on grounds for departure proposed by the judge,resulting in a lack of adversarial testing.burns,at.
there are competing arguments as to whether and how far burns and its rationales bear on variances and the supreme court will answer those questions in due course.but our view is that,in this different context,adopting a mechanical rule would be a mistake it would not respond to the realities of a system in which judges are afforded much broader discretion than in the recent past,it would reinforce guideline sentencing,and it would considerably complicate and prolong the sentencing process.
a advance notice requirement for potential departures fit sensibly within the mandatory guideline regime in place when burns was decided.the guidelines provided for departures,and articulated specific grounds upon which they can and can not be premised,through.although in theory the possible grounds for departure were unbounded,in practice they functioned almost as a set of auxiliary guidelines.see koon united states,d the court must bear in mind the commission expectation that departures based on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines will be highly infrequent.
thus,departures presented a finite number of specific,discrete and often binary determinations that would govern departures and thus the ultimate sentence.it made sense to advise the parties in advance of any proposed departure so as allow them to dispute the facts critical to the departure and to assist the court on pertinent legal questions the premised facts were reviewable for clear error the legal rulings,fully reviewable.e.in short,departures looked much like the customary fare of adversarial litigation.
under booker,rita united states,d,and now gall united states,d,the sentencing inquiry,after calculating the guideline range,is far more broad,and discretionary.under booker,the district court must independently consider the statutory sentencing factors,a,which are phrased in very general terms,the nature and circumstances of the offense the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense.a variant sentence may then be imposed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described.
the district judge draws on information from the trial,the report and the parties commentary,the defendant allocution,victims statements,letters,its own review of these materials before the sentencing hearing and whatever is added during the hearing.throughout the hearing,the judge may well be revising his views depending on what is presented and how counsel respond to questions.this is a fluid and dynamic process and the court itself may not know until the end whether a variance will be adopted,let alone on what grounds.
yet in order to provide advance notice of any value,a district court would have to advise not only that a variance is possible but also the ground and reasoning behind it before he has even heard the full presentation.this is very different than the identification in advance of a particular ground of departure that may or may not be invoked.r equiring advance notice of any ground would undoubtedly prove to be unworkable.united states vampire nation,cir.
further,a mechanical requirement of such notice is unnecessary.in the normal case a competent for incompetence other remedies are anticipate most of what might occur at the sentencing on the trial,the report,the exchanges of the parties concerning the report,and the preparation of mitigation evidence.garden variety considerations of culpability,criminal history,likelihood of,seriousness of the crime,nature of the conduct and so forth should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.
were a mechanical notice rule imposed,some judges would shy away from imposing sentences that the parties had not proposed in advance,increasing the gravitational pull of the guidelines,united states,cir,and compromising the greater freedom sought by booker and rita.see,rita.at holding that a district judge does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the guidelines sentence should apply.alternatively,the judge would often have to employ a burdensome regime,explaining at the end of the first hearing his proposed sentence and then conducting a hearing based on such notice.
the preferable solution is thus not a mechanical rule mandating formal notice in every case where the judge may conceivably vary from the guidelines.rather,when proposing to adopt a variant sentence relying on some ground or factor that would unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel,a judge must either provide advance notice or,on request,grant a continuance in order to accommodate a reasonable desire for more evidence or further research.no formal rule is required for us to adopt such a prudential policy as a matter of precedent.
in practice such cases of unfair surprise,probably rare,are not that hard to identify and this case is not one of them.here,the district judge relied primarily on three particular details of the it involved the invasion of a home,death threats and a firing of a that vega had been previously arrested but not convicted on charges of violent crime.the details of the crime were well known to counsel and vega had admitted his prior brushes with the law which were noted in the report 
defense counsel may not have anticipated that the district judge would rely upon those particular facts to impose an sentence,but having that knowledge in advance would not have made any obvious difference.the facts themselves were familiar and undisputed,so there is no concern here that counsel might have been able,with notice,to challenge them.and nowhere else in the law is the judge required to explain his reasoning before counsel have argued to him.
in granting rehearing en banc we invited supplemental briefing not only on the panel automatic notice requirement but on whether there was unfair surprise in this case.defense counsel have added new arguments to those earlier presented to the panel.but we agree with the panel original view that unfair surprise has not been established.at sentencing defense counsel had ample opportunity and incentive,without any advance notice of a possible variance,to make the same arguments now offered to us.
first,vega submits that mitigating evidence about his family circumstances could have been offered.but mitigating evidence would have been relevant to sentencing with or without a variance from the guideline range.the principal factor cited,the death of vega father shortly before the crime,was readily detectable by counsel and potentially useful to argue for a lower sentence within or under booker below the guideline range.
next,vega contends that a carjacking that involves invading a home is no worse,for purposes of the section a factors,than an ordinary carjacking.we fail to see how further notice was necessary in order to prepare that argument about the seriousness of the offense typical sentencing consideration.comparing and contrasting a defendant particular crime to its heartland prototype is always relevant.that the judge might think that a home invasion carried an extra sense of menace is hardly a surprise.
finally,vega says that the death threat and firing of the gun were already taken into account by the guidelines,and that with more notice,defense counsel would have been prepared to point that out.but a factor that is worked into the guideline calculus may still be considered by a district judge in the section a analysis.see,united states scherrer,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.anyway vega counsel did requiring any special the enhancements provided in the guidelines were sufficient.the district judge simply did not agree.
parts i,ii,iii a,and iii c of the panel opinion are reinstated vega conviction and sentence are affirmed and the case is remanded for correction of the written judgment.
it is so ordered.
the circumstances that force me to state my views at this time leave me no alternative but to partially emulate justice felix frankfurter response to similar constraints,about which he stated 
time is required not only for the primary task of analyzing in detail the materials on which the court relies.it is equally required for adequate reflection upon the meaning of these materials and their bearing on the issues now before the court.reflection is a slow process.wisdom,like good wine,requires maturing.
moreover,the judgments of this court are collective judgments.they are neither solo performances nor debates between two sides,each of which has its mind quickly made up and then closed.the judgments of this court presuppose full consideration and reconsideration by all of the reasoned views of each.without adequate study there can not be adequate reflection.without adequate reflection there can not be adequate deliberation and discussion.and without these,there can not be that full interchange of minds which is indispensable to wise decision and its persuasive formulation.
the circumstances being what they are,i am forced,deeply as i regret it,to reserve for a later date the full expression of my views.
reid covert.frankfurter,reserving.
this solution is,of course,hardly a satisfactory one,as it would leave me,an active member of this court,without an effective voice and vote at a crucial juncture in this result which affects the substantive rights of the parties to this appeal.i believe that the parties are entitled to the benefit of my views,even if they are considered to be in error by some of my colleagues.
although i am in substantial agreement with the views expressed by judge lipez in his excellent dissent,i am also deeply concerned by the serious policy,procedural,and substantive issues raised by the unwarranted haste which has characterized this en banc proceeding.accordingly,i must state my views,even if in a preliminary and incomplete fashion.
the convocation of this particular en banc proceeding highlights the whimsical and uneven manner in which this circuit often applies the rehearing rules.indeed,both the granting and denying of petitions for these extraordinary proceedings evince a with respect to which issues are deemed meritorious of such review.see,cerqueira american airlines,wl cir,torruella,dissenting.time constraints do not allow for an exhaustive inventory of this asseveration,but the circumstances of this present appeal demonstrate one such example.
in this case,before either the appellant or the appellee had the opportunity to seek en banc review,the court undertook a rather unusual procedure and ordered en banc rehearing sua sponte.the appeal thus metamorphosed into one more relevant to,and reflective of,a judicially fueled agenda.that agenda became evident in light of the government own change of heart both sides now agree that rule h applies to variances.furthermore,the issue for which the en banc court was convened is presently before the supreme court,see united states irizarry,cir,cert.granted,d,and will most likely be decided in a definitive way before june.at a minimum,circumstances would seem to counsel awaiting the decision of the supreme court rather than unnecessarily investing our limited judicial resources on this one.
in any event,i am opposed to the majority disregard for the unequivocal language of rule h and the clear mandate of the supreme court in burns united states,d.specifically,in burns,the court observed that the purpose of rule was to promote focused,adversarial resolution of the legal and factual issues.id.at.the court recognized that in the absence of notice,parties would make arguments in a random and wasteful way by trying to anticipate and negate every conceivable ground on which the district court might choose to depart on its own initiative or,worse yet,the parties may not even try to anticipate such a development,and leave the contemplated grounds untested by the adversarial process.id.
the majority opinion substitutes these requirements with what is,in effect,an unauthorized amendment to rule by this court.the majority has concocted a vague standard for notice which will inevitably lead to interminable litigation as to what a competent and reasonably prepared counsel would have anticipated.op.at.this will undoubtedly have the effect of causing more delay and a greater waste of judicial resources than the occasional continuance forecast by the majority opinion were the rule standard to be followed.see op.at.the fact is that such continuances might be necessary in only a handful of cases in any event,the postponement of sentencing is a minor inconvenience to the judicial system when weighed against the basic due process protections afforded by the rule notice requirements.see burns,at.noting that were we to read rule to dispense with notice,we would then have to confront the serious question whether notice in this setting is mandated by the due process clause emphasis added.i dissent.
i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that the reasonable notice required by burns united states,d,and federal rule of criminal procedure h is inapplicable to guidelines variances.the majority rejection of a reasonable notice requirement in favor of a new standard based on whether some ground or factor would unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel leaves district court judges without the very guidance the majority purports to offer them.indeed,the government now also agrees that the reasonable notice required by burns and rule h must apply to guidelines variances to ensure full adversarial testing of the issues related to sentencing.
moreover,having further considered the issue in the context of en banc briefing and argument,i have become convinced that the reasonable notice requirement means notice of a possible variance being contemplated by the judge in advance of the sentencing hearing.such prehearing notice is most consistent with rule directive that parties be given the opportunity to comment on matters relating to an appropriate sentence.i c.this rule does not mean that every failure to give prehearing notice will require a new proceeding.such errors lend themselves to harmless error review.in this case,however,i can not find that the error was harmless,and i therefore would vacate vega sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing.
my conclusion that notice may be deemed reasonable only if given in advance of the sentencing hearing is informed by multiple considerations.most importantly,the interest at stake for the length of not be more critical,even when the potential difference in a defendant sentence would be merely a matter of months.whether or not the due process clause is implicated the defendant opportunity to comment meaningfully when a court contemplates a sentence outside the guidelines is of utmost importance.
it also is significant,as the panel opinion observed,that implicit in burns and rule h is the understanding that rule h notice would serve as an alternative to the forms of prehearing notice expressly referenced in the rule,the presentence report or a party prehearing submission.united states,wl,at cir,emphasis in original.thus,a rule of notice is more consistent with the principles articulated in burns and incorporated into rule to require counsel to respond to a previously unannounced rationale for a sentence is to deny the very period of deliberation that notice is intended to guarantee.even when competent counsel is familiar with all of the facts of the crime and the general principles of sentencing law,he or she may not immediately appreciate their relevance to the proposed variance from the guidelines.accord united states,cir observing that the key component of the notice requirement is notice in advance of the sentencing hearing.
in addition,a rule of prehearing notice would provide unambiguous direction to both the parties and the court,with minimal burden.we must keep in perspective the small number of cases at issue here.at the en banc oral argument,the government represented that,in most instances,departures or variances are either proposed by the probation department in the presentence report or requested by one of the parties.this understanding that sua sponte variances by the court occur infrequently informed the conclusion reached by the original panel,which included an experienced district court judge.it will be the exceptional occasion when a court must provide its own prehearing notice of a contemplated ground for a variance in such instances,the court would be able to alert the parties with a brief written order.a continuance would be necessary even more rarely,when a rationale for a variance first arises at the sentencing hearing.
moreover,requiring that notice be given as a matter of course before the hearing reduces the possibility that the court will be by a party attempt to secure a sentence.the judge is obviously in a better position to evaluate the merits of a variance if it is proposed in advance.with a rule of advance notice,the government and defendant will have greater incentive to present all arguments for a sentence in their prehearing submissions,facilitating sentencing proceedings that most fairly take into account all relevant considerations.
however,even a rule of advance notice will not eliminate some questions of reasonableness.the content of the notice and its timing in relation to the date of the hearing and the issues to be addressed are elements of reasonableness.as for content,the panel opinion pointed to the requirement in burns that the notice specifically identify the ground on which the district court is contemplating an upward departure.at.a similar requirement should apply to a contemplated variance.any less exacting requirement would impose on the parties the burden of guessing the particular grounds on which the court might choose to increase or decrease the sentence,at,wl,at.
as for timing,reasonableness will depend on whether the parties were given sufficient opportunity to prepare meaningful comment on the previously unannounced ground for deviating from the guidelines.if addressing the court contemplated rationale would require minimal legal research or investigation of facts,a brief period of time would be adequate.but if,for example,the court announced that it might rely on mitigation evidence presented in letters submitted by multiple individuals,the parties might need time to review the submissions and conduct further investigation.in such circumstances,reasonable notice would have to be given far enough in advance of the hearing to accommodate such preparation.
regardless of the complexity or novelty of the court sua sponte rationale,at least some advance warning is crucial to ensure the most effective advocacy and,in turn,the thorough adversarial testing contemplated by federal sentencing procedure,rita united states,d.other circuits also have explicitly adopted this view.see,united states cole,cir n otice given during the course of the sentencing hearing and put into effect less than two hours later was insufficient.united states flanders,cir finding that the court announcement on the first day of sentencing that it might impose a sentence was plainly insufficient under rule h.
a failure to provide reasonable notice will not always require resentencing.in some cases,the reviewing court may be satisfied that lack of proper notice was harmless because it would not have placed the defendant in a position to comment more effectively on the proposed variance.where,for example,counsel had the opportunity to provide a thoughtful response to the court rationale for a variance and where the defendant on appeal offered no additional rebuttal to the court rationale,it would be appropriate to conclude that the lack of notice was harmless.if,however,a def
