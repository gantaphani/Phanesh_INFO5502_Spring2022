in march,a jury found dávila félix guilty of using force and intimidation to rob a bank insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,in violation of a,d,and knowingly brandishing a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii.at the sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that dávila félix qualified for a mandatory life sentence under c.in addition,the court determined that he qualified as a career offender under.the court ultimately sentenced dávila félix to life imprisonment for the bank robbery offense and months imprisonment for the weapons offense,to be served consecutively.the court also imposed a term of supervised release for each conviction,to be served concurrently.
we hold that the record does not support the imposition of a life sentence under the federal three strikes provision,c.nor does the record support the imposition of a sentence under the career offender provision of the united states sentencing guidelines.see.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court to the extent that it imposed such a sentence and remand the case to permit the imposition of a new sentence.
background 
during a period in,dávila félix participated in a series of armed bank robberies in and around san juan,puerto rico.these robberies took place on may,july,july,september,october and november.in march,he was arrested by commonwealth authorities and charged,under commonwealth law,for five of the six armed robberies and related weapons offenses.notably,he was not charged with the robbery or weapons offense that took place on september.dávila félix cooperated with the authorities and ultimately pleaded guilty to the charged offenses.on april,he was sentenced by the commonwealth to six years imprisonment on each of the robbery convictions and to five years for the offenses,all to be served concurrently.
on april,four years after he was convicted and sentenced for the initial robbery charges,and ten months after he was released from prison,dávila félix was indicted on federal bank robbery and weapons charges in connection with the september,robbery of first bank of puerto rico the only robbery that the commonwealth had not included as part of the original march charges.
prior to trial,the government filed an information in accordance with a notifying the district court and dávila félix of its intention to seek a mandatory life sentence under c based upon his prior convictions,which included felony drug offenses as well as violent crimes.in particular,the information included dávila félix prior convictions for the following offenses may,convictions for murder,robbery and two weapons violations june,conviction for two violations of article of the controlled substances act of puerto rico july,conviction for a violation of article of the controlled substances act of puerto rico,reduced to attempted article and april,convictions for bank robbery and weapons violations,all under puerto rico law 
in march,the jury found dávila félix guilty of robbing a bank insured by the fdic,by use of force and intimidation,in violation of a,d,and brandishing a firearm during the commission of the robbery,a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii.
the district court sentenced dávila félix to a life sentence.although the record is less than clear,it appears that the court based this determination on the federal three strikes provision,c.the court also noted that a life sentence was appropriate under the sentencing guidelines.in reaching its determination under the three strikes provision,the court did not consider dávila félix june,and july,convictions for offenses instead,it relied explicitly upon his may,and april,violent felony convictions as the two predicate offenses.
in calculating the advisory range under the sentencing guidelines,the court began with a base offense level of.after applying an additional increase based upon the circumstances surrounding the offense,the court arrived at a total offense level of and a criminal history category of v,which yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of months.the district court then classified dávila félix as a career offender pursuant to a on the ground that he had two prior convictions of crimes of violence.sent.the career offender enhancement resulted in a total offense level of and a criminal history category of vi,which corresponded to a guidelines range of months to life.this enhancement,therefore,increased dávila félix maximum sentence from months to life imprisonment.
the district court ultimately sentenced dávila félix to life imprisonment for bank robbery and months imprisonment for the weapons offense,to be served consecutively.in addition,the court ordered that dávila félix be placed in supervised release for a term of five years for each conviction,to be served concurrently,should he ever be released.
discussion 
dávila félix submits that the district court,in relying upon his april convictions,erred by determining that he qualified for a life sentence under c.he further contends that the court erred by treating the april convictions as a predicate offense under the career offender provision.we discuss each of dávila félix challenges to his sentence in turn 
we first examine whether the district court correctly determined that dávila félix was subject to mandatory life imprisonment under the federal three strikes provision.see c.we review this question de novo.see united states deluca,cir.
dávila félix submits that the plain language of c requires that the instant offense,or third strike,be committed after the defendant conviction for the second strike,in this case the april convictions.he asserts that,because the september,robbery took place before the april,convictions,the district court improperly treated the april convictions as a second strike under the statute.
the government maintains that the district court properly treated dávila félix april convictions as a second strike under the statute because c only requires that the first and second strikes be sequential.
in resolving this question of statutory interpretation,we begin with the plain language of the statute here,the statute reads,in relevant part 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,a person who is convicted in a court of the united states of a serious violent felony shall be sentenced to life imprisonment if 
a the person has been convicted and those convictions have become final on separate prior occasions in a court of the united states or of a state of 
i or more serious violent felonies or 
ii one or more serious violent felonies and one or more serious drug offenses and 
b each serious violent felony or serious drug offense used as a basis for sentencing under this subsection,other than the first,was committed after the defendant conviction of the preceding serious violent felony or serious drug offense.
c emphasis added.
it is undisputed that,according to the plain language of c b,the second violent felony or serious drug offense used as a basis for sentencing must have been committed after the first conviction.the government nevertheless asserts that this requirement only extends to the second offense.in its view of the sequencing requirement in subsection c b,the phrase other than the first should be understood to mean that the second offense must be committed after the first conviction,but the instant offense,for which the defendant would face a mandatory term of life imprisonment,could have been committed at any time.
we can not agree with this interpretation it is simply contrary to the plain language of the statute.the instant offense,which is alleged to constitute the third strike under the statute and serves as the trigger for the mandatory life sentence under c,is a serious violent felony or serious drug offense which the sentencing court used as a basis for sentencing.in other words,it is precisely this third strike that triggers the mandatory sentencing provisions.the instant offense,therefore,must be committed after the defendant conviction for the preceding offense.
although the plain language of the statute suffices,we note in passing that the legislative history also supports dávila félix contention that congress intended a sequential approach to the three strikes law.the house report explains that subsection c mandates that each serious violent felony or serious drug offense used as a basis for sentencing under subsection c,other than the crime for which the conviction became the defendant first strike,be committed after the defendant conviction for the preceding strike,at,wl.the report explicitly refers to each strike and suggests that a defendant conviction of the preceding serious violent felony or serious drug offense in the latter portion of subsection c b specifically refers to each strike to include the third strike,or instant offense.id.at.
notably,a review of other sentencing enhancements similar to the three strikes provision also supports dávila félix interpretation of the language of the statute.see united states luna diaz,cir examining related statutes and determining that they supported the court conclusion with respect to the language of the statute.in addition to the sequential approach taken in the career offender provision of the sentencing guidelines,which contains language very similar to the federal three strikes law,see discussion infra pp,we recently acknowledged that a sequential approach is required under the armed career criminal act acca,e.see united states pratt,cir explaining that,in order to establish a violation of g,the government must prove,among other things,that the defendant had been convicted of a felony prior to his possession of the firearm.additionally,in b a,which provides for a sentencing enhancement for repeat drug offenders,congress explicitly adopted a sequential approach if any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final,such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than years and not more than life imprisonment the district court therefore erred in treating dávila félix april convictions as predicate offenses under c.
on the record before us,dávila félix june and july drug convictions identified in the information can not serve as a serious drug offense for the purposes of c such that they would qualify as a second strike under the statute in order to qualify as serious drug offenses,dávila félix convictions must have been for conduct that involved a drug quantity sufficient to be punishable under sections b a,or b a of title.see c h.
in july,dávila félix was convicted for a violation of article of the controlled substances act of puerto rico,which provides,in relevant part,that it is unlawful for any person,knowingly or intentionally,to possess any controlled substance,unless such substance was obtained directly,or pursuant to a valid prescription or order from a practitioner,while acting in the course of his professional practice,or except as authorized by this chapter.laws ann.tit,a.because,unlike the predicate offenses in c,the statute of conviction prohibits only simple possession and makes no mention of drug quantity,this conviction does not fall within the definition of a serious drug offense under c.see c h.
in june,dávila félix was convicted for two violations of article of the controlled substances act of puerto rico,which provides,in pertinent part 
a except as authorized by this chapter,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally 
to manufacture,distribute,dispense,transport or conceal,or possess with the intent to manufacture,distribute,dispense,transport or conceal a controlled substance.
to produce,distribute,or dispense,transport or conceal,or possess with the intent to distribute or dispense,transport or conceal an adulterated substance.
laws ann.tit.
even if we were to assume that the commonwealth court records were sufficient to establish that dávila félix was convicted of distribution or possession with intent to distribute,as required by b a,rather than concealment,which is not a qualifying offense,see discussion infra pp,they would not be sufficient to establish that dávila félix june convictions constitute a serious drug offense under c h.as the government appeared to concede at sentencing,of the puerto rican code establishes fixed penalties based on drug type and the circumstances of the offense,rather than drug quantity,and there is,therefore,no indication that the offense would have been punishable under b a.accordingly,neither drug conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense for the purposes of c.
in addition to determining that dávila félix qualified for a mandatory life sentence under the three strikes provision,the district court also determined the sentence it would impose under the sentencing guidelines.in so doing,the court classified dávila félix as a career offender based upon two prior convictions for crimes of violence.before us,dávila félix contends,and the government concedes,that the sentencing court improperly applied the career offender guideline because the september,robbery took place before he was convicted and sentenced,on april,for what the court deemed to be his second prior felony conviction under.whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under is a question of law that we review de novo.united states almenas,cir 
under the guidelines,a defendant is classified as a career offender if the following three criteria are met 
the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
a see also almenas,at.it is the third criterion that is at issue here.
the district court took the view that the third requirement was fulfilled if the defendant had been convicted of two qualifying offenses prior to sentencing in the instant offense.the parties now agree that the district court reading of the third requirement is erroneous and that the reading adopted by the second circuit in united states chartier,cir,which requires that a defendant be convicted of two qualifying prior offenses prior to the commission of the instant offense,is consistent with the language of the guidelines.
the parties are correct.again,the plain language of the guidelines provides the basis for our decision.under the guidelines,the term two prior convictions means the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.c emphasis added.the fact that the september,robbery,the instant offense,took place before dávila félix was convicted on april,for the string of robberies does not fit within the definition of two prior felony convictions provided in c.given the plain language of the career offender guideline,the district court improperly considered the april convictions to be a prior felony conviction.
further,despite the government argument to the contrary,dávila félix june,drug convictions do not constitute a controlled substance offense,which also might qualify as a second predicate offense for purposes of the career offender provision.see b.on the record before us,the information presented regarding these drug convictions simply does not contain the requisite information that would permit a court to determine whether they indeed constitute controlled substance offenses as defined by b.
the government bears the burden of establishing that a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes.see united states bryant,cir.here,with respect to dávila félix june drug convictions,the government provided certified copies of the judgments,which imposed concurrent sentences of ten years for two violations of article of the controlled substances act o
