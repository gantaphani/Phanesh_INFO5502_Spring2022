tin yat chin was convicted of one count of impersonating a federal officer and three counts of tax evasion after a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gershon.to support his claim that he was misidentified before and at trial,tin yat chin proffered customer copies of credit card transaction receipts as part of an alibi notice and the testimony of a language expert that tin yat chin,a native cantonese speaker,could not have faked the mandarin accent attributed to the impersonator by government witnesses.the district court excluded the receipts as unauthenticated under.and it limited the expert testimony to the linguistic differences between cantonese and mandarin and the expert opinion that tin yat chin is a native cantonese speaker.
on appeal,tin yat chin contends that the receipts were authenticated and admissible,and that the district court limitation on his language expert testimony was an abuse of discretion.we agree,in part.specifically,we hold that the receipts were authenticated and admissible as,and the erroneous exclusion was not harmless but the limitation on the expert testimony was proper.based on the district court exclusion of the receipts,we vacate tin yat chin conviction and remand for a new trial.
background 
between and,a swindler,simultaneously impersonating both an immigration lawyer and an officer of the immigration and naturalization service ins,promised chinese immigrants work visas for their foreign relatives in exchange for cash payments.primarily through intermediaries,the swindler collected various documents and information from victims,prepared written contracts,and provided receipts for the payments,but he never produced a visa for any of his victims.
in,the swindler rented an apartment from sui seng wong,on street in brooklyn,new york,under the pseudonym qing zhao.in furtherance of the scheme,he opened an office,hiring lai fan lok lao as a secretary to answer the telephone,accept cash payments,write receipts,and collect documents from the victims.using another pseudonym,mok wah,the swindler promised chinese immigrants visas in exchange for about each.he usually demanded half the money in advance.
the following year,the swindler closed the street office and disappeared with his victims payments.then,using yet another pseudonym,jun li,he rented an apartment on fourth avenue in brooklyn from lolita eng,who testified that her tenant held a copy of the lease in an unusual manner the purpose of which the government claims was designed to avoid leaving his fingerprints on the document and he rented and paid her by money order.
at the fourth avenue location,the swindler established a new office,mei dong immigration service,where he used the pseudonym tan dau.the swindler retained wan yi li as his secretary to prepare form contracts,provide receipts for cash payments,and translate cantonese.according to the testimony of wan yi li and numerous victims,the swindler spoke chinese,primarily in the mandarin dialect,but occasionally in cantonese with a mandarin accent.
in june,wan yi li accompanied the swindler to china,where she acted as a translator and escorted customers to the chinese consulate.one of the victims,chau hoang dang,who had already paid the swindler tens of thousands of dollars,also went to china to meet the swindler.in july,wan yi li brought chau hoang dang to a hotel to meet the swindler.in wan yi li presence,the swindler demanded that chau hoang dang pay an additional or else her relatives would not get their visas.he also threatened to hire someone to murder chau hoang dang on her return to new york if she failed to produce the cash within two weeks.
wan yi li returned from china in august.by this time,the swindler had closed his fourth avenue office and disconnected his beeper.
in,tin yat chin was arrested as the suspected swindler.chau hoang dang and other witnesses identified tin yat chin as the swindler.tin yat chin acknowledged the potential existence of a swindler,but claimed that he had been misidentified by a group of victims desperate to recover their money or to minimize their own criminal liability for participating in a scheme with the swindler to bribe chinese immigration officials.
the government indicted tin yat chin for one count of impersonating a federal employee of the ins,in violation of and three counts of tax evasion for failing to declare his illegally acquired payments as income in,and,in violation of.
in january,following a jury trial,tin yat chin was convicted on all four counts.he was sentenced to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,a special assessment,and in restitution.the district court declined to group the four counts and enhanced tin yat chin sentence for various reasons,including sophisticated concealment on the tax evasion counts.
procedural history 
witnesses,primarily victims and their relatives and others with business connections to the swindler,testified at trial.eleven victims and their relatives identified tin yat chin as the swindler.however,two of these witnesses admitted that,before picking tin yat chin out of a photo array,they had viewed a photograph of him that appeared in a november newspaper article about the immigration scheme.two other victims who had limited or no contact with the swindler were unable to identify tin yat chin.the daughter of one of the victims,who was ten years old when she saw the swindler,selected tin yat chin from a photo array,but was unable to identify him at trial.at trial,another victim misidentified a deputy united states marshal as the swindler.
tin yat chin was also identified by wan yi li,who worked as his secretary for almost a year,and by eng,his landlady at the fourth avenue apartment.eng contact with the swindler was limited,however.the swindler first landlord,sui seng wong,identified tin yat chin with difficulty from a photo array,but was unable to confirm her identification in court.
based on perceived weaknesses in the witnesses identifications at trial,tin yat chin energetically pressed his central defense theory misidentification.
exclusion of the credit card receipts 
before trial,the government alleged that between june and august,tin yat chin traveled in china under the pseudonym tan dau.the government also noted that tin yat chin had been unemployed between and tin yat chin responded with an alibi notice and moved in limine to admit into evidence copies of credit card transaction receipts,allegedly bearing his signature,showing that he was in a queens,new york,richard sons store and a queens key food supermarket at the time government witnesses would testify that he was in china.a collection of receipts,including the richard receipt,dated july,and the key food receipts,dated july,and,were produced by tin yat chin wife while tin yat chin was detained in a federal correctional facility pending trial.at the time of his arrest,tin yat chin had on his person a september key food receipt similar to the ones from july.
tin yat chin and his wife are joint holders of the credit cards at issue.both the merchants and the credit card companies routinely destroyed their copies of the receipts eighteen months after the relevant purchases in accordance with standard industry practice.tin yat chin,however,proffered that his wife would testify that she had not made the purchases in question the store managers would testify about how the customer receipts were produced,including that a the terminal generated a credit card transaction slip which the customer had to sign to complete the transaction and b the merchant white copy contains the customer ink signature and the customer yellow copy contains an impression of the customer signature and,finally,a handwriting expert would testify that tin yat chin signatures on the yellow receipts were genuine.
trolling the federal rules of evidence,tin yat chin argued that the receipts were admissible as or,in the alternative,as business records duplicates or under the residual hearsay exception.however,the district court excluded the receipts as unauthenticated under.and therefore refused to admit them under any other evidentiary rationale.
specifically,the court held that tin yat chin proffer fail s to provide a rational basis for concluding that the receipts are in fact customer copies of records of purchases made on particular dates at particular stores by tin yat chin.united states tin yat chin,d.the court appeared to question the authenticity of the receipts in general,but emphasized,in particular,that tin yat chin offers no evidence by any witness or any document that can establish that his signature was placed on them at the time and place he proffers.id.at.therefore,tin yat chin was not permitted to introduce the credit card receipts to show that he was in queens at the time the government said he was in china.
the language expert testimony 
the victims of the immigration fraud generally described the swindler as speaking in mandarin or in cantonese with a mandarin accent.one victim even testified that she could tell the swindler was a mandarin speaker who was trying to speak cantonese.moreover,wan yi li,the swindler second secretary,testified that the swindler hired her to translate cantonese.finally,tin yat chin brother confirmed that tin yat chin was a native cantonese speaker,with limited mandarin skills,which he acquired from a single college language course.
in support of his misidentification defense,tin yat chin offered a report prepared by a linguist,julie tay,which concluded that it would be extremely difficult for tin yat chin to fake a mandarin accent.based on her report and accompanying testimony,tin yat chin proposed to argue to the jury that because he could not have faked the mandarin accent attributed to the swindler,he had been misidentified.
the district court held a hearing to determine whether tay expert testimony was admissible under.the court inquired into her qualifications and the basis for her conclusions.
tay is fluent in english,cantonese,and mandarin.she holds a in linguistics and anthropology and an in anthropology,and she teaches mandarin and cantonese at the wossing center for chinese in chinatown,new york city.as executive director of the wossing center,she assesses the dialect and accent abilities of students and prospective instructors.her professed expertise on whether an individual could fake an accent is based on her studies of social linguistics and language acquisition from which she determined that,except for scripted conversations,one can not discard an integral part of the overall speech habit,such as an accent,without significant deliberate practice.
when the court asked whether there was any literature concerning deliberate acquisition of an accent,tay responded that the salient literature was black english.tay derived her conclusions mainly from everyday experience and from her vague recollections of her studies of linguistics in the,including the nigerian situation and mongolianism in india.
her conclusion about tin yat chin inability to fake a mandarin accent was based on an interview with tin yat chin brother and a minute conversation in cantonese with tin yat chin,during which he spoke for only fifteen seconds in mandarin the dearth of mandarin schools in the united states in the and,thus minimizing the likelihood that tin yat chin had formally studied mandarin and the impossibility of acquiring a mandarin accent through.
the court allowed tay to testify as an expert,but limited her testimony to the differences between cantonese and mandarin and her opinion that when she spoke with chin he sounded to her as if he were a native cantonese speaker.
the court held that generalized assumptions about the accessibility of mandarin studies in the and did not satisfy rule standards for validity,and a conversation in mandarin was inadequate to satisfy rule requirement that the testimony rest on sufficient data.the court also held that,based on general information and literature with which she was admittedly unfamiliar,tay was not qualified to determine whether a particular individual could deliberately fake a mandarin accent.
tin yat chin now appeals his conviction and sentence.
discussion 
as detailed below,we hold as follows the copies of the receipts satisfy the authentication requirements of rule,are admissible as,and their exclusion was not harmless error.the district court limitation of tay testimony was not an abuse of discretion.on remand,however,tin yat chin may fortify his proffer of tay testimony in a manner that addresses the district court concerns.
a.the credit card receipts 
authentication 
the government concedes,as it must,that tin yat chin offered compelling circumstantial evidence that the receipts were generated at the times and places designated on the receipts.thus,the parties have narrowed their authenticity dispute down to whether tin yat chin himself signed the receipts at the times and places indicated.there may be questions about the ultimate reliability of the receipts as proof of tin yat chin alibi,but the district court applied an unreasonably high standard for their authentication under rule.
a district court has broad discretion to determine whether a piece of evidence has been properly authenticated.united states tropeano,cir.
rule provides that t he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.a.rule does not erect a particularly high hurdle,and that hurdle may be cleared by circumstantial evidence.united states dhinsa,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the proponent is not required to rule out all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,or to prove beyond any doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.united states pluta,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.rule requirements are satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.id.internal citation and quotations omitted.
once rule requirements are satisfied,the evidence persuasive force is left to the jury.dhinsa,at quoting united states ortiz,cir see also tropeano,at authentication of course merely renders evidence admissible,leaving the issue of ultimate reliability to the jury.as we recently explained in scs communications,v.the herrick,cir,the other party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence,to minimize its importance,or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning,but these and similar other challenges go to the weight of the to its admissibility.
the evidence that the receipts were signed by tin yat chin at the times and places where they were generated is contradicted by testimony of government witnesses who place him in china in july.another person,such as tin yat chin wife,a of the credit card,may have signed the originals which,having been destroyed,can no longer be compared to the copies bearing tin yat chin signature.alternatively,store employees may have permitted tin yat chin wife either to complete the transactions without a signature or to separate the yellow copies and affix her signature to the merchant copy,allowing her husband to sign the customer copies at a later date.these doubts about the ultimate reliability of the receipts,however,do not justify their exclusion under rule minimal standards for authentication.
the combined proffered testimony of tin yat chin wife that she had not made the purchases,the store managers regarding their transaction practices,and a handwriting expert identifying tin yat chin signature was sufficient to satisfy rule authentication requirements.
the district court also questioned,in particular,the authenticity of the july,richard sons receipt.the accompanying charge card receipt lacked a date,and m ost significantly,the expiration date of the charge card imprinted on the sales slip is,but the expiration date handwritten on the charge card receipt bearing defendant signature is.tin yat chin,d at.because the discrepancy between expiration dates was not raised by the government or the district court during argument on the motion in limine,tin yat chin had no opportunit
