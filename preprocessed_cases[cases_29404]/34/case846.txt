defendant appellant norby marin moreno marin appeals from an august,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,convicting her,following a jury trial,of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of,a,and b a,and possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of a and b a.the district court sentenced marin to months incarceration,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment.on appeal,marin contends that the district court erred in denying her pretrial motion to suppress the approximately kilograms of heroin found hidden in four perfume canisters in her luggage after she consented to a search of her motel room and bags on the day of her arrest.marin first contends that the district court erred in concluding that exigent circumstances supported the warrantless entry of drug enforcement agency dea agents into her room and that her consent to search was a fruit of this illegal entry and was therefore invalid.she next argues that even assuming the agents warrantless entry was justified by an exigency,her consent to search was not voluntary.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the district court did not err much less clearly err in determining that exigent circumstances justified the agents warrantless entry into marin room.further,we find no error in the district court finding that marin consent was voluntary.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court 
background 
evidence at the suppression hearing 
the following background is taken from the district court memorandum opinion and order denying marin motion to suppress and from the testimony of dea special agents salvatore aceves aceves and elizabeth at a pretrial suppression hearing before judge charles sifton we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see united states worjloh,cir per curiam see also united states ansaldi,cir.
on the morning of july,aceves,from the dea new york field division,received information from dea special agent richard walsh walsh,who was stationed in bogota,colombia,that over a kilogram of heroin was to be delivered by courier at the metro hotel in queens that very day walsh was working with the colombian national police the cnp on an investigation into a drug trafficking organization that was ferrying large amounts of cocaine and heroin to the united states and into new york city through panama,guatemala,and mexico.pursuant to colombian law,the cnp,working with walsh,had placed taps on the telephones of members of the drug organization.these taps had resulted in previous substantial narcotics seizures.
on this occasion,walsh,who had worked with aceves in the new york office prior to his posting to colombia,contacted aceves from a bogota wire room in which he was listening to calls to and from a phone associated with a member of the drug organization.walsh called to alert aceves to the impending heroin delivery in new york city.walsh relayed information to that the drug courier would be at the metro hotel and that the courier name was norby as walsh obtained it from the interceptions.by approximately on july,aceves had learned from walsh over the course of several conversations 
that a heavyset hispanic woman named norby would be at the metro hotel in room with approximately grams of heroin and that she be waiting for a male known only as pintora to arrive and that either he or someone would arrive to receive the heroin that he would be giving her.aceves was also told by walsh that beforehand,pintora would contact norby and he would tell her that he was calling on behalf of el tio,which means the uncle t hat was their code to her for her to proceed as scheduled.
walsh informed aceves that norby was already there and that the transaction would take place at any moment,according to the intercepted conversations.
after receiving this information from walsh,aceves drove to the metro motel,arriving at approximately noon.he established surveillance of the motel by parking his van in the parking lot outside room so that the van faced the exterior door of room,which opened onto the parking lot,from about feet away.aceves was soon joined by six other dea agents,including,who was in charge.by about,the agents had formed a perimeter around the motel.agents were stationed in aceves van facing room in a second van also parked in the gravel parking lot inside the motel,in a common area and on queens boulevard near the motel main entrance.
at approximately,as this perimeter was still being established,aceves observed a heavyset hispanic woman matching walsh description in the parking lot of the metro motel he saw her approach the exterior door of room.the woman,who was later revealed to be marin,was carrying one or two small plastic bags and she held a cell phone to her ear.she stepped inside room,leaving the door open,and then after a few seconds stepped outside again and looked around the surrounding area she repeated this movement twice before finally entering the room and closing the door.
marin had been inside room for approximately half an hour when the agents discovered that in addition to the exterior door that opened onto the parking lot where aceves van was stationed,room also had an interior door that opened into an interior corridor of the motel.the agents were immediately concerned that because they had been unaware of the interior door when they first established their perimeter,marin might have left room via the interior door,or pintora or another person might have arrived without their knowledge as agent aceves testified,t he drug transaction could have already taken place while we were merely surveilling the exterior door.an agent was promptly posted in the interior corridor.shortly before,agents,aceves,and special agent david samilo samilo decided that agent would ask a female member of the motel cleaning staff to knock on the exterior door of room,with agent standing beside her,in the hope that by this measure might ascertain who was inside.
shortly thereafter,the motel housekeeper,accompanied by,knocked on the exterior door of room and announced room service or maid service or s omething to that effect.the housekeeper wore a solid color uniform dress.was dressed in plain clothes a short sleeved white golf shirt and khaki green capri slacks but also wore a inch gold badge on her hip that identified her as a dea agent.as the housekeeper knocked on the door to room,samilo,followed by aceves,approached the door from aceves van.both agents were wearing badges and vests over their shirts.
marin opened the door in response to the housekeeper knock.she made eye contact with the maid,and smiled,but when she saw,the smile dropped from her face,and she went to slam the door in face,who did not have her weapon drawn and was unaware whether marin was armed or had another person in the room,first put up her hand to block the door,announcing calm,tran q uila and we are the police,and then,as marin resisted,grabbed her wrist,pushing the door open and calling for agent samilo help.with samilo assistance,the altercation was over within seconds,as successfully handcuffed marin inside the motel room.during that same brief interval,aceves entered the room with his gun drawn and conducted a brief security sweep after ascertaining that no one else was in room,he holstered his weapon.the agents,aware from agent walsh information that pintora or his associate could be arriving to meet the courier at any moment,secured the room by closing the doors.
after marin was seated on a chair,aceves,who is fluent in spanish,spoke with her,eliciting her name,where she was coming from,and when she arrived.he also translated for,who in addition to speaking with marin was responding to phone calls from other agents on the surveillance operation.marin was calm.told her,in substance,that it was in her interest to cooperate and that if there something here that should be here it in your best interest to tell us now while you can before we find it on our own.after a brief interval during which the agents continued to wait for the arrival of pintora or his associate,aceves asked for marin consent to search the room and her bags.marin immediately agreed to the search,adding that her bags had already been searched by customs officials upon her arrival at john kennedy international airport jfk that morning.
after marin orally consented to search,aceves provided her with a written consent to search form,in english,which he then translated into spanish for her,in writing,line by line.the form noted that marin had been asked to permit the search of her room and bags,and stated that she had not been threatened,nor forced in any way to consent.the form provided,in closing,that i freely consent to this search.in addition to writing out the form contents in spanish for marin to read,aceves,who previously worked as a dea translator,also read the form aloud to marin in her native tongue.he confirmed with her that she understood the form contents.the form was then signed by marin,and aceves 
after obtaining marin consent,the agents proceeded to search a black suitcase,a camouflage suitcase,a red handbag,a brown purse,a lime green purse,and various other items scattered about the room.during the search,samilo discovered a metal perfume canister concealed deep within one of the suitcases.the canister was wrapped in clothing.samilo removed the lid and sprayed perfume.he then continued to search the suitcase and discovered three similar perfume canisters.the canisters appeared to be normal perfume canisters however,they were weighted the way a liquid should be weighted.they did slosh around a bit,but they were heavy as if they were full.as aceves and samilo were examining the canisters,marin volunteered that the canisters did not belong to her.aceves pried the interior lid off one of the canisters and discovered a brown substance hidden inside the canister which field tested positive for heroin.
marin and her belongings,including the canisters with the heroin,were then transported to the new york field office for processing.a lab report prepared after marin arrest indicated that the confiscated heroin had a net weight of grams almost precisely the amount that the courier was to be carrying,according to the information relayed by walsh from the intercepted phone conversations in colombia and a purity of percent.according to agent aceves,a nything above a purity of percent would be considered extremely good quality heroin.this is almost i never seen anything above.the canisters each contained a very,very small amount of perfume t he rest of it was all heroin.
the district court decision 
marin was indicted on two counts,for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of,a,and b a,and possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of a and b a.prior to trial,marin moved to suppress the physical evidence seized from her room after a hearing held on november and,the district court denied the motion to suppress the physical evidence.on february,following trial,the court issued an order memorializing its reasons for denying the suppression motion and setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law.see united states marin moreno,cr cps,wl.as relevant here,the district court concluded that exigent circumstances justified the agents entry into marin motel room without a warrant.id.at.the district court cited our decision in united states macdonald,cir en banc,which sets forth illustrative factors to be considered in evaluating whether,given the totality of the circumstances,law enforcement agents were confronted by an urgent need to take action,id.at.drawing on the analysis in macdonald,the court reasoned that exigent circumstances justified entry because 
t he agents were faced with a situation involving the serious offense of narcotics trafficking where it was unknown whether the defendant was armed,or whether she was alone,as the agents reasonably believed an accomplice might have been present in the room where the defendant description and location precisely matched the information obtained by agent aceves from agent walsh,which,having been determined to be sufficiently reliable,and together with defendant observed demeanor,established probable cause that defendant was or soon would be committing the crime where,based on their surveillance,the agents believed the defendant was in the room at the time and the agents entry into the room,while unwelcome and met with resistance,did not result in any injury to the defendant or any damage to the hotel property.finally,the offense involved powdered heroin,which could be disposed of in a toilet at the first indication that dea agents sought to speak with the defendant or gain access to the room.
marin moreno,wl,at citation omitted.
the district court also found that marin consent to search was voluntary.it noted that the following factors weighed against this finding that at least aceves entered room with his weapon drawn that and samilo briefly struggled with marin and handcuffed her prior to her giving of consent and that the agents failed to advise defendant of her right to refuse consent,and that agent advised defendant that it was in her best interests to cooperate.id.at.but the district court found that 
a side from these circumstances marin has submitted no evidence that her consent was not voluntary,and indeed fails to allege that she was coerced into giving consent.the atmosphere of the encounter between the dea agents and the defendant,while clearly not friendly,does not appear to have been unduly hostile.there is no allegation that the agents used intimidating or coercive language or gestures in an attempt to secure defendant consent.
id.the district court emphasized that marin provided oral consent to search immediately upon request and she stat ed that her bags had already been searched at the jfk airport.id.based on all the facts and circumstances,the court concluded that marin consent was voluntary id.
trial began on december.during its,in addition to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and already discussed,the government introduced proof regarding certain telephone calls received on the cellular phone in marin possession while the dea agents were searching her room.the caller in these calls stated that he was calling for norby,on behalf of el tio,further corroborating the information obtained from agent walsh to the effect that pintora would contact norby and tell her he was calling on behalf of el tio before arriving to take possession of the drugs.marin was also shown to have three sim cards at the time of her arrest dea special agent robert garcia testified that drug traffickers commonly possess multiple sim cards,as a cellular phone user can effectively change her number at will by using a new card.finally,proof was offered that upon arriving at jfk,marin listed a false destination address of callow,new york,on her customs declaration.the government called patricia carrasquilla,the individual residing at that address,who testified that she met marin two or three years ago,but had not spoken to her since,and that carrasquilla was unaware marin had traveled to new york in july.
marin testified in her own defense.she described a history of hostility against her family in colombia by local paramilitary groups and claimed that she came to the united states to find out what happened to her two children,who had disappeared.marin denied bringing heroin into the united states and alleged the drugs had been placed in her suitcase after her arrival at the motel as part of an effort by members of these paramilitary groups to frame her.she claimed that she left room to go shopping and,upon returning,found both doors to the room open marin admitted,however,that she did not report this incident to the front desk,but instead took a nap.the dea agents arrived shortly thereafter.marin claimed that the agents turned her around while searching her belongings so that she could not fully see what was happening.she denied ever before seeing the canisters found in her luggage.marin also denied bringing drugs into the country in april,a previous occasion on which she traveled to new york.she admitted,however,that she had listed a cousin address as her destination address on a customs declaration form for that trip when,in fact,she did not see her cousin and she stayed,not with her cousin,but at the metro motel.
the government in rebuttal introduced evidence from the manager of the metro motel to the effect that both doors to room have an automatic mechanism so that they can not be left ajar,much less open,unless the doors are physically blocked from closing.in addition,agent aceves testified contradicting marin that the defendant watched the agents as they searched her bags,and that he personally field tested the substance removed from one of the perfume canisters in front of her,and then informed her that the substance was heroin.
the jury began deliberating on december,and returned a verdict of guilty on both counts that same day.
discussion 
when evaluating a district court decision denying a motion to suppress,we review the district court factual findings for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.worjloh,at.we review de novo the legal issues presented by a motion to suppress.see united states howard,cir.
the reasonableness of police action is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed de novo.united states reyes,cir quoting ornelas united states,d.therefore,the ultimate determination of whether a search was objectively reasonable in light of exigent circumstances is a question of law reviewed de novo.see also,united states goree.given the heavily fact dependent nature of the exigency inquiry,however,the lower court decision will almost invariably rest on factual determinations about the extent of the exigency,and therefore our review is usually,in practice,for clear error.see united states klump,cir.under review,we must be left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed in order to reverse a district court exigent circumstances finding.united states iodice,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we similarly review a district court finding that consent to search was voluntary for clear error.see united states isiofia,cir see also schneckloth bustamonte,d voluntariness is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances.so long as the police do not coerce consent,a search conducted on the basis of consent is not an unreasonable search.garcia united states,cir.
exigent circumstances 
it is,as we have repeatedly said,that the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment must yield in those situations in which exigent circumstances require law enforcement officers to act without delay.united states gordils,cir.thus,p olice officers may enter premises without a warrant when they are in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect.kentucky king,d.and the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence has long been recognized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the exigent circumstances rule is not rendered inapplicable,moreover,simply because law enforcement officers who are not armed with a warrant knock on a door as any private citizen might do.id.at.officers may not gain entry by actually violating or threatening to violate the fourth amendment.id.it is not a violation of the fourth amendment,however,for officers to knock on a door as any private citizen might.if those on the other side of the door react in ways that result in exigencies to which police must respond,occupants have only themselves to blame for the warrantless search that may ensue.id.
we employ an objective test in deciding whether an exigency justified a warrantless intrusion on fourth amendment interests,one that turns on an examination of the totality of circumstances confronting law enforcement agents in the particular case.macdonald,at.we have often referred to six factors as guideposts for determining the existence of exigent circumstances 
the gravity or violent nature of the offense with which the suspect is to be charged whether the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed a clear showing of probable cause to believe that the suspect committed the crime strong reason to believe that the suspect is in the premises being entered a likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended and the peaceful circumstances of the entry.
id.at omission in original and internal quotation marks omitted see also united states brown,cir noting that in addition to the macdonald factors,federal courts,including our own,have considered an additional factor,namely whether quick action is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence.these factors are not germane in every exigent circumstances situation,however and we have thus emphasized that they are merely illustrative,not exhaustive,and that the presence or absence of any one factor is not conclusive.gordils,at internal quotation marks omitted.the core question is whether the facts,as they appeared at the moment of entry,would lead a reasonable,experienced officer to believe that there was an urgent need to render aid or take action.klump,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
based on these principles,we conclude that the district court determination that exigent circumstances justified the agents entry into marin motel room was not erroneous,much less clearly so.
given the detailed information from walsh,which the district court found to be reliable,as well as the ample corroboration of this information by the agents observations at the scene,the agents clearly had probable cause to believe that marin was a drug courier and in possession of over a kilogram of heroin based on his covert monitoring of a phone belonging to a member of the drug smuggling organization,walsh provided not only a description of the courier,but specific information as to where she would be found,and when the drug transaction was to occur.marin not only fit the description but was observed entering the very motel room in which the heroin delivery was to take place on the very day of delivery.moreover,the agents observed marin repeatedly enter and exit room and survey the parking that added to their probable cause to believe that marin was about to engage in a drug transaction,as marin appeared to be awaiting the arrival of another individual,engaging in precisely the conduct one might expect of a drug courier seeking to consummate a delivery.see united states montana,cir noting that observations of defendant pac ing back and forth and attempt ing to peer through a car darkened windows supported probable cause to believe that he was a knowing participant in a planned drug pickup.
the agents probable cause was yet again strengthened,as the district court found,when marin suddenly and forcefully attempted to slam her door closed upon seeing agent standing outside her room.marin moreno,wl,at.as we have recognized,a hasty retreat into one home on sight of police manifests guilt and may,in appropriate circumstances,transform suspicion into probable cause.see united states martinez gonzalez,cir finding probable cause where suspect looked frightened and ran back into the apartment in response to agents identifying themselves as police.d eliberatively furtive actions and flight at the approach of strangers or law officers,as the supreme court has said,are strong indicia of mens rea,and when coupled with specific knowledge on the part of the officer relating the suspect to the evidence of crime,they are proper factors to be considered in the decision to make an arrest.sibron state of new york,see also illinois wardlow,d noting that nervous,evasive behavior and h eadlong flight wherever it occurs are not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing,but are certainly suggestive of such.
marin reaction to seeing at her door,moreover,also created an urgent need to enter room to ensure that evidence was not destroyed.marin unusual behavior suddenly and forcefully attempting to slam shut a door she had just opened raised a legitimate concern that she would attempt to destroy or discard the drugs that the agents had probable cause to believe were inside.see king.at noting that evidence destruction is frequent in drug cases because drugs may be easily destroyed by flushing them down a toilet or rinsing them down a drain see also united states atherton,cir noting that we have repeatedly upheld warrantless entries where law enforcement officers reasonably believed that immediate access to the premises was necessary to prevent loss of evidence and collecting cases.this rendered agent entry reasonable for fourth amendment purposes.
marin argues that the district court erred in finding an exigency here because she believed that agent was a robber,not a dea agent,and thus marin had no incentive to destroy her drugs.marin further contends that even if she realized the true identity of the officers,the supreme court decision in king makes clear that an occupant mere knowledge of the presence of agents or police outside,without more,is insufficient to create exigent circumstances warranting the officers entry into the home.marin reply br.at.these arguments are unavailing.
first,marin did not testify at the suppression hearing and did not claim,either on the day of her arrest or before the district court,that she believed agent attired as she was,in a white golf shirt and green capri slacks was at marin door to effect a daytime robbery.moreover,we find no clear error in the district court determination that marin continued to resist efforts to calm her,even after identified herself as police a finding in some tension with marin claim.in any event,even assuming,arguendo,that marin believed agent was a robber when marin attempted to slam the door,this fact makes no difference to the propriety of the agents entry.the supreme court has made clear that a n action by law enforcement agents is reasonable under the fourth amendment as long as the circumstances,viewed objectively,justify the action.brigham city stuart,d last alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted in light of marin behavior and the surrounding circumstances which would not have led a reasonable officer to conclude that marin believed robbers were at her door we find no clear error in the district court conclusion that a reasonable,experienced officer would have recognized an urgent need to take action,regardless of marin undisclosed reasons for her conduct.
similarly and contrary to marin claim,the district court exigency finding is not inconsistent with the recognition in king that when police without a warrant knock on an individual door,that person need not allow the officers to enter the premises and may refuse to answer any questions at any time.king.at.to be clear,police may not knock on a door and then cry exigent circumstances whenever probable cause exists that readily disposable drugs are in the home no matter what the response of the resident happens to be.united states chambers,cir sutton,dissenting.but as judge sutton recognized in chambers and as the supreme court reaffirmed in king where the resident reaction to the appearance of officers is the verbal,visual or aural equivalent of the police are here,destroy the drugs,the traditional rules governing the exigent circumstances exception render entry reasonable.id.at.here,marin did not simply refuse entry by the agents.rather,as the district court found,she attempted suddenly and forcefully to slam the door in agent face and thereafter continued to struggle against her as agent announced she was from the police.marin moreno,wl,at.thus,contrary to marin claim,this is not a case involving an individual knowledge of the presence of agents without more.marin reply br.at.
attempting to avoid this conclusion,marin cites the eighth circuit decision in united states ramirez,cir,which reversed a district court finding that exigent circumstances justified officers warrantless entry into a hotel room.the officers in ramirez,however,first attempted,without any evidence of exigency whatsoever,to enter the defendant room with a key card,and then forced entry when the defendant attempt ed to shut the door on their announcement they were police.id.at.w ithout more,the eighth circuit concluded,merely shutting the door did not bolster the claim that it was reasonable to conclude that the destruction of evidence was imminent.id.but ramirez is simply inapposite here.when the agents knocked on marin door,they had probable cause to believe she was at that moment or would imminently be delivering a kilogram of heroin within the room.marin responded to police,not by declining to speak,but by suddenly and forcefully attempt ing to slam her door closed upon seeing agent standing outside her room,marin moreno,wl,at thus creating a circumstance in which any reasonable,experienced officer would see an urgent need to take action.klump,at.
in sum,we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court erred in determining that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry into marin motel room.indeed,we see no error,much less clear error,in the district court conclusion as to exigency.accordingly,we reject marin claim that the evidence seized from room should have been suppressed as the tainted fruit of an unlawful entry.
marin next contends that even assuming the warrantless entry into room was justified by exigent circumstances,the heroin concealed in her bags should still have been suppressed because her consent to search was not voluntary.the test of voluntariness is whether the consent was the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,united states arango correa,cir,as opposed to mere acquiescence in a show of authority.united states wilson,cir.voluntariness is a question of fact to be determined from all of the surrounding circumstances.arango correa,at.in considering marin challenge,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and will not reverse a finding of voluntary consent except for clear error.united states snype,cir.we find no such error here.
marin argues that,in light of the forcible entry into her motel room by armed agents who both subdued and handcuffed her,failing thereafter to inform her that she was not required to consent,her oral and written consent to search could not reasonably be deemed voluntary.to be sure,these factors are germane to the voluntariness inquiry.in the totality of all the circumstances,however,we see no basis for concluding that the district court clearly erred in its consideration of them.
we have repeatedly observed that neither the fact that a person is in custody nor that she has been subjected to a display of force rules out a finding of voluntariness.see accord ansaldi,at holding that handcuffing and display of guns by five or six officers to effectuate arrest did not render consent to search involuntary united states kon yu leung,cir a finding of coercion does not follow from the fact that the defendant was handcuffed.arango correa,at noting that t he fact that the defendant was in custody for five hours did not compel a finding that his consent was involuntary.here,sufficient time elapsed between the agents initial entry into marin room and her consent to search for marin to calm down after her initial,brief struggle with and samilo.indeed,it is undisputed from the record that marin was calm when agents asked her consent to search.moreover,marin did not allege before the district court that the agents used intimidating or coercive language or gestures in seeking her consent.granted,agents did not explicitly advise her that she could decline.while knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factor to be taken into account,however,the government need not establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent.united states drayton,d internal quotation marks omitted see also ansaldi,at finding valid consent where defendant had been subjected to use of force,was handcuffed,and was asked by agents do you mind if we search and defendant responded sure,go ahead.knowledge of the right to refuse,as we have said,is not a requirement to a finding of voluntariness.garcia,at.
here,marin did not hesitate when the agents requested her conse
