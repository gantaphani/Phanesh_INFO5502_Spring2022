a jury convicted randolph williams of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin in contravention of a,b c.williams appeals his conviction because of a stipulation which was published to the jury over his objection.he argues that this error impinged on his sixth amendment right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.vi.we agree and therefore vacate his conviction.
on january,williams was indicted by a grand jury for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin from september,to october,in violation of a,b c.two,sabrina hutchinson and victor jackson,were also indicted as members of the conspiracy.subsequent to the indictment,williams pled not guilty,charges were dropped against sabrina hutchinson,and victor jackson pled guilty.
on september,the district court held a hearing to discuss pretrial matters for williams trial.the assistant united states attorney informed the court that she wished to enter a stipulation regarding the testing of the drugs at issue.she advised the court that the defendant refuses to sign the stipulation.williams defense attorney then asked the court if it had any problem with her signing the stipulation over the objection of the defendant.the court allowed the defense attorney to sign the stipulation and it was read to the jury.
during the trial,the government presented its theory of the crime.according to the government,the package of heroin was shipped from drug producers in panama to the louisville international airport in kentucky where it was intercepted by law enforcement.from there,if it had not been intercepted,the package would have been shipped to sabrina hutchinson house in spartanburg,south carolina where victor jackson would retrieve it,and then deliver the package to williams.williams,according to the government,planned to distribute the heroin thereafter.
in support of its theory the government introduced several pieces of evidence.first,the united states introduced the testimony of officer eric murphy from the customs and border protection agency,who explained how the alleged heroin arrived from panama and caught his attention.officer murphy subsequently conducted a field test which was positive for heroin.
second,victor jackson,who was williams indicted codefendant,testified that he was asked by williams to retrieve the package in exchange for.during cross examination it was revealed that jackson initially lied to police about his identity and would likely have his sentence reduced based on his testimony.
following this testimony,the government published the stipulation by reading it to the 
united states of america randolph williams also known as red,criminal no,the government and counsel for the defendant,randolph williams,that counsel being lora collins stipulate the following that on october the of the sic lieutenant beth rampey vaughn a certified forensic chemist with the spartanburg county sheriff office forensic laboratory located in spartanburg,south carolina,examined and analyzed the contents of the package addressed to sabrina hutchinson,westover drive,spartanburg,south carolina,and seized by eric murphy of customs and border protection louisville kentucky,that the package was seized on october the of from the ups sorting facility and submitted to forensic chemist rampey vaughn under ice file no,that forensic chemist rampey vaughn who has been qualified as an expert in the analysis of controlled substances in both state and federal courts within the district of south carolina determined that the package contained a total weight of of heroin,a schedule i controlled substance.we do so stipulate,signed by lora collins,attorney for the defendant,and assistant united states attorney regan pendleton in greenville,south carolina.
the government then introduced testimony by officer brian duncan.he testified that he dressed as a ups delivery man and delivered the package to hutchinson house in order to ensure that victor jackson retrieve the package.next special agent paul criswell testified as to the content of an alleged confession by williams in which he detailed the plan to retrieve and distribute the heroin.in,the defense pointed out that despite the custodial nature of williams interrogation,no written statement was ever taken.furthermore,the defense raised questions about whether williams was under the influence of medication at the time of the interrogation.the government also called investigator matt hutchins who verified much of special agent criswell testimony.
the defense called williams to testify on his own behalf.among other things,he testified that he was under the influence of the pain killer percocet at the time of his interrogation by investigator hutchins and special agent criswell.he also contradicted earlier statements regarding any admissions he allegedly made to law enforcement.finally,the government called sabrina hutchinson who indicated that she did not know and had never spoken with williams.
in its charge to the jury,the court indicated that w hen the attorneys on both sides stipulate or agree to the existence of a fact you must,unless otherwise instructed,accept the stipulation as evidence and regard that fact as proved.the court listed the required elements as an agreement existed between two or more persons to possess with the intent to distribute heroin defendant knew of the conspiracy and defendant knowingly and voluntarily became a part of the conspiracy.
during their deliberation,the jury returned several questions to the court including what amount of drugs does it take to qualify for distribution as opposed to.the court replied by indicating that the jury should use common sense but that the more drugs there are,the more likely it is that there is an intent to distribute.the court then retrieved the stipulation,marked it as the court exhibit,and sent it back with the jury.later,the court gave the jury the allen charge to encourage them to reach a verdict and allowed them to go home for the night.the next morning,the jury returned a guilty verdict.the jury also found that williams had intended to possess grams of heroin.
williams sentencing guidelines were prepared relying on a determination that he intended to possess grams of heroin.after disposing of some other objections,the court imposed a sentence of months which was at the top of the guideline range.williams timely filed a notice of appeal.
this court reviews evidentiary rulings implicating constitutional claims de novo.united states abu ali,cir,cert.denied,citing united states rivera,cir.
if we conclude that there is a constitutional violation,then evidentiary rulings of this kind are subject to harmless error review.erroneously admitted evidence is harmless if a reviewing court is able to determine that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states abu ali,cir citing chapman california.
both parties agree that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the stipulation into evidence over williams objection because it violated his right to confront witnesses under the sixth amendment 
admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation.to be sure,the clause ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence,but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee.it commands,not that evidence be reliable,but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner by testing in the crucible of.
crawford washington.though neither party cites to a case from the fourth circuit,both parties cite relevant cases from outside of this circuit which have held that where a defendant objects to the introduction of a stipulation that is nonetheless introduced at trial,a district court abuses its discretion.see hawkins hannigan,cir.
a majority of our sister circuits have held that a defendant attorney can waive his client sixth amendment right so long as the defendant does not dissent from his attorney decision,and so long as it can be said that the attorney decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.united states cooper,cir citation omitted see also janosky amand,cir same united states gamba,cir defense counsel may waive an accused constitutional rights as a part of trial strategy united states plitman,cir same united states reveles,cir same hawkins,at same.
however,other circuits have found that a defendant waiver is required for an attorney to waive a sixth amendment right.see clemmons delo,cir the law seems to be clear that the right of confrontation is personal and fundamental and can not be waived by counsel,cert.denied.carter sowders,cir there must be evidence in the record to support a defendant waiver of a sixth amendment right to confrontation for it to be valid.
while this court is inclined to require that defendants make a clear waiver of their sixth amendment right,the court need not reach this question here since both counsel and the district court were aware that williams objected to the introduction of the stipulation.we can find no reasoning or case law that would uphold a waiver of a sixth amendment right by defense counsel over a defendant objection.
therefore,we find that the district court erred when it accepted the stipulation over williams objection and violated his sixth amendment right 
next we must determine whether williams is entitled to a new trial as a matter of law.to make this determination,this court must consider whether the constitutional violation was harmless.an error will be deemed harmless if the beneficiary of the constitutional error can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.chapman california.
williams argues that the introduction of the stipulation was not harmless.first,he argues that several pieces of evidence presented at trial would not have been admissible but for the stipulation.he also argues that the court use of the stipulation to answer the jury question about defining intent to distribute was highly prejudicial.the government argues that the error was harmless because the overwhelming uncontested evidence was sufficient to prove guilt.
we find that the harm from the stipulation extended far beyond identifying the substance in the package.the harm from the stipulation falls into two broad categories.first,while styled as a stipulation,it essentially established an element of the crime.the government,having already secured a conviction against jackson,established the chain of custody,and verified the identity and weight of the substance in the package,had very little left to prove.
second,prejudice also derives from the jury using the stipulation to determine whether williams had an intent to distribute heroin.the jury question during deliberation what amount of drugs does it take to qualify for distribution as opposed to indicates that the jury was unresolved as to whether the government had met its burden of proof on the first element of the crime.in an effort to clarify the standard,the district court told the jury that the larger the quantity of drugs increases the inference that drugs were possessed with the intent to distribute as opposed to personal use,and then gave the jury a copy of the stipulation.the stipulation was the only evidence of the amount of heroin.
here,it is not difficult to identify the harm caused by the stipulation.the district court handed the stipulation to the jury and thereby indicated that it was important in determining whether williams had an intent to distribute heroin.moreover,the stipulation was marked as the court exhibit,giving it an air of reliability higher than other evidence presented to the jury.when an answer to a jury question is supplied by the trial judge it is thus stamped with the imprimatur of the court.united states,cir finding that a judge indication that codefendants are incarcerated unduly prejudiced a jury verdict.therefore the stipulation was essential to the jury finding that williams was guilty of intent to distribute.
we find that this prejudice alone is enough to require that the conviction be vacated.as a result of the clear prejudice stemming from the stipulation,this court concludes that it created pervasive prejudice and that the government can not come close to proving that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.arizona fulminante.therefore,the court finds that the conviction is vacated and this matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
for the reasons explained above,we 
vacate and remand 
i agree with the majority that the district court violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment at trial in accepting the stipulation that the package seized at the louisville airport contained grams of heroin.i respectfully dissent,however,from the majority conclusion that the error requires a new trial.notably,the stipulation did not connect williams to the seized package or inculpate williams in the charged conspiracy in any way.having reviewed the record in light of neder united states,delaware van arsdall,and the substantive law of conspiracy,i would affirm the conviction.i describe the evidence and the events at trial at somewhat greater length than the majority in order to explain why it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.neder,at.moreover,because the confrontation clause does not apply to the calculation of drug weight at sentencing,i also would affirm the sentence.
the indictment in this case states 
that beginning at a time unknown to the grand jury,but beginning at least on or about september,and continuing through october,in the district of south carolina and elsewhere,the defendants,randolph williams,red timothy ray byrd,victor oneill jackson and sabrina hutchinson,knowingly and intentionally did combine,conspire and agree together and have tacit understanding with each other and various other persons,both known and unknown to the grand jury,to knowingly,intentionally,and unlawfully possess with intent to distribute a quantity of heroin,a schedule i controlled substance,in violation of title,united states code,sections a and b c 
all in violation of title,united states code,section.
williams decided to go to trial and to make the united states prove the three elements of the charged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt 
an agreement to possess heroin with the intent to distribute existed between two or more persons williams knew of the conspiracy and williams knowingly and voluntarily become part of the conspiracy.
see united states reid,cir.williams theory of the case was simple he did not know of the alleged conspiracy or knowingly and voluntarily become part of the alleged conspiracy.
at a hearing on the morning of the first day of trial,counsel for the united states and counsel for williams stipulated that the testimony of the government forensic chemist would show that the package seized at the louisville airport on october,contained grams of heroin.defense counsel agreed to stipulate that the seized package contained grams of heroin as a trial strategy because williams theory of the case was that he did not know about the alleged conspiracy and was not part of the alleged conspiracy therefore,the weight of the heroin really does matter.id.at.over williams objection,the district court accepted the stipulation.id.at.
on september,williams trial commenced.id.at.agent eric murphy,of customs and border protection,testified first.id.at.murphy explained that he examined packages arriving into the united states from outside the united states and was assigned to the louisville international airport in louisville,kentucky.see id.at.on october,murphy was alerted to a package shipped via united parcel service ups from panama,which customs views as a high risk country for drug smuggling.id.at.the package listed a return address in windex,panama and was addressed to sabrina hutchinson,westover drive,spartanburg,south carolina.id.at.

after murphy seized the heroin,he gave the package including the package of heroin to immigration and customs enforcement ice agents in louisville.the ice agents in louisville,in turn,provided the seized package to ice agents in south carolina.id.
next,victor jackson testified.id.at.jackson testified that he had known williams since he jackson was or years old and that jackson was now.id.at.jackson and williams were friends and jackson would sometimes drive williams places and do errands for him.id.jackson had not been employed for about four or five years,lived with his girlfriend sabrina hutchinson at her residence in spartanburg,and was addicted to crack cocaine.id.at.jackson also admitted that he had been convicted of distributing crack cocaine.id.

on cross examination,jackson admitted that he was a crack cocaine addict and had sold bootleg copies of cds and dvds to williams.id.at.
the prosecutor then read the stipulation to the jury.id.at.before the prosecutor read the stipulation,the court instructed the jury that a stipulation is an agreement between the attorneys for each side which you can accept as having been proven.id.at.the stipulation stated that the prosecutor and defense counsel stipulate that a qualified,expert forensic chemist had examined the package seized from the ups sorting facility on october,and the package contained grams of heroin,a schedule i controlled substance.id.at.
next,lieutenant brian duncan testified.id.at.on october,special agent paul criswell and ice notified duncan that a package had been found in kentucky that contained heroin.id.at.criswell and ice asked duncan to dress up to resemble a ups driver and to make a controlled delivery to westover drive in spartanburg.id.duncan agreed.thus,on october,duncan posed as a ups driver and delivered the package to jackson.id.at.
duncan testified that when jackson answered the door,jackson was talking on the phone.id.at.duncan handed the package to jackson.id.at.criswell and investigator matt hutchins of the spartanburg county sheriff office then exited the van in which they had been hiding,and arrested jackson.see id.at.duncan,hutchins,and criswell then asked jackson if he would cooperate.id.jackson agreed and tried to call williams.id.at.williams,however,did not answer.id.at.

on cross examination,duncan admitted that williams was not at the residence when duncan delivered the package containing heroin to jackson.id.at.
agent paul criswell then testified.id.at.criswell explained that he was an ice agent assigned to greenville,south carolina.id.at.on october,an ice agent in louisville,kentucky contacted him and told him that ice had intercepted a package of heroin in louisville destined for sabrina hutchinson,westover drive,spartanburg,south carolina.id.at.criswell then contacted the spartanburg county sheriff office and spartanburg city police department to assist with a controlled delivery of the package.id.
criswell identified government exhibit as the package that he received from the louisville ice office.id.at.criswell also identified government exhibit as the heroin that was contained within the package that he received from the louisville office.id.at.
criswell then explained the role that he played in the controlled delivery,in jackson arrest,and in hutchins interview of hutchinson and jackson.id.criswell also explained that he presented information from the investigation to the attorney office,and a federal grand jury indicted williams,jackson,and hutchinson on january.id.at.after the indictment,federal arrest warrants were issued.id.at.on january,criswell,hutchins,duncan,and an atf agent went to arrest williams at williams residence.id.at.
criswell identified government exhibit as a statement of rights and waiver of rights form waiver form.id.at govt.ex.criswell explained that he read the waiver form to williams on january.williams appeared to understand his rights,did not appear intoxicated,agreed to waive his rights,and signed the waiver form.id.at govt.ex.criswell and hutchins also signed the waiver form as witnesses.id.
criswell did not promise williams anything or threaten him.rather,williams freely and voluntarily gave the agents a statement regarding his involvement in the heroin shipped from panama to hutchinson residence.id.at.
according to criswell,williams said that he contacted jackson about bringing heroin into the united states.id.at.williams explained that he had been in contact with a man nicknamed cool in panama and that cool sent the package containing the heroin.id.criswell then identified cool as james alexander smith iii and explained that authorities had issued a federal arrest warrant in the eastern district of new york against smith iii.id.at.williams also told criswell that he knew another man nicknamed coochie james alexander smith,that coochie had been found guilty of conspiracy to distribute heroin,and that williams had previously obtained heroin from coochie.id.
williams then told criswell that jackson was supposed to receive a package addressed to sabrina hutchinson and delivered to her residence.id.at.when the package arrived,jackson was to call williams.id.in exchange,williams agreed to pay jackson approximately.id.at.williams also told criswell that while the package was in transit from panama,cool called williams and said that the package had been held up in kentucky.id.
as for williams intent,williams told criswell that once he received the package from jackson,he intended to sell the heroin contained in the package.id.at.williams also explained that cool had fronted him the heroin,which meant that williams obtained the heroin on credit and would use some of the proceeds of his heroin sales to pay cool.id.at.
on cross examination,criswell admitted that williams had gathered bottles of medication at his residence upon his arrest.id.at.criswell also admitted that coochie is incarcerated within the bureau of prisons and that williams had told criswell that cool was in prison in panama.id.at.criswell also admitted that he had not interviewed either coochie or cool.id.
next,investigator matt hutchins testified.id.at.hutchins identified government exhibit as the waiver form that was given to williams.id.at.hutchins testified that criswell read the waiver form to williams and that hutchins signed the waiver form as a witness.id.hutchins explained that williams appeared to understand his rights,that neither hutchins nor criswell threatened him,that williams signed the waiver form,and that neither hutchins nor criswell promised him anything.id.at.hutchins also testified that williams was very well aware of what was going on during the interview,that his information was detailed and coherent,and williams said that he approached jackson about receiving a package that would contain heroin.id.at.

the lawyers then delivered their closing arguments.united states williams,at.each argument was very succinct.the prosecutor argued that the united states had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that williams and jackson had conspired to possess with intent to distribute a quantity of heroin.id.in support,the prosecutor cited the package from panama containing heroin and cited williams confession and his admission that he was on the phone with jackson during the controlled delivery of the package of heroin.id.at.the prosecutor conceded that williams was in poor health and a former heroin addict,but urged the jury to not use sympathy to excuse williams behavior.id.at.the prosecutor noted that williams and jackson did not mind using hutchinson to facilitate the conspiracy and also cited the phone calls between williams and jackson during the time period of october,and october.id.at.the prosecutor then stressed the need to use common sense in evaluating the evidence.id.the prosecutor rejected williams claim that officers twisted his words during his interview,but somehow came up with the names coochie and cool.id.finally,the prosecutor mentioned the package of heroin,the stipulation that the package contained grams of heroin,jackson testimony about how the conspiracy came into being,and williams confession concerning the conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute a quantity of heroin.id.at.the prosecutor then asked the jury to convict williams.id.at.
in response,defense counsel returned to the defense theme williams had no knowledge of the alleged conspiracy and never joined it.in support,defense counsel stated the defense has stipulated there heroin in that package because it was not heroin that williams knew about.id.at.defense counsel then reminded the jury that the package was addressed to sabrina hutchinson and that hutchinson testified that she never talked to williams about accepting a package for him.id.rather,hutchinson said that jackson asked her to accept a package and that jackson told hutchinson that the package belonged to williams.id.at.defense counsel then questioned jackson credibility in light of his guilty plea to the charged conspiracy and his hope for a sentence reduction.id.defense counsel also noted that jackson and williams had known each other a long time,but the relationship involved jackson selling bootleg cds and dvds to williams.id.
defense counsel then noted that the government failed to verify who sent the package of heroin from panama and failed to interview either coochie or cool.id.at.as for williams confession,defense counsel explained that he felt pressured to tell the officers what they wanted to hear and that his alleged confession actually concerned events of many years before october.id.defense counsel then asked the jury to find williams not guilty.id.at.the jury was then dismissed for the day.
on september,the jury returned and the district court instructed the jury that,to prove that williams is guilty,the government was required to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement existed between two or more persons to possess with the intent to distribute heroin that the defendant knew of the conspiracy and that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily became a part of the conspiracy.the district court gave a variety of other standard instructions on the burden of proof,how to consider the evidence,and the law of conspiracy.see id.at.
after beginning deliberations,the jury sent a note to the court and asked three questions.first,the jury asked,what amount of drugs does it take to qualify for distribution as opposed to id.at.the court then repeated a portion of its original charge 
w hile you should consider only the evidence in the case,you are permitted to draw such reasonable inferences from the testimony and exhibits as you feel are justified in light of common experience.in other words,you may make deductions and reach conclusions which reason and common sense lead you to draw from the facts that have been established by the testimony and evidence in the case.
id.at.it also stated 
basically,what you are determining is whether the drugs were for personal use of for the purpose of distribution.the possession of a large quantity of narcotics does not necessarily mean that the defendant intended to distribute them.on the other hand,a defendant may have intended to distribute narcotics even if he did not possess large amounts of them.having said that,the larger the quantity of drugs increases the inference that drugs were possessed with the intent to distribute as opposed to personal use.
second,the jury asked,what is the street value of the drugs the court responded there was no testimony or evidence to that effect.and we do add to the record once you go to the jury room.id.at.
finally,the jury asked,why were phone records not submitted as evidence and can we see them id.the court instructed the jury that t he records actually were not admitted in evidence and we can not add to the record.i can tell you that the only record is that the question was asked about the phone records and the defendant agreed.id.the court also stated i marked as a court exhibit.it should have gone to you anyway you are being sent the stipulation which is part of the record.id.the jury then resumed deliberating.id.
after lunch,the jury sent a note stating we need to hear the judge charge to the jury again.id.at.the court then sent a copy of its charge to the jury.id.
later,the jury asked can we get a copy of williams testimony we also would like a copy of jackson testimony.id.the court instructed the jury at that it could get the testimony transcribed,but i t going to take a while.you may go back to your jury room.id.at.the jury continued deliberating.id.later,the jury sent another note stating we have guilty and one not guilty.we can not reach consensus.id.at.
at approximately,the court gave an allen charge.see id.at.the jury resumed deliberations.id.at.at the jury asked we need to get clarification on considering evidence based on a reasonable doubt and common sense.id.at.the court then instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and common sense.see id.at.
the jury later sent another note tomorrow can we review the other officers testimony id.at.the court instructed the jury that i will get the court reporter tonight to prepare all of that testimony for you so you can have it to read tomorrow.id.at.
on september,the jury resumed deliberating at id.at.shortly after,the jury reached a verdict and found defendant guilty.id.at.
i agree with the majority that the fourth circuit has not decided whether and under what circumstances defense counsel may waive a defendant sixth amendment right to confrontation.i also agree with the majority that the first,second,fifth,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits have held in published opinions that defense counsel may waive his client sixth amendment right of confrontation by stipulating to the admission of evidence,so long as the defendant does not dissent from his attorney decision,and so long as it can be said that the attorney decision was a legitimate trial tactic.united states plitman,cir quotation omitted the rationale for this waiver rule is that a well developed body of case law protects defendants from constitutionally defective actions of their attorneys,id.at see strickland washington,and that courts must accord proper weight to the role of defense counsel in fashioning an overall trial strategy,including one involving waiver of the right to confrontation,for the defendant best advantage.plitman,at.i also agree that the sixth circuit has held that the confrontation right is personal and that defendant must waive it.see carter sowders,cir 
here,williams objected to defense counsel tactical decision to stipulate to the forensic chemist testimony.nonetheless,the district court accepted the stipulation,thereby allowing defense counsel to waive williams right to confront the forensic chemist.thus,under the standard of the overwhelming majority of circuits or under the sixth circuit standard,the district court violated williams sixth amendment right to confront the forensic chemist at trial about her testimony.see,massachusetts,plitman,at.
of course,a defendant is entitled to a fair trial,not a perfect trial.see,van arsdall,at united states hasting.moreover,the doctrine applies to the confrontation clause error that occurred during the trial.see.at van arsdall,at united states banks,cir united states kahn,cir united states iskander,cir.the doctrine preserves the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant guilt or innocence,and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.arizona fulminante,quotation omitted.when reviewing the erroneous admission of evidence,the appellate court simply reviews the remainder of the evidence against the defendant to determine whether the admission of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.sherman smith,cir en banc see.a.in conducting this review,the reviewing court must examine the whole record.neder,u.at.the court then must ask is it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error id.at.
in applying the doctrine in this case,the supreme court van arsdall decision is instructive.in van arsdall,the court analyzed a confrontation clause error and stated 
whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors,all readily accessible to reviewing courts.these factors include the importance of the erroneously admitted evidence in the prosecution case,whether the erroneously admitted evidence was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the erroneously admitted evidence on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and,of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.
