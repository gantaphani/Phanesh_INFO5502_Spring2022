paul glover entered a conditional plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.he now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a in a deserted gas station parking lot in the wee hours of the morning.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of glover suppression motion.
in the early morning hours of march,officers aaron skipper and travis archer of the charlotte mecklenburg police department were patrolling the eastway division of charlotte,north carolina in a marked police car.each officer had been with the police department for six years and was familiar with the area.officer skipper had patrolled the eastway division since early and officer archer had been assigned to the area for his entire six years on the force.based on their past experience as well as their nightly briefings on criminal activity,both officers knew that the eastway division was plagued by armed robberies and assaults.
around,the officers pulled into a hour gas station located at the intersection of westover street and central avenue.both officers were familiar with this facility.approximately one year earlier,officer skipper had investigated a robbery of this particular gas station and officer archer knew that it had been previously robbed as well.officer skipper was also aware that in the early hours of the morning,this gas station remained open for business even though its doors were locked.usually a single attendant would be on duty during these hours and he would either let one customer into the building at a time or deal with customers through a slot in the glass similar to a bank teller window.
on this occasion,however,the officers noticed that the attendant was outside the protection of the locked building.as officer skipper observed,he was instead bent down in the parking lot and preoccupied with using a large dipstick to check the levels of the fuel tanks.there were no vehicles in the parking lot at this time.
aside from the attendant,the only person in the area was glover,who was standing at the back corner of the station and appeared to be talking on a cell phone while watching the attendant.glover location caught the attention of officer skipper,who knew from investigating a previous robbery that this area was not covered by the gas station surveillance cameras.officer archer also noticed glover glancing around the corner and then pulling his head back as if he were trying to hide.according to the officers,glover and the attendant were about to sixty feet apart at the time.
the officers pulled into the back parking lot from a side entrance and then drove around to the front as if they were exiting onto central avenue.as they drove through the lot,glover followed their movements with his eyes and head.the officers agreed that glover observation of the attendant was suspicious and they were concerned about the possibility of t he store being robbed.officer skipper suggested that they should get out and speak with glover to find out what he was doing.
so instead of leaving,the officers circled back around and drove again into the station back parking lot.in the approximately five to six seconds they were out of glover sight,he had traversed the to sixty feet that had previously separated him from the attendant and was,as officer archer observed,standing,basically,over top of him.the attendant was still bent down checking the fuel levels and appeared to be unaware that glover was standing only a foot or two away from him.
the officers parked the patrol car and walked over to glover and the attendant,who were neither engaged in a conversation nor making eye contact with one another.concerned that glover was stalking the clerk and believ ing him to have a weapon,officer skipper informed glover that he was going to pat him down and then proceeded to do so.when he patted glover right pants pocket,he felt an object he believed was a gun barrel.officer skipper then retrieved a handgun from glover pocket and placed him under arrest.
in april,a federal grand jury indicted glover for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.glover filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized at the gas station.the district court then held a hearing on the issue during which it both heard testimony from officers skipper and archer as well as viewed the patrol car video recording of the incident.at the end of the hearing,the district court denied glover suppression motion.glover subsequently entered a conditional plea of guilty and the district court sentenced him to sixty months in prison.glover now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress.
glover contends that the in the gas station parking lot violated the fourth amendment because officers skipper and archer lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.according to glover,the fact that he was merely standing near a gas station attendant in a high crime area is not enough to create a reasonable suspicion that he was planning to commit a crime.this argument neglects the import of the leading case in this area of law.in terry ohio,d,the supreme court per chief justice warren held that the fourth amendment bar against unreasonable searches and seizures does not prohibit police officers from engaging in a brief necessary to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence in situations where they may lack probable cause for an arrest.that is exactly the situation we have here.
terry provides a good illustration of the type of preventive police action that complies with fourth amendment safeguards.while patrolling downtown cleveland around,officer mcfadden noticed two men pacing back and forth in front of a store and conferring with one another as well as with a third man who soon left the area.based in part on his years of experience with the neighborhood,officer mcfadden became suspicious that the men were casing the store in preparation for a robbery.concerned that they might be carrying a gun,he followed the men,asked them what their names were,and then briefly patted one of them down,whereupon he discovered a revolver in the suspect coat pocket.id.at.
the supreme court upheld this conduct as constitutional.refusing to apply the fourth amendment in a manner that might exact a high toll in human injury,id.at,or require that police officers take unnecessary risks,id.at,it held that a protective is legitimate if a police officer has a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others.id.at.it also held that officer mcfadden conduct met this standard.noting that while each of the suspects acts was perhaps innocent in itself,the court concluded that i t would have been poor police work indeed for officer mcfadden to have simply gone on his way and not to have investigated this possibly criminal behavior further.id.at.
since terry,the supreme court has reaffirmed that engaging in a to prevent a crime from occurring is a valid use of police authority.see,michigan long,d our past cases indicate then that protection of police and others can justify protective searches when police have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses a danger adams williams,d the fourth amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur see also united states perkins,cir t he very point of terry was to permit officers to take preventive action and conduct investigative stops before crimes are committed,based on what they view as suspicious albeit even legal activity.emphasis in original.while this in practice means that officers can detain suspects for conduct that is ambiguous and susceptible of an innocent explanation,terry and its progeny permit reasonable stops in order to resolve the ambiguity.illinois wardlow,d.
this makes sense.terry balanced the government interest in protecting the public and the police from unnecessary risks and a suspect interest in avoiding a brief frisk of his person.see at.when an officer has a reasonable suspicion that an armed robbery is abo
