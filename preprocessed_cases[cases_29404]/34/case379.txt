factual background 
in a sufficiency challenge,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states upton,cir.
in and,ice investigated drug trafficking and money laundering conducted by the toloza family of colombia.acting in conjunction with confidential informant werner romero,ice agents in puerto rico posed as money launderers for the tolozas,and accepted deliveries of large quantities of cash resulting from payments for the tolozas drugs.ice deposited the money in bank accounts provided by the tolozas,from which it was withdrawn inside colombia transfer through the accounts was intended to remove the taint of drug trafficking.see united states,cir describing the toloza scheme.
romero received money laundering contracts directly from juanito toloza,a member of the toloza family.juanito would call romero,ask if he was willing to transfer money from puerto rico to colombia,and then provide a phone number for the individual who would deliver the cash.romero would then contact the deliverer and use code words to communicate that he was the intended recipient of the money.for example,romero would identify himself on the phone as ricardo,on behalf of juanito.in other cases,code numbers were used.romero and the deliverer would then agree on a meeting place to transfer the money,sometimes also using code words.meetings were usually in public places,such as parking lots,to ensure safety.
on august,undercover ice agent luis ortiz,posing as a money launderer and an associate of romero,contacted cedeño through a phone number provided to romero by juanito toloza ortiz identified himself as calling on behalf of ricardo,which was,he testified,the code cedeño wa s waiting for to know that it wa s the correct person calling him.cedeño responded that he had spoken with ricardo,and told ortiz that the documents were ready for delivery.as ortiz described,w e do talk about currency like that on the phone a lmost everybody that deals with this kind of business knows the documents are currency.ortiz told cedeño that he had to receive the currency before,because i ca stay through the night with that.as ortiz later explained,the money had to be transferred early enough to be deposited in a bank the same day,or he would have to watch the currency through the night.cedeño and ortiz then agreed on a location to make the transfer.after cedeño suggested a particular location,ortiz told him,the area there,the sun is a little hot over there,using coded language to indicate a heightened police presence.cedeño then agreed to transfer the money at a different location,the home depot parking lot in plaza escorial.
sometime later that day,ortiz learned from romero that cedeño was trying to reach him.ortiz then called cedeño,who told him that he would be delayed.ortiz responded that he was not going to wait there long.you know how this is.
meanwhile,puerto rico police discovered an abandoned car in the parking lot where cedeño and ortiz had agreed to meet when cedeño arrived,he became unsettled by the presence of the police.he told ortiz,let get out of here.let get out of here.ortiz responded that cedeño should calm down,and pointed out that the police were occupied by the car and would not notice the money transfer.still,cedeño was uncertain about proceeding.after walking around the mall parking lot,he returned and asked ortiz,are we going to do it here,or are we going to leave out of here sic ortiz again tried to reassure cedeño that they could make the transfer.cedeño went to his car,and began taking a bag out of his trunk.he appeared scared.he asked ortiz,can i do it now ortiz said yes,and cedeño brought the bag to ortiz car.ortiz asked him if he had checked this,and cedeño said that he had.inside the bag was,in twenty,ten,five,and denominations,bound together with rubber bands and plastic straps.ortiz left with the currency.
sometime later,ortiz and cedeño spoke again on the phone.ortiz told cedeño that everything wa s fine,and that he had already arrived.cedeño responded,okay,my brother,and said,i am going to call that man now.my man.as ortiz explained at trial,deliverers typically notify their bosses that the delivery occurred and that they are no longer responsible for the currency.federal agents arrested cedeño on october.
proceedings in the district court 
on september,a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging individuals with conspiracy to commit money laundering,conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics,and several forfeiture charges.cedeño was named in count i,conspiracy to commit money laundering,and count iii,a forfeiture charge.the indictment charged cedeño with conspiring to commit two modalities of money laundering,promotional money laundering and concealment money laundering.see united states iacaboni,cir.
a person commits promotional money laundering if,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,he conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.a a i.in concealment money laundering,only element differs the person conducts the financial transaction knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.a b i.
during a trial involving only cedeño in february,the government presented four witnesses,including romero and ortiz,and two other government agents.at the close of the government case,cedeño moved for judgment of acquittal,which the court denied.see.a.the defense presented no witnesses and then renewed its motion for judgment of acquittal,which was again denied.on the government motion,the court dismissed the forfeiture count.the jury was instructed on conspiracy to commit money laundering,and was given a willful blindness instruction.see united states rivera rodríguez,cir.it returned a verdict of guilty.
on february,cedeño renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and,in the alternative,moved for a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure.he argued,inter alia,that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he both knew that the money involved in the august,transaction was the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,and either as required for promotional money laundering intended to promote the carrying on of that activity,or as required for concealment money laundering knew that the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds.
the district court denied cedeño motion.it held that a rational jury could have concluded that both required mental states had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.first,in light of the fact that the defendant delivered a large amount of cash,a bag full of approximately in small denominations,at a shopping mall parking lot,and used code words to establish a time and place to hand over the money,a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that cedeño knew he was handling money derived from an illegal activity.second,in light of the large amount of money,the bills,the telephone conversations about the time and place of delivery,and cedeño anxiety about police activity at the delivery,a rational jury could conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that cedeño knew the transaction was meant to conceal the origin and nature of the funds he delivered,and that his actions were intended to promote unlawful activity.
cedeño now appeals.his sole argument on appeal is again that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he possessed the mental states required for a conviction of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction,we ask whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,would permit a rational jury to find each essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.we consider the evidence as a whole,as well as reasonable inferences that jurors may draw from the evidence based on shared perceptions and understandings of the habits,practices,and inclinations of human beings.united states morillo,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,to obtain a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering,the government had to establish the existence of two mental states a cedeño knowledge that the money transferred on august,represent ed the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and b cedeño intent to promote that unlawful activity,or his knowledge that the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds.see a a i,a b i see also,at describing the twofold knowledge requirement for money laundering 
in the alternative,the government could have established cedeño guilt by proving that he was willfully blind to the facts constituting the offense.although the district court instructed the jury on willful blindness,we do not reach cedeño argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish willful blindness,because we conclude that a rational jury could find that cedeño knew that the money he transferred derived from unlawful activity.
proceeds of an unlawful activity 
in arguing that the evidence presented at trial did not establish that he knew the unlawful origin of the money transferred in the august,transaction,cedeño points out that he did not discuss the money origin during any of the telephone calls with ortiz,and that the ice investigation did not reveal the origin of the money.cedeño also argues that his connection with the money laundering scheme was attenuated romero testified that he was uncertain if he had spoken with cedeño,and that the toloza family was unfamiliar with him.
a conviction for money laundering does not require that the defendant know the precise origin of the property transferred,but only that it came from some form,though not necessarily which form,of activity that constitutes a felony under state,federal,or foreign law.c defining the phrase knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity accord,at.here,as ortiz described,cedeño recognized and used code words to identify the intended recipients of the money,romero and ortiz.in particular,he used the expression documents to conceal the fact that he was delivering currency.cedeño agreed to avoid a drop off location that was hot,or too close to police activity.during the drop off cedeño became excited and kind of scared by the presence of the police in the parking lot.he told ortiz that they should get out of here.when ortiz finally convinced him to transfer the money despite the police presence,cedeño asked ortiz,can i do it now,further reflecting his desire to avoid police detection.cedeño knew that the plastic bag he transferred contained in mixed bills.romero testified at trial that only a trusted person,an employee,part of the chain,would be assigned to deliver that much money,since others would steal it.the jury heard a phone call in which cedeño told ortiz that he had spoken with ricardo,romero alias.
from this evidence,a rational jury could have concluded,beyond a reasonable doubt,that cedeño knew that the money came from some form of unlawful activity.the jury could have reasoned that cedeño use of code words and his concern about police detection reflected an awareness that the currency he was transferring derived from unlawful activity.this inference would have been strengthened by the large amount of currency,the bills,their storage in a plastic bag,and the transfer in a parking lot,all of which the jury could have reasonably regarded as suggesting unlawful activity.see,at noting evidence that defendant witnessed deliveries of large amounts of cash and issued coded receipts for these deliveries.lastly,from romero testimony that only a trusted person would make such a delivery,and cedeño statement that he had spoken to ricardo,the jury could have reasoned that it was likely that cedeño knew something about the unlawful nature of the toloza family activities and that the transferred money was in payment for those activities.
promotion or concealment 
the district court held correctly that the government had to prove the mental state for either promotional or concealment money laundering to obtain a conviction on the indictment.see united states,cir w here an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute,a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,the conviction must be affirmed if the government presented evidence sufficient to prove that cedeño possessed either the mental state required for promotional money laundering or the mental state required for concealment money laundering.without suggesting that the evidence was insufficient to prove promotional money laundering,we focus on the charge of concealment money laundering.
in support of his claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew that the august,transaction was designed to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the money,cedeño points out that he did not instruct ortiz to deposit the money in a bank account or to purchase real associated with laundering money.nor did he mention anything to ortiz about concealing the transferred funds.lastly,ice encountered cedeño only once during the course of its investigation into the tolozas,and,as discussed above,cedeño was not known to the toloza family.
we disagree with this assessment of the evidence.the jury conclusion that cedeño knew the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the money is well supported by the evidence.our conclusion is guided by the supreme court recent interpretation of the same language in cuellar united states,d,where the court dealt with the transportation provision of the money laundering statute.under the transportation provision,it is unlawful to transport money outside the united states knowing that the money involved in the transportation represent s the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and that such transportation is designed to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the money.a b i emphasis added.in the context of the money laundering statute,the court said,design means purpose or plan,the intended aim of the transportation.cuellar.at.thus,to obtain a conviction,the evidence had to show that the purpose of the transportation was to conceal the funds,not simply that the funds had been concealed during transportation id.at.
because the court reasoning turns on the plain meaning of the statutory text,and because the text of the design element of the transportation provision is identical to the text of the design element of the transactional provision of the money laundering statute at issue here,we apply that reasoning to the facts of this case.thus,to obtain a conviction for concealment money laundering,the evidence must show that the purpose of the financial transaction is to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the transacted proceeds.
the court wrote in cuellar that where the consequences of an
