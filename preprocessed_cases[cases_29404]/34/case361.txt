after a jury trial,richard villar,a hispanic man,was convicted of bank robbery.hours following his conviction,defense counsel received an message from one of the jurors disclosing that during deliberations another juror said,i guess we profiling but they cause all the trouble.when defense counsel filed a motion for a court inquiry into the validity of the verdict,the court held a hearing in which the juror was asked only to authenticate the.concluding that an allegation of ethnically biased statements within the jury room was not,as villar argued,an external matter open to inquiry,the district court held that federal rule of evidence b precluded the court from engaging in any further examination beyond the mere authentication of the.
appellant now challenges the conviction on the grounds that the district court erred when it ruled that rule b prohibited it from taking juror testimony about ethnically biased comments during the course of deliberations,and that the appellant was denied the right to due process and the right to an impartial jury in violation of the fifth and sixth amendments to the constitution.while we agree with the trial court that rule b precludes inquiry into juror prejudice,we hold that the court has the discretion to conduct such an inquiry under the sixth amendment and the due process clause of the united states constitution.accordingly,the court reverses the district court order denying appellant motion to make an inquiry into the validity of the verdict,and remands to the trial court.appellant also argues that the district court incorrectly applied the enhancement under united states sentencing guidelines manual b d,an argument that we find has no merit.
background 
on april,richard villar was indicted on charges of conspiring with joshua gagnon and dedra scott to commit bank robbery in violation of and a,and committing a bank robbery in violation of a.trial commenced on august.during jury selection,neither party requested the court to ask the potential jurors voir dire questions regarding bias based upon race or ethnicity.
evidence introduced at trial 
at trial,the government introduced testimony from fifteen witnesses,including dedra scott,villar girlfriend and,and shauna harrington,gagnon girlfriend neither of the bank tellers who testified could positively identify the appellant as one of the men who robbed the bank.based on this evidence,particularly the testimony of dedra scott and shauna harrington,the jury could reasonably find the following facts.
on april,a teller at mary bank in hudson,new hampshire,was returning from her lunch break when a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt and a ski mask jumped over the nearby chain link fence,stuck something against her side,and told her to get inside the bank.the man had a hispanic accent.he told the teller to remain quiet and no one would get hurt.eventually,the teller saw that the man was holding a gun.once inside the bank,the teller saw that her assailant was not alone.another man,who was white,was asking tellers to place money inside a bag.the hispanic robber holding the gun pointed it at another teller who was hiding underneath her desk and told her to stand in the middle of the bank lobby.later,he told the two tellers to get down on their knees before both men fled the bank.the two men stole a total of.
according to shauna harrington testimony,planning for the robbery began a few days prior to april.while they were getting high on drugs,villar suggested to scott,gagnon,and harrington that they all rob a bank.the four shared an apartment at the time in nashua,new hampshire.according to harrington,scott and gagnon seemed interested in the idea.in addition,two or three days before the robbery,villar showed harrington two bb guns one black and the other silver and black.responding to villar inquiry,harrington told him that the black one looked more realistic.
on the morning of the robbery,one of dedra scott friends asked her to go to patrick kagwa home because he was suffering from a prolonged diabetic seizure.when she found kagwa unconscious and comatose,she called.scott then followed the ambulance in kagwa light blue minivan.after learning that kagwa had suffered permanent brain damage and would not wake up,scott left the hospital and returned to the apartment she shared with villar,gagnon,and harrington.at that time,villar asked scott to use kagwa minivan to drive him to villar brother house.when they drove by mary bank,villar asked scott to turn around and pick gagnon up from the apartment.after they had done so,the three returned to the bank,where villar told scott to drive around the building to verify whether it had a second exit.villar instructed scott where to turn,and then he and gagnon exited the vehicle.
scott eventually picked gagnon and villar up near a stop sign a few blocks away from the bank.as they drove away,scott saw a police cruiser with its lights on driving in the opposite direction.when they stopped at a gas station,gagnon threw a bag of money on the front seat.villar opened the bag and showed scott all of the money.scott became upset because the police knew that she had kagwa minivan.she told gagnon and villar that she would drop them off in lowell,massachusetts,but villar burned her with a cigarette,telling her that she was not going anywhere.once they arrived at villar brother home,they all counted the stolen money.villar told scott that she would receive.
when they returned to their shared apartment,scott told harrington,we just robbed an bank.villar then threw harrington a backpack containing thousands of dollars.gagnon gave her,which harrington claimed she immediately returned to him.later,villar told harrington that during the robbery,he had done all of the talking and that he had carried a gun.that night,a few hours after the robbery was committed,villar,scott,gagnon,and harrington went to a hotel in manchester,new hampshire.while there,they counted the money again,and gagnon and villar each took.they spent the evening at the hotel getting high.
police recovered the ski mask and the weapon used during the robbery in a wooded area near mary bank.eyewitnesses rino giordano and melissa nichols separately observed two men acting suspiciously around the time of the robbery in the vicinity of mary bank.they both described one of the subjects as hispanic and as being shorter than his companion.a third eyewitness,michael febonio,saw two men acting suspiciously and described one as having darker skin than the other.nichols also described the getaway vehicle as a light blue minivan.
the defense attacked the credibility of two of the government key witnesses,shauna harrington and dedra scott,based on their drug use,criminal histories,prior lies and inconsistent statements in addition,dedra scott was impeached as a cooperating witness.appellant pointed out the government lack of physical evidence,such as fingerprints or dna,implicating him in the robbery.finally,defense counsel argued that the testimony of one bank teller,along with a surveillance photograph taken during the robbery,indicated that the hispanic robber was taller than gagnon.appellant noted that villar is,in fact,shorter than gagnon.appellant also introduced alibi witnesses.
postverdict juror inquiry 
appellant was convicted on both counts on august,after a jury trial.hours after the verdict was delivered,defense counsel returned to his office and received an entitled juror.in the,the juror stated 
i felt compelled to send this to you.i do know if i should even be doing this but i do care.i know it late but i want you to know that there were at least people on that jury who actually listened to the testimony with an open mind.we tried to make the rest pay attention.we made them go through every piece of evidence and every witness.between us we pointed out every discr e p a ncy.they made up some story to explain it away.i want you to know that i will go to jail before i ever serve on another jury.it was awful.i sorry we could do anything.we finally decided to not prolong that young man hope any longer.we could have stayed there for another week.their minds were made up from the first day.here one example,a man said i guess we profiling but they cause all the trouble.well i wo keep you longer.again i am sorry we could do more.you know if i thought he would have gotten a different kind of jury the next time i think i would have kept them there.these people are the salt of the earth and there is no gray in their lives.i really hope they never get into the scales of blind justice because she is.god bless you and mary keep you safe.
appellee.at emphasis added.on august,defense counsel moved to set aside the jury verdict,arguing that there was the possibility of bias and prejudice on the part of at least one juror based upon villar hispanic ethnicity.the court subsequently summoned the juror who contacted defense counsel to appear at a special hearing on august,to inquire about the.
with respect to the motion to set aside the verdict,the trial court stated 
i do believe that united states connolly,cir or tanner united states,d give me the authority if i choose to because i,for example,personally believe that ethnic bias is so reprehensible in the deliberative process and so damaging and dangerous,that if it were up to me,if i had a hint of juror bias based on a statement from one juror that another juror made a comment which could reflect racial bias,if i were balancing the constitutional interests versus the interests that underlie the rule,i might balance that interest differently.but it not up to me.if you think it is,let me know.i do believe i free to inquire simply because i attach relatively greater weight to the sixth amendment interest in a fair trial free from ethnic bias than does the supreme court or the drafters of the rule.
he concluded that based on the evidence he had available,rule b did not give him discretion to act.he also noted that his instinct as a trial judge was to develop the record immediately rather than waiting months to do it.defense counsel argued that under the fourteenth amendment racial bias constitutes an exception to rule b.however,there was no separate discussion about the constitutional issues.concluding that he did not have the authority or power under the rule to inquire into the matter further than verifying that the juror had,in fact,sent the to defense counsel,the trial judge held 
i ultimately have to apply the rules of evidence and the supreme court and first circuit case law applying those rules to the facts of this case,and doing that i conclude that i am constrained from breaching the confidentiality of the deliberative process in questioning the juror on the basis of the,which is all we have at this time to call into question the integrity of the jury deliberative process.
a limited voir dire of the juror followed to authenticate the.
on august,villar filed a motion to set aside the jury verdict,to which the government objected.on october,the court issued an endorsed order denying villar motion.on november,the court sentenced defendant,and this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
contending that the juror created a possibility that the jury was racially or ethnically biased against him,appellant asserts that the district court erred in its legal conclusion that rule b barred any inquiry into the possibility of bias within the jury room.
a threshold issue is the appropriate standard of review.the parties argue that the abuse of discretion standard governs the trial judge application of rule b.the district court response to an allegation of juror misconduct is generally reviewed only for abuse of discretion.see united states connolly,cir citing united states,cir mahoney vondergritt,cir.here,however,the trial court judge seemed to be making a ruling of law,because he found he lacked discretion to act or make any inquiry under rule b based only on the juror.therefore,the appropriate standard of review of that legal ruling is de novo.janeiro urological surgery prof l ass n,cir.
federal rule of evidence rule b states 
upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment,a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror mental processes in connection therewith.but a juror may testify about whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention,whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror,or whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form.a juror affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror may not be received on a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying.
b.rule b codifies the firmly established rule that prohibits admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict.united states connolly,cir quoting tanner united states,d.there are important policy considerations underlying the rule,including finality,maintaining the integrity of the jury system,encouraging frank and honest deliberations,and the protection of jurors from subsequent harassment by a losing party,and ensuring public confidence in the justice system.id.
rule b contains three exceptions,two of which extraneous prejudicial information and outside influence are relevant to our analysis.we have warned that courts generally should be hesitant to haul jurors in after they have reached a verdict to probe for potential instances of bias,misconduct,or extraneous influences.id.quoting neron tierney,cir alterations omitted.a court should only conduct such an inquiry when reasonable grounds for investigation exist,there is clear,strong,substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,nonspeculative impropriety has occurred which could have prejudiced the trial of a defendant.id.quoting united states moon,cir.
the key case in this area is tanner united states,which involved allegations,brought to light after conviction,that several jurors had consumed alcohol and drugs during lunch breaks,causing them to sleep through the afternoon sessions of a trial and possibly affecting their reasoning ability.at.the court there recognized the common law exception to the bar against juror testimony in cases involving an extraneous influence.id.at.quoting mattox united states.the distinction employed by the tanner court is not a locational distinction but rather is based on the nature of the allegation.id.at.juror testimony about a matter characterized as external to the jury is admissible under rule b,while testimony about internal matters is barred by the rule.see id.explaining that juror intoxication does not fit within the exception to rule b for outside influence s,but rather was more properly labeled an internal issue,the tanner court held that the district court did not err when it refused to hold an evidentiary hearing.id.at.
using this framework,most courts have concluded that juror testimony about statements made by deliberating jurors does not fall within either the extraneous prejudicial information or the outside influence exceptions of rule b,but does fall squarely within rule b prohibition of juror testimony.see united states benally,cir holding that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit evidence of racial comments in the jury room under rule b exceptions shillcutt gagnon,cir concluding that rule b was intended to preclude evidence of racial slurs during jury deliberations,because w e can not expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions of jurors,their attitudinal expositions,or their philosophies internal citations omitted martinez food city,cir.unit a stating that juror testimony regarding the possible subjective prejudices or improper motives of individual jurors is inadmissible under the rule.but see united states henley,cir even without characterizing racial bias as extraneous,a powerful case can be made that rule b is wholly inapplicable to racial bias because a juror may testify concerning any mental bias in matters unrelated to the specific issues that the juror was called upon to decide.quoting rushen spain,d per curiam and adding emphasis.
we are persuaded by the courts that have held that rule b,by its express terms,precludes any inquiry into the validity of the verdict based on juror testimony regarding racial or ethnic comments made during the course of deliberations.as such,the trial judge did not abuse his discretion or commit an error of law when he held that rule b precluded further juror inquiry.
due process and sixth amendment rights 
appellant more powerful argument is that the application of rule b to prevent juror testimony about racial or ethnic statements made in jury deliberations is unconstitutional,violating a defendant right to due process under the fifth amendment,and to a trial by an impartial jury as guaranteed by the sixth amendment const.amends v,vi.constitutional issues are reviewed de novo.united states,cir.
the constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a fair trial by a panel of impartial,indifferent jurors.the failure to accord an accused a fair hearing violates even the minimal standards of due process.irvin dowd,d internal citations omitted.one touchstone of a fair trial is an impartial trier of fact a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.mcdonough power,greenwood,d quoting smith phillips,d habeas case involving claims of denial of due process due to juror bias.when questions of juror bias are raised,the supreme court has long recognized that it would not be safe to lay down any inflexible rule because there might be instances in which such testimony of the juror could not be excluded without violating the plainest principles of justice.this might occur in the gravest and most important cases mcdonald pless.see also united states dioguardi,cir stating the rule that possible internal abnormalities in a jury will not be inquired into except in the gravest and most important cases quoting mcdonald,at.emphasis added.the obvious difficulty with prejudice in a judicial context is that it prevents the impartial that both the sixth amendment and fundamental fair play require.united states heller,cir reversing jury verdict based on a voir dire of deliberating jurors where the religious prejudice displayed by the jurors is so shocking to the conscience and potentially so damaging to public confidence in the equity of our system of justice,that we must act decisively to correct any possible harmful effects on this appellant see also united states mcclinton,cir the fifth and sixth amendments protect a criminal defendant from a jury lynch mob mentality through the guarantees of due process of law and trial by an impartial jury.
tanner did not address the issue of racial bias but instead involved issues of juror competence.the supreme court recognized that a defendant has a sixth amendment right to an unimpaired jury,but concluded that,because there were several aspects of the trial process that could protect this right,the district court invocation of a rule of evidence to bar juror testimony did not amount to a constitutional violation.tanner,at.the court listed voir dire,observations of the jury by counsel and the court during trial,opportunities for jurors to report inappropriate juror behavior prior to rendering a verdict,and the admissibility of testimony as to wrongdoing as examples of other sources of protection for a defendant sixth amendment rights.id.at.
after tanner,courts have struggled with its application to cases involving the possibility of sixth amendment violations during jury deliberations.in two habeas challenges involving state court convictions,two circuits have suggested that the use of juror testimony may be appropriate in the rare case where due process and sixth amendment concerns are implicated.in shillcutt,the seventh circuit held that the intent of rule b was to preclude juror testimony,but nonetheless proceeded to address the constitutional question 
the rule of juror incompetency can not be applied in such an unfair manner as to deny due process.thus,further review may be necessary in the occasional case in order to discover the extremely rare abuse that could exist even after the court has applied the rule and determined the evidence incompetent.in short,although our scope of review is narrow at this stage,we must consider whether prejudice pervaded the jury room,whether there is a substantial probability that the alleged racial slur made a difference in the outcome of the trial.

many courts have recognized that rule b should not be applied dogmatically where there is a possibility of juror bias during deliberations that would violate a defendant sixth amendment rights.see,heller,at involving a voir dire of jurors who made comments wright united states,certainly,if a criminal defendant could show that the jury was racially prejudiced,such evidence could not be ignored without trampling the s ixth a mendment guarantee to a fair trial and an impartial jury.tobias smith,requiring an evidentiary hearing when the petitioner presented a juror affidavit describing two racially charged statements allegedly made during deliberations,including the remark y ou ca tell one black from another.they all look alike.smith brewer,where an offer of proof showed that there was a substantial likelihood that a criminal defendant was prejudiced by the influence of racial bias in the jury room,to ignore the evidence might very well offend fundamental fairness commonwealth laguer,concluding that,although juror bias could not be considered admissible as an extraneous matter under the state rule which is similar to fed.of evid.b,a hearing on the question of ethnic slurs against hispanics was nevertheless required to determine whether the statements were made because the possibility raised by the affidavit that the defendant did not receive a trial by an impartial jury,which was his fundamental right,can not be ignored.see generally racist juror misconduct during deliberations,harv,although few courts have admitted juror testimony of racist jury misconduct,most courts at least acknowledge that r ule b could not be applied to exclude such evidence if,taken at face value,the evidence established a constitutional violation.
recently,the tenth circuit held that tanner precluded inquiry into claims that racist statements were made in the jury room during the trial of a native american defendant for assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon.several days after the defendant was convicted,a juror reported to defense counsel that,during deliberations,the foreman insisted that w hen indians get alcohol,they all get drunk and that when they get drunk,they get violent.benally,at.several jurors apparently discussed the need to send a message back to the reservation.id.at.after considering juror affidavits,the trial court held that two jurors lied during voir dire about their experiences with native americans and that a new trial was warranted.id.the tenth circuit reversed,asserting that it is not necessarily in the interest of overall justice to attempt to cure defects such as possible racial prejudice in the jury process 
as the court said in tanner,there is little doubt that postverdict investigation into juror misconduct would in some instances lead to the invalidation of verdicts reached after irresponsible or improper juror behavior.it is not at all clear,however,that the jury system could survi
