william merlino and his three codefendants,carmello merlino william uncle,david turner,and stephen rossetti,were charged with violating the hobbs act,and with carrying firearms in relation to a crime of violence,c,after the fbi foiled their planned robbery of the loomis fargo armored car facility in easton,massachusetts.a jury found the defendants guilty,but the district court granted william merlino a judgment of acquittal on count three,one of the c counts.he appeals his convictions on the other counts on the basis that he was denied his right to testify in his own defense.he also brings a challenge to his sentence.the government,challenging the district court judgment of acquittal on count three.we affirm william merlino convictions and his sentence,but we reverse on the government and remand for further proceedings.
anthony romano,a former fbi informant,worked with carmello merlino hereinafter carmello for clarity sake at trc,an automobile repair shop.carmello approached romano about helping him find someone who could work inside an armored car facility to help stake it out for a robbery.the fbi had been watching carmello and codefendant turner for some time because of their suspected involvement in the unsolved theft of several historic paintings from the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston.unbeknownst to carmello,romano was already providing information to fbi agent david nadolski about the paintings heist,and romano informed agent nadolski about carmello plan to rob the armored car facility.romano became a cooperating witness for the fbi,taping conversations he had with carmello about the planned robbery.carmello involved turner and rossetti,who helped surveil the armored car facility and plan the robbery.romano suggested using carmello nephew,william merlino hereinafter merlino,in the plan as well.although merlino had been trying to stay away from drugs and crime following the death of his wife,romano testified at trial that merlino expressed unhesitating interest in the plan when romano described it to him as involving a million score and an easy hit using insiders.
the robbery was planned for the early morning hours of february.the prior evening,carmello,romano,turner,rossetti,and merlino all met at trc to discuss the final plans and to prepare for the robbery.merlino was to drive the van into the facility once it was secured and possibly guard the money after the robbery.he brought ski masks and four large duffle bags to the meeting in preparation for the robbery.
the following morning,federal agents arrested carmello,turner,and rossetti as they converged on trc,the designated meeting point.merlino was later arrested at a nearby gas station,where he was using a pay phone after having arrived at trc and finding no one there.
merlino was charged in four counts of a indictment against the four codefendants.counts one and two charged conspiracy and attempt to affect commerce by robbery,and counts three and four charged the codefendants with carrying firearms count three involved a hand grenade and count four involved pistols and a rifle during and in relation to a crime of violence,c.merlino raised an entrapment defense at trial,asserting that romano had used intimidation and fear to pressure merlino into joining the conspiracy against his will.he attempted to distance himself from his codefendants and portrayed his role as one of a mere gopher,who was kept on the periphery of the conspiracy.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts against all defendants.the codefendants each filed motions for a new trial and for acquittal.in a published opinion,the district court denied all of the motions for a new trial,as well as all of the motions for acquittal,except that it granted merlino motion for acquittal on count three related to the hand grenade.see united states merlino,d.the government filed a timely appeal from the judgment of acquittal on june.
on november,merlino was sentenced to concurrent sentences on counts one and two and a consecutive sentence on count four gun charge.merlino filed a timely notice of appeal from his convictions and sentence on december.on december,he filed a motion for a conditional determination by the court whether a motion for new trial should be granted if the judgment of acquittal is reversed,which the district court granted on february.
merlino filed a second motion for a new trial on september,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on an alleged conflict of interest.that motion was denied in a published opinion.see united states merlino,d.merlino filed a timely notice of appeal on august.
on appeal,merlino challenges the district court determination that he was not denied his sixth amendment right to testify at trial on his own behalf,and he challenges his sentence based on booker.in its,the government challenges the district court grant of a judgment of acquittal on count three related to the hand grenade.
sixth amendment right to testify 
merlino challenges the district court denial of his motion for a new trial based on his assertion that he was denied his right to testify at trial we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion,united states lnu,cir,cert.denied,d,reviewing the district court factual findings for clear error,id.
there is no doubt that a defendant has a fundamental constitutional right to testify in his own defense,owens united states,cir quoting rock arkansas,d,and that the defendant,not his attorney,is the one who makes the ultimate decision whether to testify or not,id.noting that a defendant attorney can not waive the defendant right to testify.the district court held an evidentiary hearing to address merlino motion for a new trial.peter parker,merlino trial counsel,testified at the hearing that although he had agreed at the beginning of trial to call merlino to the stand,his trial strategy changed based on the way the evidence had come in,and he then attempted to convince merlino not to testify.during a heated blowout that occurred on one of the days of trial in the area of the courthouse,parker and merlino disagreed about whether to call romano as part of his defense and about whether to cross examine fbi agent nadolski.according to attorney parker,merlino finally agreed not to take the stand if parker would ask specific questions of the fbi agents on,which parker did.parker testified that merlino made the final decision not to testify and that if merlino would have insisted,parker would have put him on the stand.
merlino testified at the hearing that parker had agreed all along that merlino would testify as part of their trial strategy and that merlino did not know that he would not be called to testify until parker rested his case without calling him.merlino claimed that he did not bring his desire to testify to the court attention because he did not know he had the right to do so.merlino recounted a blowout similar to the one testified to by parker,but he recalled that it took place after parker rested the case without calling merlino to testify,which,according to merlino,was the subject of the blowout.in an affidavit filed in support of his motion for a new trial,merlino stated that he and parker had had a heated argument about parker refusal to cross examine the two fbi agents,and he recounted in the affidavit another violent argument about parker refusal to call romano.merlino never mentioned in his affidavit that he and parker had argued about parker refusal to call him to the stand.
after hearing all the evidence,the district court found that parker testimony was more credible and that merlino in fact made the final decision not to testify.where a district court factual findings are based on credibility determinations,error is seldom considered clear unless the credibility assessments were based on testimony which was inherently implausible,internally inconsistent,or critically impeached.awon united states,cir internal citation omitted quoting keller united states,cir.after review,we conclude that the district court determination that merlino made the decision not to testify was not clearly erroneous.see lnu,at denying a motion for new trial based on alleged denial of defendant right to testify where the district court findings were made after a full hearing.
sentencing 
merlino was sentenced prior to booker,the supreme court decision that significantly changed the federal sentencing scheme and made the united states sentencing guidelines advisory.see at.merlino challenges the sentence he received on the basis that the district court improperly treated the guidelines as mandatory.because merlino did not challenge the district court treatment of the guidelines at the time of sentencing,we review his claim for plain error.see united states portes,cir.describing elements of plain error review,cert.denied,d.
merlino has met the first two elements of the plain error analysis because the district court did in fact treat the guidelines as mandatory which they then were when it sentenced merlino in,and which,after booker,is plain error now at the time of this appeal.see id.to establish the third element of our plain error review,merlino must demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights.see id.this prong places the burden on a defendant alleging a booker error to point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory guidelines booker regime.id.quoting united states antonakopoulos,cir.
in this case,merlino faced a career offender enhancement that would have resulted in a sentencing range of to months.the district court granted merlino request for a downward departure on the basis that merlino career offender status overstated the seriousness of his criminal history,see ussg,and calculated merlino guidelines sentencing range without considering the career offender guideline.the court further reduced merlino criminal history category from category vi to category v,even though his criminal history score alone would have placed him in category vi without consideration of the career offender guideline.the district court granted merlino a further reduction in his offense level based on his minimal role in the criminal activity.see ussg a.the court nonetheless rejected merlino requests for a downward departure based on duress or coercion and based on the harsh conditions under which he was incarcerated prior to trial.it also rejected merlino request for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.the district court calculated a sentencing range of to months,and it sentenced merlino to the bottom of that range.
merlino asserts that he has met his burden based on the fact that the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range and based on the district court characterization of his sentence as substantial but required,as it was the minimum sentence that the calculation of the guidelines permit ted.as we have often stated,a sentence is insufficient in itself to meet the defendant burden of establishing that the district court would likely have imposed a different sentence under an advisory scheme.see united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states martinez,cir united states.cir,cert.denied,d.
although the district court characterized merlino sentence as substantial and the minimum that was allowed under the guidelines calculation,the court did not indicate that it thought the guidelines sentence was unfair or overly harsh.see,at the court likewise did not suggest that it felt the guidelines sentence was too harsh.the district court resentenced merlino codefendant,rossetti,who likewise received a sentence,to the same sentence on remand from a successful booker challenge.see united states rossetti,cir.we have considered similar circumstances when determining whether a defendant has met his burden of establishing that the district court would likely sentence him to a lesser sentence under an advisory regime.see,at considering fact that the district court resentenced the defendant codefendants to the same or higher sentences on a booker remand in determining that the district court did not consider the guidelines too harsh.
the district court substantially reduced the sentencing range that merlino faced,from a potential range of to months down to a range of to months.given the significant downward adjustments granted by the district court as outlined above,coupled with its refusal to depart further despite its authority to do so,we conclude that merlino has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the district court would give him a lesser sentence.see united states jones,cir rejecting booker claim where the district court denial of a departure motion indicated that it considered the defendant situation not to be out of the ordinary.we therefore decline to remand for resentencing on these grounds.
government on judgment of acquittal 
the government cross appeals the district court grant of a judgment of acquittal to merlino on count three,which charged the defendants with carrying an explosive grenade during and in relation to a crime of violence,c,and which carried a mandatory minimum sentence,c b.we review the district court grant of merlino motion for a judgment of acquittal de novo.united states olbres,cir,cert.denied,d.like the trial court,we scrutinize the evidence in the light most compatible with the verdict,resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict favor,and then reach a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant is entitled to a judgment of acquittal only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,could not have persuaded any trier of fact of the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in making our assessment,we do not weigh the evidence or make any credibility judgments,as those are left to the jury.united states,cir.we must uphold the verdict if it is supported by a plausible rendition of the record,at internal quotation marks omitted.
count three was presented under a theory of liability,under which the government may show that a carried or used a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy and that this was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.united states bucci,cir quoting united states,cir.merlino conviction on count three should stand and the judgment of acquittal should be reversed if the evidence established that it was foreseeable to merlino that one of his would be carrying a hand grenade during the robbery.
the only evidence introduced at trial establishing merlino knowledge that a grenade would be used came from romano,who testified about the meeting that took place the night before the planned robbery.romano testified that the group met to discuss the final arrangements for the robbery and that there were times during the final meeting when some of the coconspirators were separate in the building for a while.he could not recall whether there were periods of time toward the end of the meeting when the weapons,the equipment,and the specific plans were being discussed that any of the four coconspirators left the group.according to romano,merlino left the meeting to retrieve the bags to be used for the money at some point during the meeting.however,in response to the specific question by the prosecutor about who was present when rossetti told the group that he had guns and grenades,romano replied,everybody was there.even though romano did not include a discussion of the grenade in his notes made shortly after the meeting,a fact brought out by merlino attorney,he remained steadfast in his testimony that he remembered merlino being present for the hand grenade discussion when questioned on cross examination q and we only have your word that grenades and other weapons were discussed when billy merlino was there as opposed to when he was,right a right,on redirect examination q in reviewing that,do you still maintain at this point that willy merlino was present when stephen rossetti discussed guns and grenades for the robbery a yeah,and again on examination q and your memory is also that when grenades were disc
