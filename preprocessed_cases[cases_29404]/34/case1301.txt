in,zachary wilson was convicted of the murder of jamie lamb,who was shot in a bar in the city of philadelphia.wilson was sentenced to death.during his relief proceedings,he learned that the commonwealth had withheld certain information from his counsel during trial that could have been used for impeachment purposes.he asserts that the commonwealth thereby violated his right to due process as set forth in brady maryland,d.after relief was denied by the pennsylvania supreme court,wilson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,raising thirteen claims for relief.the district court held a hearing solely on his brady claim and,concluding that a violation of brady had occurred,granted wilson request for habeas relief,vacated his conviction,and allowed the commonwealth days in which to retry him.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background and procedural history 
the factual background is taken from the opinions of the pennsylvania supreme court and the district court.see commonwealth wilson,direct appeal proceedings wilson i commonwealth wilson,appeal of relief proceedings wilson ii and wilson beard,civ,wl,federal habeas corpus proceedings wilson iii.the relevant facts are not in dispute.
on august,a man entered a bar in the city of philadelphia and pulled a gun from under his coat as he walked past several patrons sitting at the bar.he aimed the gun at the victim,lamb,who was sitting at the rear of the bar.after shooting the victim four times,the man fled the scene.the victim subsequently died from injuries caused by multiple gunshot wounds.wilson i,at.the shooter was later identified by two eyewitnesses,jeffrey rahming and edward jackson,as wilson.
according to the pennsylvania supreme court 
a commonwealth witness,jeffrey rahming,was in the rear of the bar,standing just behind the victim when the shooting started.rahming saw appellant enter the bar,aim the gun at the victim,and shoot the gun.
a second commonwealth witness,edward jackson,was sitting at the front of the bar when appellant entered.he,as well as many other patrons,dove to the floor as the gunfire began.when appellant rushed to leave the bar,he tripped over jackson and fell to the floor.jackson and appellant came face to face before appellant scrambled to his feet and ran out of the bar.
both jackson and rahming described the gunman to police and attended a police lineup in march.at the lineup,rahming identified wilson as the gunman but jackson did not.wilson was charged with lamb murder,but the charges were dismissed when rahming failed to identify wilson at the initial preliminary hearing.
wilson was later incarcerated on unrelated charges.in the summer of,lawrence gainer told philadelphia police officer john fleming that in october,when he and wilson were incarcerated together,he asked wilson why he killed lamb and wilson responded that he killed lamb because lamb had killed his adopted brother,ronnie williams.gainer refused to cooperate further at that time.however,gainer again spoke to officer fleming in march,at which time he agreed to provide a statement to the detectives investigating the homicide.based on gainer statement,wilson was and charged a second time with lamb murder.
on january,wilson trial began in the philadelphia court of common pleas before judge alfred sabo.the commonwealth case was based almost entirely on the testimony of jackson,rahming,and gainer.the jury returned its verdict on january,finding wilson guilty of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime.the court held a penalty hearing on january.the jury found two aggravating significant history of violent felony convictions and the knowing creation of a grave risk of death to no mitigating circumstances,and returned a sentence of death.on january,judge sabo sentenced wilson to death and a term of imprisonment of to years.
the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed wilson conviction and sentence,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari.see wilson pennsylvania,d.through counsel,wilson then filed a petition pursuant to the post conviction relief act pcra.see.ann.et.in his pcra petition,wilson alleged that the prosecution withheld evidence demonstrating that officer fleming coerced and threatened gainer and rahming into falsely incriminating wilson and that detective keenan exerted undue and improper influence over jackson in order to obtain his false testimony against wilson.the scope and nature of wilson brady claim changed during the course of the pcra proceedings,as wilson learned that jackson had an undisclosed prior criminal conviction for impersonating a police officer,that both jackson and rahming had prior mental health diagnoses relevant to their abilities to accurately experience and recall events,and that officer fleming had made loans to gainer during the time that gainer acted as a police informant.at the instruction of the pcra court,wilson filed a hearing memorandum in which he set out all of these bases for his brady claim.
on may,the pcra court denied wilson pcra petition,issuing a written opinion on september,in which it did not address wilson brady claim at all.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the denial of pcra relief on november,holding that wilson had waived his brady claim by failing to include it in his original pcra petition or to seek leave to amend his petition to include such a claim.accordingly,the pennsylvania supreme court declined to address this claim on merits.
on june,wilson filed the underlying petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the petition contained thirteen claims for relief,only one of which is at issue in the instant appeal.in claim i,wilson asserts that the prosecution violated his right to due process as set out in brady by failing to turn over evidence to defense counsel that could have been used to impeach jackson,rahming,and gainer and to undercut the prosecution case against him.after extensive briefing and oral argument on this issue,the district court agreed and granted relief,vacating wilson conviction and allowing the commonwealth days to retry him.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under and.we have appellate jurisdiction under and.the commonwealth is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability in order to appeal the district court decision to grant wilson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see cristin brennan,cir citing fed.b.
iii.standard of review 
because the facts underlying the brady issue are not in dispute,our review of the district court decision on that issue is plenary see duncan morton,cir.wilson petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed after april and is therefore subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see et.under aedpa,
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.because the pennsylvania supreme court held that wilson brady claim was waived,it did not reach the merits of the claim.accordingly,there was no adjudication on the merits to which the district court had to defer.see see also bronshtein horn,cir.the district court therefore reviewed this claim de novo.see appel horn,cir.because we agree with the district court that wilson brady claim is not procedurally barred,we will do the same.see id.at.
iv.discussion 
procedural default 
a federal court may not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.coleman thompson,d.a state procedural rule is not an adequate bar unless it is firmly established and regularly followed.bronshtein,at quoting ford georgia,d quoting james kentucky,d.whether such a rule is firmly established and regularly followed is determined as of the date the default occurred.see albrecht horn,cir.
the commonwealth argues that wilson brady claim is procedurally defaulted,based on the pennsylvania supreme court holding that wilson waived it by failing to raise it in its current form in his initial pcra petition,see.b,or to seek leave to amend his pcra petition to include this claim.see.a d.at the time wilson filed his pcra petition and,in fact,at the time it was denied,the pennsylvania supreme court still employed the relaxed waiver doctrine to reach the merits of claims brought by capital defendants which might otherwise be barred by waiver.see commonwealth mckenna.it was not until november that the pennsylvania supreme court discontinued this practice.see commonwealth albrecht.as we have held on numerous occasions,in capital cases where the waiver occurred before the pennsylvania supreme court made it clear that it would no longer apply the relaxed waiver rule,the waiver rule was not firmly established and regularly followed and,therefore,the waiver is not an adequate basis for a finding of procedural default see,albrecht,at laird horn,cir jacobs horn,cir szuchon lehman,cir.the commonwealth arguments to the contrary notwithstanding,we agree with wilson and the district court that the waiver rule as applied in this case was not adequate and,accordingly,that wilson brady claim is not procedurally defaulted.
brady claim 
in brady,the united states supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.subsequent cases have construed brady to require the disclosure by the prosecution not only of information actually known to the prosecutor,but of all information in the possession of the prosecutor office,the police,and others acting on behalf of the prosecution.see youngblood west virginia,d per curiam kyles whitley,d.under supreme court precedent,we will examine three factors in determining if a brady violation has occurred the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene,d see also banks dretke,d.the purpose of brady is not to require the prosecution to disclose all possibly favorable evidence to the defense but to make certain that the defendant will not be denied access to evidence which would ensure him a fair trial.see united states bagley,d.ultimately,t he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.kyles,at.
as the supreme court has emphasized,the impact of the suppressed evidence must be considered cumulatively,not individually.see id.at.the supreme court has described this as a balancing test for the prosecution 
on the one side,showing that the prosecution knew of an item of favorable evidence unknown to the defense does not amount to a brady violation,without more.but the prosecution,which alone can know what is undisclosed,must be assigned the consequent responsibility to gauge the likely net effect of all such evidence and make disclosure when the point of reasonable probability is reached.
while the brady decision itself concerned the failure of the prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence,it is clear that the rule announced in brady applies with equal force to the prosecutor failure to disclose evidence which could have been used for impeachment purposes.see united states bagley,d giglio united states,d.the rationale for this is clear such evidence is evidence favorable to an accused,so that,if disclosed and used effectively,it may make the difference between conviction and acquittal.bagley,at.quoting brady,at.
wilson claims that the commonwealth withheld three key pieces of information which could have been used to impeach the commonwealth primary witnesses against him at trial and which,if disclosed,clearly would have led to the discovery of additional information that also could have been used for impeachment purposes jackson prior crimen falsi conviction for impersonating a police officer rahming history of mental health problems and psychiatric interventions,including but not limited to the fact that he was taken to the emergency health services center at hahnemann hospital by a detective from the prosecutor office the day after he testified at wilson trial and officer fleming history of providing gainer with loans of undisclosed amounts during the time that gainer acted as a police informant.
on may,six weeks before the shooting,jackson was arrested for impersonating a police officer.according to the man he assaulted,who was employed as a security guard by the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority,jackson took his gun,threw him up against a wall,and told him he was going to arrest him.jackson was wearing a blue uniform and a badge and informed the victim that he was part of a special unit of the philadelphia police department.jackson was convicted on october,and a investigation and mental health evaluation were ordered.at the pcra hearing,wilson trial counsel,joel trigiani,testified that,had he seen jackson rap sheet,he would have requested to see the investigation report and mental health evaluation and would have used the information contained therein to impeach jackson.
the investigation report,dated december,reveals six arrests,two involving impersonation of a police officer.additionally,it states that jackson had sustained a severe head injury in and that within the past one and one half years,he has experienced pains in the back of his head,blackouts,and occasional loss of memory.the mental health evaluation,dated october,states 
he received two fractured skulls.the first time was in and the second time was in.he states that he has been having bad headaches and blackouts of late.testing indicates that there may be some difficulty in the left hemisphere.he has some motor visual problems,can not subtract sevens backwards.he has difficulty counting backwards from 
with respect to his mental status,the report notes that jackson long and short term memory were weak,but his social judgment was adequate.he could not think in abstract terms,and he has difficulty explaining himself and was easily confused.according to the report,the psychological testing revealed 
patterns that have a neurological quality in that he was blocked and unable to form adequate perceptions,and showed some dissociative tendencies.he has a need to have control over his environment primarily because he has difficulty interacting within a normal manner.he has a severe status problem and has a need to be accepted.
the report further states 
he sees himself as being an aid to the police and likes to associate and attach himself to police activities.his poor judgment and distorted perceptions of reality and where he fits into it appropriately causes him to function beyond normal limits at times.
with respect to the commonwealth second eyewitness,rahming,wilson alleges that the commonwealth had in its possession at the time of trial,but withheld,information regarding rahming history of mental health problems and psychiatric interventions.on january,the second day of wilson trial and the day after rahming testified that he had witnessed lamb murder,one of the detectives in the prosecutor office took rahming to hahnemann hospital emergency health services center.the clinician notes from that visit indicate that rahming had a history of mental illness and had been treated with prolexin shots and pills as recently as months ago.he reports that he has not abused any drugs since.he has used marihuana at that time.patient states that he recently witnessed a murder and the victim had fallen on him with the bullets in him.rahming was diagnosed with schizophrenia at that time and discharged to a community mental health center for case management.
at the pcra hearing,trigiani testified that,had he been aware of rahming emergency room visit,he would have asked to see his rap sheet.his rap sheet indicates a psychiatric evaluation dated february,and a investigation report dated march,and also reveals that rahming was placed on strict psychiatric probation as a result of his april,sentence.the investigation report indicates a history of drug and alcohol abuse and notes that rahming appear ed to have a number of physical,social,and mental disorders.the mental health evaluation,which was conducted approximately sixteen months before the shooting,reveals that rahming suffered from seizures and was on seizure medication at that time,and that he had been hit in the head with a padlock a few years earlier.with respect to his mental status,the report states 
at times,he is rather,and closes his eyes momentarily,and tells me that he feels sleepy because of his seizure medication 
he is well oriented and his memory is intact.his fund of information is rather limited,and his usual approach to problems is concrete although he does understand some abstractness.he appears in the low average intelligence,but his social judgment is rather impulsive and chaotic with poor capacity to turn to authority in an effective way.he does not express any values however.
he also tells me that he tends to lose his memory and does not always recall what he says or does if he becomes enraged,and he is expressing a pattern of epileptoid and disassociative acting out of his anger with a diminished sense of consciousness and responsibility and poor controls.he had little insight concerning this and he is not seen as a good candidate for psychotherapy because his thinking is rather concrete and limited.
the diagnosis section reads 
there is no evidence of any psychosis or major mental illness with this individual.he may be best described as a mixed personality disorder with and explosive traits who also suffers from a seizure disorder.psychological test material indicates some primitive and morbid aspects with inadequate coping mechanisms and much unresolved tension and emotionality with in this individual.
periodic progress reports filed during his term of probation indicate that he was taking haldol throughout and.trigiani testified that it would have been significant to know that rahming was taking haldol during the relevant time period because haldol is a psychotropic drug which is used to control psychoses or schizophrenia and it a mood equalizer.he also testified that it would have been helpful to know if rahming had taken haldol on the day of the shooting,because it may have affected his memory if he had or rendered him psychotic if he had not.the progress reports also describe rahming as exhibiting the demeanor of a slightly retarded person.during the pcra hearing,rahming admitted that he suffered,both then and at the time of the shooting,from schizophrenia,visual and auditory hallucinations,and nervous breakdowns,that he was a heavy user of drugs and alcohol,that he regularly mixed street drugs,alcohol and prescription medications,and that he was intoxicated at the time of the shooting.trigiani testified that if he had been in possession of that information during the trial,he would have asked questions concerning his ability to perceive,which is just.if the drugs affected him and he had symptoms affecting his ability to recall incidents,obviously it would have been an issue to be discussed before a jury.trigiani also testified that rahming testimony during the pcra hearing that he was taken to the emergency room by a detective from the district attorney office for placement suggests that some arrangements had been made in advance of his testimony at wilson trial and that there was possibly some sort of understanding or agreement in exchange for his testimony.
finally,officer fleming testimony at the pcra hearing revealed that he had loaned money,to gainer during the time period when gainer acted as a police informant.this is in contrast to his trial testimony,in which officer fleming testified that he and gainer had been friends for thirteen years and that officer fleming had used him on many occasions for information but that he had not paid lawrence gainer on prior occasions for his information and that he had never given him anything.
there can be no dispute that all of this information would have been favorable to wilson and could have been used to impeach the commonwealth three primary witnesses at trial and to undercut the commonwealth case against wilson.our analysis therefore focuses on whether this information was suppressed by the commonwealth and whether it was material to the jury verdict.
the commonwealth vigorously disputes that the prosecution suppressed the information regarding jackson prior conviction.trigiani testified at the pcra hearing that he filed motions asking the commonwealth to provide all exculpatory and impeachment information,including crimen falsi convictions for commonwealth witnesses.the commonwealth failed to disclose jackson criminal background,and wilson argues that it appears that,at the close of trial,the prosecutor affirmatively stated that jackson had none 
the court you have the convictions for jeffrey,jeffrey rahming 
robbery in,theft in,and an open case on retail theft.
trigiani right.
fisk correct 
trigiani gainer had 
fisk theft from in new jersey.
the court lawrence gainer had 
fisk theft.
the court theft in new jersey.
fisk that was all,no other convictions in crimen falsi beyond that.
based on these representations,trigiani testified that he did believe that jackson had any crimen falsi information.
the commonwealth maintains that this was not an affirmative misrepresentation regarding jackson criminal record but,rather,an accurate reference to gainer criminal record.accordingly,it argues that because the prosecutor did not affirmatively mislead defense counsel,because she was not personally aware that the information regarding jackson criminal history was in her file,and because that information was publicly available,there was no suppression within the meaning of brady.
the commonwealth misapprehends the state of the law as it relates to the prosecution disclosure requirements.the record reflects that jackson rap sheet was in the prosecutor file and his conviction was known to the police.we have clearly held that the prosecution bears the burden of disclosing to the defense a prosecution witness criminal record,whether or not an explicit request has been made by defense counsel.see united states perdomo,cir hollman wilson,cir.the commonwealth argues extensively that because jackson conviction was a matter of public record that easily could have been retrieved by defense counsel through the exercise of due diligence,the prosecution can not be deemed to have suppressed the information.in making this assertion,the commonwealth seeks to distinguish the instant case from perdomo,in which we concluded that a brady violation had occurred when the prosecutor failed to provide defense counsel with information regarding the prior criminal history of the prosecution main witness.see at.in response to two written requests for information regarding the criminal background of any prosecution witnesses,the prosecution responded that its main witness,hector soto,did not have a criminal background.after trial,it became evident that he did.see id.at.in response to the prosecution argument that it was not obliged to furnish the public defender with this information because the public defender office had previously represented soto in connection with his criminal conviction and,accordingly,defense counsel could be imputed with knowledge of soto criminal background,we held 
it is true that brady does not oblige the government to provide defendants wi
