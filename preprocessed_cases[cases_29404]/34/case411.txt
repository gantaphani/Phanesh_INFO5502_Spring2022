after a trial,a jury convicted angel zamora cruz and josé alfredo ayala of conspiring to rob a federally insured bank,count,aiding and abetting a bank robbery by use of a dangerous weapon,a,d count,and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,here,a bank robbery,c a count.the district court sentenced cruz to months imprisonment and ayala to months imprisonment.both cruz and ayala appeal their convictions.
cruz presents three claims.first,he argues that insufficient evidence supported his conviction for aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a crime of violence.he contends that the government failed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that he carried a real firearm as required by c.cruz second and third claims allege prosecutorial misconduct and erroneous jury instructions.
ayala presents only one claim,arguing that the court erred when it admitted his codefendant statement into evidence.this error,he contends,violated his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.after review of these claims,we affirm both convictions.
the facts stated here,which are relevant to cruz sufficiency claim,are presented in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states,cir.we add more facts where necessary to our discussion of the other appellate claims.
on february,two armed men entered a bank in puerto rico shouting,this is a robbery one of the men,later identified as cruz,proceeded to the bank front counter and demanded the tellers put money in a large,black plastic bag.the other man,later identified as ayala,shepherded bank employees to the front of the bank.four bank employees testified that cruz carried a gun.collectively,these four employees described the gun as a silver,shiny,nickel plated pistol.two bank employees testified that ayala carried a gun as well,with one describing it as a nickel plated,short barreled pistol and the other describing it as a silver handgun.
the tellers complied with cruz demand,placing money inside the bag.after receiving the money,cruz and ayala exited the bank,having been inside between one and two minutes.
the police received information that cruz and ayala were traveling in a red mazda.shortly thereafter,police officers discovered an abandoned car matching this description.near the car,they found cruz and ayala.a search of the area yielded a black plastic bag containing money from the bank a search of the red mazda produced a bullet casing on the passenger seat.the bullet casing corresponded with a luger brand bullet or cartridge.no guns,however,were ever found.
at trial,in addition to introducing testimony from bank employees and police officers,the government introduced a bank surveillance video.the video showed cruz and ayala entering the bank brandishing guns.the jury found both defendants guilty on all three counts.we first address the claims presented by cruz.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency claim 
because cruz failed to move for a judgment of acquittal on count aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during a bank review his sufficiency claim for plain error only.see united states díaz,cir under the plain error standard,we will not reverse unless allowing the conviction to stand would result in a clear and gross injustice.united states pratt,cir internal quotations omitted 
cruz sufficiency claim focuses on the definition of firearm.he starts with the premise that a conviction under c,requires proof that the defendant used a real firearm when committing the predicate offense.see united states taylor,cir noting that a toy or a replica will not do quotation omitted.for purposes of c,a firearm is defined as 
a any weapon including a starter gun which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive b the frame or receiver of any such weapon c any firearm muffler or firearm silencer or d any destructive device such term does not include an antique firearm.
armed with this definition,cruz argues that no reasonable jury could conclude that he used a real firearm in the robbery.he points to two pieces of evidence to support this argument.first,one of the bank employees who testified that cruz carried a gun later testified on that he was not a gun inspector and admitted that he could not tell whether the gun cruz carried was real or a toy.second,cruz notes that he confessed to an fbi agent that bb guns had been used in the robbery.
when analyzing cruz claim,we must keep certain principles in mind.although c requires proof that the gun is real,the government proof need not reach a level of scientific certainty.united states roberson,cir citation omitted.descriptive lay testimony can be sufficient to prove that the defendant used a real gun.id.citing united states kirvan,cir taylor,at concluding that the evidence was sufficient to prove the gun was real where three eyewitnesses to a bank robbery,who observed the object held by the defendant at close range,testified that it was a gun.
we find no error at all here,much less plain error.the record contains evidence,both direct and circumstantial,sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that cruz used a real firearm during the robbery.the direct evidence included the testimony of four bank employees.these employees testified that cruz held a gun,collectively describing the gun as a silver,shiny,nickel plated pistol.these descriptions are consistent with a conclusion that cruz and ayala used real guns.in fact,they are nearly identical to the descriptions provided by bank employees who testified in kirvan.in that case in which one of the witnesses described the item held by the defendant as a silver,shiny,handgun,we held that the government introduced sufficient evidence that the gun used in the robbery was real.at.moreover,none of the witnesses in this case,all of whom had ample time to view the gun,described it as a bb or toy gun.see taylor,at.in addition to this eyewitness testimony,the government also introduced a surveillance video showing ayala and cruz entering the bank and holding what appeared to be weapons.although the videotape did not give the jury the superior vantage point that the bank tellers had,this additional evidence did allow the jurors to see for themselves what the witnesses had observed.
finally,the jury also had circumstantial evidence to draw upon in concluding that cruz possessed a real firearm.two pieces of evidence stand out.first,the bank employees all responded as if the guns held by both cruz and ayala were real,complying with the requests made by the robbers.the jury could have reasonably inferred,based on the reactions from the employees in combination with the eyewitness testimony,that cruz and ayala carried real firearms.second,the police discovered a bullet casing in the vehicle used by cruz and ayala that corresponded with a real firearm.in our view,this circumstantial evidence,taken together with the direct evidence recounted above,supported the jury verdict on count.
our conclusion that sufficient evidence underlies count is not undermined by the evidence cruz directs to our witness expressed uncertainty regarding whether the gun cruz held was real and cruz alleged confession to an fbi agent that bb guns were used in the robbery.the wavering testimony of the one bank teller must be placed in context.three other bank tellers expressed no such uncertainty.as for cruz statement to the fbi,it does not merit overturning the verdict.in addition to being,the statement was never admitted into evidence.
prosecutorial misconduct 
cruz claims that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct during its closing argument,warranting a new trial.specifically,he maintains that the prosecutor inaccurately recounted the facts in the record and therefore prejudiced the outcome of the case.
cruz focuses on the prosecutor statement recapping the testimony of various bank tellers.the prosecutor,cruz notes,told the jury that the bank tellers testified that cruz and ayala carried firearms.cruz argues that this was inaccurate because the tellers never used the term firearms in their testimony.rather,the tellers used the words pistol and handgun to describe the objects held by cruz and ayala.the prosecutor paraphrasing was prejudicial,cruz contends,because n ot all handguns are firearms.
where an improper statement has been made,we typically ask whether the statement so poisoned the well that a new trial is merited.united states carpenter,cir.but because cruz did not object to the prosecutor statement at trial,our review is only for plain error.united states vanvliet,cir 
we find no plain error.to begin,the prosecutor paraphrasing did not plainly result in a factual inaccuracy.although cruz claims that not all handguns are firearms,a handgun,according to its dictionary definition,is a firearm as a revolver or pistol designed to be held and fired with one hand.see collegiate dictionary ed see also united states mckeeve,cir a comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that merely recounts properly admitted testimony,accurately and without embellishment or distortion,can not constitute reversible error.citation omitted.
moreover,the prosecutor use of the word firearm did not prejudice cruz.the district court gave two instructions to the jury that safeguarded against any potential prejudice.first,the court emphasized that the prosecutor closing argument was not evidence.united states bey,cir concluding that prosecutor inaccurate recounting of evidence during closing argument did not prejudice the defendant where the district court explicitly cautioned the jury that it could not consider the arguments of counsel as evidence against the defendant see also united states brandao,cir.and second,during jury instructions the court related the legal definition of the word firearm to the jury.so,however the prosecutor paraphrased the testimony of the bank tellers,it was ultimately and clearly up to the jury to conclude whether the guns used qualified as firearms 
jury instruction 
finally,cruz claims that the court issued erroneous jury instructions.specifically,cruz asserts that the court failure to define dangerous weapon when instructing the jury on count led the jury to believe that it could convict cruz on count if it found that cruz used a dangerous weapon during the robbery.on the contrary,he asserts,to convict him on count the jury had to find that he used a firearm.the difference between a firearm and a dangerous weapon is important,cruz argues,because although a bb gun or even a toy gun may qualify as a dangerous weapon under d count,neither would qualify as a firearm under c count.compare kirvan,at noting that,under c,a toy or replica will not do citation omitted with united states cannon,cir concluding that,under d,a toy gun may qualify as a dangerous weapon.
because cruz did not object to the court instructions at trial,our review is again for plain error.united states,cir observing that this standard is exceedingly difficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether jury instructions were erroneous in the first place,we review them as a whole to determine if they adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.id.
we find no error in the court instructions,much less plain error.the court appropriately instructed the jury regarding the definition of firearm.the court instructed the jury that,for purposes of count,the firearm count,it must find that cruz used a firearm during the robbery,and defined a firearm as any weapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the actions of an explosive.in so doing,the court made plain to the jury that it could not convict cruz on count if it found that he used a toy gun or bb gun during the robbery.
we turn now to ayala sole claim.ayala argues that the court erred when it allowed an fbi agent to testify regarding an statement made to authorities by his codefendant,cruz.the court allowed the agent to testify about cruz statement after ayala counsel,via,questioned a puerto rico police officer about the failure of the police to pursue various investigatory options after it detained the two defendants.
the agent,who was the case agent for the investigation,explained that the fbi and puerto rico police failed to pursue certain investigatory options because they believed they had captured the right suspects.in doing so,the agent referred to cruz statement while testifying that 
i became aware at the time of the detention of the two defendants that cruz had stated to the officer who gained custody of him,that the money is over there in a black bag,we already threw away the weapons,and something to the effect of,we screwed,less than five minutes and they caught us.
in ayala view,the court decision to admit cruz statement into evidence violated his confrontation clause rights as defined by the supreme court decisions in crawford washington,d and bruton united states,d.ayala argues that the court should have avoided a crawford or bruton problem by either suppressing the statement or severing his trial from cruz.we review this claim de novo.united states de la cruz,cir.
the confrontation clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.united states,cir quoting const.amend.vi.ayala says that his right of confrontation has been infringed under both crawford and bruton.as we explain more fully below,however,the admission of cruz statement offended neither crawford nor bruton for two reasons.first,the statement was not offered for its is,to prove that the money was in the bag,that they were screwed or even that the defendants were the true rather to explain why the fbi and police did not pursue other investigatory options after apprehending the defendants.and second,ayala trial strategy opened the door to the statement admission.
we start with the supreme court decision in crawford,which held that the confrontation clause prohibits the admission of testimonial hearsay into evidence against the defendant unless the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to him.united states earle,cir citing crawford,at.it follows,then,that even where a declarant statement is testimonial the statement may nevertheless be admitted into evidence if one of the following three circumstances exists the statement is not hearsay in that it is being admitted for a purpose other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted the declarant testifies at trial or the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant and the declarant is unavailable.united states maher,cir see also crawford,at.
in his confrontation clause argument,ayala presses two points that the testimony was hearsay and,even if the government offered a basis for admitting the statement,that basis was pretextual.
first,ayala contends that the court violated crawford because none of the circumstances noted above existed.the government argues the contrary,contending that cruz statement was not hearsay because it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
we agree that cruz confession was not hearsay.as federal rule of evidence c provides h earsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.statements offered not to prove the truth of the matter asserted but merely to show as a statement offered for the limited purpose of showing what effect the statement had on the not hearsay.united states bailey,cir noting a statement offered to show the effect of the words spoken on the listener,to supply a motive for the listener action is not hearsay citation omitted see also united states,cir stephen saltzburg et,federal rules of evidence manual f ed.if a statement is offered for its effect on the listener,in order to explain the listener conduct,it does not matter whether the declarant is telling the truth.
here,the government introduced cruz confession to explain why the authorities cut short their investigation into the robbery,specifically,why they did not take fingerprints or dna evidence from the red mazda.the district court drove this point home to the jury on two separate occasions.prior to admitting the statement,the court told the jury 
the fbi agent is going to testify as to actions he took in his investigation of this case,based upon information he received.and what i going to instruct you is that his testimony concerning what he did,the actions he took,because of information he had,is not being presented to you to consider the truthfulness of the defendant statement in any way whatsoever.you instructed not to consider the statement he going to testify about as evidence on any of the counts or against the defendants of any of the counts charged in the indictment.
additionally,when issuing the final jury instructions,the court emphasized that the jury was not to consider cruz statement for the truth of the matter asserted therein and must only consider it for the limited purpose of providing a context for the decision not to send the fingerprint evidence to the laboratory for processing.
we now turn to the second part of ayala crawford argument.he contends,citing maher,that the crawford inquiry does not end merely because the government advances a based justification for offering the declarant statement.rather,we must satisfy ourselves that the government justification for offering the declarant statement is not pretextual.pursuing this further,ayala argues that the record indicates that the government purported based justification for offering cruz confession masked an attempt to circumvent crawford.
in maher,we acknowledged that if the government needs only to identify a based reason for introducing the statement it could circumvent crawford constitutional rule as well as the hearsay rule.at see also united states silva,cir allowing agents to narrate the course of their investigations,and thus spread before juries damning information that is not subject to,would go far toward abrogating the defendant rights under the sixth amendment and the hearsay rule.therefore,as was the case in maher,when an statement is purportedly offered into evidence as example,to provide context for police action or are concerned about whether the stated purpose for introducing the evidence masks an attempt to evade crawford and the normal restrictions on hearsay.maher,at noting that t he dividing line often will not be clear between what is true background to explain police conduct and thus an exception to the hearsay rule and thus an exception to crawford and what is an attempt to evade crawford and the normal restrictions on hearsay and warning prosecutors against attempts to get statements by declarants before a jury.
in this case,after analyzing how cruz confession came to be admitted into evidence,we are satisfied that no pretext was afoot and that the government did not attempt an around crawford and the hearsay rules.
cruz confession was the subject of a suppression hearing held in the midst of the trial.during this hearing,ayala sought to suppress the admission of cruz confession,arguing that it created a potential bruton problem.the prosecutor informed both the court and the defendant that he did not intend to introduce cruz confession in the government.the government did,however,reserve the right to present the confession for purposes of rebuttal.
at trial,ayala counsel opened the door to the fbi agent testimony,pointedly a police officer about the decision not to pursue certain investigatory opportunities after apprehending the defendants.counsel focused on potential fingerprint and dna evidence the police could have gathered from the red mazda and sent for analysis.in total,ayala counsel identified eleven missed opportunities to tie ayala to the red mazda.faced with this line of questioning,the government sought to introduce the fbi agent testimony to explain why the fbi and police did not lift forensic evidence from the car.
ayala argues that the government true motive in admitting the agent testimony was to march out cruz confession,making ayala guilty by association in the process.in support of this argument,ayala relies heavily on the fact that the government introduced the substance of the confession rather then constructing a narrative.specifically,he suggests that if the government merely wanted to explain why the fbi and police failed to conduct a more thorough investigation it could have had the agent testify in a manner that entirely avoided referencing cruz confession.as an example,ayala argues that the agent could have testified that the government chose to truncate the investigation because of information the agent had.
we do not think the government failure to present a more sanitized narrative reveals a motive to undercut crawford.given the tenor of ayala about the authorities failure to investigate further,the use of the generalized narrative ayala suggests would have come at an unjustified cost to the government.during,ayala counsel painted a picture of police and fbi ineptitude,observing that the government missed eleven opportunities to tie ayala to the car,and thus,to the crime.generalized testimony limited to an explanation such as we stopped investigating because of information received,without any context,would not have sufficiently rebutted ayala line of questioning.while there can be circumstances under which confrontation clause concerns prevent the admission of the substance of a declarant statement where a less prejudicial narrative would suffice in its place,this is not such a case.
a bruton claim arises in a narrower set of circumstances than does a crawford claim,specifically,involving the admission of a codefendant statement during a joint trial for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted.see tennessee street,d.
it is well established that a codefendant statement is admissible against that codefendant as a party admission.d united states vega molina,cir.but that same statement is inadmissible hearsay and raises confrontation clause concerns with respect to another defendant being prosecuted in a joint trial.id.citing crawford,at.
a trial judge may attempt to avoid any hearsay or confrontation clause problems by instructing the jury not to consider the statements against any defendant other than the.vega molina,at see also richardson marsh,d ordinarily,a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness against a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant.this accords with the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.citation omitted.as bruton holds,however,such a limiting instruction will not effectively remedy hearsay and confrontation clause problems if the codefendant statement is so powerfully inculpating of the other defendants that there would be substantial doubt as to whether the jury could abide by a limiting instruction.vega molina,at explaining further that a statement is powerfully inculpating where it is inculpatory on its face citing bruton,at.
importantly though,bruton conditional bar on the admission of a codefendant statement during a joint trial operates on a key the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.see street,at.where the codefendant statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,a court may,in certain circumstances,admit the statement provided it gives a limiting instruction explaining the limited purpose the statement serves.id.at.furr brady,cir.
the supreme court decision in street is the exemplar.in that case,the court held that the district court admission of a codefendant confession did not raise a confrontation clause problem because of t he nonhearsay aspect of the codefendant confession.street,at.the court noted that the government offered the confession not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when street,the defendant,later confessed.id.the court went on to observe that the government introduced the codefendant confession to rebut street testimony that his own confession was coerced and,importantly,that no alternative short of admitting the codefendant statement along w
