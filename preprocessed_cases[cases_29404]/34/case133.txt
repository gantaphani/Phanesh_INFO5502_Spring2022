the government sent a third letter on august,this time to the recently appointed federal defender,indicating that sergeant deyermond,after reviewing reports,recalled that he observed the firearm in cintron left jacket pocket 
on february,the federal defender filed a motion to reconsider cintron first motion to suppress based on the changes in the accounts of the police officers.on february,the federal defender filed a second motion to suppress the firearm.in support of both motions,the federal defender submitted the various police reports describing the stop,the affidavit of trooper gaudet,the government letters,and the testimony of trooper browning at the hearing on cintron first motion to suppress.in support of the second motion to suppress,the federal defender submitted a new affidavit in which cintron averred that the gun was in his buttoned right pocket and was not visible and that the troopers did not discover the gun in his pocket until after they had frisked him.the federal defender also submitted photographs of cintron jacket a gun similar to the one possessed by cintron the jacket containing the gun in a pocket lying on a table and a model wearing the jacket containing the gun in the pocket.the gun does not protrude from the pocket in either of the latter two photographs.

on appeal,cintron claims that he made a threshold showing sufficient to place in doubt the troopers account that they saw the gun before they conducted the frisk,and he argues that the district court abused its discretion by not holding an evidentiary hearing on cintron second motion to suppress and his motion to reconsider his first motion to suppress.
