in november,a jury found tony soto guilty of four counts of aiding and abetting his girlfriend,theresa brown,in making false statements to a federal firearms licensee in violation of a a.soto appeals his conviction.we will affirm.
fred delia owns and operates a gun shop in philadelphia,pennsylvania,and has a federal firearms license.when a person buys a gun at his store,he is required to fill out a form.on the form,question asks the person purchasing the gun who is the actual buyer of the firearm.specifically,the question asks,are you the actual buyer of the firearm s listed on this form warning you are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm s on behalf of another person.if you are not the actual buyer,the dealer can not transfer the firearm s to you.app.
on december,brown bought a firearm from delia at his gun shop.at the time of the purchase,two males accompanied her.the men looked at the firearms and did most of the talking with delia.according to delia,brown did not know what she was doing with respect to firearms.eventually,brown purchased a shotgun.at the time of purchase,she filled out a form,and certified that she was the actual buyer of the firearm.brown also purchased firearms under similar circumstances on march,and again on april,from delia at his store.as with the december,purchase,brown certified on a form that she was the actual buyer of the firearms.
the circumstances of these three purchases made delia suspicious.subsequently,he contacted the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms atf,and indicated that he believed that brown was a straw purchaser of the firearms.a straw purchaser is someone who states that she is buying a firearm for herself when,in actuality,she is buying it for someone else.following up on this tip,atf agents set up surveillance at delia gun shop and at brown home.on april,agents observed brown leave her home and get into a taxi with two males.one of the males was later identified as soto.the taxi drove to delia gun shop where brown purchased a firearm.she again certified on a form that she was the actual buyer.after leaving the store,atf agents eventually detained all three individuals and took them to headquarters for questioning.
after being given his miranda warnings,soto told investigators that he was brown boyfriend.he admitted acting as protection for brown on several occasions when she went to delia gun shop to purchase firearms.soto admitted that the firearms were purchased so that they could be resold to drug dealers.soto was paid for his services,and brown was paid.
in june,soto was indicted on four counts of aiding and abetting brown in making false statements to a federal firearms licensee.the government case at trial included testimony from delia,brown and the investigator who conducted soto interrogation.the jury convicted soto on all four counts.he was sentenced to months imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.soto timely filed a notice of appeal.
on appeal,soto makes several arguments.first,he argues that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to establish that he aided and abetted brown in making false statements with respect to the false statements on the forms.second,he asserts that the jury should have decided the issue of whether the information that was falsely answered by brown was required to be kept in the records by delia.third,soto argues that even if the trial judge properly decided the second issue,brown false statement that she was the actual buyer of the firearms was not required by law to be kept in delia records.

sufficiency of the evidence 
soto claims that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction.specifically,he asserts that he was unaware that form would ask brown if she was the actual buyer.he argues that because he was not on notice of this actual buyer question,the evidence produced at trial does not support the inference of the culpable knowledge necessary to support the conviction of aiding and abetting.we disagree.
in order to convict a defendant of aiding and abetting the commission of a crime,the government must prove that the substantive crime has been committed and that the defendant charged with aiding and abetting knew of the commission of the substantive offense and acted with the intent to facilitate it.see united states dixon,cir.
in order to aid and abet a defendant must do more than associate with individuals involved in the criminal venture.he must participate in the criminal enterprise as something he wishes to bring about and that he seeks by his action to make succeed mere presence at the scene of the crime,even in the company of one or more of the principal wrongdoers,does not alone make one an aider and abettor,unless the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did something to forward the crime and that he was a participant rather than merely a knowing spectator.

soto was convicted of aiding and abetting brown in making false statements to a federal firearms licensee in violation of a a.section a a states that whoever 
knowingly makes any false statement or representation with respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in the records of the person licensed under this chapter or in applying for any license or exemption or relief from disability under the provisions of this chapter shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
as noted by the district court in denying soto motion for judgment of acquittal,the evidence produced at trial revealed that soto escorted brown to delia gun shop on several occasions.he was present in the store with her at the time of these purchases and actively involved himself in the purchase of the firearms.indeed,he was paid in his role as protection for brown.he knew that the guns were not for her,and that they were going to be resold to drug dealers.in this case,soto was more than merely a knowing spectator.he was actively involved in the gun purchase process and participated in the criminal enterprise.he actively involved himself in the straw purchase,and knew that brown was a straw purchaser.
a similar case arose in united states abfalter,cir.in that case,michael williams had his girlfriend,roxanne abfalter,buy firearms for him over a period of two months because he was a convicted felon.williams was present when abfalter made these purchases.williams handled the firearms and negotiated a sale price at the gun store.at the time of each purchase,abfalter completed a form,and affirmed that she was the actual buyer of the firearm.after he was arrested,williams confessed that he convinced abfalter to purchase the firearms for him because he was a convicted felon.he was then going to resell the firearms for a profit.see id.at.
among his other crimes,williams was convicted of aiding and abetting abfalter in making false stateme
