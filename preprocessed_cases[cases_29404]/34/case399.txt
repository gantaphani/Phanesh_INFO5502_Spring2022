maximano silva appeals both his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to obtain and obtaining controlled substances by fraud,health care fraud,identity theft,and aggravated identity theft.he argues,inter alia,that his conviction rested on evidence illegally obtained and that the district court improperly calculated his sentence.finding no error,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
the conduct underlying the charges occurred during two separate time periods,in and in.on may,police officers searched silva home pursuant to a warrant and discovered blank and forged prescription forms,pharmacy bags,receipts and pill bottles for various narcotics,pieces of identification in the names of person other than silva,and other items that linked silva to identity theft and drug fraud activities.the subsequent police investigation determined that silva forged prescriptions for narcotics and provided his wife and a friend with fake identification to facilitate the filling of the fraudulent prescriptions.
silva participation with his wife and his father in a doctor shopping conspiracy provided the basis for the remaining charges the scheme resulted in at least five doctors in different massachusetts towns prescribing pain medications for silva father at the same time.silva also forged several prescriptions for narcotics in the doctors names,and silva father or wife filled the prescriptions at various pharmacies in massachusetts.
on october,the grand jury returned a indictment charging silva with the following crimes conspiracy to obtain and obtaining controlled substances by fraud,in violation of a and health care fraud,in violation of identity theft in connection with obtaining controlled substances by fraud,in violation of a and aggravated identity theft in connection with making false statements,in violation of.
silva filed a motion to suppress evidence seized in the may,search,asserting that the warrant was not based on probable cause.during two days of evidentiary hearings,detective charles devlin devlin and silva brother norman testified.devlin search warrant affidavit listed multiple sources of information that linked silva to identity theft activities,including statements made by norman on may,norman complained to devlin at the hudson police station that silva had accrued traffic tickets and medical bills in norman name.norman explained that he had entered silva bedroom and seen a speeding ticket in his name,as well as a driver license and phone bill of someone in marlborough devlin asked norman to bring the items to the station.devlin later testified that he assumed norman had taken the items upon first discovering them and did not realize norman twice reentered silva bedroom.on may,norman reentered silva room,returned to the station,and provided devlin with a copy of the speeding ticket and medical bills.devlin inquired about the driver license and cell phone bill and upon learning that they were still at the family home,asked norman to bring the documents so that the police could get a search warrant.norman retrieved driver license and cell phone bill and on may,brought the items to the station.
on february,the court denied silva motion to suppress in a memorandum opinion.united states silva,d.the court held norman first and second searches of silva bedroom which yielded the traffic ticket in norman name were private,noting norman acted on his own initiative and for his own interests.the court found that the third search yielding driver license and cell phone bill was a government search violating the fourth amendment.nonetheless,the district court found the search was valid under the independent source doctrine.
the jury trial began on march.silva primarily argued that his sister and her husband,paul danforth danforth,who were arrested for passing forged prescriptions,committed the crimes.at trial,silva introduced a july letter written by danforth from jail to his wife that allegedly showed that the evidence seized in the may search belonged to the danforths because the parties initially believed danforth would be unavailable to testify,silva conceded the letter was hearsay and sought to admit it as a statement against penal interest.when it became clear danforth would testify,silva instead requested admission of the letter as a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to rule b.at trial,danforth denied ownership of the evidence seized from silva bedroom.danforth admitted to writing part of the letter but denied writing the portion relevant here.the court instructed the jury to consider the letter only as evidence of danforth credibility silva did not object.after a handwriting expert testimony,the court ruled the letter was admissible but could only be considered for whether it was consistent with danforth testimony again,silva did not object.
on march,the jury convicted silva on all but two counts.the court sentenced silva to months in prison and months of supervised release.this appeal followed.
ii.motion to suppress 
silva claims the evidence obtained in the may,search should have been suppressed,arguing the authorizing warrant lacked probable cause absent evidence obtained in earlier,illegal searches.to support this claim,silva asserts that his brother norman acted as a government agent when norman found and provided the police with various items.the district court rejected silva claim,finding the search warrant valid under the independent source doctrine.
we review the district court legal conclusions in a denial of a motion to suppress de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states momoh,cir citations omitted.we will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.id.quoting united states kornegay,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review a finding that a cleansed affidavit was sufficient under the de novo review provisions set forth in ornelas united states,d,with deference to the inferences drawn from facts found by the lower court and law enforcement officers.united states dessesaure,cir citing united states smith,cir.
silva first argues norman second search of his bedroom violated the fourth amendment,contending that devlin instigated and counseled it.the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies only to government action and not to a search or seizure,even an unreasonable one,effected by a private individual not acting as an agent of the government.united states jacobsen,d quoting walter united states,d blackmun,dissenting.this circuit has identified the following three factors as potentially relevant in deciding whether a private party acts as a government agent the extent of the government role in instigating or participating in the search,its intent and the degree of control it exercises over the search and the private party,and the extent to which the private party aims primarily to help the government or to serve its own interests.united states pervaz,cir.we will not find state action simply because the government has a stake in the outcome of a search.compare id.finding phone company interest in preventing defrauding of customers to be primary purpose for search,even though it was probably true that there would have been no search had government not informed company of fraud with corngold united states,cir finding joint endeavor subject to fourth amendment where private party purpose was solely to assist federal agents,and agents helped open boxes and inspect contents.see also united states walther,cir observing that presence of officers alone,without active role in encouraging or assisting private search,does not implicate fourth amendment,especially where the private party has had a legitimate independent motivation for conducting the search.
in the present case,the district court correctly determined norman did not act as a government agent in the second search.although devlin encouraged norman to bring items to the police station,he did not participate in the search and exercised no control over the manner in which it was conducted.indeed,devlin did not tell norman to search silva bedroom again because he believed norman already possessed the items.moreover,norman second search was motivated by his desire to clear his name he returned to the station with only those items that were relevant to his concerns and that would exonerate him.although silva makes multiple arguments about inferences the lower court could have drawn from the evidence he has failed to shown the court conclusions were clearly erroneous.
silva also contends that the search warrant for the may,search was tainted by the evidence obtained in norman third search of silva bedroom which the district court found illegal the court conducted an independent source inquiry and held there was sufficient information to establish probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.when conducting an independent source inquiry,a court should first determine whether the police officer would have sought the warrant even without the evidence obtained from the illegal search and second,whether the warrant contains sufficient information to establish probable cause after setting aside the tainted information.murray united states,d dessesaure,at.
even after excising license and cell phone bill,ample evidence remained,see supra note,such that a reasonable officer would seek a warrant considering the totality of the circumstances,see dessesaure,at,satisfying the first prong of murray.with respect to the second,probable cause prong of murray,devlin received report and believed that silva answered his call to the cell phone number associated with name.after norman initial visit,devlin investigated the traffic stops and obtained corroborating evidence from two police officers.viewed objectively,this evidence,independent of any information gained from norman illegal search,provided probable cause to support devlin decision to seek a warrant 
iii.evidentiary ruling 
silva next asserts that the district court incorrectly held that danforth letter,see supra note,was admissible only for impeachment purposes as an inconsistent statement.even if we were to entertain silva claim we review only for plain error.united states taylor,cir citations omitted see also olano,at.distinguishing waiver from forfeiture and discussing plain error review.thus,silva must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir citations omitted.
the district court did not err in ruling that the letter was hearsay.c,admissible only for impeachment purposes as a prior inconsistent statement.b.silva insists the limited admissibility of danforth letter violated a constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence.but our facts differ from crane kentucky,d,a case on which silva heavily relies,where the court reversed a conviction after the trial judge refused to admit any evidence regarding the voluntariness of a confession after denying a motion to suppress.see also holmes south carolina,d involving the complete exclusion of evidence regarding a third party guilt.here,danforth took the stand and was subject to silva examination,including questions regarding the letter he penned silva was able to present his defense throughout the trial he called a handwriting expert and five police officers who testified about danforth fraudulent activities,and his lawyer,in closing arguments,strenuously argued that danforth testimony and the letter indicated that silva was not guilty of the conduct in.because the court correctly applied the evidentiary rules and as silva was not deprived of any constitutional right,the district court did not plainly err in limiting the admissibility of danforth letter.see,evans verdini,cir upholding exclusion of hearsay statement for both substantive and impeachment purposes against sixth amendment challenge.
iv.jury instructions 
silva objection to the district court instruction regarding speculation also is unavailing.on the eighth day of trial,the jury asked the court,can suspicion,with lack of evidence,regarding or toward any person other than the accused in the case be used to formulate reasonable doubt the court proposed an instruction which contained the following statement the verdict must be based on the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.however,you should never speculate.silva initially agreed with the instruction but later objected,arguing that the jury should be allowed to speculate that someone else committed the crime.
while we would review de novo a claim that an instruction embodied an error of law,united states deppe,cir united states nascimento,cir,we review for abuse of discretion whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.united states ranney,cir quoting united states deluca,cir.to evaluate whether a reasonable likelihood exists that the jury understood the appropriate burden of proof,deluca,at,this circuit examines the instruction not in isolation but as part of the charge taken as a whole,victor nebraska,d quoting holland united states.
we find that the lower court instruction was correct as a matter of law.the court was not wrong to stress that the jury should not speculate but instead should rely on the evidence presented.see id.at.finding instruction correct where court cautioned the jury against influence by factors beyond the evidence such as conjecture,sympathy,passion,or prejudice.moreover,the court explained the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt at least times during its charge,compare to ranney,at finding no likelihood of confusion where the court referenced beyond a reasonable doubt some times,creating more than a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction.
sentencing 
in addition to the objections regarding the pretrial and trial proceedings,silva appeals his sentence,contending the district court applied the wrong base offense level bol to his conduct,used the wrong guidelines manual,and found facts at sentencing not charged in the indictment or found by the jury.we deal with these claims summarily.
silva first argues that his bol should have been six,not seven because silva did not previously object to this calculation,we review for plain error.united states reiner,cir citation omitted.we find no error in the district court computation.silva was convicted of two counts of identity theft under a,in connection with obtaining controlled substances by fraud,a.these convictions subject silva to imprisonment for not more than years.see b a a.thus,under the plain language of a,see supra note,silva convictions warranted a bol of seven.
silva next raises an ex post facto challenge to the district court employment of the federal sentencing guidelines rather than the guidelines in his sentencing memorandum,he stated that the predicament defendant finds himself in does not,strictly speaking,raise an ex post facto issue emphasis added.additionally,at the sentencing hearing,silva stated,i not arguing that there some kind of ex post facto problem here that the court should sentence him under those the guidelines.these affirmations lead us to concur with the government that silva waived his ex post facto claim.see olano,at.
and even under a plain error review,united states,cir,silva argument fails.generally,t he court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.a.however,if the use of that guideline results in a higher sentence than the guideline in existence at the time of the conduct,it raises ex post facto concerns.united states harotunian,cir employing guidelines in effect at time of offense.we look to the date of the last charged offense and the guidelines to determine whether an ex post facto issue exists.united states,cir cmt.t he last date of the offense of conviction is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.thus,the correct comparison is between the guidelines,which the district court employed,and the guidelines,in effect on the date that silva last offense of conviction was completed.the guidelines are in
