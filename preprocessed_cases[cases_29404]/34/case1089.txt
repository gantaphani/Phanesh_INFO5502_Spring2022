defendant jose dorance florez florez appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on may,after a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york charles sifton,judge at which he was found guilty of two narcotics conspiracies,the first to import more than one kilogram of heroin into the united states in violation of,a,b a,and the second to possess with intent to distribute the same quantity of heroin in violation of,a,b a i.sentenced to concurrent incarceratory terms of months,which he is presently serving,as well as concurrent terms of supervised release,and a total special assessment,florez challenges the district court judgment on the grounds that the charges against him are,the record evidence is legally insufficient to support his conviction,and his incarceratory sentence is a based on impermissible judicial factfinding as to drug quantity and b unreasonably disproportionate to the prison term imposed on his brother for participation in the same conspiracies.we reject these claims as without merit and hereby affirm the judgment of conviction.
factual background 
florez conviction originates in a conspiracy to import heroin from colombia into the united states and in a related conspiracy to take possession of those drugs in the united states in order to distribute them in this country.the trial evidence showed that florez initially proposed these schemes to his brother,jose maria florez,also known as chepe,after which the brothers financed and supervised a heroin importation and distribution ring that operated between february and november.
in furtherance of their conspiratorial objectives,florez and chepe recruited numerous couriers to smuggle heroin into the united states.at trial,three of these couriers provided direct evidence as to the workings of the charged conspiracies and florez participation in them.each courier testified that florez main role was to provide couriers with heroin in south america and to instruct them how best to smuggle the drugs into the united states.upon the couriers arrival in the united states,chepe would pay them,take custody of the smuggled heroin,and arrange for its distribution.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury convicted florez of conspiracy to import more than one kilogram of heroin and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute that same quantity of heroin.it acquitted florez on related substantive importation and possession counts.in response to a special interrogatory,prompted in part by the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d,the jury further found beyond a reasonable doubt that florez was responsible for a total of more than three but less than ten kilograms of heroin on the conspiracy counts of conviction.
at sentencing,the district court,relying on united states booker,d,concluded that it was not bound by the jury finding as to any drug quantity in excess of the quantity of heroin needed to trigger a statutory minimum sentence of ten years.in calculating florez sentencing guidelines range,the court found that the defendant was responsible for upwards of kilos of heroin.see c providing base offense level for drug crimes involving more than but less than kilograms of heroin.because the district court further found that florez played a supervisory role in the crimes of conviction,see id.b providing for enhancement,it assigned him a total offense level of,which,with a criminal history category of i,resulted in a guidelines range of to months incarceration.nevertheless,the district court elected to impose a prison sentence of months,taking into consideration the fact that chepe,who had earlier pleaded guilty to his involvement in the same narcotics schemes before a different judge,had received a sentence.
ii.discussion 
a.the statute of limitations challenge 
florez submits that,because his criminal conduct occurred in,his indictment is necessarily by the statute of limitations applicable to federal crimes.see.florez acknowledges,as he must,that this limitations period is appropriately tolled during any time when he was a fugitive from justice.see no statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.nevertheless,he submits that the district court erred in tolling the statute of limitations in his case from june,the date of chepe arrest,to may,the date law enforcement authorities discovered florez whereabouts,because he was not fleeing from justice during that time.we disagree.
the burden of proof and standard of review 
to toll a statute of limitations,it is the government burden to show that a defendant was fleeing from justice.in jhirad ferrandina,cir jhirad ii,we concluded that,in the context of an extradition proceeding,this burden can be carried by a preponderance of the evidence.see also ross united states marshal,cir applying preponderance standard to interpretation of flight under in extradition proceeding.since then,a number of our sister circuits have ruled that a preponderance showing also satisfies the application of to a united states criminal prosecution.see united states greever,cir united states marshall,cir united states gonsalves,cir.as the ninth circuit explained,because proof of flight is not determinative of guilt,it is not fairly viewed as an element of the crime of conviction requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states gonsalves,at citing lego twomey,d holding that government need only prove voluntariness of confession by preponderance of evidence and noting that guilty verdict is not rendered less reliable simply because the admissibility of a confession is determined by a less stringent standard.
one district court outside this circuit has ruled to the contrary,holding that flight must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury just like any other element of the case.united states owens.we are not persuaded.due process demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which a defendant is charged.in re winship,d see also jackson virginia,d.whether florez fled from justice is not a fact constituting any part of the narcotics crimes with which he was charged.rather,it is a fact that determines whether the law will toll the statute of limitations for florez prosecution on any crime.thus,while proof of florez flight may well have been necessary to avoid a dismissal of his indictment,such flight did not thereby become an element of the charged narcotics offenses.for this reason,we conclude that the flight necessary to support tolling is properly determined by the trial court rather than the jury further,we join our sister circuits in holding that,in a criminal prosecution,the government carries its burden when it proves a defendant flight from justice by a preponderance of the evidence.
with this burden in mind,we review the district court findings of fact relevant to the application of only for clear error,and we review de novo its legal conclusion that these facts establish flight as specified by the statute.see ross united states marshal,at united states greever,at united states jaffe,cir holding that,in reviewing restitution component of sentence,issues of law are reviewed de novo and findings of fact for clear error.
the contours of flight under 
in construing the flight requirement of,we begin with streep united states,in which the supreme court considered the meaning of the phrase fleeing from justice as used in an earlier statute creating an exception to the application of a limitations period.in streep,the court stated 
it is unnecessary,for the purposes of the present case,to undertake to give an exhaustive definition of the words any person fleeing from justice for it is quite clear that any person who takes himself out of the jurisdiction,with the intention of avoiding being brought to justice for a particular offence,can have no benefit of the statute of limitation s,at least when prosecuted for that offence in a court of the united states.
drawing from this language,most courts,including our own,have concluded that a person mere absence from a jurisdiction is insufficient,by itself,to demonstrate flight under or its statutory predecessor there must be proof of the person intent to avoid arrest or prosecution.as we observed in jhirad ferrandina,in the context of an extradition proceeding,the phrase fleeing from justice carries a common sense connotation that only those persons shall be denied the benefit of the statute of limitations who have absented themselves from the jurisdiction of the crime with the intent of escaping prosecution,cir jhirad i emphasis added accord united states,cir.many of our sister circuits agree that such intent is a necessary component of flight.see ross united states marshal,at cir holding that fleeing from justice requires proof that the accused acted with the intent to avoid arrest or prosecution united states greever,at cir.holding that requires proof that the defendant concealed himself with the intent to avoid prosecution united states,cir holding that a fugitive from justice must be found to have absented himself from the jurisdiction with the intent to avoid prosecution united states marshall,at cir.concluding that defendant intent to avoid arrest or prosecution must be proved in order to trigger the tolling provisions of section united states wazney,cir holding that intent to avoid prosecution is an essential element of fleeing from justice brouse united states,cir holding that essential characteristic of fleeing from justice is leaving one residence,or usual place of abode or resort,or concealing one self,with the intent to avoid punishment.
although decisions by the eighth and circuits suggest that the specific intent to avoid prosecution is not essential to toll a statute of limitations on account of flight,see in re assarsson,cir mcgowen united states,the latter court,at least,has tempered this view when the evidence of flight does not show actual departure from the jurisdiction,see united states singleton,concluding that showing of intent to avoid prosecution is required for tolling when accused does not leave jurisdiction where crime was committed.no matter.in this circuit,the rule in criminal prosecutions remains that stated in jhirad i and a finding of flight under requires proof that a defendant intended to avoid arrest or prosecution.
preliminary to reviewing florez claim that the district court erred in finding that he possessed the requisite intent to flee justice,we reiterate some basic legal principles relevant to this determination.first,while a person intentional flight from justice may certainly be inferred from his failure to surrender to authorities once he learns that charges against him are pending,united states catino,cir see also united states greever,at collecting cases,formal charges are not essential to such an inference.as this court stated in united states,where a person is aware that a criminal investigation is underway,a court may conclude that he intentionally fle d within the meaning of even though no prosecution has been commenced in any jurisdiction.at see streep united states,at.holding that fleeing from justice does not require that the course of justice should have been put in operation by the presentment of an indictment,or by the filing of an information,or by the making of a complaint it is sufficient that there is a flight with the intention of avoiding being prosecuted,whether a prosecution has or has not been actually begun.
second,the government need not prove a defendant actual departure from the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed to establish intentional flight from justice under.as the ninth circuit has explained,i t is enough that an accused leaves his usual place of abode and conceals himself for the purpose of avoiding arrest or prosecution.in modern large and heavily populated districts it is almost as easy to avoid arrest or prosecution by concealing oneself within the district as by fleeing the district.united states wazney,at internal citations omitted see united states greever,at there is nothing in the language of that requires the government to prove that the defendant left the jurisdiction.ferebee united states,cir holding that a defendant departure from his usual place of abode and the concealing of himself within the district is equally within the meaning of a prior statute as defendant flight to another jurisdiction.indeed,as we have recognized,f leeing from justice is not always a physical act it may be a state of mind.united states eng,cir,holding that defendant who resisted extradition could be fleeing felon even though he was imprisoned in another jurisdiction,abrogated on other grounds by degen united states,d.
finally,a finding of intentional flight under is not necessarily foreclosed by a hindsight determination that the government might have located the defendant sooner if it had taken certain actions.rather,the nature and the extent of the efforts of government agents to locate the defendant is one factor to consider in determining whether it is reasonable to infer from the agents failure to locate the defendant that the defendant was acting with the intent to avoid arrest or prosecution.united states greever,at internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles to this case,we identify no error of law or fact in the district court conclusion that,beginning on june,and continuing through may,florez was fleeing from justice with the intent of avoiding arrest or prosecution for his narcotics trafficking.
florez intentional flight from justice 
after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the district court concluded that the evidence overwhelming ly indicated to a high probability that the defendant fled shortly after his brother chepe arrest on june,and thereafter concealed himself for a number of years for the sole purpose of avoiding prosecution.pretrial tr.june,at.this evidence took various forms,starting with florez statements to two that his brother was in trouble.that acknowledgment,together with evidence that florez and chepe were joint participants in a drug trafficking operation,permitted the district court to infer florez awareness that law enforcement authorities soon would to apprehend him as well as chepe.
the evidence further showed that,after june,the day of chepe arrest,florez never returned to his workplace,although he had been employed there for approximately twelve years.similarly,he ceased residing at the queens home he had shared with chepe.in response to law enforcement inquiries over the ensuing weeks and months,family and reported that florez had returned to his native colombia.indeed,in,florez told a female acquaintance,girleza silva,that he had just returned from colombia when he asked if he could list her queens he never his residence on a new york state driver license application.florez also used silva bank account to conduct financial transactions.
although the totality of these circumstances strongly supports the district court finding of flight with the intent to avoid arrest and prosecution,florez submits that no such conclusion could be drawn in light of other evidence showing that prior to june,he routinely took several months leave from his job during the summer months and he had lived openly at two queens addresses,one belonging to a relative,the other to a friend,between october and january.his argument is unconvincing.
however routine it may have been for florez to take extended summer leaves from his employment,what was not typical was his total failure to return to his job,as occurred in the years after his brother june arrest.the district court did not clearly err in rejecting the argument that florez disappearance from all known new york locations after that day was merely coincidental to his brother arrest.it reasonably concluded from the totality of the evidence that florez fled at that time with the specific intent to avoid arrest and prosecution.see united states martin,cir the fact that an innocent explanation may be consistent with the facts alleged does not negate court factual finding quoting united states fama,cir united states maher,cir ruling that district court was entitled to reject defendants belated innocent explanations for their conduct and to credit inculpatory evidence united states macpherson,cir holding that defendant innocent explanations for conduct did not preclude jury from inferring requisite mens rea from other inculpatory evidence.
the fact that,at some point in or,florez may have returned to queens,does not undermine this inference.to the contrary,the fact that florez deliberately did not use either of the queens addresses where he purportedly lived in securing his new york state driver license,preferring instead falsely to list girleza silva address as his residence,strongly indicates florez continued intent to conceal his true whereabouts in order to avoid being apprehended.that purpose is further evidenced by florez use of silva bank account,as opposed to that of the relatives or friends with whom he was actually residing,to deposit a check for back pay from his former employer.indeed,the fact that florez paid silva than of the check this use of her bank account indicates the particularly high value the defendant placed on effecting a rather routine transaction in a way that would minimize anyone ability to locate him.although florez later tried to add his name to silva account to facilitate his access to the deposited funds,his hasty departure from the bank when he thought a teller was attempting telephonically to confirm his identification documents,further evidences his determination to avoid any inquiry that might draw official attention to himself and possibly lead to his arrest.
finally,we identify no clear error in the district court conclusion that the government efforts to locate florez throughout the period from june,to may,were reasonably diligent.pretrial tr.june,at.from june,well into,law enforcement authorities actively sought to locate florez at various queens locations only to be told by and family members that he was in colombia.when,in february,officials received information that florez had returned to the united states,relatives continued to insist that he was,in fact,still in colombia.in february,upon learning that florez had used girleza silva address to secure a new york state driver license,authorities questioned silva,who admitted her contacts with the defendant and denied actual knowledge of his whereabouts,but provided various leads,none of which bore fruit.in february,silva provided further cooperation nevertheless,ensuing surveillance efforts to locate florez again proved unsuccessful.florez was finally located on may,when,in reporting himself to be the victim of a carjacking,he provided local police with a queens address far from indicating law enforcement neglect in searching for florez,this evidence of the government prolonged inability to locate him despite numerous efforts over a period supports the district court conclusion that defendant intent throughout was to avoid arrest and prosecution.see united states greever,at observing that where government reasonable efforts to locate the defendant are unsuccessful,court may infer that defendant was acting with the intent to avoid arrest or prosecution internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,we conclude that the district court correctly construed the flight requirement of committed no clear error in finding that florez was intentionally fleeing from justice from june,to may,and properly tolled the statute of limitations during that period,rendering meritless florez timeliness challenge to his january indictment.
sufficiency challenge 
florez submits that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the trial evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the jury guilty verdict.see.c.we review de novo a district court denial of a rule motion,applying the same standard of sufficiency as the district court.see united states jackson,cir.that standard imposes a heavy burden on the defendant,whose conviction must be affirmed if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states macpherson,at quoting jackson virginia,at.emphasis in jackson.in assessing sufficiency,we are obliged to view the evidence in its totality and in the light most favorable to the prosecution,mindful that the task of choosing among permissible competing inferences is for the jury,not a reviewing court.see united states salmonese,cir.applying these principles to this case,it is apparent that florez sufficiency challenge lacks merit.
three cooperating witnesses provided direct evidence of the charged conspiracies and florez membership in them.miguel pavez,a courier recruited for the importation conspiracy by defendant brother chepe,and rodrigo deschamps,another courier recruited by pavez,testified in some detail to several occasions in when,in colombia,they received aerosol cans filled with heroin from florez to smuggle into the united states via ecuador and chile.on their arrival in new york,the couriers would give the heroin to chepe,who would pay them for their efforts.on one occasion in new york,deschamps overheard florez tell chepe that deschamps was a good courier who should be sent out often,more often.trial tr.at.pedro villagomez testified that florez recruited him as a courier in february.on two occasions thereafter,in colombia,florez gave him aerosol cans filled with heroin and instructed him how to behave when smuggling the drugs into new york,where he also delivered the contraband to chepe.eventually,villagomez proposed to florez and chepe that he organize a courier cell to operate from ecuador.florez arranged for villagomez to retrieve suitcases containing heroin at a luggage terminal in quito for transportation to new york by these couriers.after one of the couriers was arrested in new york in august,villagomez met with florez and chepe in colombia.as a result,the brothers arranged for villagomez to transport approximately one kilogram of heroin into the united states via ecuador in october.villagomez was arrested in possession of these drugs upon his arrival in houston,texas.
florez submits that this testimony,which we have substantially condensed,was insufficient to support a verdict of guilty because the government failed to offer any documentary corroboration,specifically,customs forms and passenger manifests,confirming his travel between colombia and new york during the conspiratorial period.florez emphasizes that the government did offer such evidence with respect to international travel by other conspirators.he contends that,without this corroboration,the accomplice witnesses were inherently incredible.we are not persuaded.
the law is well established that a federal conviction may be supported by the uncorroborated testimony of even a single accomplice witness if that testimony is not incredible on its face and is capable of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states parker,cir.as this court has previously explained,the government failure to corroborate a witness testimony raises a question as to the weight a jury might choose to give that testimony,not its legal sufficiency to support a conviction.see united states roman,cir a ny lack of corroboration goes only to the weight of the evidence,not to its sufficiency.the weight is a matter for argument to the jury,not a ground for reversal on appeal.in this case,where three accomplice witnesses provided mutually corroborative direct evidence of the existence of the charged conspiracies and florez membership in them,a sufficiency challenge based on the lack of corroborating documentary evidence must necessarily fail.
to the extent florez challenges the accomplices credibility based on their plea agreements with the government and their long histories of criminal and dishonest behavior,he simply repeats facts and arguments already presented to the jury.we will not attempt to a jury credibility determination on a sufficiency challenge.see united states autuori,cir it is not for the court on a rule motion to make credibility determinations see also united states rea,cir matters of the choice between competing inferences,the credibility of the witnesses,and the weight of the evidence are within the province of the jury,and we are not entitled t
