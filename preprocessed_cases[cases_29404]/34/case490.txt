after skehan returned to the police station,he and an assistant district attorney watched one of the videotapes.it showed rogers having sexual intercourse with a relative child a and also showed the child engaging in other sexually explicit conduct at rogers direction.based on that evidence,on july,skehan sought and obtained a search warrant the second search warrant to search rogers apartment for

procedural history 
on the basis of the evidence,prosecutors indicted and convicted rogers in both state and federal court.we describe the state proceedings only insofar as they are relevant to the issues raised by the pending federal appeal.
state indictment and conviction 
on september,the state of maine indicted rogers in a indictment,charging him with sexual offenses against child a,child b and dw identified as child c.pursuant to a plea agreement,he pled guilty to,and was convicted of,four of the six counts gross sexual assault in violation of b,based on his having engaged in a sexual act with child a,a minor under the age of count two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of a now,based on his having caused child a and child b to engage in sexually explicit conduct knowing or intending that the conduct would be photographed counts and and sexual abuse of a minor in violation of,based on his having engaged in a sexual act with dw child c,a minor who was or and at least years younger than he count.the state dismissed the remaining two counts.

federal court indictment and conviction 
on july,a few weeks before the state court imposed its sentence,a federal grand jury indicted rogers for one count of possession of child pornography in violation of a b.the indictment charged that on or about july,in the district of maine,rogers had knowingly possessed a computer that contained an image of child pornography,specifically a computer graphic image the production of which involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,that had been transported in interstate and foreign commerce,specifically by computer via the internet.app.the federal charge was based solely on rogers possession of the images found on his computer,not on his sexual abuse and exploitation of the three minor children.
federal court motion to suppress 
rogers filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence discovered after the issuance of the first search videotapes,the pornographic images discovered on his computer,and his incriminating statements.he argued that the first search warrant authorization to search for and seize photos of dw encompassed solely developed print photographs and not images on a videotape or on a computer.he further argued that because the contents of the first videotape provided the basis for the second search warrant,everything discovered and seized pursuant to the second warrant should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.
a magistrate judge recommended denying the motion to suppress.she concluded that searching the computer hard drive and the videotape for photos of dw was well within the scope of the warrant because both were plausible repositories for photos of dw.app.she reasoned that g iven the current state of technology,looking at a computer hard drive to find photos is no more inappropriate than opening a photo album and that c urrent technology also permits photos to be stored on homemade videotapes.id.over rogers objection,the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation in its entirety.app.
guilty plea and sentencing 
on june,pursuant to a plea agreement,rogers pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in violation of a b.however,he reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.see.a.
