this appeal raises questions about the government obligations in a criminal case to make notes of,and to disclose,information that may impeach its witnesses or exculpate the defendant.ramiro rodriguez was convicted of drug dealing in a trial in which the government case rested primarily on the testimony of two cooperating witnesses.during the direct examination of one cooperating witness,the government elicited that the witness had lied about everything during her initial interviews with investigators.defense counsel demanded that the government disclose investigators notes from the interviews,and demanded to be informed of the substance of the witness false statements.the government advised that no notes had been made of the false statements and refused to disclose the substance of the lies.the district court at first indicated that the government should make such a disclosure,but expressed doubt whether disclosure could properly be required where the false statements were not memorialized in a document or a recording,and ultimately declined to compel the disclosure.
rodriguez contends he suffered a violation of his rights under the jencks act,under brady maryland,d,and giglio united states,d,and under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.he contends the government investigators were obligated to take notes during their interviews with the cooperating witness,so that the notes could be turned over to the defense,and that,in any event,the government was obligated under brady to disclose the substance of the witness lies.
we reject rodriguez argument that the government was obligated to take notes during its interviews with its witness.as for rodriguez further the government was obligated to disclose the substance of the witness can not resolve them at this stage of the case.if the district court reason for declining to compel disclosure was that the statements were not recorded,we do not agree.when the government is in possession of material information that impeaches its witness or exculpates the defendant,it does not avoid the obligation under to disclose the information by not writing it down.
it does not necessarily follow,however,that the failure to disclose in this case violated any right of rodriguez.the disclosure obligations of brady and giglio apply only to impeaching or exculpatory information that is of sufficient importance to be deemed material.see united states bagley,d united states agurs,d in re united states,cir.the district court was never advised of the nature of the lies and never ruled on whether the witness undisclosed prior statements were sufficiently material to give rise to a disclosure obligation.we remand to the district court for a determination of materiality and prejudice.
background 
rodriguez was convicted of a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine in violation of b a.the government case consisted primarily of the testimony of two witnesses.patricia lopez,a drug dealer,testified that rodriguez was sent to the united states by her colombian suppliers to help her collect on customers outstanding debts.noel espada,one of lopez customers,testified that rodriguez and other members of the conspiracy arranged to pick up in drug money from him.
both witnesses testified pursuant to cooperation agreements with the government.lopez had met more than ten times with the representatives of the government.the government provided the defense with no notes of those meetings,explaining that no notes had been taken on direct examination,the assistant united states attorney ausa asked lopez whether she had told the truth during the meetings.lopez answered that during her initial meetings with the government,before she signed a cooperation agreement,she lied about everything 
q.when you first spoke with the government,did you tell them the truth 
q.what did you lie about 
about,about everything.
q.why did you lie 
well,i really do know how to explain this.i did.i was afraid.
q.did you eventually tell the government the truth about your involvement with drugs 
q.did you tell the government the truth about all of your criminal activity 
referring to brady maryland,d,defense counsel requested to be told the substance of lopez lies,insisting that the government is obliged to turn over exculpatory or impeachment material whether they have yet reduced it to writing or not t hey ca avoid advising the defense simply because they do write it down.the ausa refused,taking the position that defense counsel was free to elicit the lies from the witness on.
the court expressed sympathy with the defense position i think that is an appropriate request and i will make it i think the obligation is there,but great doubt as to whether such an order could appropriately be addressed to material that had not been recorded or written down y ou do have any piece of paper and you are not going to require i have never seen anything that says the government has to turn over oral information.although the district court at first expressed the view that the government should disclose the nature of the lies,the government continued to object,and the court,without further explanation,took no action to compel disclosure and denied the defendant motion for a mistrial.on,defense counsel asked lopez generally about the fact that she had lied to the government,but did not ask her to specify what lies she told.
when noel espada testified on direct examination,the ausa asked whether p rior to signing the cooperation agreement he had told law enforcement agents the truth about his own involvement in drug selling.espada answered that he had initially failed to disclose his brothers involvement,but testified that he made a full disclosure after he signed his cooperation agreement.on,espada testified that he met with dea agents around ten times before trial,spanning about fifty hours of interviews,and spoke with the ausa at least twenty times.defense counsel objected that the government had turned over notes relating to only one meeting.the ausa explained that no other notes had been taken.
discussion 
i.the government failure to take notes 
rodriguez argues that by failing to take notes during interviews with lopez and by taking only minimal notes during interviews with espada,the government violated his rights under the jencks act,under brady and giglio,and under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.he suggests that the government deliberately refrained from memorializing the witnesses statements in order to evade any obligation to turn over exculpatory and impeaching information to the defense.he equates the government behavior with the destruction of,the destruction not of written notes,but rather of any record of the witness es oral statements by failing to preserve them in written form.moreover,according to rodriguez,b y snuffing out the record the g overnment immunized its two chief witnesses from full and fair.
the jencks act requires the government to produce to the defendant any statement by the witness that relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.b see id.e defining statement.the term statement,however,is defined to include only statements that have been memorialized in some concrete form,whether in a written document or electrical recording.id.e.the obligation has no application where,as here,no such memorialization has been created in the first place.see united states houlihan,cir the jencks act does not impose an obligation on government agents to record witness interviews or to take notes during such interviews.
we reject rodriguez contention that brady or the confrontation clause requires the government to take notes during witness interviews.while brady and giglio,as discussed below,obligate the prosecutor in certain circumstances to disclose to the defense material exculpatory and impeaching information,those cases have not been generally construed to require the government to make written notes for the defendant benefit this is in part because the government representative may have no way of knowing,upon hearing a witness statement,that the statement is inconsistent with what the witness will say at a later time.rodriguez contends that in order to protect the obligation of the government to turn over inconsistent statements of witnesses once it becomes aware of the inconsistencies,the government is obligated to take notes of all interviews of potential witnesses.brady,giglio,and the confrontation clause have not been construed to impose this obligation,and we decline to extend them in this manner.
ii.the government disclosure of brady information 
whether the government was obligated to make notes of a potential witness statements and whether it was required to disclose the witness lies are very different questions.from the fact that the government is not required to make notes of a witness statements,it does not follow that the government has no obligation to inform the accused of information that materially impeaches its witness.brady and its progeny require the government to disclose material information that is favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching.strickler greene,d see also brady,at.due process obligation to disclose to the defendant evidence favorable to an accused leka portuondo,cir material evidence favorable to the defendant quoting united states avellino,cir.this obligation is designed to serve the objectives of both fairness and accuracy in criminal prosecutions.to begin with,it recognizes the possibility that the evidence on which the prosecution relies to prove the defendant guilt is not necessarily truthful,accurate,or complete,especially when the prosecution investigations have made it aware of evidence or information that might be favorable to the defense in controverting the government proofs.
the supreme court explained in strickler that the government duty to disclose derives from 
the special role played by the american prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials.within the federal system,for example,we have said that the united states attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy,but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest,therefore,in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,but that justice shall be done.berger united states.
strickler,at.
brady information must be disclosed,furthermore,in a manner that gives the defendant a reasonable opportunity either to use the evidence in the trial or to use the information to obtain evidence for use in the trial.thus,the government must make disclosures in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon the information efficaciously.see leka,at noting that brady disclosures must be timed so that the defense has a sufficient opportunity to use them id.at when a disclosure is first made on the eve of trial,or when trial is under way,the opportunity to use it may be impaired.see also disimone phillips,cir the more a piece of evidence is valuable and rich with potential leads,the less likely it will be that late disclosure provides the defense an opportunity for use.quoting leka,at.similarly,disclosures must be sufficiently specific and complete to be useful.see leka,at finding brady not satisfied where government did not disclose details of potential witness knowledge,because defendant was left to gamble on what witness would say.
if the district court reason for declining to compel the government to make disclosure was that the lies were not set forth in any document or recording i have never seen anything that says the government has to turn over oral information,we disagree.as noted above,we agree with the district court that the absence of such memorialization is determinative with respect to any obligation to disclose a witness statements under the jencks act.the considerations under brady and giglio,however,are quite different.brady and giglio obligations,which apply only to material exculpatory and impeaching information,arise because it would be unfair to the might cast doubt on the reliability of the the trial to be conducted without informing the defendant of such information.the obligation to disclose information covered by the brady and giglio rules exists without regard to whether that information has been recorded in tangible form 
even if the district court relied on an inappropriate reason for declining to compel disclosure,that would not necessarily mean that a brady violation occurred,which would require overturning rodriguez conviction a brady violation occurs only where there is a reasonable probability that a different verdict would have resulted from disclosure of the information that the defendant claims was suppressed.strickler,at.see also bagley,at.agurs,at.in re united states,at.the government declined to disclose the substance of lopez lies because it contended at trial that it had satisfied all of its obligations under brady,and the district court,which ruled on a different basis,never considered whether the failure to disclose lopez lies would violate brady.because we do not know what lopez lies were,we can not determine whether disclosure was mandated under or whether the government refusal to make disclosure more extensive than lopez testimony that she lied about everything caused the defendant prejudice.the district court is far better positioned to make this appraisal.accordingly,we remand,in accordance with the procedures set forth in united states jacobson,cir,so that the district court can evaluate these questions in the first instance.
in the event the court determines that disclosure was mandated,the court will need to consider the government argument that any disclosure obligation was fully discharged when the ausa elicited on the direct examination of lopez that she had lied about everything.the government takes the position that this disclosure gave the defendant the full protection of the brady rule because it armed defense counsel with sufficient information to learn the specifics of lopez lies by her.
we express no definitive views on the government argument because the conclusion may vary depending on the nature of the undisclosed material.but at least in some circumstances,telling the defendant that a witness lied,but leaving it for defense counsel to find out what the lies were by questioning the witness before the jury,might as a practical matter foreclose effective use of the impeaching or exculpatory information.defense counsel would be in the difficult position of having to question the witness blindly in the jury presence,not knowing whether the answers elicited might seriously incriminate or prejudice the defendant.see leka,at the opportunity for use under brady is the opportunity for a responsible lawyer to use the information with some degree of calculation and forethought.a responsible lawyer could not put the potential witness on the stand without essential groundwork.it is not surprising that,despite having pressed for disclosure of the specific lies,none of the defense lawyers ran the risk of asking lopez what lies she had told.at least in some circumstances,a prosecutor use of this approach to the discharge of a brady disclosure obligation might well result in the defendant never learning the nature of the exculpatory or impeaching material which gave rise to the disclosure obligation.while we can easily imagine circumstances in which this approach to brady disclosure would effectively defeat its purpose,it may be appropriate in other circumstances.
the government acknowledged to the court by letter that it might have been the better practice to have provided the defense with more information about the substance of lopez prior inconsistent oral statements.it contends nonetheless that its disclosure complied with brady and giglio.we will express no view of the issue on the present facts because the facts are unknown to us.we note further,however,that while the government and lopez characterized her initial statements as lies,that characterization presumes the truth of the version of events she gave on the witness very issue at the heart of rodriguez trial.lopez eventually came to characterize her initial
