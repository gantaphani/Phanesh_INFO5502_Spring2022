this appeal arises from gary lee gillion convictions on four counts of mail fraud,in violation of,and one count of conspiring to commit mail fraud,in violation of.gillion challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his convictions,as well as the district court admission of statements he made pursuant to a proffer agreement with the government.for the following reasons,we affirm.
gillion became southeastern regional manager of citicapital trailer rental citicapital,a trailer leasing company owned by citigroup,in.gillion was based in citicapital columbia,south carolina office.his duties as regional manager included overseeing the profit of the region branches,monitoring sales contracts,and ensuring that branches complied with company policies.
prior to becoming a regional manager at citicapital,gillion worked with a number of trailer leasing companies.throughout his career,he maintained a business relationship and friendship with john dalcanton,a trailer leasing executive.dalcanton was serving as citicapital vice president in its dallas,texas headquarters when the events leading to gillion convictions transpired.
in early december,dalcanton visited gillion in columbia and told him that citigroup was considering selling citicapital.concerned that the sale would mean gillion and dalcanton would lose their jobs,gillion told dalcanton he had created a side company capital city trailer capital city to make some money in case citicapital laid them off.records reveal that gillion opened a business checking account in capital city name on november.
dalcanton,who later pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit mail fraud and testified against gillion at trial,described three ways he and gillion used capital city to defraud citicapital and purloin profits beginning in late.first,gillion would arrange sales of trailers,checking the book value of the trailers with dalcanton before finalizing each sale.gillion would then sell the trailers for more than book value,write a cashier check to citicapital for the book value of the sale,and keep the profits above book value to split with dalcanton.second,gillion and dalcanton would arrange secret leases of the trailers and keep the lease payments as profits.third,gillion and dalcanton would arrange contracts on behalf of capital city with potential citicapital customers,who would lease trailers from capital city for a number of months,then purchase the trailers outright for a nominal sum at the end of the period.dalcanton would either not report the nominal purchase to citigroup or create a nominal purchase to cover up these rentals so he and gillion could keep the lease payments.on at least one occasion,described in detail below,gillion and dalcanton arranged for citicapital to sell capital city the trailers it needed to execute a contract during the lease period,so capital city could reap the contract profits outright.
the third strategy forms the basis for gillion mail fraud convictions.the scheme involved baker transportation baker,a south carolina trucking company which had been a citicapital customer for several years.the government and gillion presented conflicting information as to whether baker would have remained a citicapital customer as of late.william baker,the company owner,testified that there was no reason to believe his relationship with citicapital would end in or and that he had no plans to take his business elsewhere.the citicapital salesman in charge of baker account,kevin sparks,testified that baker often made late payments and that he could not approve baker credit for further trailer rentals in.sparks also testified,however,that gillion could override credit determinations and give customers additional credit.
on october,gillion,acting as president of capital city,signed a agreement with baker.the agreement named eight trailers by serial number.baker testified that these were the foot trailers that he liked to purchase and that the agreement was basically the same purchase plan as his previous citicapital contract.baker agreed to make lease payments to capital city over three years,from november,to november.each lease payment would be for per trailer,per month,plus tax,with baker receiving the option to purchase the trailers for one dollar at the end of the lease period.the contract listed a mailing address at which baker would be invoiced and an address for capital city.
as of october,however,neither gillion nor capital city owned the eight trailers named in the baker lease.rather,on december,gillion had dalcanton approve a sale of the eight named trailers from citicapital to capital city,at per trailer.this sale represented a loss for citicapital.the used bill of sale document listed,by serial number,the same eight trailers gillion had already leased to baker.gillion did not sign his name to the sale document.instead,to conceal his identity,he forged his name james pitts as the capital city purchaser.on february,dalcanton transferred the eight trailer titles from citicapital to capital city.between november,and november,baker mailed lease payments totaling more than to gillion as president of capital city.in particular,baker mailed checks on april,may,june,and july.over the course of the lease,capital city,gillion,and dalcanton received over in profits from the baker deal.
although citigroup did not sell citicapital in,as dalcanton predicted,it did eventually sell the company.citicapital came to rest in the hands of xtra lease xtra,a national trailer leasing company,in february of.after purchasing citicapital,xtra due diligence revealed accounting discrepancies that brought capital city,dalcanton,and gillion names to the fore.xtra inquiry led to a civil suit against gillion for conversion and breach of fiduciary duty,in which gillion was held liable to xtra for over one million dollars.
on march,before his eventual indictment gillion signed a proffer agreement with the government the agreement,pursuant to which he agreed to provide information about his actions while employed as a citicapital regional manager.he also agreed to submit to polygraph examination s by any qualified polygraph examiner should he be requested to do so,acknowledging that f ailure to pass to the satisfaction of the government any polygraph examination administered pursuant to this agreement constitutes a breach of the agreement,which then allowed the government to use for any purpose any statements gillion made during the interview.absent breach,the agreement barred the government from using gillion proffered statements against him.pursuant to the agreement,gillion met with special agent chris mcclure on march,for an interview,during which he admitted that he had formed capital city leased and sold some citicapital trailers in furtherance of the scheme assured some customers that citicapital and capital city were indeed sister companies used dalcanton to create a cover trail using paper and run capital city while working for citicapital.
a federal grand jury issued a indictment on august,charging gillion with one count of conspiring to embezzle from a common carrier,in violation of,and eight counts of embezzling from a common carrier,in violation of.on april,a grand jury issued an superseding indictment,charging gillion with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,in violation of,and seven counts of substantive mail fraud,in violation of.
before trial,the government requested that gillion submit to a polygraph examination to test the truth of his original proffer interview.gillion moved to suppress the statements he made during the proffer session,arguing that the agreement had no effect.the government contended that the agreement was still in effect as a binding contract.the district court found the agreement was still in effect,and held that gillion could either sit for the polygraph examination which would be limited to questions related to topics raised in the original proffer interview or be found in breach.gillion sat for the polygraph examination on june,but left the session midway,disputing the scope of the questions.as a result,the district court found gillion in breach and allowed agent mcclure to testify to gillion proffered statements at trial.
during a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of south carolina,the government presented testimony from several witnesses,including dalcanton and mcclure.the government theory was that gillion and dalcanton had an overarching scheme to deprive citicapital of profits,and that the pair used the three methods dalcanton described trailer sales,leases,and contracts to do so.dalcanton testified to each method,including the documents surrounding the baker deal,which represented the third,or,method of defrauding citicapital.dalcanton specifically testified to the used bill of sale document he signed which allowed gillion to buy the trailers he needed for the baker deal from citicapital the cashier check gillion used to purchase the trailers and the fact that dalcanton did not recognize the name of james pitts,the signature gillion forged on the sale sheet.dalcanton stated that citicapital would have loved a profitable deal on the trailers gillion contracted with baker to lease.j.he also testified that in furtherance of the scheme,he helped gillion falsify a certificate of liability so that capital city would appear to be legitimately insured as required by citicapital and that he requested that gillion use cashier checks to submit payments to citicapital and dalcanton to cover up the scheme.dalcanton testified to a letter he wrote to a former citicapital customer,asking them to remit all payments to capital city,and the government produced an written by gillion in which he informed a former citicapital customer that capital city was citicapital sister company.
on june,the jury found gillion guilty of four counts of substantive mail fraud,in violation of,and one count of conspiring to commit mail fraud,in violation of 
gillion filed a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his convictions.the district court denied the motion,explaining that sufficient evidence was presented to the jury to support its guilty verdict.it subsequently sentenced gillion to months imprisonment,three years of probation,and restitution to xtra of.this appeal followed.
the issues before us on appeal are whether the district court erred in admitting the statements gillion made during his proffer session and whether sufficient evidence supported gillion mail fraud convictions.we consider each issue in turn.
we first consider appellant contention that the district court erred in admitting the statements he made pursuant to his proffer agreement.although we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion and will only overturn an evidentiary ruling that is arbitrary and irrational,united states cloud,cir internal quotation and citation omitted,gillion challenge to the district court holding that proffer agreements remain in effect is a question of law which we review de novo,united states lopez,cir.
gillion argues that the government should not have been able to ask him to sit for a polygraph examination pursuant to the terms of the agreement because the agreement terminated upon his indictment.the government replies that proffer agreements are binding contracts construed by their terms,and that gillion agreement allowed the government to request a polygraph at any time.the district court concluded that the agreement was enforceable as a binding contract,allowing the government to request that gillion submit to a polygraph examination or be found in breach.after gillion failed the polygraph examination by walking out of the interview,the district court found that he had breached the agreement and allowed mcclure to testify to the statements obtained during the proffer interview.
a proffer agreement defines the obligations of the parties and is intended to protect the defendant against the use of his or her statements,particularly in those situations in which the defendant has revealed incriminating information and the proffer session does not mature into a plea agreement.lopez,at.we interpret a proffer agreement based on the language it contains.id.at.in sum,a proffer agreement operates like a contract accordingly,we examine its express terms to determine whether the defendant is in breach.see united states liranzo,cir holding that proffer agreements are interpreted like contracts united states chiu,cir same.
gillion argument here is unavailing.nothing in the agreement before us suggests a temporal limitation.rather,it requires gillion to be fully truthful and forthright at any stage.while gillion is correct that basic principles of contract interpretation counsel that we construe any ambiguities against the draftsman,maersk line,united states,cir,there is no such ambiguity here.as the government points out,the agreement contemplates the possibility of a breach and trial in its provisions regarding the consequences of breach,making clear that it does not lapse.appellee br.at.therefore,the district court correctly applied our precedent in reject ing the defendant argument that either the terms of the contract,or constitutional law or criminal law,generally requires that the polygraph must be taken.
even if the district court erred in requiring gillion to adhere to the agreement,admission of the proffered statements was harmless in order to find a district court error harmless,we need only be able to say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.cloud,at internal quotation and citation omitted.a.
gillion submits that the admission of a confession can hardly ever be harmless.appellant reply br.at.while a confession is the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against a defendant,united states johnson,cir quoting arizona fulminante,d,we have found admission of a confession harmless when the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty absent the confession,id.quoting united states jones,cir.in johnson,we found admission of the defendant confession harmless when the government introduced an abundance of other evidence and proved parts of the defendant involvement without any use of his statements.id.at.additionally,t he settled law of this circuit recognizes that the testimony of a defendant accomplices,standing alone and uncorroborated,can provide an adequate basis for conviction.united states burns,cir.
the statements admitted at trial from gillion proffer session involve facts proven by the government in other ways.in particular,dalcanton testified as to all the information mcclure provided and in greater detail,including,for example,the methods he and gillion used to defraud citicapital while employed there.nor was dalcanton testimony uncorroborated rather,the government presented accompanying exhibits,such as the baker lease,the citicapital bill of sale,and the capital city cashier check for the baker trailer purchase,to corroborate dalcanton descriptions of the fraud.testimony from other witnesses also corroborated dalcanton statements.for example,william baker testified to the timing of the baker contract,the fact that gillion offered baker the foot trailers that he liked to purchase on basically the same purchase plan as his citicapital contract,and that gillion would mail him invoices for the contract,which baker would pay by mailing monthly checks to capital city.
further,gillion defense did not deny his involvement in the capital city scheme gillion attorney stated that he and the government basically all agree on the facts even before the district court issued its final ruling as to whether mcclure would testify to the proffered statements because gillion had breached the proffer.instead,gillion argument was primarily legal that the government could not prove citicapital had a property interest in the profits gillion obtained and that gillion did not obtain the profits with material false representations.id.at.indeed,before the court final ruling holding that the proffered statements would come in at trial,gillion attorney offered to co
