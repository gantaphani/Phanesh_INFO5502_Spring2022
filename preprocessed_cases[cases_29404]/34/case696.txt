following a trial,a jury convicted luis and jean carlos cruz of,inter alia,possession of narcotics with intent to distribute and possession of machine furtherance of a scheme.these consolidated appeals require us to decide whether the district court erred in various evidentiary rulings,and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.having carefully reviewed the record,we affirm the convictions of both defendants.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdicts.see united states echeverri,cir.
on october,puerto rico police agent angel aviles parked an unmarked vehicle in front of street in toa alta and began surveillance of an area known within the police department to be a drug point.agent aviles immediately focused his attention on three identified as lugo,cruz,and jose gonzalez feet away from him,outside a bar known as the pub.each man was carrying a firearm on his waistline in addition,cruz had a fanny pack strapped across his chest and appeared ready to receive money from some person.
agent aviles next observed an unidentified man,who was carrying money,approach cruz from an unidentified vehicle that had just arrived on the scene.after encountering cruz,the individual returned to his vehicle and drove away.the substance of this,whether there had been an actual exchange of drugs or not witnessed.
at one point during his surveillance,agent aviles saw gonzalez disappear around the side of the pub when gonzalez reappeared,he and another unidentified individual were carrying a pillowcase that had rifle barrels protruding from it these men then lifted the pillowcase,placed it into a nearby garbage can,and,with the assistance of lugo and cruz,covered it with a blanket and some trash.after witnessing these activities,agent aviles immediately called for backup.
when the reinforcement agents arrived three to four minutes later,backup agent luis sales morales noticed that cruz was carrying a pistol on his waistline.during an ensuing chase,agent sales saw cruz toss his firearm into an overgrown lot.although the handgun was never recovered,cruz was eventually arrested as he tried to scale a fence.at the time of his arrest,cruz was carrying a magazine,cash,and a fanny pack strapped across his chest containing substances that later tested positive for cocaine base,heroin,and cocaine.
meanwhile,backup agent nancy mendez was pursuing gonzalez.when she caught him just outside the pub,gonzalez attempted to draw his weapon.in response,agent mendez grabbed his arm and was dragged inside the pub.there,during her struggle with gonzalez,she observed lugo for the first time he was standing behind the bar with a gun in his hand.agent aviles testified as to how and when lugo had entered the pub i saw mendez who was going to arrest the defendants,and they started running.at that moment,i started running,following her.so she went into the pub after,going after the defendants.
gonzalez eventually surrendered and was taken outside the pub and arrested.once outside,agent mendez told another agent to go inside the pub,arrest lugo,and seize the firearm that she had seen him conceal between a bottle rack and the bar.
lugo was arrested without incident.although no drugs or weapons were found on his person,agents successfully recovered the loaded smith lugo had hidden behind the bar.
the principal suspects having been apprehended,agent aviles next seized the pillowcase from the garbage can.inside the pillowcase were two romanian arms rifles that,as an expert witness later testified,had been converted into machine guns,as well as an arsenal rifle,a pistol,and large amounts of ammunition.the serial numbers on the two machine guns and the pistol had been removed,and all four firearms were loaded.
on november,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging lugo,cruz,and gonzalez with several offenses count one alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly possessed cocaine base with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and count two alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly possessed heroin with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and count three alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and count five alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,possessed a firearm in furtherance of a scheme,in violation of c and count six alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly possessed a firearm shipped or transported in interstate commerce and from which the manufacturer serial number had been obliterated or removed,in violation of k and and count seven alleged that the defendants,aiding and abetting each other,possessed a machine gun,in violation of o and.
on february,a joint trial began,at which cruz and lugo were on february,the jury convicted both defendants on all counts.thereafter,cruz was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of months for counts one,two,and three and months for counts six and seven.lugo was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of months for counts one,two,and three and months for counts six and seven.additionally,because the jury found that each defendant had possessed a machine gun in furtherance of a scheme,both cruz and lugo were sentenced to months of imprisonment for count five,to be served consecutive to their other sentences see c b.
these appeals followed.
we are presented with two issues on appeal whether the district court erred in various evidentiary rulings and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts.
given these separate issues,two standards of review apply.first,we review a district court decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion.see larch mansfield mun,cir see also udemba nicoli,cir a trial court enjoys considerable discretion in connection with the admission or exclusion of evidence.second,in deciding sufficiency challenges,we review all the evidence,direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the prosecution,drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict,and avoiding credibility judgments,to determine whether a rational jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states baltas,cir citations omitted see also united states ruiz,cir noting that we review de novo the defendants challenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of their convictions,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.
evidentiary rulings 
lugo contends that the district court improperly admitted unduly prejudicial testimony concerning the presence of a drug point on street near the pub,and various untagged weapons with obliterated serial numbers,specifically the two machine guns.we find no abuse of discretion.
the testimony 
despite objection,agent aviles was allowed to testify at trial as follows 
q now,the young man to this side of the table cruz,can you please tell us what,if anything,was he doing,aside from the fact that he had a weapon in his waist 
a cruz was standing there.he had like a brown bag,and he was ready to receive money from some person.i have knowledge that that is the drug point of that sector.
q excuse me.before you go into anything else 
court let him finish.
a personally myself i arrested several people at that location for violation of weapons and drug laws.
lugo argues that this testimony should have been excluded because agent aviles assertions regarding the drug point were unsupported by statistics,personal knowledge,or they were unduly prejudicial.as best we can tell lugo is challenging the testimony on two separate bases a lack of foundation,in violation of.and b unfair prejudice,in violation of.neither is convincing 
first,contrary to lugo assertion,the government did,in fact,present evidence sufficient to support a finding that agent aviles had the requisite personal knowledge of the area history.see.a witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.evidence to prove personal knowledge may,but need not,consist of the witness own testimony.specifically,agent aviles testified that he had been a member of the drugs and narcotics division of the puerto rico police department for approximately six years,that he had been involved with approximately or investigations involving drug points,that he knew of other agents who had made drug arrests outside the pub,and that he himself had previously arrested an individual on drug charges outside the pub in addition,three other agents provided corroborating testimony that the area in front of the pub was known within the police department to be a drug point.given the testimony of these four witnesses,the district court acted well within its discretion in determining that there was an adequate foundation for agent aviles testimony.
we next consider whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that the testimony was not unduly prejudicial.see.although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice emphasis added see also united states pitrone,cir virtually all evidence is the truth be told,that is almost always why the proponent seeks to introduce it is only unfair prejudice against which the law protects.emphasis retained.according to lugo,this testimony allowed the jury to infer impermissibly that,because lugo was arrested at a point,he must have been involved in the drug trade there.
only in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.freeman package machinery,cir.this is not such a circumstance.here,the testimony was probative not only to explain agent aviles presence at the scene but also to corroborate the inference that cruz and lugo were involved in a scheme that would be independently suggested by other evidence.so understood,the district court could have concluded that the prejudice caused by such testimony was not unfair it was,instead,merely the negative result of the testimony probative value.
the machine guns 
lugo next argues that the two machine guns were not properly authenticated,see.a,and thus should not have been admitted into evidence.we disagree 
federal rule of evidence a requires the trial court to determine if there is a reasonable probability that the evidence is what it is purported to be.united states neal,cir see also united states twitty,cir all that was required for admission was evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the guns were the same.
here,two agents were called to authenticate the machine guns.first,agent aviles testified to the following chronology immediately following the arrests,he himself seized the pillowcase from the garbage can the pillowcase contents,including two romanian arms rifles,were then taken to police headquarters agent aviles next phoned agent rios from the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms and requested that rios travel to headquarters to take possession of the weapons and the weapons remained in his custody until agent rios arrived.second,agent rios testified that,upon arriving at police headquarters on october,he prepared a property receipt describing the contents of the pillowcase,which both he and aviles signed that he thereafter took possession of the weapons that,two days later,on october,he prepared a form,on which the seized weapons were listed and that the weapons remained in his custody from october through october.both men testified that the weapons sought to be introduced at trial were,in fact,the weapons that earlier had been in their respective custodies.we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to lead a reasonable jury to the same conclusion accordingly,the admission of this evidence was not erroneous.
sufficiency of the evidence 
lugo,but not cruz,challenges the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his convictions.see a criminalizing possession of narcotics with intent to distribute see also whoever commits an offense against the united states or who aids or abets its commission is punishable as a principal.additionally,both lugo and cruz argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their respective convictions for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a scheme.see c a providing minimum sentences for such conduct see also id.c b mandating an enhanced sentence if the firearm possessed by the individual in violation of c a was a machine gun.we affirm the convictions.
lugo convictions under a 
lugo contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings that he aided and abetted the possession of cocaine base,heroin,and cocaine.accordingly,he asks us to set aside his convictions on counts one,two,and three of the indictment.
one who aids and abets a crime is punishable as a principal.see see also nye nissen united states.accordingly,we must affirm lugo conviction if a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt both that the principal here,cruz knowingly possessed and intended to distribute drugs,and that lugo consciously shared that criminal design,associated himself with it,and actively sought to ensure its success.united states arias,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also united states campa,cir the elements that the government was required to prove to show that appellant aided and abetted the possession of narcotics were that appellant associated himself with the venture,that he participated in it as something he wished to bring about,and that he sought by his action to make it succeed.citations and quotation marks omitted.we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to prove all elements.
first,there was ample evidence to support a finding that cruz had possessed controlled substances with the intent to distribute.agent aviles testified that,while conducting surveillance of a known drug area,he had observed an unidentified,individual approach a man later identified as cruz who had a fanny pack strapped across his chest and who appeared ready to receive money.these observations were,agent sales arrested cruz and found drugs,together with a substantial amount of cash,in a fanny pack on cruz person.
lugo argues that,even if the evidence was sufficient to determine that cruz possessed controlled substances with the intent to distribute,the evidence was entirely insufficient to enable the conclusion that lugo aided and abetted in that venture.specifically,he notes that t he prosecution simply failed to overcome the presumption of innocence and produce evidence that he was more than merely present in connection with any offense.we are not persuaded.
while mere presence at the scene of the crime or mere association with conspirators is not enough to establish guilt,see united states,cir,the mere presence defense is not so ubiquitous as to envelop every case in which the government lacks direct evidence of a defendant complicity.echeverri,at.see also united states,cir mere presence at the scene and close association with those involved are insufficient factors alone nevertheless,they are relevant factors for the jury.quoting united states sanchez,cir emphasis in original.as we repeatedly have recognized,a jury is free to rely on its common sense and may infer that criminal conspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal.united states dimarzo,cir citations omitted.s uch is not normally the conduct that one would expect of conspirators engaged in conduct which by its nature is kept secret from outsiders.united states smith,cir.
here,of course,lugo was more than merely present the evidence suggests that he was present for the important purpose of protecting the money and the drugs.see echeverri,at a defendant mere presence argument will fail in situations where the mere is lacking.see also united states lema,cir p resence on a single occasion may support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding circumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant must have been a knowing participant.citations omitted and emphasis added.for example,two separate officers testified that lugo
