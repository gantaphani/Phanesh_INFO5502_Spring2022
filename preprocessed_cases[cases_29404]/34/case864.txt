federal agents arrived at a small building in new york city one morning in january with a warrant to search the apartment.the warrant did not mention the name of the person who lived there and only authorized them to search that single apartment.but on the morning of the search the agents discovered that the suspect they were investigating lived on the second floor,not the first.he also happened to be home.so they decided to search his apartment instead.
the officials could have called a magistrate judge and obtained a new warrant to search the apartment.the evidence was going anywhere,and neither was their suspect.but the officials took a shortcut.they searched the second floor without first obtaining a warrant from a judge.
the officials in this case did not stray far from their search warrant.they merely ventured up a flight of stairs.but the fourth amendment does not permit the police to search one apartment simply because they have a warrant to search another that is nearby.
we hold that these agents conducted a warrantless search of a person home in violation of the fourth amendment.in addition,we conclude that the evidence seized as a result of this unconstitutional search should have been suppressed because the officials in this case knowingly stepped beyond the bounds of the search that the magistrate judge had authorized them to conduct.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of voustianiouk motion to suppress the evidence,vacate his conviction and sentence,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in,an american official with immigration and customs enforcement obtained a report from the german federal police indicating that someone who had accessed a network using a particular internet protocol ip address,which is a short string of numbers that can be used to identify individual computers,had a file on their computer containing child pornography.
american law enforcement officials traced the ip address to an internet service provider,and filed a subpoena with the service provider parent company requesting the name and address of the customer whose account was associated with the ip address under investigation.according to the internet service provider,the ip address was assigned to andrei voustianiouk,at cambreleng avenue,apartment,bronx,new york.
prior to applying for a search warrant,robert raab,a federal agent involved with the investigation,visited the building at cambreleng avenue and visually observ ed its exterior.raab attempted to confirm the accuracy of voustianiouk address by checking with the united states postal service,as well as with a database maintained by new york state that contained the names and addresses of people who had registered for driver licenses.both sources of information confirmed that voustianiouk lived at cambreleng avenue.but neither the postal service nor the new york state database indicated which apartment was voustianiouk.
raab eventually obtained a search warrant authorizing agents to search the premises known and described as cambreleng avenue apt,bronx,new york.capitalization altered.in an affidavit submitted to the magistrate judge in support of the search warrant,raab identified the place to be searched as a ground floor apartment inside a white shingled house.raab affidavit indicated that b ased in part on information obtained through a summons directed to the internet service provider for the ip address under investigation,he learned the subscriber was an individual at cambreleng avenue,apt,bronx,new york.
neither the search warrant nor any of the accompanying information which comprised a total of pages mentions voustianiouk name.in fact,the government intentionally withheld voustianiouk name from the magistrate judge who approved the search warrant.when asked by the district court below why voustianiouk name was not mentioned in the warrant or its accompanying materials,an assistant united states attorney prosecuting the case explained there are cases,your honor,where there are multiple people in a home and one person may be the person whose information is on the subscription for the internet address,so it does always make sense to name that person because going in you do know if that necessarily the person that you are going after 
thus,there is no indication that the magistrate judge who issued the search warrant was aware that the government even considered voustianiouk a suspect,or knew what evidence the government had to support its suspicions.
just over a week after obtaining a search warrant,raab and other agents arrived at cambreleng avenue on the morning of january.as raab later explained,they rang both of the buzzers because neither were marked with an apartment number.after the officials rang the doorbells,they saw a light turn on from the second floor window and then a man came to the front door of the building.raab affirmation.the man was asked whether he was andrei voustianiouk,and he confirmed that he was.
raab also immediately recognized voustianiouk from a photograph that raab had seen on the internet.voustianiouk worked as a medical researcher at the new york university medical center,and raab had found a picture of the staff from what he believe d was the nyu medical center website.
at that point,raab and the other officials showed the defendant that they had a search warrant and needed to enter his apartment.voustianiouk then led them up the stairs and into his apartment on the second floor.
there is no indication that the officials explained that the search warrant in their possession did not mention voustianiouk name or that the warrant clearly made reference to the downstairs apartment,not the one that he was leading them to on the second floor.
upon searching the apartment,officials discovered thousands of files containing child pornography on computers and hard drives.voustianiouk apparently had been downloading child pornography from the internet for some time.he eventually admitted to viewing child pornography for over one year at the time agents searched his home.voustianiouk was charged with receipt and possession of child pornography in violation of federal law,and was found guilty after a bench trial before judge robert patterson,of the southern district of new york.
in september,judge patterson sentenced voustianiouk to a term in prison,which was the mandatory minimum sentence that had been set by congress for the criminal conduct at issue.voustianiouk is currently serving that sentence and is scheduled to be released from prison in march.see inmate locator,federal bureau of prisons,http indicating that voustianiouk release date is march.
on appeal,voustianiouk argues that the search of his apartment violated the fourth amendment of the constitution and that the government should have been prohibited from introducing the evidence that was seized as a result of that search at the trial against him.we agree.
discussion 
the standard of review for evaluating the district court ruling on a suppression motion is clear error as to the district court factual findings,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and de novo as to questions of law.united states rodriguez,cir.
the fourth amendment of the constitution states the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.
the fourth amendment requirements regarding search warrants are not formalities.mcdonald united states.by requiring police officers first to obtain a warrant before they search a person home,unless some exception applies that permits a warrantless search,the fourth amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police,not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities,but rather to ensure that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law.id.
indeed,the fourth amendment demand that search warrants particularly describ e the place to be searched,const.amend.iv,provides a limitation curtailing the officers discretion when executing the warrant,so that the safeguard of having a magistrate determine the scope of the search is not lost.united states george,cir maryland garrison,d noting that the fourth amendment particularity requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications,and will not take on the character of the exploratory searches the framers intended to prohibit.it is that i t is enough if the description is such that the officer with a search warrant can,with reasonable effort ascertain and identify the place intended.steele united states.
in determining the permissible scope of a search that has been authorized by a search warrant,however,we must look to the place that the magistrate judge who issued the warrant intended to be searched,not to the place that the police intended to search when they applied for the warrant.see groh ramirez,d the mere fact that the magistrate issued a warrant does not necessarily establish that he agreed that the scope of the search should be as broad as the affiant request.ybarra illinois,d had the issuing judge intended that the warrant would or could authorize a search of every person found within the tavern,he would hardly have specifically authorized the search of greg alone.wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment ed.one of the specific commands of the fourth amendment is that no warrants shall issue except those particularly describing the place to be searched.quite obviously,the primary purpose of this limitation is to minimize the risk that officers executing search warrants will by mistake search a place other than the place intended by the magistrate.emphasis added.
we conclude that these agents searched an apartment other than the one that the magistrate intended to authorize them to search.indeed,we have no reason to believe that the magistrate judge who signed the warrant at issue intended for the scope of the search to cover any apartment in the building other than the one on the first floor.the search warrant and accompanying affidavit explicitly authorize the search of the apartment and make no mention of the apartment or even of voustianiouk name.the government concedes as much on appeal,acknowledging that agent raab did not disclose voustianiouk name to the judge who issued the warrant.indeed,the affidavit submitted by raab in support of his application for a search warrant would not have provided probable cause to search voustianiouk apartment on the second floor,because the information in the affidavit,by omitting any mention of voustianiouk,does not provide any basis for concluding that he may have been involved in a crime.
we note that when officers search a location other than the one that the magistrate judge intended to be searched,as was the case here,there is no need to inquire into whether the warrant description was sufficiently particular to satisfy the fourth amendment in order to determine if the search violated the constitution,because the search was conducted without the authorization of a warrant such a warrantless search,absent some exception,violates the fourth amendment not because the description in the warrant was insufficient or inaccurate,but rather because the agents executing the search exceeded the authority that they had been granted by the magistrate judge.see horton california,d if the scope of a search exceeds that permitted by the terms of a validly issued warrant or the character of the relevant exception from the warrant requirement,the subsequent seizure is unconstitutional without more.
accordingly,we need not and do not address whether a warrant that authorizes the search of a particular person apartment,but mistakenly lists an incorrect apartment number,would satisfy the particularity requirement of the fourth amendment.we note only that if voustianiouk had not been home or had not answered the building front door on the morning of the search,the agents might very well have entered and searched the apartment,which we have no reason to believe was anything other than an innocent person home.courts of appeals have rejected fourth amendment challenges to warrants that contain partial misdescriptions of the place to be searched so long as the officer executing the warrant could ascertain and identify the target of the search with no reasonable probability of searching another premises in error.velardi walsh,cir quoting united states valentine,cir see also united states bonner,cir the test for determining the adequacy of the description of the location to be searched is whether the description is sufficient to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort,and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premise might be mistakenly searched.quoting united states turner,cir.
the government correctly argues on appeal that inaccuracies or ambiguities in a warrant do not necessarily render a warrant invalid under the fourth amendment.see united states williams,cir summary order t he officers who executed the warrant were familiar with the apartment because they had purchased drugs there through a confidential informant shortly before the warrant was executed.they had surveilled the informant entering that apartment through the brown side entrance door specified in the warrant.accordingly,there was no risk that the executing officers would use any other door or mistakenly enter the wrong apartment.united states campanile,cir noting that while one of the appellants,a t oral argument,made much of the statement in the warrant that it was for the only basement apartment at the address at issue,although the evidence at trial indicated that there may have been two basement apartments,the police searched only the apartment lived in by the defendant brother,which was the one described in the affidavit that supported the warrant valentine,at upholding the validity of a search warrant where o fficers obtained the warrant after surveillance,over the course of several days,of a particular unnumbered building,and t he warrant accurately described the target building,even though the warrant inaccurately identified the building number united states gordon,cir noting that the government agent searched only the location intended to be searched the residence he had seen with the undercover officer,and concluding that b ecause the agent was both the affiant and the executing officer and had recently viewed the location in question,there was no possibility the wrong premises would be searched.internal quotation marks omitted.but the warrant at issue here did not inaccurately or incompletely describe the place that the magistrate judge had authorized the agents to search.if anything,the warrant was quite clear and specific.raab believed that the ip address linked to child pornography was associated with a computer located in the apartment on the ground floor of the building,and he secured a warrant to search that particular apartment.
the government essentially admitted to purposefully omitting voustianiouk name from the search warrant and accompanying affidavit because the government did not want to foreclose the possibility that it could search the apartment even if it turned out that voustianiouk did not in fact live there.agents had obtained information from an internet service provider that suggested that a computer located in that apartment contained child pornography.and for all they knew,voustianiouk might have been a landlord who paid the internet bill on behalf of a tenant.
indeed,if the officers had discovered on the morning of the search that voustianiouk formerly lived in the apartment but had moved out a few years ago,and that the current resident in that apartment had simply continued to pay for internet service but had neglected to change the account holder name,the officers would still have had every reason to search the apartment,and would have had a valid warrant to do so,notwithstand
