jason korey appeals from his conviction on one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.he argues that the jury instructions concerning conspiracy violated his right to due process because they contained an impermissible mandatory presumption,that his sixth amendment right to be present at his trial was violated when the judge and the prosecutor had an ex parte meeting about an improper comment the prosecutor made in the courtroom,that his right to a fair trial was violated both by the prosecutor apology for foul language that bolstered the prosecutor reputation and by improper statements during closing argument,and that the district court erred in excluding evidence that korey had been acquitted in an earlier murder trial that had been mentioned by a potential juror during jury selection.for the reasons stated below,we agree that the jury instructions contained an impermissible mandatory presumption that was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.consequently,we will vacate korey conviction.
for a number of years in the late,billy kuhn and ray erfort worked together as cocaine and crack dealers in the south hills of pittsburgh.jason korey knew both men,and was aware that they were drug dealers.
when erfort was arrested in,he attempted to prevent the police from finding his drug stash by asking kuhn to collect it.kuhn gathered ounces of cocaine with a street value of.after his release from jail,erfort asked kuhn to return the cocaine,but kuhn refused.
according to the government,erfort later approached korey,who was seventeen years old at the time,and offered him cocaine in exchange for killing kuhn.korey,in turn,obtained a caliber handgun with a silencer from a friend,ostensibly to use in the murder.according to the government,he then either murdered kuhn himself on the morning of july,or had his friend dave clemons murder kuhn for him on that date.however,after police discovered the body,they charged ray erfort and milton morgan with kuhn murder.
on october,the police,who had an outstanding warrant for korey arrest based on other circumstances,received an anonymous telephone tip concerning his whereabouts.they arrested him based on the outstanding warrant.at the time of his arrest,korey had illegal drugs and other contraband on his person,and the arresting officers prepared charges against him based on this contraband.
later that day,korey,while still in police custody,devised a deal to keep himself out of jail for possession of the contraband he offered to provide information about kuhn murder if they would agree to keep him out of jail on the present charges.after agreeing to this deal in writing,korey told the officers that erfort had paid him cocaine to kill kuhn,and that he had turned to clemons to carry out the murder for him.he also told the police where he and clemons had hidden the murder weapon.the police recovered the murder weapon from the location korey described.
following this confession,the murder charges against erfort and morgan were dropped,and korey was charged.however,he was acquitted of the murder charge after a state court trial on november.
several years later,korey was indicted on federal firearms charges stemming from the incident.he pleaded guilty to possessing a silencer and possession of a firearm by a drug user or addict.as to the remaining charges,he was acquitted of one count of possessing a stolen firearm,and convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.it was during the trial for these charges that the alleged errors korey complains of occurred.
before the trial began,the government filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence that korey had been acquitted of kuhn murder in state court.the district court heard argument on the issue,but reserved judgment.later,after the jury venire was sworn,the group of prospective jurors were asked whether they knew jason korey.one of the prospective jurors responded in the presence of other jurors that he knew a jason korey who was allegedly involved in a murder.this same juror expressed reluctance to serve on the jury because of his prior experience with korey,and because he was aware of some previous allegations.although this prospective juror was dismissed for cause,defense counsel argued that the jury panel should be dismissed.the district court denied this request and also determined,over korey objection,that it would not admit evidence of korey state court acquittal.
during the trial,one of the government police witnesses had trouble recalling events surrounding his search for a stolen weapon.when the witness was excused to review his reports in the hallway,defense counsel requested to see what he was reviewing.after the district court indicated that defense counsel would be able to review a copy for cross examination,the prosecutor responded with inappropriate language in the jury presence.the district judge demanded to see the prosecutor in his chambers.when the attorney for the government emerged,he recited the following apology in front of the jury on the district court request 
your honor,before i begin with the testimony of this witness,i have some remarks for you,for hackney,and for the jury.
i have been an a ssistant a ttorney in this district since,and i have appeared in front of you as well as other judges in this court,and you should know that even though this is how i make my living,it is more than a living to me,and it is something that important to me,and i take pride in what i do and who i do it for and in the way i do it.
i try to try these cases to the best of my ability,not only for the convenience of the jury,but with respect for the court,with respect to the parties,and with respect to the witnesses and anybody else who might be involved in the system.
that broke down today.i expressed frustration because of something that was happening here.i want the court to know that i was not expressing irritation at you as the judge,at hackney as opposing have been friends for many as a measure of disrespect towards this court or for this jury.
it was inexcusable,but it was borne in a moment of frustration in the interruption of the trial,which is something that i would liked to have gone more smoothly for the benefit of all concerned.
you have known me for many years,i have been in and out of the courtroom.i hope you understand that this was not a picture of me at my best,but it was just a moment of frustration.i am sincerely sorry for it.
if anyone was offended by it,i want you to know now that i would not have done it otherwise,and i extremely sorry.
the following morning,defense counsel objected to this speech and asked for a mistrial,but was overruled by the district court.
as the trial progressed,it became increasingly clear that the two sides had different views about what constituted a drug distribution conspiracy.the government theory was that a jury could find that korey was guilty of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug conspiracy because he agreed to commit a murder in exchange for cocaine,and in order to avenge a drug,korey used the caliber handgun either by shooting billy kuhn or by giving it to clemons to do so.defense counsel,on the other hand,maintained that agreeing to provide a an unlawful exchange for cocaine constituted a relationship and not a drug distribution conspiracy.
on the final day of the trial,counsel met with the district judge to discuss the jury instructions.over objections by the defense,the district court determined that it would instruct the jury that korey was,as a matter of law,a member of a drug distribution conspiracy if he either agreed to accept cocaine in payment for killing billy kuhn,or agreed to murder billy kuhn for ray erfort in order to avenge kuhn theft of erfort cocaine.
after the jury deliberated,korey was acquitted of possessing a stolen firearm and convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug distribution conspiracy.he now appeals,asking this court to order a new trial based on four errors improper jury instructions,a violation of his right to be present at an ex parte meeting between the prosecutor and the judge,the prosecutor prejudicial comments in his apology and during closing argument,and the district court improper exclusion of evidence of his acquittal in the state court trial for billy kuhn murder.
korey first complaint is that the jury instructions used in his trial were erroneous.specifically,he argues that the instructions concerning the count for using a firearm during and in relation to a drug conspiracy contained an erroneous conclusive presumption.that presumption,he contends,relieved the government of its duty to prove all essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.we exercise plenary review over challenges to the legal standards expressed in jury instructions.see,united states zehrbach,cir.
due process requires that the government prove every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.in re winship,d.accordingly,jury instructions that relieve the government of this burden violate a defendant due process rights.carella california,d.the inquiry is whether the court instruction constituted a mandatory presumption by directly foreclos ing independent jury consideration of whether the facts proved established certain elements of the offense with which the defendant was charged.id.at.
in this case,korey was charged with violating c a,which punishes any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm.the drug trafficking crime charged by the government in relation to here is conspiracy to distribute cocaine under and a.
it is clear from our prior cases that an important element of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine is that the parties shared a common goal.in united states cartwright,cir,for example,we considered a convicted criminal defendant claim that the guilty verdict against him for conspiracy to distribute cocaine was not supported by sufficient evidence.describing what the evidence must prove,we explained that o ne of the requisite elements the government must show in a conspiracy case is that the alleged conspirators shared a unity of purpose,the intent to achieve a common goal,and an agreement to work together toward the goal.id.at quoting united states wexler,cir see also united states gibbs,cir to prove a conspiracy,the government must establish a unity of purpose between the alleged conspirators,an intent to achieve a common goal,and an agreement to work together toward that goal.in other words,because the conspiracy charged here is a conspiracy to distribute cocaine,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that korey shared a goal with his to further the purpose of distributing cocaine.
the jury instructions,however,did not require the jury to find a unity of purpose.rather,the district court instructed jurors that 
the government in this case alleges that korey committed the crime of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and did so in two separate ways.
first,when he agreed to accept drugs from ray erfort as payment for the murder of billy kuhn.i instruct you that if you find that the defendant agreed to accept cocaine in payment for killing billy kuhn,that is a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
and,second,the government alleges that korey agreed to murder billy kuhn for ray erfort in order to avenge kuhn theft of erfort cocaine.i instruct you that if you find that defendant agreed to murder billy kuhn for ray erfort in order to avenge kuhn theft of erfort cocaine,that is also conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
under these instructions,all the jurors had to find was that korey agreed to accept cocaine in payment for killing kuhn.they did not have to consider whether the government met its burden of proof in establishing a unity of purpose.their verdict on the conspiracy charge was to be the same whether or not they believed the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that korey and erfort shared a common goal to distribute cocaine.this is certainly at odds with the definition of conspiracy we expressed in cartwright.at.
defending the instructions,the government argues that the statements at issue do not constitute error because other parts of the instructions discussed the complete definition of a conspiracy.indeed,the instructions did provide a general definition of conspiracy,including an explanation that t here must be intentional participation by the defendant in the specific conspiracy charged,with a view to furthering the common design and purpose of the conspiracy.however,this complete and correct statement of the law does not overcome the language that followed,which amounted to an improper mandatory presumption.even if jurors took to heart the general definition of a conspiracy,they were instructed that if they found that the defendant agreed to accept cocaine in payment for killing billy kuhn,that is a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.regardless of what the district court may have advised elsewhere,this statement directly foreclosed independent jury consideration of whether the facts proved established certain elements of the offense with which the defendant was charged.carella,at.although the jury was told that a conspiracy required a shared purpose,it was also told that korey actions amounted to participation in a conspiracy whether or not they believed that he shared the goal of furthering erfort cocaine distribution operation.if the jurors believed that he agreed to accept cocaine in exchange for killing kuhn,that was the end of their inquiry.
the government also contends that the instructions were not faulty because by agreeing to accept cocaine as payment for murdering kuhn,korey was serving an enforcement role in the conspiracy to distribute cocaine.as an initial matter,there is an important difference between considerations of the sufficiency of evidence and the propriety of jury instructions.even if there was ample evidence that korey shared a common goal to advance erfort scheme to distribute cocaine,the jury instructions must not command the jury in a manner that forecloses their consideration of that element of the crime.carella,at.
but assuming the government is arguing not about the sufficiency of evidence,but that the jury instructions were correct as a matter of law because the mandatory presumption was proper,the law on point simply does not comport with the government argument.although we have recognized that an enforcement role is part of a conspiracy to distribute drugs,we have always rested on a showing that the enforcer shared the goal of the overarching conspiracy.in united states gonzalez,cir,for example,we considered,in the context of a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting a conviction,whether a defendant was part of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine based on serving as the muscle for the operation.as we explained 
considering the placement of the defendant gun,the fact that he was in the kitchen with the at the time of the arrest and his act of blocking the detective way out of the apartment,it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the defendant was the muscle of the group and he was there to protect the money and the cocaine.in addition,the defendant was present the night before the transaction when the tried to store the cocaine at another apartment,and one of the coconspirators invited him to be present at the apartment again the next day while the transaction was taking place in the back bedroom.
id.at.in other words,based on the circumstances,a jury could have inferred that the defendant shared the goal of making sure cocaine was distributed.the defendant specific role was to provide the muscle to protect the transactions,but his overarching goal was clearly the same as other members of the conspiracy distribution of cocaine.
the government also attempts to rely on the fifth circuit case of united states baptiste,cir.it claims that baptiste is analogous to the case before us because the court found a conspiracy based on the fact that many of the appellants responded to the murders of their friends with killing sprees against the rival group of drug dealers.id.at.
however,in reviewing a defendant conviction to determine wh
