opinion of the court 
in this appeal we consider whether a vehicle stop based on information provided by a witness who called to report a shooting violated terry ohio.as we shall explain,the vehicle stop was supported by reasonable suspicion that at least one of its occupants was involved in the shooting.in addition,the police officers conduct in effectuating the stop was reasonable under the circumstances.accordingly,the district court did not err when it denied appellant anthony johnson motion to suppress evidence.
a hard rain was falling in harrisburg,pennsylvania on the night of january,when tammy anderson noticed a taxicab pull into a parking lot across the street from her house and park next to a van.though visibility was poor,anderson was able to observe what appeared to be two men emerge from the vehicles and begin to fight.watching this altercation develop from the doorway of her home,anderson heard at least one gunshot ring out.
upon hearing the gunshot,anderson called and told the police dispatcher i heard a gunshot.i seen sic two people wrestling on the ground and i do see them now.and there was a gunshot.i standing here on sic my front door.when prompted by the dispatcher,anderson provided her full name,her telephone number,and described the location of the parking lot.although anderson was unable to describe in any detail the individuals involved in the altercation,she said the taxi appeared to be with tan had a green light on its roof.while she was still on the phone,anderson told the dispatcher that the taxi was departing from the parking lot and heading southbound on seventh street.the van,anderson noted,remained in the lot and appeared to be unattended.
the information anderson provided was dispatched to harrisburg police officers on patrol that evening.officer john doll responded to the parking lot and confirmed that a van was parked in the lot.doll arrived so quickly that anderson,who was still on the phone,told the dispatcher that she saw a police car drive by.at about the same time,another officer reported that he had spotted a taxicab matching the description provided by anderson heading southbound on seventh street approximately ten blocks away.after determining that no one remained with the van,officer doll proceeded southbound on seventh street in search of the taxicab.
doll quickly tracked down the taxi,though he did not stop the vehicle immediately.concerned that its occupants might be armed,doll and other officers followed the taxi for several blocks to allow backup to join the pursuit.when the taxi turned onto aberdeen street,a narrow alleyway approximately two miles from the reported altercation,the officers initiated a traffic stop.the purpose of this stop,doll testified at the suppression hearing,was to investigate the shots fired call and to ensure that no one in the taxicab was either armed or injured.positioning their vehicles to block the exit to the alleyway,numerous officers surrounded the taxicab.because the information relayed by the dispatcher indicated that the occupants of the taxi may have been involved in the reported shooting incident,the officers approached the taxicab slowly,with guns drawn,while shouting for the occupants to exit the vehicle.according to doll,such a response was general practice in such circumstances in case somebody comes out of the vehicle with a gun ready to shoot.
the police proceeded to clear and secure the vehicle.riding in the backseat of the taxi with his young son was the appellant,anthony johnson.after removing both johnson and the taxi driver,kenneth cobb,the officers handcuffed both men,though neither was formally arrested at that time.rather,officer doll testified at the suppression hearing that the police handcuffed the men so the officers could safely clear the vehicle and gather information about the shooting reported by anderson.surprised to discover johnson son in the taxicab,the officers also removed him and placed him to the side.
after johnson and cobb were detained,another responding officer,richard gibney,approached the car.though it was raining hard,the location was and the taxicab interior dome light was on,illuminating the vehicle passenger compartment.looking through a back window,officer gibney observed the butt of a taurus special revolver protruding from an unzipped duffel bag on the taxicab rear seat,where johnson had been sitting.after consulting with officer doll,officer gibney retrieved the weapon from the taxi and unloaded it,finding two spent shell casings inside.
officer doll then placed johnson,a convicted felon,under arrest for possession of the gun and suspected involvement in the shooting and altercation reported by anderson.after reading johnson his miranda rights,doll began questioning him about the firearm and the shooting.johnson declined to respond.a search of johnson incident to his arrest revealed that he carried on his person marijuana,cocaine,and related drug paraphernalia.
johnson was transported to the police station for booking,where he again encountered officer doll,who had traveled to the station separately.although doll did not attempt to question johnson at the police station,johnson began speaking to doll during the booking process,admitting ownership of the revolver and duffel bag but denying responsibility for the shooting reported by anderson.johnson also attempted to persuade doll to forego charging him with any drug offenses.
a grand jury indicted johnson on a single count of illegal possession of a firearm by a person with three prior felony convictions in violation of g and e.after johnson pleaded not guilty,the government filed a superseding indictment,adding a single count of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine in violation of a.johnson then filed the motion to suppress at issue in this appeal,contending that the firearm,drugs,and any inculpatory statements made to doll should be suppressed because the initial stop of the taxicab violated the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.after the district court denied his motion,johnson conditionally pleaded guilty to violating g and e,reserving his right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress.the district court sentenced johnson to months incarceration and imposed a fine of,together with four years of supervised release.
johnson now appeals the district court denial of his motion to suppress.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,johnson claims the initial stop of the taxi was unconstitutional for two independent reasons.first,he argues that the stop of the taxi amounted to a de facto arrest which required probable cause that the information provided by anderson could not provide.alternatively,johnson argues that the stop of the taxicab was not supported by reasonable suspicion because the information provided by anderson was insufficiently detailed,particularized,and reliable.examining the district court factual findings for clear error,united states bonner,f d,cir,and exercising de novo review over the district court legal determination that the seizure at issue here did not violate the fourth amendment,united states myers,cir citing ornelas united states,we address johnson arguments in turn.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures const.amend.iv.a traffic stop of a motor vehicle is a seizure of the vehicle occupants for the purposes of the fourth amendment.delaware prouse,united states mosley,cir.ordinarily,for a seizure to be reasonable under the fourth amendment,it must be effectuated with a warrant based on probable cause.united states robertson,cir.under the exception to the warrant requirement set forth in terry ohio,however,an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow,see also prouse,at stop of vehicle must be based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.evidence obtained as the result of a terry stop that does not meet this exception must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.united states brown,cir citing wong sun united states.
johnson first contends that the evidence recovered from the taxicab and his statements to the police must be suppressed because the initial stop of the vehicle was not supported by probable cause though johnson acknowledges that police officers ordinarily may stop a vehicle based on reasonable suspicion alone,see prouse,at united states johnson,cir,he argues that probable cause was required here because the manner in which the stop was conducted transformed the encounter into a formal arrest.specifically,johnson notes that the police encircled the taxicab,drew their weapons,yelled at the occupants,and later handcuffed johnson and cobb without first questioning them or checking their identification.
in certain circumstances,it can be difficult to distinguish between a terry stop,which requires only reasonable suspicion,and a de facto arrest,which must be supported by probable cause.see,united states sharpe,observing that case law may in some instances create difficult problems in distinguishing an investigative stop from a de facto arrest.we do not find johnson appeal to present such a case,however.we have recognized that the vast majority of courts have held that police actions in blocking a suspect vehicle and approaching with weapons ready,and even drawn,does not constitute an arrest per se.united states edwards,cir collecting cases.nor does placing a suspect in handcuffs while securing a location or conducting an investigation automatically transform an terry stop into a arrest.baker monroe,cir there is no per se rule that pointing guns at people,or handcuffing them,constitutes an arrest.torres united states,cir i n certain circumstances officers lawfully may handcuff the occupants of the premises while executing a search warrant.
we likewise find unpersuasive johnson argument that the stop constituted a de facto arrest because the police did not question the taxi occupants or check their identification before ordering them from the vehicle and handcuffing them.in terry,the supreme court recognized that it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.at.accordingly,the supreme court noted 
when an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,it would be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.
id.at.here,the harrisburg police,acting on a credible tip that at least one of the taxi occupants was armed and dangerous,took reasonable steps to ensure that the scene was secure before investigating further.see part,infra.that the police did not first engage the taxi occupants in conversation or check their driver licenses did not transform the stop into a de facto arrest.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that nothing about the conduct of the harrisburg police in this case rises to the level that we have previously required to constitute a de facto arrest under the fourth amendment.accordingly,we decline johnson invitation to subject the stop of the taxicab to the probable cause standard.instead,we will evaluate whether the harrisburg police had reasonable suspicion to stop the taxi and question its occupants regarding the shooting reported by anderson.see prouse,at johnson,at.
having ascertained the appropriate legal standard,we now consider the primary issue presented in johnson appeal whether the district court erred when it held that the terry stop of the taxicab was supported by reasonable suspicion.terry,at see also united states,cir reaffirming that the terry reasonable suspicion standard applies to routine traffic stops.johnson argues that it was not,contending that anderson call provided the harrisburg police with insufficient information to justify an investigative stop.when assessing whether the vehicle stop was supported by reasonable suspicion,we must consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the detaining officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.united states brown,cir quoting united states cortez.in assessing whether the officers suspicions regarding the taxicab and its occupants were based on sufficiently reliable facts,the knowledge of the dispatcher to whom anderson made her report is imputed to the officers in the field.united states torres,cir.
here,the stop of the taxi and the seizure of its occupants were based almost exclusively on the information anderson provided to the police.when a terry stop is based on a tip provided by an informant,we must scrutinize the informant veracity,reliability,and basis of knowledge to determine whether the information relied upon by the police was sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion for the stop.id.quoting alabama white,internal quotation marks omitted.several factors inform our assessment of the reliability of an informant tip,including whether 
the information was provided to the police in a interaction,allowing an officer to assess directly the informant credibility 
the informant can be held responsible if her allegations are untrue 
the information would not be available to the ordinary observer 
the informant has recently witnessed the criminal activity at issue and 
the witness information accurately predicts future activity.
see id.at citing brown,at.though these factors all are relevant to our analysis,no single factor is dispositive or even necessary to render an informant tip reliable.id.at a tip need not bear all of the even any particular supply reasonable suspicion.thus,we must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether anderson call had sufficient indicia of reliability for us to conclude that the officers possessed an objectively reasonable suspicion to justify the stop of the cab.cortez,at brown,at.
evaluating the totality of the circumstances in this case,we have little trouble concluding that the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion.innocent,uninvolved to report an ongoing altercation that involved gunfire.though she did not speak with a police officer,she freely and repeatedly provided the police dispatcher with her name and telephone number,and the location of her home.these data points enhanced anderson credibility and the reliability of her report by allowing the police to hold her responsible if her tip ultimately proved false.see florida,united states nelson,f d,cir.indeed,the information anderson provided here was more detailed than in torres,where we noted that an informant reliability was enhanced because he identified himself by telling a police dispatcher that he was driving a green taxicab from a specified company.at.
the details of anderson call also made clear that she was reporting not just recent,but ongoing criminal activity that she was observing during her emergency call.see nelson,at.this allowed the police to conclude that anderson had a reliable,her eyewitness the information she was relaying to the dispatcher.see united states valentine,officers knowledge that informant was reporting what he had observed moments ago enhanced reliability of tip torres,at that detailed tip was relayed to dispatcher in fashion supported finding of reliability.anderson tip also described the color of the taxicab and noted that it had a distinctive green light on top see white,at level of detail of information provided can enhance an informant credibility nelson,at detailed information regarding,model,color,and other distinctive characteristics of vehicle supported reliability of information provided by anonymous informant.finally,anderson correctly noted that the taxi would be heading south on seventh street,which is exactly where it was first spotted by the police.see white,at reliability of tip enhanced because it accurately predicted defendant future behavior torres,at reliability of tip supported by fact that it
