opinion of the court 
at durrell smith trial for threatening federal officers with a gun,the government sought to establish that two years earlier smith had been observed dealing drugs at the same location as the charged assault.smith objected,arguing that the relevance of the drug deal to the gun crime requires an inference that because smith was a drug dealer in the past he must have been a drug dealer on the day in question.the district court overruled smith objection and permitted evidence about the earlier drug sale.smith was convicted and sentenced to years in prison.
we conclude that the evidence of smith drug distribution,two years before the incident for which he was on trial,violates our requirement that,when seeking to introduce evidence of prior bad acts under rule b,the proponent must set forth a chain of logical inferences,no link of which can be the inference that because the defendant committed offenses before,he therefore is more likely to have committed this one.united states sampson,cir emphasis added.we therefore reverse the district court evidentiary ruling,vacate smith conviction as to counts and of the indictment,and remand for a new trial.
factual and procedural background 
a.the september incident 
on september,fbi agent michael alerassool and three other officers were conducting surveillance in an unmarked car with tinted windows on the corner of brunswick and parkhurst streets,as part of an ongoing drug activity investigation in newark.most people in the vicinity scattered when the vehicle arrived on the street,but alerassool observed appellant durrell smith through the car window,standing his ground across the street and staring into the vehicle.
smith then disappeared from alerassool sight but returned about one minute later,walking at a regular pace towards the car.as smith passed under a street lamp,alerassool noticed that he had a handgun in his right hand,pointing the gun kind of at a downward angle,about seven inches from his right thigh.app.smith then began to rotate his shoulder to face the officers as he approached the vehicle.alerassool called out to the others in the car that smith had a gun,and smith was arrested before he could get any closer.the officers recovered a cf handgun from smith person but there is no contention that drugs were found on smith on that day.
the next day,smith was interviewed by newark police detective raul diaz.smith waived his miranda rights and confessed that he had been on the corner of brunswick and parkhurst the night before and that he had a gun.however,smith denied that the gun belonged to him.moreover,smith claimed that he retrieved the gun in because,although he did not know who was in the car,he feared for his life given that there had been a shooting nearby two weeks prior involving a similar car.
b.the government rule b motion 
smith,a convicted felon,was indicted on three counts threatening a federal officer in violation of a b using and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g.
before trial,the government moved in limine to admit evidence under rule b of the federal rules of evidence that,two years prior to his arrest,smith had engaged in a drug transaction on the same street corner.the government noted that the case boils down to smith motivation in retrieving the gun because smith claimed that he retrieved it in,and that the evidence would rebut that theory by establishing that smith had a motive to assault the people in the vehicle.app.specifically,the evidence would show that smith has a history of selling heroin on this corner,which,along with evidence that drug dealers often leave the guns in a stash and the drugs in a different stash and that drug dealers use weapons,would prove that smith wanted to assault the officers to protect his drug turf that particular night.app.smith objected,arguing that this line of reasoning violated rule b prohibition on evidence about a defendant character,used to show his propensity to act in accordance with that character.the district court deferred ruling on the motion.
after concluding its initial presentation of the evidence,the government renewed its motion,again arguing that the evidence of the drug deal was necessary to show that smith reason to assault the officers was to protect his turf.the government framed its argument as this defendant was seen in the past selling drugs at that particular corner,which shows that he sells drugs at that corner.app.smith again objected,arguing that the evidence was impermissible propensity evidence.
the district court allowed the evidence,explaining that it is important to the government in order to connect its proofs that there was an intentional assault.app.the court reasoned that because the issue that the jury ha d to resolve was whether smith motivation was offensive,rather than merely defensive,the evidence was admissible to determine whether smith acted in.app.the court then correctly recognized that admissibility of rule b evidence requires district courts to follow four steps,as set forth in huddleston.united states.analyzing these steps,the district court concluded that the evidence was offered for a proper purpose under rule b,to establish motive that the evidence was relevant under rule that although the evidence was significantly prejudicial it was not unfairly prejudicial under rule and that it would give an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury.app.
c.the september incident 
after this ruling,fbi agent michael brooks testified that in september he was conducting an investigation of drug activity in the same corner in newark as the one smith was arrested on in,when he observed smith engaging in a sale of heroin.there were no firearms involved in the incident.
the district court then gave a limiting instruction,which it repeated after its final charge,explaining that the testimony was admitted for limited purposes only,namely to decid e whether the defendant had the intent and a motive to commit the acts charged.app.the court asked the jury not to consider this evidence as proof that the defendant has a bad character or any propensity to commit crimes.app.
closing arguments,conviction,and sentence 
the government began its summation by painting smith as a drug dealer with turf to protect.app.the prosecutor twice argued that on the night of september smith meant to threaten the people in the car because,even if the jury believed smith statement that there had been a shooting two weeks prior,smith wanted to menace the individuals in the car for the of his turf.app.in rebuttal,the government also asked the jury to think what smith doing standing on a corner there is no house there,what he doing staring at a car what he doing over there he been on that block before,has he and not just two years ago.app.
the jury convicted smith on all counts.he was adjudicated a career offender based on the heroin sale that was the subject of the b motion and an unrelated drug possession charge,and sentenced to consecutive sentences of months on the assault charge,months on the use of the gun charge,and months on the felon in possession charge,for a total of months imprisonment.
ii.analysis 
rule b and standard of review 
smith argues that the district court violated rule b of the federal rules of evidence in admitting the evidence of the drug deal rule b prohibits evidence of a crime to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.b.however,t his evidence may be admissible for another purpose,such as proving motive.b.in determining the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence,a district court must analyze,under the familiar huddleston test,whether the evidence has a proper evidentiary purpose under rule b is relevant under rule is of such probative value as to outweigh the prejudice to the defendant as required by rule and is accompanied by a proper limiting instruction.at.we normally review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,but we exercise plenary review over whether evidence
