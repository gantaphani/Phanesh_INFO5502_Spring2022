a jury convicted david green of attempted possession with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine.green appeals,arguing that the district court erred by allowing the government to introduce evidence that he threatened to kill an undercover police officer.we will affirm.
in march of,green was arrested in new jersey on drug charges.this arrest came about in part through the efforts of an undercover officer identified in the record as,gus,and gussy.
three months later,green and an acquaintance,jacqueline stahl,were in a vehicle together when they drove past home.green told stahl that he was going to blow up as retaliation for getting him arrested.he stated his desire to purchase dynamite and blasting caps,as well as cocaine.alarmed,stahl contacted law enforcement,reported what green had said,and agreed to act as an informant in the weeks that followed,stahl,acting at the direction of the fbi,surreptitiously recorded a series of conversations with green about the possibility of acquiring dynamite and cocaine through frankie,stahl boyfriend from florida.
on july,stahl and green met at a convenience store in mantua,new jersey.green confirmed his interest in buying dynamite and blasting caps.stahl told green that frankie could get him six sticks of dynamite.the conversation then turned to the possibility of buying cocaine through a man green knew in miami.stahl volunteered to drive to florida to consummate the deal.green agreed that stahl should make the trip,because she was middle class looking and would not arouse suspicion.later,the conversation returned to the subject of explosives.green said,look,serious let do some dynamite.stahl asked him what he planned to do with it,and told him he better not kill anyone she knew,or go blow up that gus house.green remained coy,saying only that he wanted to keep something handy because he intended to do something.when stahl pressed him,asking who you got in mind,green responded,you never know.
on july,stahl and green again discussed the possibility of buying cocaine and dynamite from frankie.stahl asked green whether he needed small sticks of dynamite,such as would be used to blow up a car or a tree stump,or big sticks,to destroy a building.she again asked whether he intended to use it to blow up home.green steadfastly refused to specify his target,but he did ask stahl to tell him more about.the remainder of the conversation revolved around the terms of the deal.stahl told green that frankie would accept fifteen hundred dollars and an ounce of coke for six little ones or apiece for the small ones,or ounces of coke and a thousand cash for the big ones.green told stahl that these prices were too high.he was also skeptical that frankie would have any use for cocaine from new jersey,since the drug was abundant in florida.stahl promised to find out how much cash frankie would require.
in the weeks that followed,green interest in buying dynamite appeared to wane.at one meeting,green told stahl that the dynamite was on the back burner because he was low on money.but he was still interested in cocaine,which he could sell for a hefty profit.on july,stahl told green that frankie would sell him a kilogram of cocaine in exchange for up front and more within a month.she also told him that the total purchase price of included the sticks of dynamite.green responded,i ai,forget the sticks.i talking about the powder.he also told stahl that he did not wan na keep talking about this thing because he feared he was under surveillance.the next day,green told stahl that he would accept frankie terms,and described his plan to sell the cocaine through a friend in pottstown,pennsylvania.on july,stahl told green that frankie associates would be up from florida the following weekend and that green should have his ready.stahl reminded him that the sticks are right in with the grand take it,book and then you can deal more with him later.
the sale was scheduled for august.green had not pulled together the necessary,but he brought along plus the title to a vehicle he intended to offer as collateral.stahl picked up green at his apartment and drove him to a motel,where they met mario,an fbi agent posing as frankie friend.after initial conversations inside the motel,mario,green,and stahl went to mario vehicle.mario opened the trunk and showed green one bag containing dynamite and another containing cocaine.green twice said,alright,then went to retrieve stahl vehicle.as he walked to the car,however,he noticed police officers sitting in several of the vehicles in the parking lot.he decided to abandon the deal.he got into stahl car,stopped in front of mario car,pulled stahl into the vehicle,and sped away.as they drove away,green exclaimed to stahl that there were police officers the man in the parking lot.stahl feigned ignorance,but green angrily accused her of setting him up.he exclaimed look,look.that the fucking man bitch i oughta kill your fucking ass.stahl denied any involvement with the police,but green was not convinced.he ordered stahl to stay away from him,drove her car back to his apartment,and dropped himself off.stahl drove away unharmed.
green was arrested four days later.he was indicted on one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute grams or more of cocaine,in violation of a and b b and.he was not charged in connection with his attempts to procure dynamite or his threat to kill 
before trial,the government filed a motion in limine to admit recorded and testimonial evidence of green attempts to purchase dynamite and threats to kill specifically,the government theory of admissibility was that green pursuit of dynamite constituted intrinsic evidence concerning the charged cocaine offense.this argument relied on united states williams,cir,and similar cases from other courts of appeals.in williams,the fifth circuit stated that evidence of uncharged bad acts is intrinsic to the charged offense when the evidence of the other act and the evidence of the crime charged are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.id.at.the court distinguished such evidence from extrinsic evidence,which,unlike intrinsic evidence,must be analyzed under rule b.id.the government contended that green attempts to buy dynamite were inextricably intertwined with the charged cocaine offense because green drug crime occurred concurrently with and arose out of his negotiations for explosives,and because the final price,quantity,and terms of the charged cocaine transaction were inextricably bound up in and influenced by green negotiations for explosives.
green argued for exclusion of all references to the dynamite and why he wanted it.he argued that discussions about dynamite and killing were not intrinsic to the charged cocaine offense,and could easily be redacted from the recordings of his conversations with stahl about cocaine.he also argued that even if the references to dynamite were intrinsic evidence,they should be excluded under rule.
after a hearing,the district court granted the government motion.the district judge apparently accepted the government intrinsic evidence argument,because he did not conduct a rule b analysis.he reasoned that the dynamite explains how we got into a drug deal in the first place,and that the government certainly is entitled to give the background and an explanation of how this all came about,how they ended up together in this position to arrest green under these charges.the district judge also declined to exclude the government evidence under rule.he recognized that the evidence was highly prejudicial,but offered to give a limiting instruction to the jury.
at trial,the jury heard recordings of the conversations between stahl and green recounted above.stahl supplemented those recordings with testimony about the conversations and green attempts to procure dynamite and cocaine.she testified that she went to the fbi after she learned that green wanted to kill a couple officers and he was looking for some cocaine and dynamite.she also said that she agreed to cooperate with the subsequent investigation because officers lives were in danger.shortly after that testimony,the jury heard the july conversation in which stahl questioned green about his desire to blow up gussy.the prosecutor asked who gussy was.stahl responded that gussy was an officer and that green wanted to know where he lived because you know,he wanted to kill him.he wanted to murder him because he was busted.
meanwhile,green attacked stahl credibility throughout the trial.in his opening statement,he called her a profane,aggressive,and unpleasant individual whose cooperation with the fbi was motivated by money.he developed this line of attack during his of the government first witness,fbi agent robert barbieri,who was stahl fbi handler.barbieri testified that the fbi paid stahl approximately for her work as an informant,both to compensate her for her time and to reimburse her for gas and the use of her cell phone.he acknowledged that stahl had asked for money from the fbi five or six times since the investigation of green had concluded,and had threatened not to testify against green unless the fbi gave her more money.he also admitted that stahl had asked if the fbi could help her son,who was facing criminal charges in an unrelated matter.green resumed this attack during of stahl herself.he suggested that the she received from the fbi was a lot of money to her,and again suggested that she cooperated to help her son.stahl denied any improper motive and insisted that she approached the fbi out of a desire to protect people,lives that were in danger.
near the end of the trial,the district court reminded the jury that green was not on trial for any acts or attempted acts relating to dynamite,and cautioned jurors not to use evidence about dynamite as proof that green was a bad person with a propensity for committing criminal acts.green trial counsel approved this charge,telling the district court that its proposed instruction was great.the jury found green guilty.
in determining green offense level for purposes of calculating his advisory guidelines range,the district court applied a enhancement for obstruction of justice under.obstructive conduct under includes threatening,intimidating,or otherwise unlawfully influencing a witness directly or indirectly,or attempting to do so.cmt.a.green received this enhancement because he yelled,bitch i oughta kill your fucking ass at stahl as they drove away from the motel.the district court concluded that this statement amounted to a threat,inasmuch as green had menaced stahl precisely because he realized she had set him up,and was likely to be a witness against him in the future.
the court sentenced green to months in prison.green filed a timely notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction under and a 
in the district court,green challenged the admissibility of all evidence concerning his attempts to buy dynamite.he has narrowed his challenge on appeal.he admits that his discussions about dynamite permeated and could be said to have intertwined with his discussions about cocaine.green contends,however,that the district court erred in allowing evidence that he had threatened to use that dynamite to kill.in other words,he no longer argues that the jury should not have learned that he sought to buy dynamite.he argues only that it should not have been allowed to learn why he wanted that dynamite.he claims that this evidence was not intrinsic evidence.additionally,he argues that evidence of his threat to kill was inadmissible under rule b,and in any event should have been excluded under rule 
as it did in the district court,the government asserts that evidence of green threat to kill was intrinsic evidence and thus admissible without reference to rule b.in the alternative,it argues that the evidence was admissible under rule b,and need not have been excluded under rule.as a fallback position,the government maintains that admission of the evidence was,at worst,harmless error.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings principally on an abuse of discretion standard.complaint of consolidation coal,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs only where the district court decision is arbitrary,fanciful,or clearly unreasonable in short,where no reasonable person would adopt the district court view.united states starnes,cir.we exercise plenary review,however,of the district court rulings to the extent they are based on a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.complaint of consolidation coal,at.this includes plenary review of whether evidence falls within the scope of rule b.united states cruz,cir 
we begin with green argument that evidence of his threat to kill was not intrinsic to the crime charged.in doing so,we examine several evidentiary concepts that have frustrated courts and commentators alike.accordingly,recourse to some legal history affords useful context.
the original attitude of the english courts was that any relevant evidence of the defendant misconduct was admissible even if the only theory of relevance was to establish the defendant character and,in turn,use character as circumstantial proof of conduct.edward imwinkelried,uncharged misconduct evidence hereinafter imwinkelried,uncharged misconduct evidence.abuse of this rule,among others,by the inquisitors of the star chamber prompted parliament to pass the treason act of.id.that law granted several new rights to individuals accused of treason.first,it entitled the accused to a copy of the indictment stating the charges against him.second,it mandated that any overt act of treason alleged in the indictment be proved by two witnesses,testifying in open court subject to.third,and most importantly for present purposes,it provided that no overt act that was not alleged in the indictment could be proved at trial.see thomas reed,trial by propensity admission of other criminal acts evidenced in federal criminal trials,cin,hereinafter reed,trial by propensity citing will.iii,ch.over time,courts extended the rule against proving uncharged acts to criminal trials generally,not just trials for treason.id.at.by,it was more or less settled that bad acts evidence which merely demonstrate d the propensity of the defendant to do acts similar to those charged was inadmissible.see norman krivosha et,relevancy the necessary element in using evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or bad acts to convict,citing the case of rex cole 
english decisions in this area influenced american courts,and the rule here throughout the and centuries mirrored that of england evidence that the accused had committed some other crime was not admissible to prove that the defendant had a propensity for committing crimes,and therefore probably committed the charged crime reed,trial by propensity,supra,at.see also david leonard,the new wigmore evidence of other misconduct and similar events at american courts plainly followed english practice in excluding uncharged misconduct evidence when offered to prove guilt through an inference of bad character.
it was held early on,however,that this rule did not require the exclusion of all evidence of uncharged crimes courts allowed such evidence when it was introduced not to demonstrate propensity,but to establish the res gestae thing done of the charged crime most of the early cases arose in the state courts.walker commonwealth,leigh,wl,was one such case,though it did not explicitly invoke the term res gestae.in walker,the defendant was indicted for larceny of a watch,a gold chain,and a key.at trial,the prosecution was permitted to introduce evidence that the defendant had also stolen a cloak,a theft which was the subject of a separate indictment.id.at.the defendant was convicted and appealed,contending that admission of evidence concerning the stolen cloak was error.the general court of virginia agreed.it began its analysis by acknowledging the general rule that the prosecution was forbidden to go into proof of the commission of any other offence than that charged or of the character of the prisoner.id.at.it then recognized that 
i t frequently happens,however,that as the evidence of circumstances must be resorted to for the purpose of proving the commission of the particular offence charged,the proof of those circumstances involves the proof of other acts,either criminal or apparently innocent.in such cases,it is proper that the chain of evidence should be unbroken.if one or more links of that chain consist of circumstances which tend to prove that the prisoner has been guilty of other crimes than that charged,this is no reason why the court should exclude those circumstances.they are so intimately connected and blended with the main facts adduced in evidence that they can not be departed from with propriety and there is no reason why the criminality of such intimate and connected circumstances should exclude them,more than other facts apparently innocent.
id.the court gave the following hypothetical suppose a man is indicted for murder.suppose further that the murder weapon was a pistol that this pistol once belonged to another man,but was stolen on the same night the defendant was seen at the rightful owner house and that the defendant was seen in possession of the pistol on the day of the murder.this evidence would tend to suggest that the defendant had stolen the pistol.should it be admitted in the murder trial the court said yes,even though the evidence tended to prove both larceny and murder,because it was intimately connected and blended with the main facts of the charged murder.the court distinguished between evidence which constitute d a part of the transaction the sort of evidence that became known as res evidence of circumstances hav ing no intimate connexion with the main fact.id.the former was admissible the latter was not.
application of similar rules led to a different result in commonwealth heath,rob,wl.there,the trial court allowed a witness to testify that the defendant had shot him shortly before he murdered the victim.the general court upheld that decision,noting that the fact of the shooting,as being part of the circumstances and of the res gestae,ought not to have been precluded from being given in evidence to the jury,although such evidence might itself have tended to prove a distinct felony committed by the prisoner.id.at.brown commonwealth,wl,was to the same effect.in that case,the defendant was accused of murdering a husband and wife.in a separate trial for the murder of the wife,prosecutors sought to prove that the husband body had been found nearby.the defendant argued that nothing about the husband murder should be admitted.the pennsylvania supreme court disagreed.it held that b eing parts of the same res gestae,the two murders together,tend ed to throw light on each other,and there is no reason that the truth should be thrown out by excluding evidence concerning the murder of the husband.id.at.this despite the general rule that the commission of a distinct offense,even similar in character,can not be given in evidence against a defendant.id.
the most famous case on this issue was people molineaux,bedell.in that case,molineaux was accused of poisoning and killing one adams.at trial,the court allowed the prosecution to introduce evidence suggesting that molineaux had also poisoned a romantic rival with the same drug that felled adams.id.at.the new york court of appeals held that this evidence should not have been admitted.it declared it universally recognized and firmly established in all lands that the general rule of evidence applicable to criminal trials is that the state can not prove against a defendant any crime not alleged in the indictment,either as a foundation for a separate punishment,or as aiding the proofs that he is guilty of the crime charged.id.at.the court recognized that there were exceptions to this rule,however,such as where the evidence tended to prove motive intent the absence of mistake or accident a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the others or the identity of the person charged with the commission of the crime on trial.id.at.in explaining the common scheme exception,the court acknowledged that evidence of other crimes could be admissible where two or more crimes are so connected that it is impossible to distinguish them and proof of all,in the effort to establish one,is a part of the res gestae.id.at citing brown,and people foley.
in the decades that followed,federal courts generally adhered to the approach outlined in molineaux.they held that evidence of uncharged misconduct was generally inadmissible,but recognized many exceptions to that rule,including one for evidence that was part of the res gestae.gianotos united states,cir,is representative.in that case,gianotos and two others were charged with unlawfully importing opium.thomas,a who had been caught with the opium,pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for the government.thomas testified that he agreed to hold the opium only because gianotos had threatened to inform police that thomas had assisted him in a separate act of opium smuggling months earlier.id.at.on appeal,gianotos argued that no evidence concerning the earlier smuggling should have been admitted.the ninth circuit disagreed.it began by recognizing the general rule against admitting evidence that the accused has committed another crime wholly independent of that for which he is on trial.id.at.the court recognized,however,that there were many exceptions to this rule,including one for instances in which two distinct offenses are so inseparably connected that the proof of one necessarily involves proving the other.id.applying this exception,the ninth circuit held that the challenged evidence was admissible because it explained why thomas feared gianotos enough to go along with the charged offense.the court reasoned that t he purpose of this evidence relating to the former crime was not to establish the commission of a distinct offense,but the charged offense,insofar as it explained thomas involvement.id.emphasis added.it concluded by stating the prevailing rule in proving a crime,all the res gestae may always be shown,though it involve proof or evidence concerning the commission of another and independent crime by the defendant at the same time.id.at.
similarly,in united states tuffanelli,the seventh circuit allowed evidence of uncharged wrongful acts in a conspiracy case involving violations of federal liquor laws,on the theory that those acts were logically connected with the charged offense and so closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself as to form part of the plan or system of criminal action,cir.in bracey united states,the circuit synthesized more than a dozen cases and concluded that,notwithstanding the general rule against the admission of uncharged crimes,evidence of other criminal acts has been held admissible by this court when they are so blended or connected with the one on trial as that proof of one incidentally involves the other or explains the circumstances thereof or tends logically to prove any element of the crime charged.see also united states hughes,cir upholding admission of evidence that defendants possessed firearms in a trial for counterfeiting because the defendants guns were part of the res gestae they were so closely blended and inextricably bound up with the history of the crime itself as to constitute a part of the plan or system of criminal action involved in the case united states crowe,cir citing tuffanelli and gianotos lynch united states,cir the general rule is that,where a defendant is on trial for one offense,evidence of separate and distinct offenses is not permissible,except where the subject of inquiry is so related to the main offense as to throw material light thereon.
while use of the res gestae exception grew common,critics argued the term was too vague to be useful and encouraged rote incantation of latinisms in lieu of thoughtful analysis.professor wigmore was especially unsparing.he wrote that res gestae was an empty phrase which encouraged looseness of thinking and uncertainty of decision,john wigmore,wigmore on evidence chadbourn,and most frequently used as a cover for loose ideas and ignorance of principles,john wigmore,wigmore on evidence tillers ed.professor morgan wrote that res gestae was a troublesome expression which owed its prominence to an inclination of judges and lawyers to avoid the toilsome exertion of exact analysis and precise thinking.edmund morgan,a suggested classification of utterances admissible as res gestae,yale.he argued that the phrase was marked by exasperating indefiniteness that did nothing but bewilder and perplex,and faulted courts for choosing to express in a dead and foreign tongue an idea for which there are accurate and adequate english words.id.professor thayer likewise criticized the growing and intolerable vagueness of the expression.james thayer,bedingfield as a part of the res gesta,am.these criticisms were chiefly directed to the use of res gestae as a hearsay exception,but they were equally applicable to its use in the context of uncharged crimes see leonard,supra,at.
in,congress adopted the federal rules of evidence.the new codification included rule b,which provided that evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts was inadmissible to prove a person character in order to show action in conformity therewith,but admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.the rule codified the common law bar against the use of uncharged crimes to prove criminal in a modified form.the common law rule was widely,though not universally,stated in exclusionary terms.that is,it set forth a general rule of inadmissibility,subject to exceptions,such as res gestae.see,united states clemons,cir describing narrow exceptions to a general rule of exclusion molineaux,bedell at.by contrast,rule b was inclusionary.it stated a general rule of admissibility,subject to a single of other wrongful acts was admissible so long as it was not introduced solely to prove criminal propensity.thus,the proponent no longer had to pigeonhole his evidence into one of the established exceptions,on pain of exclusion.if he could identify any purpose for introducing the evidence,it was admissible see,united states long,cir contrasting the exclusionary and inclusionary approaches united states bradwell,cir same leonard,supra,reed,trial by propensity,supra,at.
since rule b was enacted,the term res gestae has largely given way to its modern,descendant intrinsic evidence,the term invoked by the government in this case see christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence ed.see also edward imwinkelried,the second coming of res gestae,cath,hereinafter imwinkelried,the second coming of res gestae describing the inextricably intertwined doctrine as arguably the second coming of the res gestae principle.as mentioned earlier,modern cases divide evidence of other crimes and bad acts into two categories those extrinsic to the charged offense,and those intrinsic to it.extrinsic evidence must be analyzed under rule b intrinsic evidence need not be.recalling the logic for allowing res gestae evidence,courts today exempt intrinsic evidence from application of rule b on the theory that there is no other wrongful conduct at issue the evidence is admissible as part and parcel of the charged offense.compare gianotos,at res gestae evidence admissible not to establish the commission of a distinct offense but for its bearing on the crime under investigation,with united states gibbs,cir intrinsic evidence is not subject to rule b analysis because there is no other crime.the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic evidence has been criticized,see,united states.cross,cir united states bowie,but it is one we have accepted,see,united states hoffecker,cir gibbs,at.
this brings us to the issue presented in this appeal.was evidence of green threat to kill intrinsic to the charged offense of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute the answer to that question depends on the definition of intrinsic evidence,a term we have used before but never conclusively defined.exhuming the inseparably connected and inextricably mixed up language of res gestae most courts of appeals today hold that acts are intrinsic to the charged offense if they are inextricably intertwined with that offense.cross,at.they allow this evidence for the same reason courts once allowed res gestae evidence it helps the factfinder to evaluate all of the circumstances under which the defendant acted.united states smith,cir.in other words,it aids understanding by complet ing the story of the charged crime.see,united states basham,cir united states sumlin,cir united states carboni,cir.
courts following this reasoning employ a variety of tests for determining whether an act is inextricably intertwined with the charged offense.the eleventh circuit holds that evidence is inextricably intertwined if it is not part of the crime charged but pertain s to the chain of events explaining the context of the crime or is linked in time and circumstances with the charged crime or forms an integral and natural part of an account of the crime or complete s the story of the crime for the jury.united states wright,cir.the seventh circuit exempts from rule b evidence of misconduct that supplies a complete story of the crime on trial evidence necessary to avoid a chronological or conceptual void in the story of the crime and evidence that is so blended or connected that it incidentally involves,explains the circumstances surrounding,or tends to prove any element of,the charged crime.united states gibson,cir internal quotations omitted.the eighth circuit considers evidence inextricably intertwined if it is an integral part of the immediate context of the crime charged.united states hall,cir.the second circuit inquires whether the uncharged crime evidence is necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.united states quinones,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.the tenth circuit asks whether a witness testimony would have been confusing and incomplete without mention of the uncharged act.united states johnson,cir.
there are at least three problems with the inextricably intertwined test and its subsidiary formulations.the first is that the test creates confusion because,quite simply,no one knows what it means.such an impediment stands as an obstacle to helpful analysis.indeed,we have criticized the inextricably intertwined standard as a definition that elucidates little.cross,at.the seventh circuit,which has consistently used the test,admits that it is often unhelpfully vague.united states taylor,cir professors mueller and kirkpatrick argue that it has proved elastic and invites abuse.mueller kirkpatrick,supra.others note that it substitutes a careful analysis with boilerplate jargon,stephen saltzburg et al,federal rules of evidence manual ed,and invites sloppy,leonard,supra,at.even professor imwinkelried,who defends the test,concedes that the vacuous nature of its wording gives courts license to employ sloppy analysis and allows them quickly to slip from a conclusory analysis to a desired conclusion.imwinkelried,the second coming of res gestae,supra,at.
indeed,this case exemplifies how elusive and unhelpful the inextricably intertwined standard can be.all of the formulations used by the courts of appeals purport to embody the same test,but clearly they are not interchangeable.whether evidence qualifies as intrinsic in a particular case may well depend on which version of the test one employs.for example,green threat to kill would qualify as intrinsic if the test is whether it pertain s to the chain of events explaining the context of the crime,wright,at,because it pertained to in fact,triggered stahl decision to go to the fbi and the subsequent chain of events through which green was caught attempting to possess cocaine.the same threat would not be intrinsic,however,if the test were whether that threat was an integral part of the immediate context of the crime charged.hall,at.the district court just as easily could have forced the government to start the tale of green wrongdoing with the fact that stahl went to the fbi because green had expressed interest in buying cocaine and dynamite.it was not strictly necessary for the jury to know why green wanted dynamite in order for it to understand that he did,and that his inquiries on that point drove stahl to the fbi.likewise,green threat to kill would probably be intrinsic evidence if the touchstone were whether that threat explain ed the circumstances surrounding stahl decision to warn the fbi.gibson,at.it would not be intrinsic,however,if the relevant inquiry is whether stahl testimony would have been confusing and incomplete without mention of the threat against johnson,at.we see no principled way to choose among these competing incarnations of the test,yet that choice could well be determinative.simply stated,the indefinite phrasing of the doctrine is a virtual invitation for abuse.imwinkelried,the second coming of res gestae,supra,at.
the second problem with the inextricably intertwined test is that resort to it is unnecessary.the most common justification for admitting evidence of intertwined acts is to allow a witness to testify freely and coherently we do not want him to have to tiptoe around uncharged bad acts by the defendant,and thereby risk distorting his narrative.this is a worthy goal,but it can be accomplished without circumventing rule b.as the circuit explained in bowie 
if the intrinsic act is indeed part of the crime charged,evidence of it will,by definition,always satisfy rule b.the rule bars bad acts evidence only when the evidence is offered solely to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.evidence that constitutes the very crime being prosecuted is not of that sort.
at.there is little practical difference between admitting inextricably intertwined evidence as background pursuant to rules and,and admitting it under rule b.in both cases,the evidence must be relevant,it must pass muster under rule,and it must not be introduced solely to prove the defendant criminal propensity.t he only consequences of labeling evidence intrinsic are to relieve the prosecution of rule b notice requirement and the court of its obligation to give an appropriate limiting instruction upon defense counsel request.id.see also united states ameri,d,it is difficult for me to conjure up a fact situation where inextricably intertwined evidence would be admissible under rule b.if this is true,why discard the rule b safeguards t he notice requirement of b is manifestly important,and is often crucial if the defendant is to meet the bad act evidence.stated another way,the inextricably intertwined doctrine exempts evidence of wrongful acts that explain the circumstances of the crime from the rigors of rule b.but the same evidence would also be admissible within the framework of that rule because allowing the jury to understand the circumstances surrounding the charged the a proper,purpose under rule b.see,united states,cir identifying the need to show the background of the charges and the parties familiarity with each other as a proper purpose united states simmons,cir concluding that providing the jury with necessary background information was a proper purpose under rule b united states dansker,cir upholding introduction of prior criminal acts by defendants because the background information provided by this testimony enabled the jury to better understand the witness role in the bribery scheme as well as his testimony as a whole all that is accomplished by labeling evidence intrinsic is relieving the government from providing a defendant with the procedural protections of rule b.
the third problem with the inextricably intertwined test is that some of its broader formulations,taken at face value,classify evidence of virtually any bad act as intrinsic.see,gibson,at permitting evidence of any act that explains the circumstances surrounding the charged crime.as we warned in cross,such a regime would eviscerate rule b.see at.see also bowie,at ameri,d at explaining that a liberal view of the inextricably intertwined exception to rule b would essentially nullify the b restrictions on bad act evidence.
this court has never adopted its own version of the inextricably intertwined test.in cross,we noted some of the problems with the test but ultimately reserved judgment.we observed that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic evidence is often fuzzy and noted that most circuit courts view evidence as intrinsic if it is inextricably intertwined with the charged offense or if it completes the story of the charged offense.cross,at.we pointed out that the former approach was a definition that elucidates little,and the latter so broad that it renders rule b meaningless.id.however,we found it unnecessary to go beyond highlighting these pedagogical problems with understanding intrinsic evidence.because cross arose from a criminal conspiracy charge,the issue was easy to resolve.we noted that,under third circuit precedent,acts are intrinsic when they directly prove the charged conspiracy.id.citing gibbs,at.we concluded that because the evidence at issue did not directly prove the charged conspiracy,it was not intrinsic.id.accordingly,we declined to decide the boundaries of intrinsic evidence for every case.specifically,we expressed no view on whether other acts evidence that does not directly prove an element of the charged offense may be intrinsic if it is inextricably intertwined with the events underlying the charge,so that the evidence is necessary for the jury to understand how the offense occurred or to comprehend crucial testimony.id.at.
our resistance to the inextricably intertwined standard has not diminished since cross,and today we make clear that this is not our test for intrinsic evidence.like its predecessor res gestae,the inextricably intertwined test is vague,overbroad,and prone to abuse,and we can not ignore the danger it poses to the vitality of rule b.
that is not to say we reject the concept of intrinsic evidence entirely.instead,we will reserve the intrinsic label for two narrow categories of evidence.first,evidence is intrinsic if it directly proves the charged offense.see,cross,f d at gibbs,at acts of violence admissible as direct proof of the charged drug conspiracy.see also bowie,at acknowledging that evidence of an act that is part of the charged offense is properly considered intrinsic.this gives effect to rule b applicability only to evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts.b emphasis added.if uncharged misconduct directly proves the charged offense,it is not evidence of some other crime.gibbs,at.second,uncharged acts performed contemporaneously with the charged crime may be termed intrinsic if they facilitate the commission of the charged crime.bowie,at.but all else must be analyzed under rule b.
as a practical matter,it is unlikely that our holding will exclude much,if any,evidence that is currently admissible as background or completes the story evidence under the inextricably intertwined test.we reiterate that the purpose of rule b is simply to keep from the jury evidence that the defendant is prone to commit crimes or is otherwise a bad person,implying that the jury need worry overmuch about the strength of the government evidence.taylor,at.no other use of prior crimes or other bad acts is forbidden by the rule,and one proper use of such evidence is the need to avoid confusing the jury.id.at emphasis added.see also simmons,at recognizing that other crimes evidence may be admissible if offered for any purpose,and identifying the need to provide necessary background information about the relationships among the players as a proper purpose.thus,most,if not all,other crimes evidence currently admitted outside the framework of rule b as background evidence will remain admissible under the approach we adopt today the only difference is that the proponent will have to provide notice of his intention to use the evidence,and identify the specific,purpose for which he seeks to introduce it,allowing the jury to hear the full story of the crime.see bowie,at.additionally,the trial court will be required to give a limiting instruction upon request.see united states kemp,cir bowie,at explaining that designation of evidence as inextricably intertwined unduly deprives the defendant of the right to a limiting instruction.
applying the s
