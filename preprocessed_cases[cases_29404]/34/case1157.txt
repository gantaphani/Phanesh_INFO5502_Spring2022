appellants,the mercator corporation,its chairman james giffen,and their attorneys,the law firm of akin,gump,strauss,hauer feld,akin gump,appeal from the september,order of the district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge,granting the united states motion to compel akin gump to produce bank records for thirty specific accounts at four swiss banks called for in grand jury subpoenas dated march,and august.appellants submit that in ordering production of the subpoenaed records,the district court abused its discretion in two ways by failing to recognize that the discrete bank records in akin gump possession constituted attorney work product because counsel selection and compilation of these records was part of an evolving strategy to defend mercator and giffen from possible criminal charges,and by compelling production of this work product despite the united states failure to demonstrate an inability to obtain the subpoenaed records from alternative sources.we conclude that appellants work product claim,unsupported by any in camera identification or submission of the responsive documents in akin gump possession,is simply too conclusory to meet their burden to show a real,rather than speculative,concern that the ordered production will reveal counsel thought processes and strategies.gould,mitsui mining smelting,cir.accordingly,we affirm the district court order compelling compliance with the grand jury subpoenas.
background 
for several years,the united states attorney for the southern district of new york has been investigating possible violations of the foreign corrupt practices act,et,by corporations and persons doing business with senior officials of a particular foreign country toward that end,more than two years ago,the united states filed a mutual legal assistance treaty mlat request with swiss authorities seeking bank records relating to specific accounts held by the foreign country or its officials.as the government explains in its ex parte submission,the response received from switzerland to date has been incomplete or unsatisfactory in several respects important to the prosecution of the charges under investigation.
throughout the relevant time,akin gump has represented mercator and giffen,and,on their behalf,has communicated with prosecutors on matters relating to the pending criminal investigation.specifically,in the fall of,akin gump offered to produce records from six of the swiss bank accounts identified in the mlat request with the understanding that production did not waive future privilege claims by akin gump clients.prosecutors declined to accept the documents on these terms.
on march,a grand jury sitting in the southern district of new york issued a subpoena to akin gump demanding production of any and all bank records in its possession relating to the six swiss accounts discussed in with prosecutors.on august,it issued a second subpoena calling for akin gump production of any and all bank records in its possession relating to additional swiss accounts,which records had also been sought pursuant to the mlat request.in response to both subpoenas,akin gump invoked the work product doctrine,prompting prosecutors to file a motion with the district court on august,to compel compliance.
after reviewing the submissions of the parties and hearing oral argument on september,judge chin granted the motion to compel,entering a formal order on september.a few days later,on september,he issued a memorandum decision detailing his reasons for rejecting appellants work product claim.see in re grand jury subpoenas dated march and august,no.m,wl.carefully reviewing the law applicable to the attorney work product doctrine,judge chin concluded that the subpoenaed bank records did not in and of themselves constitute work product because they were the records of third parties,created and maintained in the ordinary course of business by those third parties without any reference to litigation whatsoever.id.at.to the extent appellants argued that akin gump selection and compilation of specific bank records transformed the documents into attorney work product,disclosure of which would reveal counsel developing defense strategy,judge chin noted that in this circuit,qualifying the selection of records for work product protection depends upon the existence of a real,rather than speculative,concern that the thought processes of counsel in relation to pending or anticipated litigation would be exposed.id.at quoting gould,mitsui mining smelting,at.he expressly found that akin,gump has failed to demonstrate such a genuine concern.id.judge chin ruled that,in any event,equity warranted disclosure of the subpoenaed records because it was unlikely that they would be procured from any other source given the difficulties that had plagued the mlat request,as well as a memorandum of understanding between switzerland and the united states limiting attempts to subpoena information from united states branches of swiss banks.id.at and.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court rulings on appellants work product claim for abuse of discretion.see in re grand jury proceedings,cir united states adlman,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir footnote omitted see united states adlman,at remanding case where district court applied incorrect legal standard to work product claim.we find no such error in this case.to the contrary,we conclude that judge chin decision fully comports with applicable law.
b.the attorney work product doctrine 
the attorney work product doctrine,now codified in part in rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure,provides qualified protection for materials prepared by or at the behest of counsel in anticipation of litigation or for trial.both distinct from and broader than the privilege,united states nobles,d,the work product doctrine permits discovery of documents and tangible things prepared by or for counsel in anticipation of civil litigation only upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.b.in the context of a pending criminal prosecution,the doctrine is even stricter,precluding discovery of documents made by a defendant attorney or the attorney agents except with respect to scientific or medical reports.b.
it was in hickman taylor,that the supreme court first recognized the work product doctrine as essential to the proper functioning of our adversarial system.
in performing his various duties it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy,free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel this work is reflected,of course,in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondence,briefs,mental impressions,personal beliefs,and countless other tangible and intangible though roughly termed as the work product of the lawyer.were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand,much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten.an attorney thoughts,heretofore inviolate,would not be his own.inefficiency,unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.the effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing.and the interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly served.
