background 
juan hernandez was arrested by the new york city police department on november,on charges arising out of an incident in which he sustained multiple gunshot wounds.numerous bullet fragments were removed from his body at luke hospital and at bellevue hospital prison ward for medical reasons,however,the surgeons did not remove bullet fragments embedded in his left hand.this injury was particularly serious hernandez describes the gunshot as having shattered and ripped apart his hand.tr.at 
on december,hernandez was released from police custody on his own recognizance and was transferred from bellevue prison ward into the hospital general population.the next day,against the advice of bellevue medical staff,he left the hospital,the bullet fragments still embedded in his hand.according to hernandez,t he pain was excruciating,and the hand was swollen to the size of a boxing glove.id.at.
hernandez remained free on his own recognizance for the next five months,from the time he left bellevue on december,until he was rearrested on april,and placed in the custody of the city of new york department of corrections.during this period he sought no treatment for his hand because he explained he could not afford it.
hernandez was then in the city custody for fifteen april,when he was rearrested,until july,when his criminal trial which time he unsuccessfully sought treatment for his hand.no one responsible for his care during this period was named as a defendant in this suit.
in july,hernandez was convicted in state court of attempted murder in the second degree,and was transferred to the custody of the state to serve his sentence.he was initially placed in the downstate correctional facility in fishkill,new york downstate.there,hernandez again sought treatment for his hand but was told that he would not be treated until he arrived at the next facility.id.at.no one responsible for plaintiff care at downstate was named as a defendant in this suit.
hernandez arrived at the sing sing correctional facility in ossining,new york sing sing on august or,approximately months after he sustained the gunshot wound to his left hand.except for a transfer to another facility between march and january,he remained at sing sing until he filed this lawsuit in february.the defendants in this appeal all worked at sing sing while plaintiff was there.
upon his initial arrival at sing sing,plaintiff complained to prison officials about severe pain caused by the bullet fragments in his left hand.he was examined by defendant philip williams,a sing sing employee whose title was physician assistant.williams discussed the injury with his supervisor,defendant halko,who was plaintiff primary care physician.because sing sing had no surgeons on staff,halko and williams referred hernandez to an outside consultant surgeon,louis rose.rose examined hernandez on october,and recommended surgery to remove the gunshot fragments and reconstruct the hand.an operation was scheduled for november,but was cancelled when rose became unavailable through no fault of defendants or anyone else at sing sing.
in december,no appointment having been made,hernandez filed a grievance with the sing sing prison administration,recounting his difficulties in getting treatment and complaining that the situation was getting worse yesterday a piece of the metal came halfway out of my hand and is now sticking out.this is very painful.id.at.at trial,hernandez explained that by this point his hand had contracted into a shape.
hernandez was thereafter examined by halko,who prescribed pain medication,recommended that surgery be performed asap,and arranged a consultation with another outside surgeon,richard magill.id.at.at an examination on december,magill discussed surgery,and asked that plaintiff return a full month later to discuss surgery in further detail.id.at.
over the next several months,plaintiff was treated by sing sing medical staff for a chronic cyst on his back and for a seizure disorder,but was not sent back to magill.uncontroverted evidence at trial established that in january,hernandez refused to take medication that sing sing medical staff had prescribed to alleviate his seizure condition,and that scheduling surgery in such circumstances c ould be devastating and c ould result in grave consequences,including death.id.at.then,on march,hernandez was transferred from sing sing to elmira correctional facility in elmira,new york elmira,several hundred miles away.this transfer was generated by a statewide prisoner transfer computer system however,a sing sing policy called for the placement of a medical hold to prevent the transfer of patients awaiting hospitalization,surgery,or consultation for a serious or complex illness.the testimony at trial established that medical holds are a clerical procedure,and an administrative function.id.at.the evidence hid not establish who had the direct responsibility for placing a hold on hernandez.the hold policy stated that the nurse administrator,nurse prigitano,had primary responsibility for providing the records coordinator with a list of inmates on medical hold,and it appears that she and several other nurses were primarily responsible for placing medical holds.nurse prigitano was also directly responsible for scheduling prisoner visits with outside clinics,id.at,but she was not named as a defendant in this case.williams,halko,or their supervisor,defendant satish kapoor could have placed a medical hold on hernandez or scheduled a appointment with magill,but they did not do so.
at elmira,prison officials referred hernandez to yet another outside surgeon for advice on possible surgery to remove the gunshot fragments and reconstruct the hand,but this surgeon recommended against such an operation on grounds that the bullet fragments were not interfering with the use of the hand and that surgery could in fact compromise hand function even further.def.ex.none of the officials responsible for plaintiff care at elmira were named as defendants in this suit 
hernandez was transferred back to sing sing in january.after several months of further examinations and testing,magill concluded that the benefits of surgery outweighed the risks,and operated to remove the bullet fragments.as part of this operation,a piece of bone was taken from plaintiff leg and grafted into his hand.
the hand did not improve as quickly as hoped after the surgery.plaintiff attributed this to the following errors or neglects committed by defendants and others in the period pins and wires inserted in the hand during surgery caused infection when they were not removed within ten weeks as directed by magill prescribed physical therapy for plaintiff hand was not provided and feed up passes,issued to allow him to receive meals in his cell when he had difficulty carrying a food tray,were briefly suspended.
in february,plaintiff brought suit under against defendants and various others involved in his medical treatment at sing sing,alleging eighth amendment violations and averring that these violations caused permanent damage to his hand at the conclusion of plaintiff case,and again at the close of evidence,defendants moved pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure for judgment as a matter of law.the court reserved decision.the jury returned a verdict for hernandez that apportioned in nominal,compensatory,and punitive damages among the defendants as set out in the margin the district court declined to enter judgment pursuant to the jury verdict,and granted defendants rule motion.the court was at a loss to find any factual or credible evidence to support a finding that defendants acted with the culpable state of mind required to support a claim under the eighth amendment.hernandez ii,dist.lexis,at.having listened to the testimony of nineteen witnesses and reviewed all the evidence,the court held that the totality of the evidence,including the voluminous prison medical records submitted at trial,indisputably show ed that plaintiff was well attended,and that no defendant was deliberately indifferent to any serious medical needs of plaintiff.id.at.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court ruling granting judgment as a matter of law,wilkinson russell,cir,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to hernandez and grant ing him every reasonable inference that the jury might have drawn in his favor,samuels air transp.local,cir.
the jury role as the finder of fact does not entitle it to return a verdict based only on confusion,speculation or prejudice its verdict must be reasonably based on evidence presented at trial.goldhirsh group alpert,cir quoting michelman fiber glass,cir.accordingly,a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law must be granted where t here is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or t here is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against him.newmont mines hanover ins,cir.the district court relied on both grounds in granting judgment to all defendants.
the eighth amendment outlaws cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii.this includes punishments that involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.chance armstrong,cir quoting gregg georgia,d.while society does not expect that prisoners will have unqualified access to health care,hudson mcmillian,d,an inmate can nevertheless prevail on an eighth amendment claim arising out of medical care by showing that a prison official acted with deliberate indifference to the inmate serious medical needs.hathaway coughlin hathaway i,cir quoting estelle gamble,d.
in this appeal,the seriousness of plaintiff medical needs is undisputed the question is whether there is enough record evidence to support an inference that any defendant acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind in the treatment of those serious medical needs.see hathaway i,at.
deliberate indifference describes a mental state more blameworthy than negligence but a plaintiff is not required to show that the defendant acted for the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.farmer brennan,d citing estelle,at.deliberate indifference is a state of mind that is the equivalent of criminal recklessness.hathaway coughlin hathaway ii,cir.a showing of medical malpractice is therefore insufficient to support an eighth amendment claim unless the malpractice involves culpable recklessness,an act or a failure to act by the prison doctor that evinces a conscious disregard of a substantial risk of serious harm.chance,at quoting hathaway ii,at.
defendants were sued in their individual capacities the liability of each therefore depends on a showing that he or she acted with deliberate indifference.see wright smith,cir it is well settled in this circuit that personal involvement of defendants in alleged constitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under.quoting moffitt town of brookfield,cir see also brock wright,cir stating that plaintiff must show deliberate indifference on the part of a particular defendant.
kapoor was responsible for overseeing sing sing medical staff,including williams,kathy greiner,and halko but supervisor liability in a action depends on a showing of some personal responsibility,and can not rest on respondeat superior.see estate of rockefeller,cir.similarly,proof of linkage in the prison chain of command is insufficient.ayers coughlin,cir.absent some personal involvement by the supervisory official in the allegedly unlawful conduct of his subordinates,he can not be liable under section.gill mooney,cir.
the liability of a supervisor under can be shown in one or more of the following ways actual direct participation in the constitutional violation,failure to remedy a wrong after being informed through a report or appeal,creation of a policy or custom that sanctioned conduct amounting to a constitutional violation,or allowing such a policy or custom to continue,grossly negligent supervision of subordinates who committed a violation,or failure to act on information indicating that unconstitutional acts were occurring.see colon coughlin,cir citing wright smith,cir see also brock,at.
hernandez made no such showing as to kapoor.kapoor never examined or diagnosed plaintiff hand.and he was not directly responsible for placing medical holds on patients for scheduling treatments or procedures or for following up on issues such as physical therapy or feed up passes.there is no evidence that kapoor had notice of,instituted,or became aware of any unconstitutional policy,practice or act,or that he was grossly negligent in supervising his subordinates.
plaintiff argues that the jury could have inferred deliberate indifference from the nature and extent of the constitutional violations committed by the persons kapoor supervised,williams,kathy greiner,and halko this argument is foreclosed by our conclusion,explained below,that none of these defendants violated hernandez constitutional rights.while there are circumstances in which a supervisor could be deliberately indifferent to an inmate serious medical needs under one or another of the colon categories of supervisor liability cited above even if no single subordinate committed an act amounting to a constitutional violation,plaintiff has adduced no evidence on the basis of which a jury could so find in this case.
halko and williams 
as plaintiff primary care physician at sing sing,halko was the person most directly involved in overseeing plaintiff treatment and made many of the decisions with respect to hernandez care.williams,a physician assistant who worked closely with halko,examined plaintiff hand several times.many of the same facts bear upon the alleged deliberate indifference of williams and halko.specifically,plaintiff relies on evidence that williams and halko failed to schedule a appointment with magill between late december and early march so that hand surgery could be discussed and possibly performed failed to place a medical hold to forestall transfer to another prison while surgery was being considered failed to arrange to have the pins and wires removed from plaintiff hand within ten weeks after surgery and failed to ensure that plaintiff received prescribed physical therapy for his hand.
viewing these facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and drawing every reasonable inference in his favor,we agree with judge conti that no reasonable jury could find that either williams or halko were deliberately indifferent.the evidence as to the treatment of plaintiff hand suggests at most several acts of negligence over a prolonged period.that is not enough to support an eighth amendment violation.see farmer brennan,d hathaway ii,at.
in hathaway coughlin,on which hernandez chiefly relies,we held that a prolonged delay in treatment could support an inference of deliberate indifference.hathaway,at.in that case,however,the inmate was kept waiting two years before being evaluated for surgery to abate chronic pain in his hips and during that time his doctors withheld relevant information regarding the cause of the pain broken pins
