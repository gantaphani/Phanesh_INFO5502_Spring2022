petitioner marcus mungo appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which sought to overturn his conviction in the courts of new york for murder.petitioner contends that the admission at his trial of certain hearsay statements made by the murder victim just before his death violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.upon petitioner direct appeal from his conviction,the new york supreme court,appellate division,determined that the admission of the hearsay statements was proper under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.in judging the habeas petition,the district court concluded that this ruling was not an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law,including ohio roberts,d,and white illinois,d.the district court accordingly ruled that the state court decision satisfied the deferential standards of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,and denied the petition.while this appeal from the district court judgment was pending,the supreme court decided crawford washington,d,in a manner that reconceived much of the court confrontation clause jurisprudence.petitioner contends that under the standards established in crawford he is entitled to grant of the writ.we agree with the district court that the state court did not unreasonably apply roberts and white,and we further hold that petitioner is barred by teague lane,d,from relying on the new rule established in crawford.
background 
at approximately on the morning of june,on euclid avenue in brooklyn,new york,two plainclothes police officers,driving a police cruiser disguised as a taxicab,heard shots fired.driving toward the sound of the shots,they were flagged down by the wounded brent arthur.they saw two black men in shirts run across the street.the driver,sergeant robert delaney,asked arthur,who shot you those guys running arthur answered,yeah those guys.with arthur in the cruiser,they drove off in pursuit.the second officer,dante cavallo,asked arthur,do you know where they are going arthur responded,go to the projects,go to the projects,referring to a nearby housing project at sutter avenue.when they arrived at sutter avenue,the officers saw two black men in the driveway.one wore a gray the other a white with multicolored lettering.delaney asked arthur if the two men were his assailants.arthur answered,those are them.
cavallo,joined by other officers,pursued the men into sutter avenue and found them hiding in the doorway of a apartment.the men were later identified as petitioner marcus mungo in the gray shirt and leshawn stewart in the white shirt.no weapons were found on either man.by the time the men were brought downstairs,arthur was lying on the ground near the cruiser writhing in pain.sergeant delaney told him that an ambulance was on the way and said,listen,i going to bring over two people,bring two people over to you one at a time.you have to tell me are these the guys that shot you.officer cavallo then brought forward stewart and asked,is that the guy that shot you arthur answered,yes.cavallo then brought forward petitioner and asked,is this the guy that shot you arthur again answered,yes.cavallo then asked arthur,i need to know exactly who shot you.arthur responded,the guy in the gray.delaney asked arthur why they had shot him,and arthur stated,they tried to rob me.arthur died shortly thereafter.in officer cavallo estimation,the entire episode from the time when arthur entered the cruiser until he identified the defendant lasted only about two and to three minutes.
in statements to police the next day,petitioner admitted that until the previous evening he had lived on euclid avenue in an apartment owned by arthur.petitioner stated that he had decided to move out of the apartment the previous night and move into stewart apartment at sutter avenue.petitioner denied hearing any gunshots,but stated that while he and stewart were standing on the street,stewart had suddenly begun to run.petitioner then ran with him back to stewart apartment,whereupon they were arrested.
over objection,the trial judge admitted into evidence under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule arthur several statements tending to identify petitioner as the shooter.the jury convicted petitioner of second degree murder,and he was sentenced to a term of years to life.the appellate division affirmed,rejecting petitioner contentions relating to his hearsay objection.people mungo,app.div d dep t.leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied.people mungo,people mungo.
mungo petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under,arguing that the admission of arthur statements at trial violated his rights under the confrontation clause.the district court applied aedpa deferential standard of review and denied the petition,finding that the state court ruling was not an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.the court reasoned that the statements were properly admitted under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule,and thus,under white,were categorically immune from confrontation clause challenge.mungo duncan,d.the court,however,granted a certificate of appealability,noting the fallacy of the assumption that out of court excited utterances,as a class,should be presumed reliable without further examination of the trustworthiness of the statements.id.at.
discussion 
analysis of the petition under roberts and white.the sixth amendment to the united states constitution,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,provides,in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him in ohio roberts,the court stated that the confrontation clause was intended to exclude some hearsay,at,but that it nonetheless countenances hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule,id.at.quoting snyder massachusetts.reliability,the court said,could either be established through a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,or be inferred from the fact that the evidence fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.id.at.subsequently,in white illinois,the court recognized that spontaneous declarations which describes the same category of statements as the term excited utterances used in the courts of new within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.see at.the court therefore ruled constitutionally admissible statements by a girl made about an hour after her sexual assault,even though the girl was available and could have been required to testify.id.at.see also brown keane,cir noting that the excited utterance exception has been ruled to be firmly rooted citing lilly virginia,d.
petitioner essentially concedes that the statements challenged here fall within new york excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.see pet.reply br.at t he appellant has essentially conceded that the statements elicited from arthur by the police were excited utterances,as the courts in new york have consistently interpreted this exception.under new york rule,a n excited utterance occurs under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses,and during the brief period when considerations of could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection a period which is not measured in minutes or seconds but rather is measured by facts.people cotto,internal quotation marks omitted.
petitioner instead contends that the statements admitted here were so inherently unreliable that,despite falling within new york excited utterance exception,they should not be considered to bear the indicia of reliability generally required by roberts.see at.we can not say that it would have been unreasonable for the appellate division to reject this argument.even accepting that some statements that fall within new york excited utterance exception might be too unreliable to support the inference of reliability drawn by white for all statements within the traditional common law spontaneous declaration exception,the statements admitted here were not clearly of such a nature.in white,the court described the exception by stating that a statement that has been offered in a moment of the opportunity to reflect on the consequences of one justifiably carry more weight with a trier of fact than a similar statement offered in the relative calm of the courtroom.white,at.the court referred with apparent approval to the federal rule of evidence incorporating the exception.id.at.see also.describing an excited utterance as a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.the district court here assumed that the statement would have qualified under the federal rule,mungo,d at,and petitioner does not suggest otherwise.
petitioner argues only that i the statements were prompted by police questions,some of which were leading and ii arthur identified both stewart and petitioner as the shooter,and only specified petitioner when the police said they needed to know which of the two pulled the trigger on the other hand,as the people point out,arthur knew petitioner personally,and was thus unlikely to confuse him with someone else.furthermore,if arthur was attacked by both men acting in concert,as appears to have been the case,it was reasonable for him to describe both as having shot him,even though only one held the gun and pulled the trigger.we do not see these factors as inconsistencies casting serious doubt on the reliability of the statements.we can not say that the appellate division ruling amounted to an objectively unreasonable application of confrontation clause jurisprudence.see d williams taylor,d,for the court.
retroactive application of crawford.on march,after the district court had denied the petition for habeas corpus,and while this appeal was pending,the supreme court issued its opinion in crawford.the opinion reconceived much of the court prior confrontation clause jurisprudence in a manner that is potentially inconsistent with the court admission of some of arthur statements at trial.crawford ruled essentially that,notwithstanding the prior holdings of roberts and white,statements of a person who does not appear as a witness at trial that are of a testimonial nature may not be received against the accused to establish the truth of what was stated unless i the declarant is unavailable to testify at the trial,and ii the accused was afforded a prior opportunity to the declarant on the statement.crawford.at as the english authorities above reveal,the common law in conditioned admissibility of an absent witness examination on unavailability and a prior opportunity to.the sixth amendment therefore incorporates those limitations.the people argue that petitioner is barred from retroactively invoking crawford both by the nonretroactivity doctrine of teague lane,and by the independent nonretroactivity rule imposed by aedpa in d.petitioner contends that crawford establishes a watershed rule of criminal procedure,and that neither teague nor aedpa bars retroactive application of such a watershed rule.
nonretroactivity under teague lane and aedpa.in teague,the supreme court barred the application of new procedural rulings in the collateral review of convictions that became final before those rulings were announced.see teague,at.plurality opinion penry lynaugh,d majority opinion adopting the teague analysis 
the teague opinion,however,delineated two exceptions.the first,which is not pertinent to this controversy,is that a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places certain kinds of primary,private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal authority to proscribe.teague,at.quoting mackey united states,d harlan,concurring in part and dissenting in part the second exception is for new watershed rules of criminal procedure that are necessary to the fundamental fairness of the criminal proceeding and improve the accuracy of the criminal process.gaines kelly,cir quoting sawyer smith,d quoting teague,at.petitioner contends that the new rule of crawford is a watershed rule which falls within this exception.
a second principle of nonretroactivity with potential application to this case was created by aedpa itself.under the aedpa provision codified at d,if a state prisoner seeks habeas corpus relief on a claim that was decided on the merits by the state court,we apply the following standard 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
d.the supreme court has described this standard as mandating that federal courts decide habeas corpus petitions not with reference to the supreme court current jurisprudence,but rather with reference to the supreme court jurisprudence as of either the date of the pertinent state court adjudicat ion on the merits,or the date when the state court conviction became final see williams,at,for the court stating that the clearly established phrase in d refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision id.at.stevens,for four justices aedpa codifies teague to the extent that teague requires federal habeas courts to deny relief that is contingent upon a rule of law not clearly established at the time the state conviction became final.id.at.stevens,for the court the threshold question under aedpa is whether petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.we have also held in general terms that d bars retroactive reliance on new rules of law.see vasquez strack,cir if petitioner claim requires us to apply a rule of law that was not clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court at the time of the state court determination,section d bars relief.
because the state court adjudicated petitioner claim on the merits,d applies.the people point out that d,unlike the teague opinion,does not set forth an exception for watershed rules.they argue that,even if crawford is deemed retroactive under the teague exception,the new crawford rule can not be applied under aedpa and the petition must be denied.the question thus arises whether d nullifies teague exceptions in cases coming within the statute terms,or instead implicitly adopts them.
this poses a difficult question of statutory,and perhaps even constitutional,interpretation.teague exception to the general rule of nonretroactivity gives recognition to new rulings that purport to enhance the accuracy of the factfinding process in a manner necessary to the fundamental fairness of the criminal proceeding.gaines,at internal quotation marks omitted.the people argue that no such exception exists under the aedpa rule.according to this argument,if a state criminal conviction were obtained in a manner later determined by the supreme court to be not only unconstitutional but also incompatible with fundamental fairness and fraught with an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be convicted,teague,at.internal quotation marks omitted,the federal courts would nonetheless be compelled to reject the petition and accept the potentially inaccurate and fundamentally unfair conviction,so long as the state court had affirmed on the merits.
in any case,whether d was intended,or out of prudence should be read,to adopt the teague exceptions is a question we need not answer because we conclude that the crawford rule does not qualify as a watershed rule coming within the exception to teague.we therefore find that petitioner reliance on crawford is barred by teague itself,and an interpretation of the scope of d effect is unnecessary to the disposition of this case.
analysis under teague.teague bars petitioner from relying on a new rule of criminal procedure,unless that
