this habeas appeal,brought by a state prisoner against a massachusetts correctional official for relief from a conviction and life sentence for murder,is governed by the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.in pertinent part,the aedpa instructs that a writ of habeas corpus may issue upon a showing that the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.d.this provision lies at the epicenter of the petitioner appeal.
the petitioner first claim of error involves what is unarguably a clearly established constitutional rule when evaluating a claim of evidentiary insufficiency,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia.the petitioner asserts that,in his case,the state court recognized this rule but applied it unreasonably.
the second claim of error involves an allegation of prosecutorial inconsistency.at the petitioner trial,the commonwealth argued that he had shot and killed the victim.at an earlier trial,however,the commonwealth argued that the defendant in that case the petitioner accomplice had shot and killed the victim.the petitioner asserts that,under clearly established law,these inconsistent approaches rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and deprived him of his constitutional right to due process.
after careful consideration of this asseverational array against the backdrop of an amplitudinous record,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
background 
we touch lightly upon the factual findings of the state court,supplementing those findings when necessary with consistent record evidence.see tash roden,cir.the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail should consult the underlying opinion of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.see commonwealth housen housen i.because this appeal involves a challenge to evidentiary sufficiency,we rehearse the facts in the light most compatible with the jury verdict leftwich maloney,cir.
near midnight on april,a toyota camry stopped in front of an apartment house in brockton,massachusetts.three men got out of the car.two of them entered the building while the third pressed the front buzzer.the third man then entered the lobby,but the record is unclear as to whether he proceeded further.
fitzroy hecker and his girlfriend,kerry murphy,shared an apartment on the third floor of the building.hecker sold marijuana from the apartment.murphy was in the bedroom when she heard a voice later identified as belonging to damon cannon saying i do know,an ounce.she then heard someone with a deeper voice say either r un him or r un it.according to evidence adduced at trial,these phrases indicated that the men were robbing hecker.
murphy soon heard three gunshots in rapid succession and,after a brief pause,a fourth shot.she went to the living room and saw a man sprinting into the common hallway while cannon,with a look of shock on his face,stood still.after noticing murphy,cannon fled.he did not appear to be armed.
hecker,who had been shot twice in the neck and once in the wrist,was bleeding profusely.his gun lay on the floor near his left hand.
a neighbor heard the gunshots and then heard two people running down the stairs,saying l et go,let go.he next heard a car screeching off.a tenant likewise heard two people running down the stairs immediately after hearing the gunshots.
although first responders arrived promptly,their efforts failed to save hecker.uncontradicted medical evidence showed that his death was caused by gunshots to the neck,fired at close range.
other evidence including a dna match placed corinthian housen in the room and revealed that he had sustained a gunshot wound to his left hand.several hours after the incident,the petitioner sought treatment at an emergency room.he lied both about his identity and about the origin of his injuries.
on january,a state grand jury indicted the petitioner on charges of,inter alia,murder and attempted armed robbery.the case was tried to a jury in plymouth superior court.the commonwealth argued that the petitioner and cannon attempted to rob hecker and that,when the robbery attempt soured,the petitioner shot hecker while cannon stood frozen in time.
testifying in his own defense,the petitioner admitted that he went with cannon and a third man,leroy drane,to purchase marijuana from the victim.the petitioner asserted that hecker was standing in front of him when hecker facial expression changed and he hecker reached into the couch and retrieved a gun.at that point,the petitioner turned to flee but cannon,who was standing behind him,began firing at hecker.one of the bullets struck the petitioner hand,and he ran from the apartment.cannon and drane followed.
drane did not testify.although the petitioner placed drane in the room at the time of the murder,the neighbors accounts indicated that only two men,not three,fled from the apartment after the shooting.
the trial justice instructed the jurors that they could find the petitioner guilty of murder either as a principal or as a joint venturer under a felony murder theory.the jurors ultimately found the petitioner guilty of murder,but they did so through a general verdict without specifying whether the finding of guilt was as a principal or as a joint venturer 
following the imposition of a life sentence and other proceedings not relevant here,the sjc took up the petitioner appeal.he advanced several claims of error,including a claim of evidentiary insufficiency and a due process claim based on the commonwealth advocacy,albeit in different trials,of inconsistent theories about the identity of the shooter.the sjc turned a deaf ear to the petitioner importunings.see housen i,at.
the petitioner repaired to the federal district court and sought habeas relief.the district court denied the petition,see housen gelb housen ii,wl,at,but granted a certificate of appealability on the evidentiary sufficiency and due process issues,see c.
ii.analysis 
in this instance,the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing.consequently,we review de novo its denial of habeas relief.see lynch ficco,cir.in conducting this appraisal,we examine the petitioner two claims of error sequentially 
sufficiency of the evidence.
the supreme court opinion in jackson,at,supplies what is unarguably the clearly established federal law anent the petitioner first claim of error.the sjc implicitly employed this standard it cited one of its own prior opinions,which had adopted the holding in jackson.see housen i,d at citing commonwealth latimore.thus,we can securely reason that in scouring the record for latimore error and finding none the sjc effectively answered the federal constitutional question.leftwich,at.
the petitioner does not dispute this point but,rather,challenges the sjc application of the jackson standard.he contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on a theory of principal liability or,put another way,to show that he shot hecker 
the petitioner evidentiary sufficiency argument pivots on his assertion that the evidence did not show that only two men,rather than three,entered hecker apartment before the murder.this is important,he says,because there was no direct evidence that the petitioner pulled the trigger,and the commonwealth case for principal liability depended in material part on two facts that only the petitioner and cannon were with hecker and that cannon did not have a gun.if a third man drane was present,cannon lack of a weapon would have much less significance.
the petitioner reading of the record is overly optimistic.the record contains ample evidence to support an inference that only the petitioner and cannon were in the room with hecker at the time of the murder.murphy heard only two voices in the living room and,within a matter of seconds after hearing the shots,saw only cannon and one other man in the living room.although murphy could
