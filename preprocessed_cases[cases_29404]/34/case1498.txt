on rehearing en banc 
this appeal presents the question of whether a law enforcement officer is justified in frisking a person whom the officer has lawfully stopped and whom the officer reasonably believes to be armed,regardless of whether the person may legally be entitled to carry the firearm.stated otherwise,the question is whether the risk of danger to a law enforcement officer created by the forced stop of a person who is armed is eliminated by the fact that state law authorizes persons to obtain a permit to carry a concealed firearm.
after receiving a tip that a man in a parking lot well known for activity had just loaded a firearm and then concealed it in his pocket before getting into a car as a passenger,ranson,west virginia police stopped the car after observing that its occupants were not wearing seatbelts.reasonably believing that the car passenger,shaquille robinson,was armed,the police frisked him and uncovered the firearm,leading to his arrest for the possession of a firearm by a felon.
during his prosecution,robinson filed a motion to suppress the evidence recovered as a result of the frisk,contending that the frisk violated his fourth amendment rights.the officers,he argued,had no articulable facts demonstrating that he was dangerous since,as far as the officers knew,the state could have issued him a permit to carry a concealed firearm.after the district court denied the motion to suppress,robinson pleaded guilty to the illegal possession of a firearm,reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.
on appeal,robinson contends again that the information that police received from the tip described seemingly innocent conduct and that his conduct at the time of the traffic stop also provided no basis for officers to reach the conclusion that he was dangerous.he argues,under the logic of the district court,in any state where carrying a firearm is a perfectly legal activity,every citizen could be dangerous,and subject to a terry frisk and pat down.
we reject robinson argument and affirm,concluding that an officer who makes a lawful traffic stop and who has a reasonable suspicion that one of the automobile occupants is armed may frisk that individual for the officer protection and the safety of everyone on the scene.see pennsylvania mimms,per curiam.the fourth amendment does not require police officers to take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.terry ohio.and it is inconsequential that the person thought to be armed was a passenger.see maryland wilson.it is also inconsequential that the passenger may have had a permit to carry the concealed firearm.the danger justifying a protective frisk arises from the combination of a forced police encounter and the presence of a weapon,not from any illegality of the weapon possession.see adams williams,michigan long.
the material facts in this case are not disputed.at about on march,an unidentified man called the ranson,west virginia police department and told officer crystal tharp that he had just witnessed a black male in a bluish greenish toyota camry load a firearm and conceal it in his pocket while in the parking lot of the on north mildred street.the caller advised officer tharp that the camry was being driven by a white woman and had just left the parking lot,traveling south on north mildred street.
the on north mildred street is adjacent to the apple tree garden apartments,and the area constitutes the highest crime area in ranson.one officer who testified said that in his short one and a half years as a state trooper,he had experience with at least incidents of drug trafficking in the parking lot.another officer testified that when she was doing drug work,she dropped an informant off to buy drugs at the parking lot and observed three other people waiting for drugs in that parking lot.she added that she had personally received numerous complaints of people running between the parking lot and the apartment complex,making drug transactions.another officer testified that a nytime you hear apple tree or,your radar goes up a notch.accordingly,when the ranson police department received the tip about someone loading a gun in the parking lot,its officers radar went up a notch,and the officers went on heightened alert.
while still on the telephone with the caller,officer tharp relayed the information to officer kendall hudson and captain robbie roberts.hudson immediately left the station to respond to the call,and roberts left soon thereafter to provide backup.
when officer hudson turned onto north mildred street a short time later,he observed a toyota camry being driven by a white woman with a black male passenger.noticing that they were not wearing seatbelts,hudson effected a traffic stop approximately seven blocks,or of a mile,south of the.he estimated that the traffic stop took place two to three minutes after the call had been received at the station.
after calling in the stop,officer hudson approached the driver side of the vehicle with his weapon drawn but carried below his waist and asked the driver for her license,registration,and proof of insurance.he also asked the male passenger,the defendant robinson,for his identification but quickly realized that doing so was probably not a good idea because t his guy might have a gun,and i asking him to get into his pocket to get his instead,officer hudson asked robinson to step out of the vehicle.
at this point,captain roberts arrived and opened the front passenger door.as robinson was exiting the vehicle,captain roberts asked him if he had any weapons on him.instead of responding verbally,robinson gave roberts a weird look or,more specifically,an oh,crap look.roberts took the look to mean,i do want to lie to you,but i not going to tell you anything either.at this point,captain roberts directed robinson to put his hands on top of the car and performed a frisk for weapons,recovering a loaded gun from the front pocket of robinson pants.after conducting the frisk,roberts recognized robinson,recalled that he had previously been convicted of a felony,and arrested him.
after robinson was charged with the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon,in violation of g,he filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the firearm and ammunition seized during the frisk,arguing that the frisk violated his fourth amendment rights.
the district court denied the motion,concluding that the officers possessed reasonable suspicion to believe that robinson was armed and dangerous.relying on navarette california,the court concluded that the anonymous caller eyewitness knowledge and the contemporaneous nature of the report indicated that the tip was sufficiently reliable to contribute to the officers reasonable suspicion.the court explained that the anonymous tip that robinson had recently loaded a firearm and concealed it on his person in a public parking lot in a area,as well as robinson weird look and failure to verbally respond to the inquiry whether he was armed,gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that robinson was armed and dangerous.
robinson thereafter pleaded guilty to the firearm possession charge,reserving his right to appeal the district court denial of his suppression motion,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.robinson appealed the denial of his motion to suppress,and a panel of this court reversed the district court decision denying robinson motion to suppress and vacated his conviction and sentence.united states robinson,cir.by order dated april,we granted the government petition for rehearing en banc,which vacated the panel judgment and opinion.see cir.local c.
robinson appeal is defined as much by what he concedes as by what he challenges.robinson rightfully acknowledges that the ranson police had the right to stop the vehicle in which he was a passenger after observing a traffic violation,see whren united states,and also that they had the authority to direct him to exit the vehicle during the valid traffic stop,see wilson,at.he also correctly concedes that the anonymous tip received by the ranson police department was sufficiently reliable to justify the officers reliance on it.see navarette,at concluding that an anonymous call bore adequate indicia of reliability for the officer to credit the caller account in large part because,like here,the caller claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged conduct and the call was a contemporaneous report that was made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event.finally,and most importantly,robinson does not contest the district court conclusion that the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that he was armed.
robinson argument focuses on whether the officers could reasonably have suspected that he was dangerous.he argues that while the officers may well have had good reason to suspect that he was carrying a loaded concealed firearm,they lacked objective facts indicating that he was also dangerous,so as to justify a frisk for weapons,since an officer must reasonably suspect that the person being frisked is both armed and dangerous.see terry,at.robinson notes that at the time of the frisk,west virginia residents could lawfully carry a concealed firearm if they had received a license from the state.see.code to.and,because the police did not know whether or not he possessed such a license,the tip that a suspect matching his description was carrying a loaded firearm concealed in his pocket was,he argues,a report of innocent behavior that was not sufficient to indicate that he posed a danger to others.moreover,he argues,his behavior during the stop did not create suspicion he was compliant,cooperative,and not displaying signs of nervousness.in these circumstances,he concludes,the officer frisk was not justified by any reasonable suspicion that he was dangerous.
robinson argument presumes that the legal possession of a firearm can not pose a danger to police officers during a forced stop,and it collapses the requirements for making a stop with the requirements for conducting a frisk.it thus fails at several levels when considered under the supreme court stop jurisprudence.first,robinson confuses the standard for making stops which requires a reasonable suspicion that a crime or other infraction has been or is being committed with the standard for conducting a frisk which requires both a lawful investigatory stop and a reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.see arizona johnson.second,he fails to recognize that traffic stops alone are inherently dangerous for police officers.third,he also fails to recognize that traffic stops of persons who are armed,whether legally or illegally,pose yet a greater safety risk to police officers.and fourth,he argues illogically that when a person forcefully stopped may be legally permitted to possess a firearm,any risk of danger to police officers posed by the firearm is eliminated.
we begin by noting that the supreme court has repeatedly recognized that whenever police officers use their authority to effect a stop,they subject themselves to a risk of harm.this holds true whether the temporary detention is a traditional,terry stop to investigate an officer reasonable suspicion that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense,johnson,at,or a stop of a motor vehicle and all of its occupants to enforce a jurisdiction traffic laws,id.at.the supreme court has explained that the risk of a violent encounter in a setting stems not from the ordinary reaction of a motorist stopped for a speeding violation,but from the fact that evidence of a more serious crime might be uncovered during the stop.id.at quoting wilson,at see also mimms,at rejecting the argument that traffic violations necessarily involve less danger to officers than other types of confrontations.indeed,the court has concluded that traffic stops are especially fraught with danger to police officers.long,at.and the court has also observed that when the stop involves one or more passengers,that fact increases the possible sources of harm to the officer,wilson,at,as the motivation of a passenger to employ violence is every bit as great as that of the driver,id.at.
in wilson,the court observed that i n alone,there were officer assaults and officers killed during traffic pursuits and stops,at,prompting the court to conclude that the public interest in police officer safety during traffic stops is both legitimate and weighty,id.at quoting mimms,at.and more recent statistics,unfortunately,remain as grim.of the law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty in,officers or were fatally injured during traffic pursuits or stops.fbi,officers feloniously killed,in uniform crime reports law enforcement officers killed and assaulted.
to be clear,the general risk that is inherent during a traffic stop does not,without more,justify a frisk of the automobile occupants.but the risk inherent in all traffic stops is heightened exponentially when the person who has been stopped a person whose propensities are unknown is armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against the officer in a matter of seconds.terry,at.as such,when the officer reasonably suspects that the person he has stopped is armed,the officer is warranted in the belief that his safety is in danger,id.at,thus justifying a terry frisk.
in terry,officer mcfadden seized terry on the street and subjected him to a search without probable cause to believe that he had committed or was committing a crime or that he was armed.at.the court was thus confronted with two distinct constitutional issues first,whether a person could be stopped seized on suspicion of criminal conduct that fell short of probable cause and second,whether the officer could conduct a protective frisk or pat down for weapons search during the stop.the court readily concluded that terry seizure was reasonable under the fourth amendment because the officer reasonably believed that criminal conduct was afoot.id.at.the court then turned its attention to the legality of the frisk,stating,we are now concerned with more than the governmental interest in investigating crime in addition,there is the more immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.id.at.the concern,the danger was thus found in the presence of a weapon during a forced police encounter.indeed,the court said as much,noting in approving officer mcfadden frisk of terry that a reasonably prudent man would have been warranted in believing petitioner was armed and thus presented a threat to the officer safety.id.at emphasis added.in this manner,the court adopted the now standard that an officer can frisk a validly stopped person if the officer reasonably believes that the person is armed and dangerous.id.at see also id.at harlan,concurring explaining that because a frisk is justified in order to protect the officer during an encounter with a citizen,the officer must first have constitutional grounds to insist on an encounter,to make a forcible stop.
the supreme court applied terry to circumstances analogous to those before us in mimms,where an officer,after making a routine traffic stop,noticed a large bulge under the defendant jacket and therefore conducted a frisk.at.holding that the frisk was clearly justified,the mimms court explained that t he bulge in the jacket permitted the officer to conclude that mimms was armed and thus posed a serious and present danger to the safety of the officer,adding that i n these circumstances,any man of reasonable caution would likely have conducted the pat down.id.at emphasis added.the only evidence of mimms dangerousness was the bulge indicating that he was armed.see id.it was thus mimms status of being armed during a forced police encounter the traffic stop that posed the danger justifying the frisk,and we have previously relied on mimms for that precise principle.see united states baker,cir.citing mimms,at based on the inordinate risk of danger to law enforcement officers during traffic stops,observing a bulge that could be made by a weapon in a suspect clothing reasonably warrants a belief that the suspect is potentially dangerous,even if the suspect was stopped only for a minor violation.
in short,established supreme court law imposes two requirements for conducting a frisk,but no more than two first,that the officer have conducted a lawful stop,which includes both a traditional terry stop as well as a traffic stop and second,that during the valid but forced encounter,the officer reasonably suspect that the person is armed and therefore dangerous.in both terry and mimms,the court deliberately linked armed and dangerous,recognizing that the frisks in those cases were lawful because the stops were valid and the officer reasonably believed that the person stopped was armed and thus dangerous.terry,at emphasis added mimms,at emphasis added.the use of and thus recognizes that the risk of danger is created simply because the person,who was forcibly stopped,is armed.
in this case,both requirements a lawful stop and a reasonable suspicion that robinson was armed were satisfied,thus justifying captain roberts frisk under the fourth amendment as a matter of law.
robinson argues that mimms is distinguishable because the frisk there took place in a jurisdiction that made it a crime to carry a concealed deadly weapon.west virginia,on the other hand,generally permits its citizens to carry firearms.from this distinction,robinson argues that when the person forcibly stopped may be legally permitted to possess a firearm,the risk of danger posed by the firearm is eliminated.this argument,however,fails under the supreme court express recognition that the legality of the frisk does not depend on the illegality of the firearm possession.indeed,the court has twice explained that t he purpose of this limited search,the frisk is not to discover evidence of crime,but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence,and thus the frisk for weapons might be equally necessary and reasonable,whether or not carrying a concealed weapon violated any applicable state law.williams,at emphasis added see also long,at w e have expressly rejected the view that the validity of a terry search,a frisk depends on whether the weapon is possessed in accordance with state law.robinson position directly conflicts with these observations.
notwithstanding the supreme court statements,robinson position also fails as a matter of logic to recognize that the risk inherent in a forced stop of a person who is armed exists even when the firearm is legally possessed.the presumptive lawfulness of an individual gun possession in a particular state does next to nothing to negate the reasonable concern an officer has for his own safety when forcing an encounter with an individual who is armed with a gun and whose propensities are unknown.see united states rodriguez,cir.concluding that an officer making a lawful investigatory stop must have the ability to protect himself from an armed suspect whose propensities are unknown and therefore rejecting the defendant argument that the officer had no reason to believe he was dangerous even though the officer had seen a handgun tucked into the waistband of his pants.
accordingly,we conclude that given robinson concession that he was lawfully stopped and that the police officers had reasonable suspicion to believe that he was armed,the officers were,as a matter of law,justified in frisking him and,in doing so,did not violate robinson fourth amendment rights.
while the lawful traffic stop of robinson and the reasonable suspicion that he was armed justified the frisk in this case,the officers had knowledge of additional facts that increased the level of their suspicion that robinson was dangerous.
first,the reliable tip in this case was not just that an individual matching robinson description possessed a firearm.rather,the caller reported that he had observed an individual load a firearm and conceal it in his pocket while in the parking lot of the on north mildred street,a location that the officers knew to be a popular spot for activity.four officers testified about the high level of and other criminal activity in that particular parking lot,prompting one to explain,a nytime you hear,your radar goes up a notch.knowing that the parking lot was frequently used as a site for drug trafficking,a reasonable officer could legitimately suspect that an individual who was seen both loading and concealing a firearm in that very parking lot may well have been doing so in connection with activity,making his possession of a firearm even more dangerous.see united states lomax,cir.recognizing the numerous ways in which a firearm might further or advance drug trafficking.
second,when captain roberts asked robinson,as he was getting out of the car,whether he was carrying any firearms,robinson failed to respond verbally and instead gave the officer an oh,crap look,which roberts took to mean,i do want to lie to you,but i not going to tell you anything either.surely,robinson evasive response further heightened captain roberts legitimate concern as to the dangerousness of the situation.
while not necessary to the conclusion in this case,these facts can only confirm captain roberts reasonable suspicion that robinson was dangerous and therefore should be frisked for the protection of the officer and all others present.indeed,in light of all of the circumstances known to captain roberts,he would unquestionably have been criticized for not conducting a frisk if,after having failed to do so,something untoward had happened.
the judgment of the district court is accordingly 
defendant shaquille robinson concedes that law enforcement officers reasonably suspected that he was carrying a firearm defendant further concedes that the law enforcement officers lawfully stopped him for an unrelated,albeit pretextual,reason.i agree with the majority that these facts alone allowed the officers to perform a protective frisk of defendant during the stop.
in reaching this conclusion,the majority frames this case as a case involving a traffic stop in which we must assess whether law enforcement officers had reasonable suspicion to frisk defendant based on the facts known to the officers at the time they conducted the frisk.to that end,the majority focuses on the dangers law enforcement officers face in conducting lawful stops,particularly traffic stops,and the officers reasonable suspicion that defendant had a weapon.
but this case is not about traffic stops or weapons it is about firearms and the danger they pose to law enforcement officers.in particular,this case arises from the defendant presumptively lawful activity of carrying a firearm,which became the basis for making a pretextual,albeit lawful,stop for not wearing a seatbelt.from these remarkable facts,the majority opinion reduces the issue in this case to whether the officers justifiably frisked defendant,after a lawful stop,because they had a tip that defendant carried a weapon.
by focusing on the officers justification rather than defendant presumptively lawful decision to carry a majority elides discussion of the two key issues in this case whether individuals who carry firearms lawfully or unlawfully pose a categorical risk of danger to others and police officers,in particular,and whether individuals who choose to carry firearms forego certain constitutional protections afforded to individuals who elect not to carry firearms.as explained in more detail below,the majority opinion attempt to duck these questions is futile because its conclusion necessarily answers yes to both questions.
first,the majority opinion altogether avoids addressing the first issue whether individuals who carry firearms lawfully or unlawfully pose a categorical risk of danger to others by reinterpreting the supreme court test for determining whether law enforcement officers lawfully performed a protective frisk.under that test,the question is whether the officers had reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.arizona johnson.instead of according dangerous an independent meaning,the majority contends that armed and dangerous is a unitary concept if law enforcement officers reasonably suspect a detainee is armed,they necessarily reasonably suspect he is dangerous.ante at t he risk of the danger is created simply because the person,who was forcibly stopped,is armed.i disagree with the majority opinion contention that armed and dangerous is a unitary concept.
to be sure,from the outset,stripping dangerous of independent meaning violates the principle that elements separated by a conjunctive should be interpreted as distinct requirements.see,crooks harrelson,am.paper inst,cir.that is why other circuits have held that law enforcement officers must reasonably suspect a detainee is both armed and a danger to the safety of officers or others before conducting a frisk.united states leo,cir.emphasis added northrup city of toledo police dep t,cir.clearly established law required the officer to point to evidence that the subject may have been armed and dangerous.yet all he ever saw was that the subject was armed and legally so.emphasis in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the view of the other circuits on according dangerous an independent meaning makes sense because the majority opinion unitary meaning interpretation would allow law enforcement officers to frisk a wide swath of lawfully stopped individuals engaging in harmless activity.indeed,by definition,an individual is armed if he is e quipped with a weapon.armed,black law dictionary ed.
to illustrate the absurdity of the majority opinion unitary meaning interpretation,consider,for example,that courts have found a bottle to be a weapon.see united states daulton,cir.courts have held that a wine bottle can be a dangerous weapon.under the majority unitary meaning interpretation,officers informed that an individual was leaving a convenience store armed with a bottle of wine could,after a lawful stop,frisk that individual because,in the majority words,the risk of the danger is created simply because the person,who was forcibly stopped,is armed.ante at.
as justice brennan noted,numerous everyday objects turn into weapons when put to appropriate use 
a weapon could include a brick,a baseball bat,a hammer,a broken bottle,a fishing knife,barbed wire,a knitting needle,a sharpened pencil,a riding crop,a jagged can,rope,a screw driver,an ice pick,a tire iron,garden shears,a pitch fork,a shovel,a length of chain,a penknife,a fork,metal pipe,a stick.the foregoing only illustrate the variety of lawful objects which are often innocently possessed without wrongful intent.
wright new jersey,brennan,dissenting from dismissal for want of substantial federal question.under the majority opinion unitary meaning interpretation,reasonable suspicion that an individual possessed any of these items would give rise to reasonable suspicion to frisk the individual,after a lawful stop,even absent any evidence the individual intended to use the object as a weapon.the fourth amendment does not contemplate giving law enforcement officers such authority to engage in warrantless frisks of detainees.see,city of los angeles patel,holding that courts must not interpret the fourth amendment in a way that allows the narrow exception s to the warrant requirement to swallow the rule united states wilson,cir.refusing to allow limited terry exception to swallow the rule.
the majority nonetheless contends that the supreme court deliberately linked armed and dangerous in terry ohio,and pennsylvania mimms,per curiam,by approving frisks because the officers reasonably believed that the person stopped was armed and thus dangerous.ante at quoting terry,at mimms,at.but when the supreme court has elaborated on the test for a lawful frisk,it has highlighted the independent role of dangerousness,holding that terry authorizes a frisk of an automobile when law enforcement officers reasonably suspect that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.michigan long.
how then do we reconcile the language in terry and mimms,upon which the majority relies,with long and the plain language of the test,which requires that officers reasonably suspect an individual is both armed and dangerous the answer plainly lies in the type of weapon at issue.
in long,the officers reasonably suspected that the defendant had a knife.at.by contrast,in terry and mimms,the officers reasonably suspected the detainees had firearms.terry,at mimms,at.accordingly,terry and mimms collapse the armed and dangerous test into a single inquiry only when law enforcement officers reasonably suspect that a detainee has a firearm or other inherently dangerous weapon.such a reading ensures that the armed and dangerous prongs retain distinct meaning and places meaningful restrictions on law enforcement officers ability to frisk lawfully stopped individuals.
but the majority opinion also contends that we should collapse the armed and dangerous test into a single of the type of weapon with which the detainee is armed because the combination of a forcible stop and an armed detainee poses a risk of danger.ante at t he risk of danger is created simply because the person,who was forcibly stopped,is armed.yet committing a minor traffic violation a seatbelt violation here provides no basis to believe an individual poses any special danger warranting departure from the rule that law enforcement officers may not,as a general matter,frisk lawfully detained individuals.likewise,as explained above,given the numerous objects that can constitute weapons,being armed does not,by itself,establish that an individual poses a danger.rather,what the majority opinion skillfully avoids is that the risk of danger to the officers arose from the officers reasonable suspicion defendant was carrying a firearm.
confronting the inescapable reality that individuals armed with firearms are categorically dangerous reflects the heightened danger posed by firearms.to that end,the supreme court has held that a gun is an article that is typically and characteristically dangerous the use for which it is manufactured and sold is a dangerous one,and the law reasonably may presume that such an article is always dangerous.mclaughlin united states.this court also has recognized the substantial risk of danger and the inherently violent nature of firearms,pelissero thompson,cir.quotation omitted,as have other circuits,united states copening,cir.characterizing a loaded gun as by any measure an inherently dangerous weapon love tippy,cir.recognizing the inherently violent nature of firearms,and the danger firearms pose to all members of society united states allah,cir.f irearms are inherently dangerous devices.
indeed,the supreme court decision in district of columbia heller which first recognized the individual right to carry firearms is premised on the dangerousness of carrying firearms.in particular,heller held that the second amendment affords individuals the right to keep and use handguns for the defense and protection of one home and family for example,to ward off attacker s or threaten burglar s,emphasis added.if a lawfully possessed firearm did not pose a danger to attackers,burglars,or other threatening individuals,there would be no need for individuals to own and carry firearms for protection.
and the widespread judicial recognition of the inherent dangerousness of firearms accords with the evidence.the department of justice reported that in,the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are available,a total of fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with afirearm.michael planty jennifer truman,dep t of justice,bureau of justice,special report firearm violence,at may.likewise,firearms are a leading cause of death in the united states and have been for many years.jonathan selkowitz,comment,guns,public nuisance,and the plcaa a public legal analysis of the predicate exception,temp,see also centers for disease control prevention,ctr.for health,underlying cause of death on cdc wonder online database,queried on,reporting that there were intentional firearms deaths between and.accordingly,as a matter of law and fact,firearms and therefore individuals who choose to carry firearms are inherently dangerous.
in sum,individuals who carry firearms lawfully or unlawfully pose a risk of danger to themselves,law enforcement officers,and the public at large.accordingly,law enforcement officers may frisk lawfully stopped individuals whom the officers reasonably suspect are carrying a firearm because a detainee possession of a firearm poses a categorical danger to the officers.
having determined that individuals who are armed with a firearm are categorically dangerous,we confront the second issue whether individuals who choose to carry firearms sacrifice certain constitutional protections afforded to individuals who elect not to carry firearms.we must confront this issue because treating individuals armed with or unlawfully as categorically dangerous places special burdens on such individuals.today we recognize one such burden individuals who carry firearms elect to subject themselves to being frisked when lawfully stopped by law enforcement officers.
i see no basis nor does the majority opinion provide limiting our conclusion that individuals who choose to carry firearms are categorically dangerous to the terry frisk inquiry.accordingly,the majority decision today necessarily leads to the conclusion that individuals who elect to carry firearms forego other constitutional rights,like the fourth amendment right to have law enforcement officers before forcibly entering homes.see richards wisconsin,in order to justify a entry,the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence,under the particular circumstances,would be dangerous or futile.emphasis added.likewise,it is difficult to escape the conclusion that individuals who choose to carry firearms necessarily face greater restriction on their concurrent exercise of other constitutional rights,like those protected by the first amendment.see schenck united states,holmes,the question in every freedom of speech case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that congress has a right to prevent.emphasis added.
the supreme court has long recognized that t he promotion of safety of persons and property is unquestionably at the core of the state police power,kelley johnson,and the structure and limitations of federalism allow the states great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,limbs,health,comfort,and quiet of all persons,gonzales oregon.thus,like most rights,the right protected by the second amendment which defendant conduct may or may not implicate is not unlimited and therefore does not amount to a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.heller,at.in particular,today majority opinion necessarily recognizes that the limitations on the right to carry firearms derive not only from the language of the second amendment as heller recognized but also from other provisions in the constitution,which protect law enforcement officers and the public at large from individuals who elect to engage in dangerous activities,like the carrying of firearms.
in sum,because the carrying of a firearm poses a categorical danger to others in this case,law enforcement officers the law enforcement officers lawfully frisked defendant,after lawfully detaining him,based on information that he carried a firearm.accordingly,i concur in the majority opinion decision to affirm defendant convictions.
in many jurisdictions and for many years,police officers could assume that anyone carrying a concealed firearm was up to no good.because public possession of guns was prohibited or tightly regulated,concealed firearms were hallmarks of criminal activity,deadly weapons carried by to facilitate their crimes.so it followed,without much need for elaboration,that if a suspect legally stopped by the police was carrying a gun,then he was not only armed but also dangerous,justifying a protective frisk under terry ohio.
but that is no longer the case,at least in states like west virginia.today in west virginia,citizens are legally entitled to arm themselves in public,and there is no reason to think that a person carrying or concealing a weapon during a traffic stop conduct fully sanctioned by state law is anything but a citizen who poses no threat to the authorities.and as behavior once the province of becomes commonplace and a matter of legal right,we no longer may take for granted the same correlation between armed and dangerous.
the majority disagrees,adopting a rule that any citizen availing him or herself of the legal right to carry arms in public is per se dangerous under the terry formulation and therefore subject to frisk and disarmament,at police discretion,if stopped for a traffic violation or some other minor infraction.it may be,as the concurring opinion suggests,that this is where we will end up that the price for exercising the right to bear arms will be the forfeiture of certain fourth amendment protections.conc.op.at.but unless and until the supreme court takes us there,i can not endorse a rule that puts us on a collision course with rights to gun possession rooted in the second amendment and conferred by state legislatures.nor would i adopt a rule that leaves to unbridled police discretion the decision as to which legally armed citizens will be targeted for frisks,opening the door to the very abuses the fourth amendment is designed to prevent.i must respectfully dissent.
a s public possession and display of firearms become lawful under more circumstances,fourth amendment jurisprudence and police practices must adapt.united states williams,cir.hamilton,concurring.within the last decade,federal constitutional law has recognized new second amendment protections for individual possession of firearms,see mcdonald city of chicago,district of columbia heller,and state law has followed,providing expanded rights to carry guns in public,see williams,at.that states have elected to trust their citizens to carry guns safely can not,of course,change federal fourth amendment law.but it does change the facts on the ground to which fourth amendment standards apply.and once it no longer is the case that the public carry of guns is illegal or even unusual,courts must take into account that changed circumstance in applying the familiar terry standard.
we have recognized as much already when it comes to the stop portion of a terry stop and frisk,justified on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.see terry,at arizona johnson.in jurisdictions in which the public carry of firearms is prohibited or closely regulated,a concealed gun is indicative of criminal activity and may give rise to reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify an investigative stop.but when a state elects to legalize the public carry of firearms,we have held,the fourth amendment equation changes,and public possession of a gun is no longer suspicious in a way that would authorize a terry stop.united states black,cir.permitting such a justification for a terry stop,we explained,would eviscerate fourth amendment protections for lawfully armed individuals in those states.id.at.
we are not alone in this insight.in northrup city of toledo police dep t,cir,for instance,the sixth circuit held that where state law permits the open carry of firearms,the police are not authorized by terry to conduct a stop or an attendant frisk of a person brandishing a gun in public.where the state legislature has decided its citizens may be entrusted with firearms on public streets,the court reasoned,the police have no authority to disregard this decision by subjecting citizens to terry stops and frisks.id.at see also,united states leo,cir.rejecting frisk and search of backpack on suspicion that it contains gun in light of important developments in second amendment law together with wisconsin gun laws united states ubiles,cir.invalidating terry stop based on suspicion of gun possession in jurisdiction.
in my view,the same reasoning compels the conclusion that in a state like west virginia,which broadly allows public possession of firearms,reasonable suspicion that a person is armed does not by itself give rise to reasonable suspicion that the person also is dangerous,so as to justify a terry frisk.guns,of course,are in some sense intrinsically dangerous.but the question under terry is whether a person carrying a gun is a danger to the police or others.terry,at.and where the state legislature has decided that its citizens may be entrusted to safely carry firearms on public streets and during traffic stops,and citizens have availed themselves of these rights,i do not see how we can presume that every one of those citizens necessarily poses a danger to the police.see northrup,at absent reasonable suspicion that an armed man is dangerous,officers must trust their state approach to gun licensure and gun possession.
to be clear as officer tharp testified at the suppression hearing,none of the conduct reported in the anonymous tip she received that an man had loaded a gun in the parking lot of a and then concealed it in his pocket before leaving in a car was illegal under west virginia law.nor was there any testimony from the officers that the reported conduct was unusual,or out of place where it occurred.united states arvizu,conduct that appears innocuous in one setting but is unusual in another may give rise to reasonable suspicion in terms of robinson behavior,the officers knew nothing except that robinson was engaging in what we must treat as a presumptively lawful exercise of his right to carry a concealed weapon.see black,at police may not proceed on assumption that gun displayed in jurisdiction may be illegally possessed by convicted felon see also northrup,at same.if that by itself is enough to make a person dangerous for terry purposes,then the legal right to carry arms in public is perfectly the moment a person exercises that right and has the misfortune to be stopped for a traffic violation or other minor infraction he opens himself up to being frisked and disarmed,at least temporarily,by law enforcement officers.
the majority insists that this result,putting at fourth amendment and gun possession rights,is compelled by the supreme court holdings in terry ohio,at,and pennsylvania mimms,per curiam.according to the majority,those cases establish that if the police have reasonable suspicion that a suspect is armed,then they necessarily have reasonable suspicion that he is dangerous,as well,justifying a frisk under terry armed and dangerous standard.in other words,when the supreme court says armed and dangerous,what it really means is armed and therefore dangerous,op.at or,put more simply,armed.
but the supreme court for decades has adhered to its conjunctive armed and dangerous formulation,giving no indication that dangerous may be read out of the equation as an expendable redundancy.see michigan long,approving terry frisk of automobile on reasonable suspicion that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons emphasis added.indeed,until its latest filing before our en banc court,the government itself understood armed and dangerous as separate and independent conditions of a lawful terry frisk.see gov t br.at.and other courts applying terry in precisely this context against a backdrop of state laws that routinely permit the public possession of firearms have taken the same position,holding that a terry frisk requires reasonable suspicion that a person is both armed and a danger to the safety of officers or others.leo,at see northrup,at clearly established law required the officer to point to evidence that the suspect may have been armed and dangerous.yet all he ever saw was that the suspect was armed and legally so.emphasis in original citation omitted.
it is true,as the majority argues,that the court in terry and mimms was prepared to infer danger from the presence of a concealed firearm.terry,at mimms,at.but that simply brings us back to our starting point that in jurisdictions where public possession or concealed carry of guns is illegal,as in terry,see northrup,at,or tightly regulated,as in mimms there is precious little space between armed and dangerous not only because someone carrying a gun probably is breaking the law already,but also because he likely is inclined to commit other crimes with the assistance of the gun.nobody including robinson doubts that as in mimms and terry,a presumptively illegal concealed gun gives rise to a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness,allowing the police to conduct a protective frisk.but those cases simply do not speak to the very different circumstances presented when public gun possession is presumptively legal,see black,at,and there no longer is reason to believe that a person carrying a gun during a traffic stop is anything but a perfectly citizen.
nor,contrary to the majority analysis,op.at,does adams williams,resolve this issue.adams does make clear,as the majority emphasizes,that even a lawfully possessed firearm can pose a threat to officer safety.at.but that point is of limited use here,because nobody is disputing it.robinson argument is not,as the majority would have it,op.at,that any risk of danger posed by a firearm necessarily is eliminated if the firearm is legally possessed.where,as in adams,an armed man suspected of drug offenses is sitting alone in a parked car at and unwilling to cooperate with the police,everyone agrees that the circumstances give rise to a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness regardless of the legal status of the gun.see at.but the question in this case is different not whether a presumptively lawful gun may give rise to a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness under certain circumstances,but whether it necessarily and automatically does so in every circumstance.on that question,adams has nothing to say 
the problems with treating armed and dangerous as a unitary concept,see conc.op.at,go beyond the mismatch with precedent.as the concurring opinion cogently explains,the logic of terry frisk doctrine is premised on an independent role for dangerousness whether a person in possession of,say,a screwdriver is deemed armed under terry depends entirely on whether there is separate reason to believe he or she also is dangerous and thus might use that screwdriver as a weapon.see conc.op.at united states matchett,cir.upholding terry frisk of burglary suspect because burglars frequently are armed with tools like screwdrivers.
and though it purports to rely on a equation of guns with danger,the majority approach can embrace that connection only very selectively an armed citizen in an jurisdiction necessarily poses a danger to the police that justifies a protective frisk if and only if he appears to have committed some offense,however trivial like the seatbelt violation here leading to a valid stop.see op.at.if,on the other hand,the police in this case had initiated a consensual encounter with robinson in the parking lot,then the gun robinson was suspected of carrying would not have been grounds for a frisk,as the government conceded at oral argument.likewise,had robinson exited the car in which he was a passenger before the police could conduct their pretextual traffic stop,then again he would no longer be dangerous for purposes of allowing a terry frisk,notwithstanding the concealed gun in his pocket.to be sure,as the majority explains,op.at,terry doctrine requires that a frisk be attendant to a lawful stop.but if armed may be conflated with dangerous under terry,then it is hard to see why an officer right to protect him or herself would be made to turn on whether a dangerous person carrying a gun has remembered to fasten his seatbelt.
most important,by equating armed with dangerous even in states where the carrying of guns is widely permitted,the majority rule has the effect of depriving countless citizens of what otherwise would be their fourth amendment and other constitutional rights.as the concurring opinion explains,the upshot of the majority approach is that citizens who avail themselves of their legal right to carry firearms will be subject to a wide range of special burdens,the full extent of which we only can begin to discern.conc.op.at.certainly,such citizens may be frisked and temporarily disarmed when stopped,even for the most minor of infractions if they necessarily are dangerous,then the police should be free to dispense with fourth amendment knock protections before entering their homes and when armed and therefore dangerous citizens seek to assemble in public,their first amendment rights may be restricted based on the risk they are conclusively presumed to pose to public safety.see id.at.to the concurring opinion list,i would add one more if a police officer reasonably believes that a suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,he may use deadly force to protect himself,see,cooper sheehan,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,and while we have held in the past that the presence of a gun alone does not constitute a threat,or establish that a suspect is dangerous to an officer,pena porter,app x,cir.unpublished,today decision insisting on a conclusive link between armed and dangerous undoubtedly will have implications for police use of force,as well.those consequences and others that surely will follow are profound,both practically and constitutionally,and i would not be so quick to invite them without some direction from the supreme court.
but my biggest concern is that these special burdens most relevantly,the terry frisks at issue here will not be distributed evenly across the population.allowing police officers making stops to frisk anyone thought to be armed,in a state where the carrying of guns is widely permitted,creates a serious and recurring threat to the privacy of countless individuals,arizona gant,police may not search a car whenever an individual is caught committing a traffic offense.and,critically,it gives police officers unbridled discretion to decide which of those legally armed citizens will be targeted for frisks,implicating concerns about the abuse of police discretion that are fundamental to the fourth amendment.see black,at.as judge hamilton warned in williams,once a state legalizes the public possession of firearms,unchecked police discretion to single out anyone carrying a gun gives rise to the potential for intentional or unintentional discrimination based on neighborhood,class,race,or ethnicity.at see also utah strieff,sotomayor,dissenting it is no secret that people of color are disproportionate victims of special police scrutiny.
the government assures that we need not worry about these possible disproportionate effects because a terry frisk may be conducted only after a stop on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity an objective standard that prevents police stops on hunches alone.pet for reh g en banc at.but that simply is not so,and to understand why not,we need look no further than the facts of this very case.robinson was not stopped for criminal activity,at least as that term generally is understood.as a legal matter,he was stopped because officer hudson observed a seatbelt violation the kind of minor and routine traffic infraction that does next to nothing to narrow the class of legally armed citizens who may be subjected to a frisk at police discretion.and in reality,as officer hudson candidly testified at the suppression hearing,robinson was stopped so that the police could investigate the tip they had received about a black male carrying a concealed firearm.though robinson gun possession was presumptively lawful in light of west virginia generous laws,see black,at,that is,robinson was stopped precisely because the police had a hunch that his possession in fact might be unlawful.
it is true,as the government argues,that under whren united states,the fourth amendment permits this kind of pretextual traffic stop,undertaken in order to explore some unsupported hunch.but that is exactly the problem in light of whren,the requirement that a valid stop precede a terry frisk imposes no meaningful limit at all on police discretion.if the police in a jurisdiction want to target a particular armed citizen for an exploratory frisk,then they need do no more than wait and watch for a moving violation,as in this case or a parking violation,see united states johnson,cir.hamilton,dissenting describing pretextual stop for parking while black reh g en banc granted,opinion vacated,or,for the pedestrians among us,a jaywalking infraction,as the government helpfully explained at oral argument and then make a pretextual stop.
and we should be clear about the degree to which that pretextual stop may be leveraged into a and intrusive investigation.strieff,at sotomayor,dissenting although many americans have been stopped for speeding or jaywalking,few may realize how degrading a stop can be when the officer is looking for more.first,of course,is the frisk itself,euphemistically described as a but recognized,since terry,as a serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person that may extend to a thorough touching of sensitive and private areas of the body.id.at terry,at.and under michigan long,reasonable suspicion that the subject of a vehicular stop is armed and dangerous may authorize not only a frisk of the suspect person but also a frisk of the passenger compartment of the car.so with possession of a firearm in a state now enough to generate a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness,pretextual stops will allow police officers to target gun owners not only for intrusive frisks but also limited car searches,at police discretion and on the basis of nothing more than a minor infraction.that is effectively the same result that the supreme court found unacceptable in gant,at forbidding car searches incident to arrest for minor traffic violations,and it should be no more acceptable here,where a right of constitutional dimension the right to bear arms is in the balance.
i recognize the serious concerns for officer safety that underlie the terry frisk doctrine and the majority opinion.those concerns,as the majority points out,op.at,may be especially pronounced during traffic stops,see,mimms,at though,of course,the majority rule is not limited to the context of traffic stops.and i do not doubt that recent legal developments regarding gun possession have made the work of the police more dangerous as well as more difficult.see williams,at.
in my view,states have every right to address these pressing safety concerns with generally applicable and evenhanded laws imposing modest burdens on all citizens who choose to arm themselves in public.for instance,many states though not west virginia seek to reconcile police safety and a right to public carry through duty to inform laws,requiring any individual carrying a weapon to so inform the police whenever he or she is stopped or in response to police queries and if a person fails to disclose a suspected weapon to the police as required by state law,then that failure itself may give rise to a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness,justifying a protective frisk.
west virginia,however,has taken a different approach,permitting concealed carry without the need for disclosure or temporary disarmament during traffic stops.for the reasons described above,i do not believe we may deem inherently dangerous any west virginia citizen stopped for a routine traffic violation,on the sole ground that he is thought to have availed himself fully of those rights to gun possession.nor,in my view,does the fourth amendment allow for a regime in which the safety risks of a policy like west virginia are mitigated by selective and discretionary police and frisks of certain legally armed citizens,by way of pretextual stops or otherwise.delaware prouse,invalidating discretionary of drivers for licenses and registrations in furtherance of roadway safety.absent some specific,articulable suspicion of danger in a particular case,see united states sakyi,cir,west virginia citizens,including its police officers,must trust their state considered judgment that the benefits of its approach to public gun possession outweigh the risks.see northrup,at.
the majority rule is and broad any citizen carrying a gun in a jurisdiction is armed and also per se dangerous under terry,regardless of surrounding circumstances.op.at.the majority goes on,however,to consider the particular facts surrounding robinson stop,and concludes that they confirm a reasonable suspicion of dangerousness.id.at.though thi
