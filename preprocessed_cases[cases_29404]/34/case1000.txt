defendant paul ryan douglas appeals from an amended judgment,entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a jury trial before colleen mcmahon,judge,convicting him of killing a person in connection with an attempt to enter a bank with intent to commit a crime therein,in violation of a and e,and sentencing him principally to a mandatory term of life imprisonment and ordering him to pay in restitution.on appeal,douglas contends principally that,because a e offense may be punished by death,he was entitled to representation by two attorneys,see,and the district court erred in dismissing one of his two appointed attorneys after the government stated that it would not seek the death penalty that the government engaged in impermissible discrimination in the use of a peremptory challenge during jury selection that there were various errors in connection with the eyewitness identification evidence admitted against him and that evidence obtained in violation of his privilege against should not have been admitted in evidence in the government rebuttal case.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
the present prosecution arose out of an attempted theft from automated teller machines atms at a branch of citibank,located in a building on central park avenue in yonkers,new york the yonkers atms,during which an atm technician was killed.douglas was tried on a superseding indictment that charged him with attempting to enter a bank facility with intent to commit larceny therein,in violation of a count one,and killing a person in connection with that attempt,in violation of a and e count two.we summarize the evidence as to the robbery attempt,as well as the evidence as to douglas ensuing flight and statements,in the light most favorable to the government.
a.the government direct case 
in,citibank atms were serviced by brink,brink,which periodically replenished the machines with cash.from late through,douglas was an employee of brink.part of his job had been to fill the yonkers atms with to in cash on thursday mornings.
in april,milton moran,moran,was employed by brink as an atm repair technician.on the morning of thursday,april,moran went to the building in which the yonkers atms were located to repair an atm printer.for such an assignment,moran normally carried,inter alia,a pouch containing a keys to give him access to the backs of the atms and b the various codes for disabling alarms and for releasing the electronic locks on the backs of the atms as a matter of brink policy,he also carried a gun.at on that thursday morning,moran notified brink that he had arrived at the yonkers atms facility at he notified brink that he was about to depart.
at about or that morning,john vitetta,who worked in a ground floor office in the building in which the yonkers atms were located,was in the parking lot working on his car when he saw a body being dragged between an suv and an adjacent toyota.thinking the body was a cpr mannequin,vitetta returned his attention to his car.after hearing a thud and looking up again,he saw feet sticking out of the trunk of the toyota and saw a man standing behind the open trunk.realizing that the body he had seen being dragged was not that of a mannequin but that of a person,vitetta ran into his office and called.at trial,vitetta pointed out douglas as the man he had seen standing behind the trunk in which the body had just been placed.vitetta also testified that he had selected the picture of douglas from a photographic array shown to him by the police two days after the event.
when the police arrived at the parking lot in response to vitetta call,they opened the trunk of the toyota and found moran,dead,with duct tape wrapped around his mouth and head.moran had extensive bruising on the head,along with contusions on his arm and hand that were consistent with defensive wounds.the cause of death was determined to be principally asphyxia due to smothering,along with blunt force trauma to the head and face.the keys and codes that moran had used to gain access to the back and interior of the atm machine were missing.and although moran was wearing a gun holster and carrying a gun permit,his gun was missing.
marilyn sarin,employed in the same office as vitetta,had heard vitetta calling and describing what he had seen.she had then run into the parking lot and had seen an suv back swiftly out of a parking spot and speed out of the lot through the marked entrance rather than the exit.sarin testified at trial that the vehicle was driven by a heavyset,black male with dark facial hair.trial transcript tr,at.although sarin was unsure whether she would recognize the driver if she saw him again,she testified that when she was shown a array four days after the incident,see part.below,she selected the picture of douglas as the driver.
in addition,upon observing the suv on the morning of april,sarin wrote down the suv license plate number.records revealed that the vehicle belonged to a woman with whom douglas was living in brooklyn.when the suv was recovered several days later,its contents included a loaded shotgun,a vest,a suitcase containing men clothing and toiletry items,douglas social security card,and his expired jamaican passport.
douglas,after exiting the yonkers atms parking lot on april,shortly left the new york area by bus and made his way to florida.there he made statements to his cousin and a close friend of the family,both of whom were called as witnesses by the government.
douglas told those witnesses that he had planned,in collaboration with moran,to steal money from atm machines immediately after the machines received cash infusions.douglas was to hit moran on the head and bind his mouth and hands to make it appear that moran had been a robbery victim.douglas said he had hit moran on the head and taped moran mouth while they were in the suv that the brink truck bringing cash to the atms did not arrive when expected and that while he and moran were waiting,moran pointed out that the tape on his mouth had come loose and douglas tightened it.douglas said he then went to the atms to check on whether the cash had been delivered,and when he returned to the suv,he found moran unresponsive,and he panicked.he put moran body in the trunk of moran car and fled in his girlfriend suv.
on april,douglas turned himself in to the police in florida,saying,inter alia,that he had been involved in a robbery attempt in new york in which a man had died.
douglas defense 
douglas defense consisted principally of his own testimony.he admitted that he had made most of the statements to which his cousin and friend testified but douglas testified that he had given them a story that he had made up tr.douglas testified that he had in fact been at the site of the yonkers atms on the morning in question,had put moran body in the trunk of moran car,and had left the scene in his girlfriend suv.he also admitted that he had gone to florida and told his cousin and their friend that he and moran had planned to rob the atms together and that moran had accidentally died.however,douglas denied that he had said anything about hitting moran,tying him up,or taping his mouth he also denied that he had gone to see whether the atms expected cash delivery had arrived or had tightened the tape on moran mouth.douglas testified that in fact moran had been killed by another man.
douglas testified that some three months prior to april,he encountered a man he had not met before and the man began extorting money from him by threatening him and his family.testified that in jamaica he had been a policeman for more than six notified the authorities of the extortion see,tr.he gave the man money on several occasions a total of see id.at,indeed draining his bank account and borrowing on his credit cards and pawning his jewelry to do so see id.at.douglas described the man as than himself,with dreadlocks or twists in his hair,but testified that he did not know the man name.however,the man somehow knew,without any input from douglas,that douglas had formerly worked at brink.on april,douglas agreed to drive the unnamed man to the site of the yonkers atms on the morning of april see tr,and on april he did so with the unnamed man holding a gun to his neck.douglas testified that it was this unnamed man who killed moran.
douglas testified that after he drove the unnamed man to the yonkers atms location,he drove around the parking lot,then parked for a while,and then exited the lot and parked on the street,adjacent to the lot.douglas then got out of the suv and sat on the back bumper while the unnamed man sat in the suv and cased the location for purposes of a robbery.after douglas saw moran,whom he knew,approaching the building and sorting through a ring of keys,douglas reentered the suv the unnamed man asked who moran was,and douglas informed him that moran was an atm technician.the unnamed man forced douglas to reenter the parking lot.when moran reappeared some minutes later after leaving the building and approached his own car,the unnamed man exited the suv,approached moran,and jammed his gun into moran back.the man forced moran to drive moran car from its spot in front of the entrance to a corner of the lot and beckoned to douglas to bring the suv to the parking spot next to moran car the man then put moran into the back seat of the suv.the unnamed man also climbed into the suv back seat,and he forced moran to give him the keys,to identify those that unlocked the doors to the atms,and to disclose the codes.the man then gave douglas the keys and codes and told him to make sure the codes were correct.
douglas testified that before he went to check on the atm codes,the unnamed man asked whether he had rope to tie up moran douglas responded that he did not have rope but volunteered that he did have duct tape if that can help tr,and he gave the man his duct tape.douglas testified that he then left the suv and walked around the corner of the building in which the atms were located but that he never entered or attempted to enter the building after remaining out of sight of the unnamed man for some minutes,he returned to the suv,got into the driver seat,and said the codes were good.the unnamed man was by then in the front passenger seat.when douglas could not see moran in the back seat,he got out and opened the back door and found moran on the floor,bruised,gagged,and unresponsive.douglas got into the back seat and tried to pull the duct tape from moran mouth but was unsuccessful.
douglas testified that he was crying and then the crying turned to rage.tr.he suddenly remembered that he had in the back of the suv a shotgun see id.which he had begun to carry in his own vehicle because he was being threatened by the unnamed man and which he transferred to the rear area of the suv on the eve of these events see id.at.douglas testified that when he remembered the shotgun,he jumped up and reached for the shotgun case,unzipped the case,pulled the shotgun out and brought it forward,and then racked it,making a sound.id.at.when he then pointed the shotgun at the unnamed man,the man jumped out of the car and fled on foot.
douglas testified that,after some deliberation,he pulled moran body out of the suv,and it hit the ground with a very loud thud.douglas testified that he then saw vitetta in the parking lot,watching him.douglas put moran body in the trunk of moran car.he then drove the suv to brooklyn,left it in a hospital parking garage,and fled to florida.
c.the government and impeachment of douglas 
in douglas,the government elicited answers that,inter alia,highlighted the implausibilities in his story.for example,having begun to carry the shotgun and vest precisely because he was afraid of the unnamed man,and having put them into the back of the suv on april knowing he would be driving the unnamed man to yonkers the next morning,douglas testified that he made no attempt to get the shotgun or vest on april when the unnamed man went off to intercept moran and left douglas alone in the suv.having testified that he cried after seeing moran condition,douglas admitted that his only attempt to revive moran was the unsuccessful effort to remove the tape from moran mouth,and that although he did not know whether moran was still alive he made no attempt to discern whether moran still had a pulse,it never occurred to him to take moran into the doctor office that douglas knew was in the building.and despite proclaiming his innocence at trial,during the nearly months between his arrest in this case and his testifying at trial douglas had made no effort whatever to tell the authorities about the unnamed man.
the government also asked douglas about his decision to put moran body in the trunk of moran car 
q so the decision to take this dead body and dump it into the trunk of a car,that was your decision,right 
a yes,that was all mine.
q now milton was an atm tech,right 
a that is correct.
q and atm techs are armed,right 
a yes,i think they are,far as my recollection.
q and you know that,right 
q and milton was armed that day,right 
a i do know if he was.
q you have no idea whether he was armed 
q you have no idea whether he had a gun on him 
a i think he might have,but i not sure.
q you not sure whether he had a gun on him you have no idea what happened to that gun 
a no,i did do anything.
tr.emphases added.as discussed in part.below,the government was then allowed to question douglas with respect to a statement he had made about moran gun to the police in florida,which the government had acknowledged was inadmissible in its because it had been given in response to questioning before douglas was given warnings pursuant to miranda arizona,d.douglas had told the florida police that he had thrown moran gun off a bridge.
the government continued its of douglas by asking whether,when he put moran body in the trunk of the toyota,he noticed that moran gun holster was empty.douglas responded that he did not observe a holster,and he reiterated that he did not do anything with moran gun and did not know what happened to it.the government then asked him about being questioned by florida police officers who were relaying an inquiry from the police in yonkers as to the whereabouts of moran gun.douglas denied telling the florida officers that he had thrown the gun off the bridge.
in its rebuttal case,the government called two florida police officers,who testified that douglas told them he had thrown moran gun off a bridge.the district court instructed the jury that it was to consider this evidence for impeachment purposes only,and not for its truth.
d.the verdict and the sentence 
the jury found douglas guilty on both counts of the superseding indictment,attempted entry of a bank facility with intent to commit a felony therein,in violation of a,and killing a person in connection with that attempt,in violation of a and e.
on douglas motion,consented to by the government,the district court essentially concluded that the offense of attempted entry of a bank with intent to commit a felony therein in violation of a is included within the e offense of causing the death of a person while committing that a offense,and it entered a judgment of conviction only on the latter count.as e provides that any person who kills another in the course of violating a shall be punished by death or life imprisonment,and as the government had announced prior to trial that it would not seek the death penalty,the district court sentenced douglas principally to life imprisonment.douglas was sentenced on january.the court deferred decision on the matter of restitution,pending receipt of additional information.
on may,no restitution order having yet been entered,douglas wrote to the court,contending that such an order could no longer be entered against him because d provides that a restitution order may be entered up to days after sentencing.douglas argued that as he had been sentenced on january,the period within which a restitution order could be entered had ended on may.
on may,the district court entered an order rejecting the untimeliness contention,finding that douglas was not prejudiced by the delay from may to may,and ordering him to pay brink and moran father restitution totaling.see part.below.an amended judgment,adding the restitution order,was entered,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,douglas contends principally that,because he was charged with an offense that was statutorily punishable by death,he was entitled to representation by two attorneys pursuant to despite the government notification that it would not seek the death penalty that the government used a peremptory challenge during voir dire to discriminate against him on the basis of race that there were various errors in connection with the admission of the identification testimony by vitetta and sarin and that the court improperly allowed the government to to introduce rebuttal his postarrest response to questioning by the police in florida,without miranda warnings,that he had possessed and disposed of moran gun.douglas also contends,inter alia,that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he attempted to enter the yonkers atms facility and that the restitution order was untimely and substantively improper.finding no basis for reversal,we affirm.
a.the claim of entitlement to representation by two attorneys 
count one of the superseding indictment against douglas charged him with attempting to enter a banking facility with intent to commit a larceny therein,in violation of a.count two charged that in connection with that offense,douglas killed moran in violation of subsection e of that section,which provides that w hoever,in committing any offense defined in this section,kills any person,shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.e emphasis added.
the original indictment against douglas,which also charged him with violating e,was filed on september.the first attorney appointed to represent douglas following his arrest was paul davison,of the office of the federal defender.on october,in light of the potential death sentence if douglas were convicted on count two,davison requested the appointment for douglas,pursuant to,of a second attorney,one learned in the law applicable to capital cases.the court granted that request by order dated october,appointing clinton calhoun,iii,who was learned in the law applicable to capital cases,as an additional attorney to represent douglas.
by letter dated march,the government informed douglas and the court that it would not seek the death penalty in the present case.see also conference transcript,march,at.douglas requested that the court nonetheless continue the appointment of both calhoun and davison as his attorneys.the court rejected the request,reasoning that where there was no longer a potential death sentence,the services of counsel learned in the law applicable to capital cases were no longer needed.the court concluded that the government only needs to pay for one lawyer from this point forward id.at.douglas was allowed to decide which attorney would continue to represent him,and,without waiving his objection to the court ruling,he opted for calhoun.
on this appeal,douglas contends,raising an issue of first impression in this court,that the district court refusal to continue the appointment of a second attorney for him following the government notification that it would not seek the death penalty violated his right under to be represented by two attorneys and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial.we disagree.
section provides that when a person is indicted for a capital crime,
the court before which the defendant is to be tried,or a judge thereof,shall promptly,upon the defendant request,assign counsel,of whom at least shall be learned in the law applicable to capital cases,and who shall have free access to the accused at all reasonable hours.
emphases added.the section states plainly that such counsel is to be appointed promptly in a case involving a capital crime but it is silent as to whether the court has an obligation to continue the appointment after the government has announced that it does not seek the death penalty.
however,the purpose of the right is to reduce the chance that an innocent defendant would be put to death because of inadvertence or errors in judgment of his counsel,united states waggoner,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d,and all but one of our sister circuits that have dealt with this issue have reasoned that once the government has announced that it does not seek the death penalty,the case is no longer a capital case,see,united states casseus,cir,cert.denied,d,and the appointment of counsel learned in death penalty law may be terminated,see,united states waggoner,at in re,cir united states grimes,cir,cert.denied,d.
in united states waggoner,for example,the district court appointed second counsel on an interim basis,pending the government determination of whether to seek the death penalty.after the government announced that it would not seek that penalty,the court terminated the appointment.the ninth circuit found no error in either the conditional nature of the appointment or the termination of the appointment once the death penalty was no longer a potential sentence 
the question we address in this case is whether the defendant right to be represented by two attorneys is extinguished once the threat of capital punishment has been irrevocably removed from the slate of available punishments.
in this case,the district court properly concluded that the defendant was not entitled to be represented by two attorneys after the government filed formal notice that it did not intend to seek the death penalty.
w hen a defendant is no longer subject to indictment for a capital crime because the threat that the death penalty will be imposed has been eliminated,the defendant no longer has a statutory right to a second attorney to defend him at the trial of the offense.
at,emphasis added.
similarly,in united states grimes,in which the government had stated,on the record prior to trial,that it would not seek the death penalty in this case,the eleventh circuit ruled that the defendant was properly denied benefits afforded to a capital defendant because the government stipulated that it would not seek the death penalty and thereby transformed this case into a proceeding.at.see also in re,at granting mandamus requiring the district court to appoint second counsel promptly,rather than wait for a decision by the government as to whether to seek or eschew the death penalty,stating that there are practical reasons to treat the case as capital from indictment forward,for purposes of appointing learned counsel,until it becomes clear that the death penalty is no longer an option and the matter is no longer a capital case first emphasis in original second emphasis ours united states casseus,at holding that any error in the district court refusal to appoint second counsel was harmless in light of the facts that during plea negotiations the defendants were not pressured by the possibility of death sentences and that the government announced prior to trial that it would not seek the death penalty after the government declared that it would not seek the death penalty,the appellants were no longer capital defendants.
other circuits had similarly held that did not require the appointment of a second attorney where a sentence of death was precluded by the supreme court decision in furman georgia,d,which invalidated the death penalty under statutory schemes then in effect.see,united states shepherd,cir.does not apply because there is no possibility that the death penalty can be imposed,cert.denied,d united states weddell,cir in light of furman,the case lost its capital nature as charged in the indictment.it follows that the district court did not err in rejecting weddell request for the appointment of a second attorney pursuant to,cert.denied,d.
so far as we are aware,only the fourth circuit has taken an opposite view,although the precise contours of that circuit views of the scope of are not entirely clear.in united states boone,cir boone,in which one count charged the defendant with an offense that could be punished by death and the district court did not appoint counsel,the fourth circuit ordered a new trial on that count despite the fact that the government had not sought the death penalty.the boone court ruled that the right to the appointment of counsel in a case where the death penalty may be imposed attaches upon indictment and that that right is absolute and not extinguished,even when the government does not in fact seek the death penalty.see id.at.
although in boone,the court ruled that the error in failing to appoint such counsel could not be deemed harmless,see id.at,the fourth circuit viewed the rights created by as less absolute in united states robinson,cir.robinson,cert.denied,d,declining to reverse a conviction where counsel had been appointed but the appointment was the government elected not to seek the death penalty.in robinson,the court stated that u nder boone,the failure to provide robinson with two attorneys throughout trial was plain error even though the government withdrew its notice of intent to seek the death penalty,id.at emphasis added but the robinson court concluded that the failure to provide a defendant with the benefit of a provision designed to provide additional protection to capital defendants did not affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,id.emphases in original see also boone,at surely,if the government decides not to seek the death penalty,then the penalty phase is won before trial.
in any event,we agree with the majority of the federal courts of appeals that once the government has formally informed the court and the defendant of its intention not to seek the death penalty,the matter is no longer a capital case within the meaning of and that section does not require the district court to continue the appointment of a second attorney.the district court in the present case properly appointed such counsel for douglas upon his request shortly after the filing of the original indictment and it was not error for the court to rule that after the government renunciation of any intent to seek the death penalty,douglas was not entitled to representation by more than one attorney.
finally,we emphasize that the question on this appeal is whether the district court erred in requiring douglas to proceed with only one attorney once it became clear that he would not be subject to the death penalty.our conclusion that does not entitle a defendant to a second attorney under these circumstances would not preclude a district court,in its discretion,from maintaining the dual appointment in a future case out of a concern for fairness at the trial of a criminal offense,united states durant,cir.n o right ranks higher than the right of the accused to a fair trial.united states king,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the district court discontinued davison appointment nine months before the trial was scheduled to begin,leaving more than enough time for calhoun,douglas remaining attorney,to get ready for trial and undertake whatever responsibilities had been shouldered by davison.deciding when,if ever,the retention of both counsel is necessary in the interest of justice after the government has announced it will not seek the death penalty is an exercise best left to the broad discretion of the district court.
b.the government use of peremptory challenges 
douglas,a man of color originally from jamaica,contends that under batson kentucky,d,he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the government,in exercising a peremptory challenge during jury selection,discriminated against him on the basis of race,in violation of his right to equal protection.this claim is based on the peremptory challenge by the government to a prospective juror apparently a man of color who had stated in response to the court initial background questions that he was from jamaica.
in hernandez new york,d,the supreme court discussed the framework for analyzing a defendant claim of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges,established by batson in the context of a claim of discrimination based on race 
batson outlined a process for evaluating claims that a prosecutor has used peremptory challenges in a manner violating the equal protection clause,at first,the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race,at.second,if the requisite showing has been made,the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a explanation for striking the jurors in question,at.finally,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination,at.
hernandez,at.plurality opinion.
as to the prosecution burden to proffer a neutral explanation,the court has stated that u nless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor explanation,the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.purkett elem,d internal quotation marks omitted.discriminatory intent may be found to be inherent where the proffer of a supposedly explanation has a racial ingredient.see,walker girdich,cir ordering a new trial where the prosecutor began her proffer by stating that one of the main things she had a problem with was that this wa s an individual who was a black man with no kids and no family quoting prosecutor emphasis in walker.
since a finding as to whether there was intentional discrimination is a finding of fact,and the trial court findings in this context largely will turn on evaluation of credibility,hernandez,at.plurality opinion quoting batson,at.other internal quotation marks omitted,the trial court finding as to whether the prosecutor reason was may be overturned only if that finding is clearly erroneous,see hernandez,at.plurality opinion id.at.concurring opinion of,i agree with the plurality that we review for clear error the trial court finding as to discriminatory intent,and agree with its analysis of this issue.i f the trial court believes the prosecutor nonracial justification,and that finding is not clearly erroneous,that is the end of the matter.it is well established that w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous,id.at.plurality opinion quoting anderson bessemer city,d.
where a prosecutor has articulated multiple reasons for his peremptory challenge,one of which is race,dual motivation analysis is appropriate.see,howard senkowski,cir.in those circumstances,the batson claim should be rejected if the prosecutor persuades the court that the challenges would have been exercised for reasons even if race had not been a factor.id.
the record in the present case persuades us that the district court permissibly found that the government articulated,and possessed,a neutral reason for excusing the juror in question and that he would have been excused whether or not race was a consideration.in conducting the voir dire,the district judge determined that several prospective jurors had actually served on a jury one member of this group was stewart,who had previously stated that he was from jamaica.the court stated that each member of the group would be asked to describe his or her jury service without disclosing the verdict,if any 
each of you i want to answer the following question 
when were you a juror 
what kind of a case 
did the jur y reach a verdict yes or no.not what the verdict was.did you reach a verdict yes or no.
or if the case settled or for whatever reason you did deliberate,just say,we did deliberate.okay 
jury selection transcript tr,at emphasis added.the court then asked each member of the group in turn to answer these questions.when the court called on stewart,he responded it was three years ago and there was a verdict.id.at emphasis added.the judge stated there was a verdict.thank you.i do want to know what the verdict is,people,i just want to know if you reached a verdict.id.
the government used its first peremptory challenge to excuse stewart,and douglas promptly made a batson objection.the court conducted the following inquiry 
the court a p rima faci e case of discrimination in jury selection is established when a defendant is a member of a cognizable racial group,the prosecutor uses a peremptory challenge to remove members of that group from the jury and these facts and other relevant circumstances raise an inference the prosecutor has excluded jurors on account of their race.
i assume this is your challenge,calhoun 
calhoun yes,it is,your honor.
your honor,we have so few persons of color to deal with in this group of jurors 
i n listening to stewart answers to your honor questions and watching him during jury selection,i discern no valid basis why he should be challenged.the only remote connection i saw was that he from jamaica,but i do know if national origin means anything at all.i do see any basis why he should be challenged,and i ask the court to determine whether there is a racially neutral explanation for why the government challenged him.
the court ritchin 
ritchin assistant united states attorney ausa your honor,i would point to a number of factors.
first,there is no pattern here.this is the government first strike.
the second of which is the factor that calhoun pointed to,he is from the same country as the defendant and there some concern that he might,therefore,have sympathy for the defendant.
a third factor is that,despite the court instruction that jurors not give the verdict of any case on which they have sat,stewart did provide that verdict in response to the question indicating some inability to follow directions.
and the fourth factor i suppose is the answer he gave,which,for a prosecutor,gives some pause.
the court correct.i anticipated that this was going to happen,and you going to have to convince me,calhoun,that the reason stewart was challenged was something other than he announced to the world that he was on a jury,that he voted to acquit a defendant.if i were a prosecutor,he the first guy i want off.
calhoun well,i do know if i can convince anybody of that,but i think it far more likely that he misunderstood your honor instruction about not revealing the verdict.i do know knowing anything about the case and anything about the evidence that was presented in that case,it may have been a perfectly fine verdict.
the court may have been.that not to say that a prosecutor would want such a person off the jury,whether the person was black,white or purple.
calhoun i just do think that the fact that he was on some jury somewhere sometime in the past and rendered a verdict or participated in a verdict that was not guilty,i do think it means anything at all,and i do see why it would be any factor at all in determining whether to challenge somebody.
tr.emphases added.
although the court noted that one of the reasons given by the stewart was from the same country as not neutral,it found that the explanation that stewart had served on a jury that returned a verdict of acquittal was a neutral reason and one that the court found to be,indeed,so predictable a basis for peremptory challenge that it was the impetus for the court instruction that the prospective jurors not disclose their prior verdicts 
the court as far as i concerned,in this instance,the government has given a reason for challenging stewart.i reiterate,the minute he said that,i said,i see what coming,a challenge and a batson.
but stewart,in response to the court question about prior jury service,indicated that he was on a jury that reached a verdict.he further indicated it was a criminal case,and then,contrary to my instruction,he announced that the jury had acquitted in that case.
it entirely possible,as calhoun says,that he misunderstood my instruction however,he did give that information,and if i were a prosecutor,i would want such an individual off the jury myself.that is the reason that i do ask that question.no judge i know wants that information out because acquitters tend to be people that the government does not want,the prosecution does not want.convictors tend to be people that the defendant does want.
it an absolutely reason for striking him from the jury,the argument is not,and the inability to follow instructions is not persuasive.but the fact that the defendant was on the jury that it voted to acquit is a completely reason striking him from the jury and the batson challenge is disallowed.
tr.emphases added.
although douglas argues that the government did not put forth clearly that stewart had been on a jury that voted for acquittal as one of its reasons for excusing stewart douglas brief on appeal at,the district court plainly so understood the ausa articulation of his fourth factor as apparently did defense counsel,who argued that it may have been a perfectly fine verdict tr.plainly,the ausa concern for the nature of the verdict was sufficiently clear.
further,the record quoted above shows that the trial court found the ausa neutral explanation to be credible.the finding that individuals of any race or color who have served on juries that acquitted tend to be people that the government does not want is a permissible view,and the court finding that the government would have used a peremptory challenge to excuse stewart regardless of race is not clearly erroneous.we conclude that the court properly rejected douglas batson challenge.
finally,to the extent that douglas may be suggesting that he was denied equal protection on the ground that the government discriminated against him on the basis of national origin,we note that while batson has been extended beyond race to apply to peremptory challenges based on ethnicity,see hernandez,d,and gender,see alabama ex rel,d,this court has not decided the issue of whether national origin is a cognizable classification for batson protection.rodriguez schriver,cir.assuming,however,that a peremptory challenge based entirely on national origin would violate equal protection,we conclude that a batson challenge here fails for the reasons stated above,that the government had a neutral reason for excusing stewart and that he would have been excused even if national origin had not been a consideration.
challenges to the identification testimony 
douglas makes several claims of error with respect to the admission of the identification testimony of vitetta and sarin.he contends that their identifications of him were unreliable because they resulted from impermissibly suggestive photographic arrays that the court erred in excluding from evidence an affidavit signed by sarin that cast doubt on her identification of douglas and that the government suppressed evidence contradicting or impeaching those witnesses identifications,in violation of brady maryland,d.we find no merit in these contentions.
the alleged suggestiveness of the photographic array 
as described in part above,vitetta identified douglas at trial as the man he had seen in the parking lot just after moran body had been dragged on the ground and put in the trunk of the toyota and both vitetta and sarin testified that they had identified douglas from the photographic array that they were shown in the days following april.prior to trial,douglas moved unsuccessfully to suppress those photographic identifications and to preclude any identification of him on the ground that the photographic array was impermissibly suggestive and created a significant risk of misidentification memorandum in support of defendant pretrial motions,dated february,at.on this appeal,douglas contends that the district court erred in summarily denying this aspect of his suppression motion,arguing principally that a one of the photos was a picture of a known murderer that had been prominently displayed in tabloids in the new york area douglas brief on appeal at,and b the background colors in the photos made the picture of douglas stand out from the others.his contentions are meritless.
a defendant right to due process includes the right not to be the object of suggestive police identification procedures that make an identification unreliable.see,manson brathwaite,d brathwaite neil biggers,d biggers simmons united states,d.generally,a witness will not be allowed to make an identification if the authorities pretrial photographic identification procedures were so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.simmons,at.emphasis added.and w hile th at phrase was coined as a standard for determining whether an identification would be admissible in the wake of a suggestive identification,with the deletion of irreparable it serves equally well as a standard for the admissibility of testimony concerning the identification itself.biggers,at.thus,in determining the admissibility of identification testimony for either pretrial or identification,reliability is the linchpin brathwaite,at.
we review the district court determination of the admissibility of identification evidence for clear error.united states mohammed,cir,cert.denied,d.we may review the photographic array itself to assess its fairness.see,united states jacobowitz,cir,cert.denied,d.
we see no merit in douglas contention that the array was tainted by the presence of a picture of john royster,a convicted killer of some notoriety.the frequent appearance of royster picture in new york area newspapers had occurred some eight years earlier,and the district judge noted,i did not recognize this photograph,although i regularly read the newspapers order dated march,at.the district court stated that if a witness actually recognized royster,that witness presumably would not have selected him,and thus would have viewed the array as a array rather than a array.there is nothing inherently improper about a array.id.we agree.
further,we have reviewed the photographic array and see no hint of suggestiveness.all are photographs,all of,men in roughly the same age group,with hair,hairlines,and thin or trimmed mustaches.only one of the six royster has a thin face,suggesting a thinner build than the others.as to the background colors of the photos,no two are the same,and no picture stands out because of its background color.the district court found that i t simply can not be said that the picture of the accused so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an identifying witness that the accused was more likely to be the culprit.id.quoting jarrett headley,cir other internal quotation marks omitted.we see no error in that finding.
given the lack of any suggestiveness in the photo array,the identification testimony of vitetta and sarin was admissible at trial without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial identification s,united states,cir,cert.denied,d,of douglas as the man vitetta saw standing behind the car into whose trunk moran body had just been dumped and as the man sarin saw driving the suv out of the parking lot.and if there had been any error in not conducting a further inquiry as to the reliability of those identifications,we would conclude that such an error was without a doubt harmless in light of the trial testimony of douglas himself,described in parts and above,that it was he who drove the suv out of the parking lot,and that during his dealings with moran body,he had seen vitetta watching him.
the exclusion of sarin affidavit 
douglas also contends that the trial court erred in excluding from evidence a sarin affidavit that stated that the driver of the suv might have been white.evidentiary rulings of the district court are reviewed for abuse of discretion,see,old chief united states,d united states abel,d,and we see no abuse of discretion here.
in a hearing outside the presence of the jury,sarin was questioned about an affidavit she had signed on the afternoon of april,in which the driver of the suv was described as a heavyset male,possibly white tr.she testified,i was asked if he was possibly,could he have possibly been white.i said,he was possibly white but i was confident that he was a black male.id.
in the presence of the jury,sarin testified,as described in part above,that the driver of the suv was a heavyset,black male with dark facial hair,and that she had selected the picture of douglas from the photographic array as the driver of the suv.on,douglas attorney was allowed to have sarin read from her april affidavit the statement,i saw a heavyset male,possibly white,with a beard,driving the suv.tr.when defense counsel asked whether sarin had said heavyset male,possibly white she responded,possibly white,yes.id.at.
on redirect examination,sarin testified that her april affidavit had been prepared by the police detective interviewing her that she did not tell the detective what words to use in the affidavit that she had not read the typed affidavit carefully for the accuracy of its contents before she signed it and that she did not notice that its only reference to the race of the person she was describing was possibly white.id.at.sarin testified that when she was asked by the detective to describe the suv driver,she had said he was a heavyset,black male that when asked if the driver could have been white,she had said possibly and that it was not her recollection,either on april or at the time of trial,that the driver of the suv was white.id.at.
on,defense counsel brought out that sarin statement was taken just hours after the events on april that she had given the detective the information about what she had seen that she knew her statements were of importance to the police investigation that she had wanted to be accurate that the document recites that the driver sarin saw was a heavyset male,possibly white id.at and that sarin had signed the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
plainly,douglas was allowed at trial to cross and sarin fully about the affidavit.he was allowed to have her read aloud the portion of the affidavit that said that she had seen a heavyset male,possibly white,with a beard,driving the suv.id.at.and he was allowed to quote the heavyset male,possibly white language to the jury repeatedly see,id.at.in light of the latitude given to douglas to examine sarin repeatedly with respect to that phrase in the affidavit,we see no abuse of discretion in the court refusal to allow douglas also to introduce the affidavit itself.
the posttrial brady motion 
following his conviction,douglas unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the ground that the government had failed to disclose to him prior statements by vitetta and sarin and notes of their interviews by agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi collectively the documents until the friday before the monday on which the trial began,thereby violating his due process rights as declared in brady maryland,d,and its progeny,giglio united states,d.he pursues this contention on appeal.
under brady and its progeny,the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material to the accused guilt or punishment,brady,at.materiality encompasses the notions that the suppressed evidence is favorable to the accused and that he was prejudiced by its suppression.see,kyles whitley,d the constitutional duty is triggered by the potential impact of favorable but undisclosed evidence.thus,as discussed further below,t here are three components of a true brady violation the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the prosecution,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued,strickler greene,d.
where a defendant brady claim was raised in a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,we review the denial of the motion for abuse of discretion.united states gil,cir gil.for the reasons that follow,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that douglas established none of the three components of his brady claim.
to begin with,douglas does not complain that the documents were not disclosed,but only that he received them just one business day three calendar days before trial.the record in this case does not lend itself to the conclusion that the timing of the government disclosure of these documents constituted their suppression within the meaning of brady.
with respect to when the prosecution must make a disclosure required by brady,the law appears to be settled.brady material must be disclosed in time for its effective use at trial,see,leka portuondo,cir,or at a plea proceeding,see united states persico,cir tate wood,cir.
in re united states coppa,cir emphasis in original.brady material that is not disclos ed in sufficient time to afford the defense an opportunity for use may be deemed suppressed within the meaning of the brady doctrine.leka portuondo,cir.but 
as long as a defendant possesses brady evidence in time for its effective use,the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.there is no brady violation unless there is a reasonable probability that earlier disclosure of the evidence would have produced a different result at trial 
in re united states coppa,at.in gil,we held that a document that was exculpatory and impeaching brady material,given to the defendant on the friday before a monday trial,was in effect suppressed within the meaning of brady as it was buried in the midst of five reams of paper labeled material,gil,at.
although douglas relies on gil for his contention that the documents were suppressed,gil is readily distinguishable.in that case,the documents delivered to the defendant on the friday before trial consisted of more than exhibits,totaling some pages.further,gil focus was a memorandum written by and to persons other than the witness whose testimony it would impeach and the entry for that document in the index to the exhibits identified the document only by the initials of the witness,without mention of the names of its author or addressee.we concluded that,given the delivery of the document in that obscure fashion,the defense was not in a position to read it,identify its usefulness,and use it.id.at.
here,in contrast,the documents given to douglas on the friday before trial totaled only some pages.they were grouped according to the witness to which they pertained and were easily recognizable as such,with the documents relating to a given witness fastened with a clip.the documents related only to the statements of vitetta and sarin themselves,respectively,not to statements by others.the documents relating to vitetta totaled just pages.the documents relating to sarin totaled pages,plus an eighth page that was inadvertently omitted on friday and was sent by fax on the following afternoon.the pages of documents were easily found and fathomed.we can not conclude that they were suppressed.
nor did douglas establish that he was prejudiced by not having received the documents earlier.as to vitetta,douglas focuses in particular on an fbi report and handwritten notes stating that when vitetta first entered the parking lot to work on his car,he saw the toyota idling and thought the man he saw in the driver seat was than the man he saw standing behind the toyota just after moran body had been dumped into it.as to sarin,douglas complains particularly about not having had the affidavit discussed in part.above,which stated that the man sarin had seen driving the suv out of the parking lot was possibly white,along with an fbi report and notes to the same effect.
douglas argues first that these documents could be used to impeach the credibility of vitetta and sarin by clearly discredit ing their trial testimony that douglas was the one and only person they saw at the scene.douglas brief on appeal at.but that impeachment potential reveals no prejudice,for the district court noted that the documents were in fact used to attempt the impeachment of both witnesses on,to emphasize discrepancies on summation,and to argue on summation substantively that there was another person at the crime scene.see decision denying motion for a new trial,dated january,decision denying new trial,at.the court observed that the information contained in the supposedly suppressed documents was used at trial,to the best possible effect.id.
douglas also argues that late disclosure of the documents deprived him of the opportunity to follow up on any leads from the descriptions or from vitetta or sarin douglas brief on appeal at.the district court,in rejecting this argument in douglas motion,noted that douglas made no proffer of any defense efforts made to locate or speak with vitetta or sarin,in person or by telephone,in the four days between disclosure of their prior statements and their testimony,and that douglas did not seek an adjournment of the proceedings.decision denying new trial at.more importantly,we note that douglas provides no hint as to what sort of leads could have been gleaned from the documents and none come to mind,given douglas testimony that,inter alia,he knew who had killed moran but just did not know the man name.
finally,douglas did not establish that the information in the documents was material.
the touchstone of materiality is a reasonable probability of a different result,and the adjective is important.the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.a reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the government evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.
kyles,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also leka portuondo,at.
s trictly speaking,there is never a real brady violation unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.
strickler,at.
the contents of the documents plainly do not meet this test.although vitetta was recorded by one investigator as having stated that he had thought the man in the idling toyota was than the man he saw standing behind the toyota just after moran body was put in the trunk,vitetta testified that upon seeing douglas picture in the photographic array he realized they were the same man because the facial characteristics were the same.moreover,even if they were not the same man,vitetta prior statement provided no substantive support for douglas version of the events,for vitetta said he saw only one person in the idling toyota,whereas in douglas version of the events,both the unnamed man and moran were in that vehicle and whereas vitetta had stated that the man was in the driver seat of the toyota,according to douglas testimony the unnamed only person whom douglas described as than moran to drive the toyota.thus,the prior vitetta statement was inconsistent with douglas own scenario.
similarly,to the extent that sarin had said that the driver of the suv was possibly white,that statement provided no substantive support for douglas defense.in his version of the events,douglas did not mention any white person.further,all sarin saw,according to her testimony and the documents,was a man backing the suv whose license plate she noted out of a parking space and driving it out of the parking lot.sarin maintained at trial and in a preliminary hearing that she had said,and was confident,that the driver was a heavyset black man she had selected the picture of douglas as the driver and douglas himself testified that he had driven the suv out of the lot.
in sum,the contents of the documents were not favorable to douglas for they were inconsistent with his version of the events,and they provide no basis for finding any reasonable probability that earlier disclosure of those documents would have produced a different verdict.the district court properly rejected douglas brady claim.
d.the challenge to the impeachment of douglas with his postarrest,statement that he had disposed of moran gun 
prior to trial,douglas moved to suppress,inter alia,the statement he made to police officers in florida that he had thrown moran gun off a bridge.in response to that motion,the government acknowledged that douglas had not been advised of his miranda rights prior to being questioned as to the whereabouts of the gun see government memorandum of law in opposition to motions of paul ryan douglas,dated february,at,and it stated that that statement will not be offered by the government in its case in chief id.at.
at trial,the government made no reference to that statement in its.however,after douglas testified to his version of the events of april,including his testimony that he put moran body into the trunk of moran car but had had no role in assaulting or killing moran,and his testimony that he freed himself from the control of the unnamed man by getting the shotgun from the back of the suv,the government sought to douglas as to whether moran was armed and what had happened to moran gun,and to impeach him through both and rebuttal evidence with his statement to the florida police that he had thrown moran gun off a bridge.the trial court,after receiving briefing from the parties,ruled that the government proposed was permissible and its rebuttal evidence admissible,citing,inter alia,united states payton,cir when a defendant offers an innocent explanation for his conduct,he opens the door to questioning into the truth of his testimony,and the government is entitled to attack his credibility on.douglas contends that this was error we disagree.
it is essential to the proper functioning of the adversary system that when a defendant takes the stand,the government be permitted proper and effective in an attempt to elicit the truth.united states havens,d.thus,the supreme court has repeatedly insisted that when defendants testify,they must testify truthfully or suffer the consequences.id.at.reject ing the notion that the defendant constitutional shield against having illegally seized evidence used against him could be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense,free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances quoting harris new york,d.accordingly,statements taken from a defendant in violation of his miranda rights,though they may not be introduced by the government during its,are nonetheless admissible to impeach statements made by the defendant in the course of his testimony.see,harris,at.admissible to impeach direct testimony oregon hass,d same see also havens,at.evidence seized in violation of the defendant fourth amendment rights is admissible to impeach testimony given by the defendant on.questions with respect to a defendant otherwise privileged statements are justifiable if they would have been suggested to a reasonably competent by the defendant direct testimony.id.at.
although douglas contends that about moran gun was improper because douglas direct testimony made no mention of that gun,we disagree.douglas testified that he was innocent of any wrongdoing with respect to moran,although he admitted that he had pulled moran out of the suv,dragged moran to moran car,and hoisted him into the trunk of that car.douglas also testified that while the unnamed man was in the front seat of the suv,douglas had entered the back seat with moran and tried unsuccessfully to remove the tape from moran mouth and,as set out in part above,douglas testified that when his tears turned to rage,he jumped up and reached into the rear of the suv,pulled out a case containing a shotgun,unzipped the case,pointed the shotgun at the unnamed man,noisily racked the shotgun,and was thereby able to cause the unnamed man to flee.tr.whether the focus was a on what douglas observed as he pulled moran from the suv,dragged his body to the toyota,picked up moran body,and dumped the body into the trunk of the toyota,or b on douglas potentially swifter access to less noticeably to the unnamed of a weapon other than the shotgun in its zippered case in the rear of the suv,these aspects of douglas direct testimony would have suggested to any reasonably competent a question as to whether moran was wearing a gun.when douglas admitted on,as set out in part above,that he knew atm technicians were usually armed but responded that he was not sure whether moran was armed,that he had no idea what had happened to moran gun,and that he,douglas,did do anything tr,the government was entitled to impeach him by asking him whether he had in fact stated to the police in florida that he had thrown moran gun off a bridge.when douglas denied that he had made such a statement,the government was entitled to impeach that denial by calling as witnesses in its rebuttal case the florida officers to whom the statement was made.the trial judge properly instructed the jury that the rebuttal evidence was to be considered only for purposes of impeachment,not for its truth and we see no error.
e.other contentions 
douglas other contentions,which include challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the restitution order,also provide no basis for relief.
the sufficiency challenge 
section a of title provides in pertinent part as follows 
a whoever,by force and violence,or by intimidation,takes,or attempts to take,from the person or presence of another,any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to,or in the care,custody,control,management,or possession of,any bank or 
whoever enters or attempts to enter any bank or any building used in whole or in part as a bank,with intent to commit in such bank,or building,or part thereof,so used,any felony affecting such bank and in violation of any statute of the united states,or any larceny 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years,or both.
a.in the superseding indictment,douglas was charged with violating the second paragraph of that section.at trial,he unsuccessfully moved pursuant to.for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the attempt prohibited by the second paragraph is not attempted larceny but only attempted entry into the bank building with intent to commit a felony therein and that the government failed to prove such an attempted entry because there was no evidence that he made any physical effort to get into the building housing the yonkers atms tr.see id.at there has to be some move in the direction of trying to get getting into the bank.douglas pursues this contention on appeal.
the standard for establishing a criminal attempt is well settled.
in order to establish that a defendant is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime,the government must prove that the defendant had the intent to commit the crime and engaged in conduct amounting to a substantial step towards the commission of the crime.for a defendant to have taken a substantial step,he must have engaged in more than mere preparation,but may have stopped short of the last act necessary for the actual commission of the substantive crime.
united states yousef,cir.discussing a,and which prohibited destruction of and attempts to destroy aircraft other internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d see,united states mowad,cir,cert.denied,d united states manley,cir manley,cert.denied,d united states jackson,cir,cert.denied,d.under this standard,a defendant may be found guilty of attempting to enter a banking facility even if he did not move physically to breach its perimeter,so long as he took a substantial step toward attempting to gain entry.
although douglas contends that the substantial step standard does not apply to a,his only argument in support of that contention relies on the current version of rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which provides as follows 
c lesser offense or attempt.a defendant may be found guilty of any of the following 
an offense necessarily included in the offense charged 
an attempt to commit the offense charged or 
an attempt to commit an offense necessarily included in the offense charged,if the attempt is an offense in its own right.
c.douglas apparently takes the position a strange one for a defendant to endorse that under subpart,a defendant may be convicted of an attempt to commit an offense even if no statutory provision prohibits such an attempt he thus argues that congress express prohibition against attempts to enter in a would be unnecessary surplusage,on the theory that congress did not need to insert those words because the prosecutor could rely on rule c douglas brief on appeal at,unless congress intended to require proof of more than the traditional substantial step to establish the offense of attempt under a.this argument has several flaws.
in addition to noting the obvious due process concerns for the possibility of convicting a defendant of an attempt that is not prohibited by any statutory provision,see,fiore white,d conviction of a defendant for conduct that a criminal statute does not prohibit violate s due
