bobby lee medford,a former sheriff of buncombe county,north carolina,was convicted in a jury trial of numerous conspiracy and other charges relating to his receipt of bribes in connection with the unlawful operation of video poker machines in buncombe and other north carolina counties.medford raises several challenges to his convictions,including the district court refusal to sever his trial from that of a,the district court admission of a conversation into evidence containing statements of certain alleged participants in the bribery scheme,and various other issues.upon our review,we affirm medford convictions on all counts.
medford served as the sheriff of buncombe county,north carolina,from through,when he lost his bid for.under a state law enacted in the legislation,medford was required,among his other duties as sheriff,to enforce north carolina regulations governing video poker machines.see.
under the legislation,which was repealed in an establishment was permitted to have up to three video poker machines at one store location.although cash payouts from the poker machines were prohibited under the legislation,winnings from a poker machine could include up to eight replays on the machine or a coupon for merchandise not exceeding a value of ten dollars.each video poker machine in operation was required to be registered with the sheriff office in the county in which the machine was located.
once registered,the video poker machines were affixed with registration stickers bearing a unique identification number.sheriffs were not permitted to charge any fee in connection with the registration of the video poker machines.the legislation also prohibited the importation into north carolina of any additional video poker machines,thereby restricting the pool of available video poker machines to those machines already located in the state.
in,medford delegated the primary responsibility for registering video poker machines to lieutenant john harrison.medford assigned guy kenneth penland,a volunteer who held himself out as a captain in the buncombe county sheriff office,to assist harrison.when harrison retired in may,lieutenant ronnie butch davis took over the duty of registering the video poker machines,and continued doing so until medford lost his bid for and left office in december.
the evidence at trial established that medford,with the assistance of harrison,penland,and davis collectively,the,accepted cash payments from the operators of video poker machines operators and owners of establishments store owners in which the video poker machines were located in exchange for these cash payments,medford allowed certain of the video poker machines to be registered and operated in ways that violated the restrictions established in the legislation.
according to the testimony of harrison and numerous video poker machine operators and store owners,medford and his were paid cash bribes to register video poker machines,some of which had been brought in from other states in violation of the legislation.medford and his also received cash bribes to place video poker machines in particular stores,and to allow the operation of video poker machines that on occasion paid out large sums of cash.
additionally,harrison,with medford knowledge and consent,organized golf tournaments,with participating individuals and organizations paying a donation to participate or to sponsor a golf hole.soon after the legislation was enacted,the majority of the individuals and organizations financially supporting the tournament were video poker machine operators and store owners.
during election years,the proceeds from the golf tournaments were used to support medford campaigns.however,during years,the proceeds were sometimes distributed either directly to medford or deposited,at medford direction,into credit union accounts held by medford or his girlfriend.although most of the money received in connection with the golf tournaments was in the form of cash,checks were sometimes given and were cashed by members of the sheriff department in stores in which video poker machines were located.
on one particular occasion,at medford direction,sheriff department employees converted cash obtained during a golf tournament into money orders.medford instructed that the money orders be purchased at different post offices in order to keep the purchases under a certain amount,thereby avoiding federal reporting requirements applicable to larger cash purchases.
the record also shows that henderson amusement,henderson amusement,a video poker machine operator based in south carolina,registered video poker machines in buncombe county and numerous machines in other north carolina counties.henderson amusement was a frequent provider of cash bribes to medford and his.
jerry pennington,an employee of henderson amusement,worked with penland to register video poker machines that previously had been in use outside north carolina.penland brought pennington to various stores,and placed pressure on the store owners to install the machines in these locations.in return,pennington paid penland a commission for every machine that penland was able to put into operation.
in addition to these commission payments,pennington,on behalf of henderson amusement,regularly made cash payments to medford,penland,and the other.pennington made at least seven such payments directly to medford,in individual amounts up to.in total,henderson amusement expense reports showed that the company paid to individuals associated with the buncombe county sheriff department,with medford personally receiving.
on the basis of this and other evidence,a grand jury indicted medford,along with harrison,penland,and davis,on charges of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right,in violation of the hobbs act,count one conspiracy to commit mail fraud,in violation of count two five counts of mail fraud and aiding and abetting mail fraud,in violation of,counts three through seven conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of h count eight conspiracy to obstruct the enforcement of criminal laws,with the intent to facilitate an illegal gambling business,in violation of count ten and conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business,in violation of count eleven 
the charges against medford and penland were tried together,over their objection,in an jury trial.the jury returned a verdict of guilty against medford and penland on all counts.the district court sentenced medford to concurrent terms of imprisonment of months for each of his convictions on counts through,and concurrent terms of imprisonment of months for each of his convictions on counts and.medford timely filed a notice of appeal.
medford raises five challenges in this appeal.he asserts that the district court erred in admitting into evidence a recording of a meeting that occurred between representatives of henderson amusement and persons associated with a sheriff department of a county adjacent to buncombe county the district court abused its discretion in denying medford motion to sever his trial from penland trial the evidence was insufficient to support medford conviction for violating the hobbs act the district court deprived medford of a fair trial by subjecting him to inconsistent and biased treatment and the honest services fraud statute,on which the charges in counts three through seven were based,is unconstitutionally vague.we address each argument in turn.
medford first argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence a recording of a december,meeting the december meeting attended by jamie henderson,a of henderson amusement,jeff childers,an employee of henderson amusement,john parker,a former deputy sheriff in neighboring rutherford county,and jack conner,the sheriff of rutherford county.according to medford,this recording should not have been admitted into evidence because the recording related to a separate conspiracy in rutherford county to which medford was not a party,and occurred after medford already had left office following his loss in the election.thus,medford asserts that the recording did not qualify for admission under the hearsay exclusion provided by rule for statements made by during the course and in furtherance of a conspiracy see.d e.
the record shows that neither medford nor any of the named in medford indictment attended the december meeting,which was recorded by parker and conner in cooperation with the federal bureau of investigation fbi.the meeting occurred more than two weeks after medford had left his position as sheriff of buncombe county.during the meeting,as reflected in the transcript of the recording,henderson informed conner that henderson amusement had placed video poker machines in twelve counties in north carolina,including about machines located in buncombe county.
henderson also stated in the recorded conversation that the buncombe county sheriff department did not mess with his machines located in that county,but that he now was out of the loop because buncombe county just changed sheriff sic.henderson stated that the sheriff that was there was a super guy,and that henderson hated to see him lose the election.henderson also stated that medford had been happy with receiving from henderson amusement between and each month,plus a lot more at election time.henderson mentioned medford by name at least three times during the recorded conversation.
the government sought to introduce this recorded evidence as proof that henderson amusement engaged in a conspiracy to conduct an illegal gambling business with medford and his,as alleged in count eleven of the indictment.the government also asserted that the recording tended to prove the existence of an illegal gambling business operated by henderson amusement across multiple counties in north carolina,including buncombe county.
the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that medford was a part of a conspiracy with henderson amusement operating both inside and beyond buncombe county.the court ruled that,therefore,the recording made at the december meeting was admissible under rule d e as containing statements made by in furtherance of that conspiracy.see.d e.
a district court evidentiary ruling ordinarily is reviewed on appeal under an abuse of discretion standard.united states murray,cir.under this standard,the appellate court affords the evidentiary ruling substantial deference,and will not overturn the ruling unless the decision was arbitrary and irrational.see united states weaver,cir.
based on the present record,however,we need not resolve the question whether the recording at issue was admissible under rule d e.instead,assuming,without deciding,that the district court erred,we conclude that any such error was harmless.
under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,a ny error,defect,irregularity,or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.we employ a analysis in determining whether a particular trial error was harmless.as we have explained 
in order for an error to have a substantial and injurious effect or influence,it must have affected the verdict.because juries have a limited number of responses to give in a criminal trial guilty,innocent,or can not decide an error is harmless when the error did not substantially sway or substantially influence the response.
thus,if the evidence is not merely sufficient,but so powerful,overwhelming,or cumulative that the error simply could not reasonably be said to have substantially swayed the jury judgment,then the error is not harmful.on the other hand,if the federal court is in grave doubt about whether the trial error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict and therefore finds itself in virtual equipoise about the issue,the error is not harmless.and the determination of whether trial error substantially and injuriously affected the judgment must be made by the court based on its review of the record.

upon our review of the record,and as described below,we conclude that apart from jamie henderson statements at the december meeting,there was overwhelming evidence concerning medford agreement and participation with henderson amusement in operating an illegal gambling conspiracy the government presented testimony from pennington,and expense reports related to henderson amusement operation in buncombe county,which established that pennington regularly made cash payments to medford on behalf of henderson amusement.pennington testified that his cash payments to medford became so regular that pennington knew that if medford asked to see him,it was time to bring some money.
henderson amusement expense reports,which the government introduced into evidence at trial,reflected that medford received in cash from henderson amusement during the time frame that pennington was registering video poker machines with the buncombe county sheriff department and placing those machines at stores in buncombe county.in light of this direct evidence that henderson amusement made cash payments to medford,jamie henderson statement from the december meeting that medford regularly received cash payments from henderson amusement was merely cumulative of evidence already before the jury.
the government also introduced the testimony of several video poker machine operators and store owners who attested to providing cash bribes to medford.these witnesses stated that such bribes were necessary for them to be able to operate video poker machines providing illegal cash without fear of prosecution.further,harrison,who worked for medford during a substantial period of the conspiracy,testified that medford requested and accepted cash payments from video poker machine operators on numerous occasions.
in light of this overwhelming evidence supporting the jury verdict,we reach a firm conclusion that the district court admission of the december recording could not reasonably be said to have substantially swayed the jury judgment.cooper,at.accordingly,we hold that even if the district court erred in admitting into evidence the recording of the december meeting,such error was harmless.
medford next argues that the district court deprived him of due process by denying his motion to sever his trial from that of his,penland medford contends that the district court denial of the motion prevented him from introducing penland exculpatory statements made to the fbi while cooperating with the government investigation.medford asserts that penland would have provided this evidence at medford trial if the two trials had been severed.
according to medford,penland told the fbi that he had not collected money from persons on medford behalf,nor had penland observed medford engaging in any wrongdoing.medford asserts that penland also told the fbi that when he gave medford cash received from pennington and medford asked the reason for the payment,penland told medford that the cash was a donation and pennington did care what medford did with it.
after being presented with the motion to sever,the district court ordered medford and penland to file an assurance that defendant penland will testify should the defendants motion be granted and the trial severed.in response to the district court order,penland filed a written representation stating,in relevant part,that penland can provide assurance to the court that he intends to cooperate with any subpoena issued by bobby lee medford however,penland response also stated that o bviously,facts and circumstances which may arise during a trial of medford,or,for that matter,a previous trial of penland,could alter the landscape sufficiently to cause him,in good faith,to retract his position stated herein emphasis added.
the district court reviewed penland representation and concluded that penland willingness to testify at a severed trial of defendant medford appears to be conditioned on penland being tried first.the district court held that penland representation did not demonstrate an unequivocal willingness to waive his fifth amendment rights and testify at a severed trial regardless which trial began first,as required under fourth circuit precedent.accordingly,the district court denied the defendants motion to sever.
