norman goldstein operated hotels,a business that provided hotel bookings for customers at discounted rates.when a customer made a reservation,immediately charged the customer credit card and the next day mailed the customer a confirmation and voucher for the hotel.the confirmation form stated that customers could cancel their reservations without penalty up to hours before their designated arrival date.however,did not place the actual hotel reservation when the customer made it.instead,typically contacted the designated hotel approximately three days before the customer was to arrive.on occasion,the hotel in question would not have rooms available and the customer purported reservation could not be honored.
five of unsatisfied customers testified at trial.some told of similar situations in which they arrived at a hotel,believing they had paid for rooms that had been reserved for them,only to discover that no reservation was in place,the hotel had received no money on their account,and no rooms were available.others testified that they cancelled their reservations within the period allowed but their credit cards were still charged for the rooms.some of these customers were unable to get refunds from and had to dispute the charges with their credit card companies.
chaniqua conner,a former employee who testified under a agreement,described the operation of business.the business employed seven people including goldstein,his,and his wife.goldstein identified himself as mike beer when he hired conner,but she later learned his real name.the office was small enough that conner could hear other telephone conversations from her desk,and from time to time conner heard goldstein identify himself as mike beer or one of several other aliases in telephone conversations with customers.goldstein assigned each alias a position such as reservation manager,manager,controller,or accounting department employee.indeed,at goldstein direction,conner and other employees falsified their own names in conversations with customers in order to make the business seem bigger.
received several calls each day from customers complaining about unavailable rooms,delayed refunds,or unauthorized credit card charges.all such calls were transferred to goldstein.it was during these calls that goldstein would often adopt different names,even taking on two or more in the same call as he purported to transfer a customer from one department to another.goldstein would sometimes direct conner or another employee to process a refund after having received a complaint,but that was not always the last word.on occasion,goldstein would further direct these employees to void refunds,which effectively cancelled them.he also told employees to some customers after their first charge had been refunded.in other instances he simply refused to issue a refund to a customer who had either cancelled a reservation or was without accommodations because a hotel had no vacancy,thereby forcing the customer to dispute the credit card charge through the issuing bank or company.
this latter practice is known as a chargeback,which describes a successful customer challenge to a credit card charge through the issuing entity,which in turn charges the amount back to the business.the result for the customer is the same in both a refund and a customer ultimately is not responsible to pay the disputed a business voluntarily gives a refund and involuntarily suffers a chargeback.the government introduced evidence demonstrating that chargeback rate and refund rate far exceeded both the nationwide and hotel industry averages.
the government introduced evidence concerning banking and credit card practices.maintained a merchant bank account with sterling national bank so that its customers could pay for hotels with a credit card.when a customer authorized a charge bank account was credited in that amount,and conversely it was debited when issued a refund or suffered a chargeback.sterling bank began monitoring merchant account because of an unusually high number of chargebacks,and the account was frequently overdrawn.the bank required to deposit more money in reserve and had at least weekly meetings with goldstein to try to keep the account in balance.when those efforts proved fruitless,sterling bank closed the account.
goldstein was indicted on one count of trafficking in and using credit card numbers without authorization and on four counts of making unauthorized charges to separate credit cards.he was convicted by a jury on all five counts,and the district court denied his motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial.
goldstein alleges that the district court erred by giving jury instructions with respect to count that were prejudicial and insufficient.the propriety of jury instructions is a question of law that we review de novo the question is whether the challenged instruction misled the jury as to the correct legal standard or did not adequately inform the jury on the law.united states pimentel,cir.we vacate the conviction only if the error was prejudicial we will not disturb the judgment if the error was harmless.an erroneous instruction is harmless if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.id.at.
goldstein acknowledges that the district court correctly instructed the jury that good faith is a complete defense to a fraud charge.however,he asserts that the instruction was undermined when the district court added language that improperly required the jury to find that goldstein good faith was objectively reasonable.see cheek united states,d holding that claimed belief need not be objectively reasonable.goldstein concedes that our review is for plain error because he made no objection at trial.united states bala,cir.
when we review for plain error,we examine the challenged language in context by looking at the instructions as a whole to determine if the jury was given a correct interpretation of the law.id.at.this standard requires an error that is plain and affects substantial rights.if those three conditions are met,we may exercise our discretion to review the error,but only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states rossomando,cir.after instructing the jury as to the elements of intent to defraud,the district court addressed the defense of good faith goldstein challenge is to the italicized words in the following passage 
since an essential element of the crime charged is intent to defraud,it follows that good faith on the part of the defendant is a complete defense to a charge of access device fraud.if the defendant actually believed that he was authorized to use the access devices and took reasonable steps to check out that belief,then the defendant acted in good faith.the defendant,however,has no burden to establish a defense of good faith.the burden is on the government to prove fraudulent intent and the consequent lack of good faith beyond a reasonable doubt.
in considering whether or not the defendant acted in good faith,you are instructed that a belief by the defendant,if such belief existed,that ultimately everything would work out so that no one would lose any money does not require a finding by you that he acted in good faith.no amount of honest belief on the part of the defendant that the transactions will somehow work out in the end will excuse him if he obtained or used an access device with intent to defraud.
as a practical matter,the
