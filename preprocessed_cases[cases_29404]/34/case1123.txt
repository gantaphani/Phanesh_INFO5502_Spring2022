alfredo serrano petitioner or serrano appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york trager,denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.petitioner claims that the state trial judge violated petitioner sixth amendment right to counsel when he issued orders barring all communications during two midday recesses from petitioner testimony.applying the deferential standard of review required by d,we hold that the state court decisions rejecting petitioner claim were not contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent and did not unreasonably apply that precedent.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of the writ.
background 
on the evening of may,petitioner stabbed and killed miriam molina,the mother of his young daughter.soon thereafter,new york state authorities charged him with two counts of murder in the second degree under new york penal law and,respectively.after rejecting an opportunity to plead guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a sentence of eight and to years imprisonment,petitioner proceeded to a jury trial in the supreme court of the state of new york in queens county.a jury convicted petitioner of one count of second degree murder,and on april,the court sentenced him to years to life in prison.
at trial,petitioner counsel repeatedly clashed with the judge over a variety of matters,including the judge rulings on certain lines of questioning and argument,the alleged bias of the judge against petitioner,and the judge imposition of limitations on communications between petitioner and his attorney.during the testimony of various witnesses,defense counsel persisted in asking the same question multiple times even after the judge had sustained objections to the question form or substance.defense counsel complained several times in the presence of the jury that the prosecution was receiving favored treatment,and declared at one point,this is not a trial,this is a tag team.
the trial judge did not conceal his exasperation with defense counsel contumacious behavior.at one sidebar conference,the judge stated that he was sick and tired of defense counsel telling him what the law is,and that he had tried more cases than counsel ha d.on another occasion,the judge told defense counsel that he was acting like a clown,and that his actions were abominable.at least three of defense counsel outbursts resulted in the imposition of a fine for contempt.
the dispute now before us stems from two of the many heated exchanges that took place between defense counsel and the trial judge.the first of these two exchanges occurred shortly after defense counsel had requested a five minute restroom break during his direct examination of petitioner.after defense counsel returned to the before the jury counsel began to confer with petitioner while petitioner was on the stand.the judge interrupted,instructing defense counsel not to speak with his client.counsel protested the court order,claiming that t he defendant always has a right to counsel and that counsel did not need the court permission to confer with his client.the trial judge responded by imposing a fine for contempt.
the second incident forming the basis of the instant appeal occurred during petitioner,specifically as he was questioned about whether he knew his daughter had had nightmares the night prior to the crime,a fact central to the defense theory of justification due to the alleged abuse of the child when under the mother care.upon calling a lunch recess during the testimony,the judge directed defense counsel not to speak to petitioner during the recess.counsel responded i will disobey that instruction,your honor.i will speak to my client at any point in time.counsel added that he had an absolute right to speak to his client at any point in the proceedings.in response to this defiance,the judge ordered counsel taken to jail.the judge then indicated,however,that he might reconsider his ruling and limit the bar on communications to discussions of ongoing testimony.counsel stated that he would not discuss petitioner testimony and attempted to clarify that the absolute right to which he had referred was a right to speak about other matters.the judge expressed doubt at counsel representation,stating counsel,i do know whether i can trust you b ecause you refuse to follow my directions during the entire course of this trial.i had to sanction you twice.before finally ruling,however,the judge sought further assurance that counsel would not discuss the ongoing testimony during the recess.at that point,counsel gave only indirect and evasive responses.when,for example,the judge reminded counsel not to discuss anything about the trial testimony,counsel responded i never said i would,judge.the conversation concluded when counsel again declared that his client ha d an absolute right to speak to counsel at any stage in the proceeding.the judge not only barred communications during the recess,but also ordered defense counsel taken into custody.the lunch recess lasted approximately ninety minutes.
serrano appealed his conviction to the appellate division,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court orders barring his communications with counsel had deprived him of his constitutional right to an attorney.the appellate division rejected his appeal on the merits,see people serrano,dep t,and the new york state court of appeals denied his request for leave to appeal,see,bellacosa.petitioner also filed a motion with the appellate division for reargument,and a motion with the trial court to vacate the judgment,both of which were denied.
proceeding pro se,serrano filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the petition claimed that the circus atmosphere created by the heated exchanges between his counsel and the court resulted in the denial of a fair trial in violation of the due process clause the trial court deprived him of his right to confer with his attorney during trial he received ineffective assistance of counsel and the legislature violated the constitution by failing to include extreme emotional distress as a defense to the crime for which petitioner was convicted.adopting the report and recommendation of magistrate judge robert levy,district judge david trager denied the petition in its entirety on may.judge trager also denied petitioner motion for a certificate of appealability,finding that petitioner ha d not demonstrated a substantial showing of a constitutional violation.on appeal,however,this court granted a certificate of appealability limited to the issue of whether serrano was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel by the trial court refusal to permit him to consult with counsel during breaks that occurred during the prosecutor of serrano.we also appointed counsel pursuant to a b.we denied petitioner appeal in all other respects.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a petition for habeas corpus.loliscio goord,cir.because serrano filed his petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,both this court and the district court must review his claim in accordance with aedpa deferential standard,as codified at d 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
see rosa mccray,cir.
a state court adjudicates a claim on the merits for purposes of d when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment even if the state court does not explicitly refer to either the federal claim or to relevant federal case law.gutierrez mcginnis,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the instant case meets that standard.the trial court squarely addressed and rejected petitioner claim that he had an absolute right to consult with his attorney during midday recesses from testimony.though the appellate division did not expressly refer to the sixth amendment claim in affirming the judgment of the trial court,it dismissed as without merit the claims raised in petitioner pro se supplemental brief,which included the claim.serrano,at see howard walker,cir concluding that claims were adjudicated on the merits where state court stated that it had considered the other contentions raised by defendant and conclude d that they were without merit citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also eze senkowski,cir.thus,we may rule for serrano only if he has demonstrated that the state courts rejection of his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases,or if it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court but reaches a different result.brown payton,d citing williams taylor,d see also rosa,at.the state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if the court applies such precedent to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner.brown.at see also williams,at.rosa,at.relief may also be available under this prong if the state court unreasonably extends a legal rule established by the supreme court or if it unreasonably fails to extend a legal rule to a context in which the rule reasonably should apply.see kennaugh miller,cir.in applying d,however,we bear in mind that unreasonable is not synonymous with incorrect.williams,at.a petitioner seeking relief under the unreasonable application prong must demonstrate some increment of incorrectness beyond error.rosa,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,the range of judgments that can be deemed reasonable may vary with the nature of the rule in question.see yarborough alvarado,d.thus,while very specific rules may not permit much leeway in their interpretation,the same is not true of more general rules,the meaning of which must emerge in application over the course of time.id.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case determinations.id.
where state courts summarily reject a claim on the merits without explanation,we must focus on the ultimate decisions of those courts,rather than on the courts reasoning,to determine whether the decisions were contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.aeid bennett,cir.but where,as here,the state trial court clearly indicates its reasons for rejecting a claim,we may apply a rebuttable presumption that the state appellate courts later unexplained orders upholding the trial court judgment rest upon the same ground provided by the trial court.ylst nunnemaker,d see also id.at.the maxim is that silence implies consent,not the courts generally behave accordingly,affirming without further discussion when they agree,not when they disagree,with the reasons given below.
under d,a federal court may also grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if the state adjudication of the claims resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.here,however,petitioner does not challenge the state courts factual findings he challenges only the courts conclusions of law.subsection of d is therefore inapplicable,and we conduct our analysis solely under d.see larrea bennett,cir.
ii.governing precedent 
in light of d restrictions,our analysis of petitioner claims focuses on the two supreme court cases which have addressed the sixth amendment right to counsel in the specific context of defendants who,like serrano,were prohibited by a judge from conferring with their attorney during a recess from their testimony.see perry leeke,d geders united states,d.
in geders,the supreme court held that a trial court deprived a defendant of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment when it ordered the defendant not to consult with his attorney during a overnight recess that the court had called during the defendant.see id.at.the court acknowledged that the trial judge,as governor of the trial must have broad power to cope with the complexities and contingencies inherent in the adversary process.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this includes a broad power to sequester witnesses before,during,and after their testimony,in order to restrain,inter alia,improper attempts to influence the testimony or tailoring of the testimony to that of earlier witnesses.id.at.because the witness in geders was also the defendant,however,the supreme court ruled that the sixth amendment sharply circumscribed the trial judge power to impose prolonged restrictions on communication between the witness and his attorney.id.at.an absolute bar on communications during a overnight recess,the court held,violated the constitutional right to counsel.id.at.
in so holding,the court observed that an accused and his or her counsel commonly use overnight recesses to review the day events and make important tactical decisions 
the lawyer may need to obtain from his client information made relevant by the day testimony,or he may need to pursue inquiry along lines not fully explored earlier.at the very least,the overnight recess during trial gives the defendant a chance to discuss with counsel the significance of the day events.our cases recognize that the role of counsel is important precisely because ordinarily a defendant is to understand and deal with the trial process without a lawyer guidance.
the court also emphasized that t here are a variety of ways to further the purpose served by sequestration without placing a sustained barrier to communication between a defendant and his lawyer.id.at.the trial judge,for example,could directly order counsel not to discuss the ongoing testimony during the break or could reschedule testimony to avoid long recesses.the prosecutors could also question the defendant during regarding whether coaching had occurred during the recess.see id.at.while these alternatives might not always prove effective,the conflict between the defendant right to consult with his attorney during a long overnight recess and the prosecutor desire to the defendant without the intervention of counsel must,under the sixth amendment,be resolved in favor of the right to the assistance and guidance of counsel.id.at.
thirteen years later,the supreme court considered whether the geders rule applied to a defendant whom the trial court had ordered not to consult with his attorney during a break from direct examination.see perry,at.the perry court reiterated that an accused constitutional right to counsel is of fundamental importance,id.at,but emphasized that there is no constitutional right to discuss testimony with counsel while that testimony is in progress,id.at.the court further explained that when a defendant assumes the role of witness,the rules that generally apply to other witnesses are generally applicable to him or her as well.id.at.thus,during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and the lawyer would relate to the ongoing testimony,the trial judge has the power to maintain the status quo by briefly barring communications.id.at.the court held that t he interruption in geders was of a different character because the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs during an overnight recess would encompass matters that go beyond the content of the defendant own testimony.id.at.in contrast,during a short recess in which it is appropriate to presume that nothing but the testimony will be discussed,the testifying defendant does not have a constitutional right to advice,and the trial court may bar consultation.id.the perry court acknowledged that the line between the facts of geders and the facts of perry was a thin one.id.at.nevertheless,it was a line of constitutional dimension.id.
in morgan bennett,cir,we interpreted geders and perry as together 
stand ing for the principle that a court should not,absent an important need to protect a countervailing interest,restrict the defendant ability to consult with his or her attorney,but that when such a need is present and is difficult to fulfill in other ways,a carefully tailored,limited restriction on the defendant right to consult counsel is permissible.
id.at in accordance with that principle,we held in morgan that the state court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent where the court had ordered that defense counsel not disclose to the defendant that a certain witness was planning to testify.id.at.the trial judge in morgan had issued the order because of allegations that associates of the defendant had threatened and intimidated the witness.id.similarly,in united states padilla,cir,we a direct criminal appeal not involving d that a district court could,consistent with geders and perry,order defense counsel not to reveal to their clients an ongoing investigation into a defendant alleged involvement in jury and witness tampering.id.at.
other lower courts have diverged from this court and from each other in their understanding of geders and perry.though this court has explained,for example,that t he difference between perry and geders is not the quantity of communication restrained but its constitutional quality,padilla,at,the new york court of appeals concluded that the critical factor in determining whether a violation of the right to counsel occurred is the length of time dividing the defendant access to counsel contemplated by the trial court ruling,people joseph.compare,with united states mclaughlin,tatel,dissenting arguing that even a bar on communications conflicts with supreme court precedent when it precludes defense counsel from obtain ing information from their clients prior to making important tactical decisions.courts have also disagreed with respect to whether an overnight restriction on communications that only bars discussion of a defendant testimony will satisfy the demands of the sixth amendment under geders and perry.compare united states cobb,cir holding that restriction on communications during weekend recess from violated sixth amendment as interpreted in geders and perry even where restriction only barred discussion of ongoing testimony,with webb state,explaining that order restricting communications during an overnight recess before the start of would not violate sixth amendment where the order only barred discussion of defendant testimony.particularly relevant to the instant case,of course,is the question of whether a bar on communications during a one or two hour midday recess is more analogous to the facts of geders or to those of perry this question too has failed to produce a consensus.compare albrecht horn,d,i n the context of an ongoing,a recess of an hour or two is more akin to the recess in perry than the overnight recess in geders,with people enrique,dep t milonas,dissenting a lunch recess,particularly a one,is plainly something more than the brief break that occurred in perry and constitutes a more severe curtailment of the right to counsel.see also geders,at.declining to decide whether geders rule would apply to cases involving brief recesses and citing as an example of such a case united states leighton,cir,which involved an minute recess.
given the tenuity of the constitutional line drawn in geders and perry,this diversity of interpretations comes as no surprise.rather than create a rule,the supreme court established an intensely inquiry,the precise contours of which have yet to emerge.in such circumstances,where the governing rule remains so roughly defined,we are less likely to conclude that a given interpretation or application of supreme court law is contrary to or an objectively unreasonable application of supreme court precedent for purposes of d.see yarborough.at the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case determinations.wade herbert,cir where the supreme court has spoken only in general terms various outcomes may be reasonable applications of the court precedents.
iii.application of supreme court precedent 
the state trial court limitation on communications did not result in a decision that was contrary to geders or perry.see williams,at.noting that word contrary is commonly understood to mean diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed.citation omitted.nor did the state court confront a set of facts that was materially indistinguishable from geders or perry but reach a different result.brown.at.even the longer of the two recesses at issue in the instant case lasted less than ten percent of the time of the recess in geders.
the outcome of the case thus hinges on whether the state courts decisions applied the geders and perry principles in an objectively unreasonable manner.as discussed above,we may find objective unreasonableness where the state courts unreasonably extend a supreme court precedent or unreasonably fail to extend a legal rule to a context in which the rule reasonably should apply.see kennaugh,at.no such unreasonable application of the law took place here,however.with regard to the first of the orders directing counsel not to confer with his client,the bar on communications was only momentary immediately after chastising the defense attorney and conferring with counsel for both parties regarding the propriety of defense counsel actions,the judge brought the jury back into the courtroom and directed that the testimony continue.the bar on communications was thus even shorter in duration than the restriction at issue in perry,and it was appropriate to presume that nothing but the testimony w ould be discussed.perry,at.with regard to the longer,bar on communications during lunch,the trial judge imposed the restriction only after indicating to counsel that he was willing to limit the ban to discussions of ongoing testimony if counsel gave sufficient assurance to the judge that he was willing to comply with such an order counsel squandered that opportunity by providing coy and evasive responses,and by again declaring that petitioner ha d an absolute right to speak to counsel at any stage in the proceeding.given counsel repeated defiance of the trial court rulings,and his refusal to provide a consistent,straightforward guarantee that he would comply with a limited restriction on discussing ongoing testimony,the judge was again entitled to presume that testimony would be discussed during the recess,particularly in that the lunch recess interrupted a key moment in the,when defense counsel had an incentive to influence his client testimony.see see also id.at.t he judge must have the power to maintain the status quo during a brief recess in which there is a virtual certainty that any conversation between the witness and the lawyer would relate to the ongoing testimony.
in his brief,petitioner takes issue with the trial court reliance on people enrique,a state court decision rejecting a sixth amendment challenges that arose out of a midday bar on communications.see enrique,dep t,aff,adopting appellate division reasoning.the trial court in the instant case referred to enrique in disregarding counsel objection to the restrictions on communication with petitioner during the lunch recess.petitioner now argues that the court reliance on enrique was unreasonable because,petitioner contends,enrique was wrongly decided.petitioner argument is misguided.
according to petitioner,enrique simplistically concluded that any luncheon recess,regardless of the length,should in every case be considered the sort of limited interruption
