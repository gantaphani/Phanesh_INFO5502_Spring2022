defendant tavon robinson was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine,possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine,a being a felon in possession of a firearm,g and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense,c a.
robinson appeals both firearms convictions and his sentence,alleging prosecutorial misconduct,insufficient evidence,and improper sentencing.we affirm.
in,dea special agent david ditullio agreed to purchase two ounces of crack cocaine for from adam ellard as part of an undercover drug investigation.unable to locate any crack cocaine for the deal,ellard contacted willie hester,whom he had seen packaging crack on a previous occasion with another man,norman barnes.hester agreed to sell ellard grams of crack cocaine,but conditioned the sale on his accompanying ellard to the deal.
hester picked up ellard in a honda,followed by a ford with new hampshire plates.the ford had three occupants robinson in the driver seat,stephen tucker in the front passenger seat,and barnes in the back.the two cars traveled to a parking lot in dorchester to complete the deal with ditullio.ellard exited the honda and entered the passenger side of ditullio vehicle.he told ditullio that the crack cocaine was in the ford and requested the.ditullio showed ellard the money,let him count it,but would not give it to him unless he produced the crack cocaine.ellard returned to the honda to consult with hester,who told him to go speak with barnes in the ford.barnes informed ellard he would not produce the drugs without any money.in an attempt to compromise,ellard had ditullio back his vehicle up to the rear of the ford.ditullio again refused to give ellard the money without the drugs.
frustrated at the stalled deal,robinson exited the driver seat of the ford,walked to the front of the hood for a few moments and then proceeded to ditullio vehicle.speaking with ditullio through the passenger window,robinson removed a clear plastic bag from his jacket pocket and placed it on the front passenger seat.ditullio gave robinson the money,and robinson began walking back to the ford.as law enforcement officers moved in for an arrest,robinson fled briefly before being apprehended.he was arrested and police found and a clear plastic bag containing marijuana and crack cocaine in his possession.
after seizure of the ford,an inspection at a garage revealed two loaded semiautomatic pistols wrapped in a and hidden inside a small space in front of the engine compartment near the front of the hood 
the next day,officer conners overheard robinson and barnes conversing in their shared holding cell.according to officer conners,robinson remarked to barnes,it not crack anyway.it only coke.they find that out when they do the lab tests.officer conners also heard robinson tell barnes that when they came from everywhere,i could have gone boom,boom.
at trial,in his opening statement,robinson counsel admitted his client guilt on the drug charges but argued that he was unaware of the firearms presence.robinson was convicted on both firearms charges.the district court denied robinson motion for judgment of acquittal and sentenced him to months 
claims for prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed under the harmless error standard if the defendant contemporaneously objected to challenged statements.united states auch,cir.if no objections were made,challenged statements are reviewed for plain error.united states,cir.we review de novo whether a challenged statement by the prosecutor during closing argument was improper.whether the misconduct,if any,warrants a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
we review claims of insufficient evidence de novo.united states hall,cir.a conviction will be affirmed if,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states,cir.we also review de novo claims that the district court committed errors of law at sentencing.united states pho,cir.
robinson raises three issues on appeal prosecutorial misconduct,insufficient evidence,and improper sentencing.we address each issue in turn.
robinson first argument is that the prosecution repeatedly engaged in a pattern of misconduct during both and closing argument when it systematically portrayed him as a habitual drug user and career drug dealer.he contends that the government questions about the drug deal with ditullio and repeated questions and references to his prior history of drug trafficking constitute reversible error because they confused the jury into convicting him on the gun charges based mostly on his prior history of drug trafficking.
robinson argues that the government improperly elicited prejudicial testimony regarding the drug deal with ditullio.according to robinson,such testimony was unnecessary because he never challenged his guilt defense counsel informed the government prior to trial that he would not deny his role in the drug deal with ditullio,defense counsel opening statement conceded his guilt to the drug trafficking charges,at no time during the trial did he otherwise contest his guilt,and on the morning of the third day he entered guilty pleas to both drug charges.thus,he argues,the government was relieved of its burden to prove that robinson engaged in drug trafficking as part of its charge that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.robinson contends that the sole reason the government focused on this drug deal was to make the jury believe it was to convict him for his drug trafficking activities and not the firearms charges.
this argument is unavailing for several reasons.first,although he conceded his role in the drug deal with ditullio prior to trial and during his opening statement,robinson remained free to change his mind whether he would contest both drug trafficking charges at some point in the trial.he did not formally enter guilty pleas to both charges until the morning of the third day of trial,and until that time the government still had the burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.therefore,it was proper to present evidence that robinson engaged in drug trafficking.
robinson claims the government also engaged in misconduct when it repeatedly questioned him about his prior drug use and involvement in drug trafficking during his and when it returned to this theme in closing arguments.he argues that these questions and closing statements constitute misconduct and violate.b.
on several occasions during robinson,the government attempted to question him about his history in dealing and using drugs at a sidebar after repeated defense objections,the government told the district court that it was not inquiring about prior bad acts,but rather showing that robinson knew about the dangers of dealing drugs in order to prove the in furtherance element of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.several times after the sidebar,the government again attempted to ask robinson about his drug dealing history in an effort to prove why he would bring a gun to a drug deal and how he knew prices of drugs.
evidence of a defendant other bad acts is proper only if that evidence meets the requirements of both rule b and rule.united states tse,cir.rule b evidence must be specially relevant and can not include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.united states flemmi,cir united states washington,cir.even assuming that the district court properly excluded the government questions to robinson about his prior history,robinson can not show prejudice from these questions 
robinson claims that the mere asking of these questions was prejudicial.see united states meserve,cir t he question itself may nevertheless prejudice a defendant because of the weight a jury gives to the questions asked by a prosecutor.however,robinson never answered many of the questions because the court sustained his objections.thus,the required showing of prejudice becomes more difficult.see id.noting that where challenged questions are left unanswered,the harmless error analysis is likely to weigh in favor of the appellee see also united states innamorati,cir prejudicial effect of challenged questions lessened when questions were not answered.
in response to a question asked without objection,robinson admitted that it was not out of the ordinary for him to be selling drugs.moreover,on the third day of the trial,robinson pled guilty to the two drug charges.at this point,the jury had heard considerable evidence regarding robinson drug deal with ditullio.therefore,it is difficult to see how the questions prejudiced robinson.
robinson cites to two main cases to support his contention that reversal is required.however,these cases are distinguishable.first,he cites united states crawford,cir.in that case,the prosecution asked questions insinuating that the defendant was a member of a group of narcotics users and sellers.the court found reversible error,in part,because the only purpose in asking those questions was to degrade the defendant and to prejudice the jury against him.id.at.here,the government did have a legitimate purpose in asking the questions to provide the jury with a reason why robinson would bring a firearm to a drug deal.the misconduct inherent in the baseless attacks in crawford is not present here.
robinson similarly cites to united states newman,cir.in that case,we found error in the government questions of whether the defendant knew what a con man or confidence game was.as was the case in crawford,we found the government had no justifiable purpose for that line of questioning,other than,as the defendant suggests,to discredit him by insinuation.id.at.again,the same is not true here because the government did have a legitimate reason for pursuing its line of questioning.
robinson next claims the prosecution committed reversible error when it asked him on whether two law enforcement witnesses lied on the witness stand.agent genese had testified that when he asked robinson whether he knew the cocaine he sold to ditullio was real or fake,robinson responded that he did not know.during robinson,he denied saying that he was unsure what he sold.the prosecution then asked him if agent genese was lying 
at another point,officer conners testified that he heard robinson state that when the officers surrounded him just prior to his arrest,he could have gone boom,boom.during robinson,he denied making the statement and responded that officer conners could have been mistaken.the government then asked robinson if conners was lying,to which he answered that he did not know and was unable to say 
this court has held it is improper for an attorney to ask a witness whether another witness lied on the stand.united states thiongo,cir citing united states gaines,cir noting that such practice is improper because credibility judgments are for the jury.furthermore,g iven the faith that the jury may place in the word of a law enforcement officer,it is unfair to force a criminal defendant to choose between recanting and calling a law officer a liar.united states fernandez,cir.
because robinson objected to the government question asking whether agent genese was lying,it is reviewed for harmless error.see united states sullivan,cir analyzing a similar question under the harmless error standard.while the question was improper,any resulting error was harmless because the district court sustained robinson objection and relieved him from answering.robinson was not forced to choose between recanting and calling a law officer a liar.fernandez,at.the only benefit the government gained from the question was highlighting the discrepancy between the testimony of agent genese and robinson.as was the case in sullivan,t hat there was a contradiction between robinson testimony and agent genese was obvious.pointing out the obvious most likely scored the government,at most,rhetorical points.sullivan,at.
robinson did not object when the government asked him if officer connors was lying.therefore,we review this question for plain error see fernandez,at.t o constitute plain error the questions must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.id.the prosecution question here was not plain error because robinson fails to show prejudice similar to the question about agent genese testimony,this question merely drew the jury attention to the discrepancy between robinson and officer conner testimony.thus,it is difficult to imagine that the improper framing of these questions affected the outcome of the trial.fernandez,at.
robinson also argues that the government continued to impermissibly vouch for the law enforcement officers in its closing argument.in relevant part,the prosecutor argued 
ladies and gentleman,if you believe that the officers of the united states,if you believe that these agents got on that stand with all those years of experience and in the face of their oath stood up there and lied in their testimony and you believe they did that,then acquit the defendant.then acquit the defendant.
because there was no contemporaneous objection,we review for plain error.united states wilkerson,cir.improper vouching occurs when the government place s the prestige of the united states behind a witness by making personal assurances about the credibility of a witness,united states,cir,or implies that the jury should credit the government evidence simply because the government can be trusted.united states,cir.the government statement in this case did neither and does not constitute plain error.
the government statement merely invited the jurors to acquit robinson if they believed that agent genese and officer conners were lying.this is not the type of improper vouching present in or because the government neither made statements about the witnesses credibility nor implied that they could be trusted based on their affiliation with the united states.moreover,these statements do not rise to the level of plain error.see wilkerson,at no plain error where prosecutor rebuttal included statement that officers did stretch the truth here sullivan,at no plain error where government closing argument stated that one witness came off pretty believable,another could have lied about anything,and that all of them were telling the truth.
in addition to arguing that the government improperly vouched for law enforcement witnesses in its closing argument,robinson alleges other instances of prejudice in the government summation.because he failed to object to the government closing argument,we review for plain error.sullivan,at.we will not notice error unless it caused a miscarriage of justice or seriously undermined the integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states josleyn,cir see also united states taylor,cir referring to this standard as.
robinson claims that the government first statement in its closing argument directed the jury to convict him based on his alleged life of crime rather than his alleged possession of firearms 
while arguments urging a jury to act in any capacity other than as the impartial arbiter of the facts in the case before it are improper,united states manning,cir,the government closing argument in this case did not request the jury to act in that manner.in assaying the appropriateness of a prosecutor remarks,context frequently determines meaning.united states sepulveda,cir.here,the discussion following the challenged statement focused on the facts attendant to robinson arrest,not to his prior drug dealing.the government then spoke for some time about the fundamentals of the law of the case before it mentioned robinson and his alleged life of crime.even when the government did mention his prior history,it constituted only a small portion of the entire summation.taken in context,the prosecutor remarks are not plain error.
robinson next alleges that the government closing argument impermissibly returned to his history as a drug dealer.robinson brief selectively excerpts sentences from the government summation and dissects each sentence to arrive at his conclusion
