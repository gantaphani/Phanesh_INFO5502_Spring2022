roger day was convicted of wire fraud,conspiracy to commit wire fraud,conspiracy to commit money laundering,and conspiracy to commit smuggling for his role as the mastermind of a dollar scheme to defraud the department of defense dod.the crux of day scheme involved the knowing supply of defective and nonconforming spare parts for use in military aircraft,vehicles,and weapons systems.many of these were critical application items that is,parts whose failure could jeopardize the lives of military personnel and the success of military operations.the district court imposed a sentence of years in prison along with substantial fines,forfeitures,and restitution.day now appeals his convictions and sentence on a variety of grounds.finding his arguments without merit,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in late and early,day began running a business scheme involving his,susan crotty neufeld,and his friends,nathan carroll and greg stewart.acting at day direction,neufeld,carroll,and stewart would set up companies that could bid on contracts for the defense logistics agency dla,the agency within the dod responsible for acquiring parts for the military services.using day software program,the companies would then bid en masse on value dla contracts.when one of the newly formed companies won a contract,day would purchase the necessary parts and have them shipped to neufeld or carroll,who would in turn deliver the parts to a packaging company for shipping to the dla to complete the contract.day would then share a portion of the profit with the others.
the arrangement between day and his lasted three years,during which the various companies secured some contracts worth approximately.like all too many ideas,however,this scheme was too good to be true.the trick was in the parts rather than delivering parts that complied with the exacting military specifications called for in the various contracts,day would purchase similar sounding yet cheaper and nonconforming items.for example,instead of the special military aircraft dome antennas that were the subject of one contract,day obtained and directed his to deliver ordinary citizens band radio antennas.similarly,rather than the valuable infrared halogen light filters requested by the dla for nighttime use on f fighter jets,day and his delivered noncomplying recessed lighting components.percent of the contracts obtained during the scheme involved critical application items,or items that the military had determined to be essential to weapon system operation or the safety of operating personnel.when all was said and done,day purchased the various nonconforming parts for,on average,just of the amount that he received back in payment from the government.
the success of day scheme was predicated on the fact that,due to issues of cost and efficiency,the dla could not individually inspect each delivered part for quality assurance prior to paying out many of its contracts.thus,instead of rejecting noncomplying parts upon receipt and refusing to make payment,the dla typically punished companies who had shipped such parts by debarring them from winning future awards.yet when the dla identified the companies used by day and his as the proper subject of debarment orders,day circumvented those orders through the simple expedient of instructing his to form new companies,which could place and win bids on contracts anew.
early on in the scheme,in may,day moved to mexico,where he directed neufeld,carroll,and stewart through emails,phone calls,and internet chats.he initially instructed the three to route the proceeds of the scheme to him in mexico in the form of checks that he would deposit in a belizean bank account.however,the bank eventually shut down day account,leaving him without an easy way to pocket the proceeds of his project.day reacted by instructing carroll to convert his funds into gold and to physically bring the gold to him in mexico.
the task of purchasing and then transporting the gold to day in mexico involved several complicated steps.first,day told carroll to purchase a large quantity of gold some ounces in gold bars and ounces in gold coins from a gold dealer in arizona and to have the gold shipped to carroll residence in new jersey.however,because day did not wish to enter the united states to transport the gold personally,he instead asked other individuals to transport the gold for him.thus,in july,carroll drove gold bars worth more than million from new jersey to houston,texas,where he met juerg mehr,an auto mechanic whom day had asked to help hide the gold inside the hollow front bumper of a toyota land cruiser.once the gold was hidden,carroll picked up stewart and drove across the border where they met up with day.the three of them then drove to day home in lo de marcos,where after waiting until nighttime,they the gold out of the land cruiser bumper and placed it inside day home.
the next effort to transport gold to day in mexico did not meet with the same success,as carroll was arrested by mexican authorities while attempting to cross the border in september.although he was released shortly thereafter,the arrest left carroll unable to travel to mexico and day looking for a new courier.day eventually recruited glenn teal,a former law enforcement officer.in february,teal flew to houston where he met carroll,mehr,and a fourth individual.together they hid roughly worth of gold that carroll had driven down from new jersey inside the rear door panel of an austrian pinzgauer military transport vehicle that belonged to day.teal then drove the pinzgauer into mexico,where he met day,and the two transported the gold together to day home in lo de marcos.
within a month of this second delivery,however,the scheme began to unravel.carroll and stewart had with law enforcement officers in february,after which day sent carroll an email instructing him to stop bidding on the dla contracts.carroll was arrested soon thereafter,on march.day then abandoned his mexican residence,assumed multiple fake identities,and began recruiting additional individuals to help him transport his gold,first from mexico back to the united states and then to a gold dealer in canada.finally,after more than a year on the run,day was arrested in july by mexican authorities at the cancun international airport.he was subsequently detained at a mexican prison where he awaited extradition to the united states.
in august,a federal grand jury indicted day for wire fraud conspiracy,wire fraud,aggravated identity theft,money laundering conspiracy,h smuggling conspiracy,and obstruction of justice.in december,the mexican government agreed to extradite day to the united states on all charges other than the identity theft and obstruction counts.
after his extradition to the united states,day was scheduled to be tried by a jury in the district court for the eastern district of virginia in august.
prior to the trial,day filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude a variety of evidence characterized as uncharged money laundering and miscellaneous bad acts on the grounds that such evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and irrelevant to the offenses that were actually charged.in particular,day counsel sought to bar the government from introducing evidence concerning day use of his belizean and other bank accounts to deposit proceeds from his scheme,his use of various false names and identifications,and his purchase of several expensive watches while living in mexico.after considering day arguments,the trial court denied the motion to exclude those disputed items of evidence,reasoning that they were really part and parcel of the money laundering scheme and not attempts to slam day character.
during the trial,the government introduced testimony from a number of witnesses.one was tom higginbotham,a dla engineer who tested several of the nonconforming parts that the government purchased from day and his.on of higginbotham,day counsel sought to admit into evidence an internal agency report that had concluded that some of the parts higginbotham tested had been mishandled by a government investigator in the case.
the government objected to the report admission under rule of the federal rules of evidence,arguing that it concerned a collateral matter whose probative value would be substantially outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues.the trial court agreed,reasoning that the report does not suggest that any of the evidence is tainted,or wrong in this case,a characterization with which defense counsel concurred.the court accordingly ruled that the report would yield little probative value,while posing a high risk of prejudice.the court did,however,permit day to the agent who had allegedly mishandled the evidence regarding the ways in which he may have violated agency procedures.
at the close of the trial,the court turned to the task of instructing the jury.during the charge conference,the government sought an instruction on aiding and abetting liability.day counsel did not object,and the trial court proceeded to instruct the jury that day could be held liable under an aiding and abetting theory.
the trial judge also instructed the jury on the meaning of the word proceeds as it is used in the money laundering statute,a b.specifically,the judge instructed the jury without objection that the term proceeds includes any interest in property that someone acquires or retains as a result of the commission of a specified unlawful activity.
on august,the jury unanimously found day guilty on all counts.during day sentencing hearing,the district court determined that based on his convictions and applicable sentencing enhancements,day guidelines range was months imprisonment.one of the enhancements that the court found applicable was for obstruction of justice,which the court determined to be warranted because day had attempted to bribe united states and mexican officials,attempted to escape while in mexico,and at least plotted an escape while in jail in virginia.
after calculating the guidelines range,the court considered the a sentencing factors and determined that the month sentence was appropriate.in particular,the trial judge noted that the nature and circumstances of the offense are just absolutely vile,and that with respect to his character,day had exhibited absolutely no conscience and no regret.the judge also explained that the need to protect the public from further crimes by day was a paramount consideration in his sentencing determination because if day was released today he would think of his next scheme before sunset and would start to put it in action tomorrow.finally,in addition to the term of imprisonment,the court imposed on day a fine of million,restitution of more than million,and forfeiture consisting of gold,vehicles,and more than million in cash.
day now appeals his convictions and sentences,raising challenges on a number of grounds.we address each in turn.
day initial arguments concern the trial court decision to instruct the jury that he could be convicted under an aiding and abetting theory.day counsel did not object to the aiding and abetting instruction,so we review his claims for plain error.see puckett united states,d.as explained below,his claims fail the first prong of this standard,for the jury instruction was not erroneous.
day first argues that his convictions should be reversed because the trial court aiding and abetting instruction amounted to a constructive amendment of his indictment.a constructive amendment,also known as a fatal variance,happens when the government,through its presentation of evidence or its argument,or the district court,through its instructions to the jury,or both,broadens the bases for conviction beyond those charged in the indictment.united states roe,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.day asserts that the aiding and abetting instruction broadened the bases of conviction in his case because his indictment neither mentioned nor charged that particular theory of liability.
day argument fails for the simple reason that as this court and other courts have repeatedly held a defendant may be convicted of aiding and abetting under an indictment which charges only the principal offense.united states duke,cir see also,united states mcknight,cir united states galifa,cir.indeed,we observed just two years ago,in united states ashley,that aiding and abetting liability need not be charged in an indictment,cir,cert.denied.
this conclusion follows ineluctably from the rule against constructive amendments itself,which is focused not on particular theories of liability but on the offenses charged in an indictment.that is,a constructive amendment occurs only where an indictment is altered to change the elements of the offense charged,such that the defendant is actually convicted of a crime other than that charged in the indictment.united states randall,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.yet as we explained in ashley,aiding and abetting liability does not set forth an essential element of the offense with which the defendant is charged or itself create a separate offense.at.instead,aiding and abetting simply describes the way in which a defendant conduct resulted in the violation of a particular law.id.we therefore reject day contention that the aiding and abetting jury instruction was a constructive amendment.
day next argues that his convictions should be reversed because the aiding and abetting jury instruction violated the extradition rule of specialty.as expressed in the united states extradition treaty with mexico,the rule provides that a person extradited under this treaty shall not be detained,tried or punished in the territory of the requesting party for an offense other than that for which extradition has been granted.extradition treaty between the united states of america and the united mexican states,may,extradition treaty.day contends that the aiding and abetting instruction violated the rule in this case because mexico did not grant or even consider extradition on the basis of aiding and abetting liability.
although the government disputes day contention on the merits,it argues as a threshold matter that day lacks standing to raise the specialty violation in the first place.as we have noted before,the circuits are split on the question of whether an individual defendant has standing to raise a specialty violation,and the fourth circuit has yet to rule on the matter.united states davis,cir.the courts that have declined to find individual standing take the view that only an offended nation can complain about the purported violation of an extradition treaty.united states kaufman,cir per curiam denying petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc see also,shapiro ferrandina,cir.in contrast,other courts have held that an individual may raise whatever objections the extraditing country would have been entitled to raise.united states cuevas,cir see also,united states diwan,cir.
because we conclude that day specialty argument fails on the merits,however,we need not resolve the government standing argument now.to be sure,courts must resolve jurisdictional article iii standing issues before proceeding to consider the merits of a claim.steel citizens for a better env t,d.but the standing requirement at issue here does not flow from article iii,for there is little question that an individual who is extradited for one offense but then tried for a completely different one suffers a concrete injury that is both fairly traceable to that prosecution and redressable by a favorable judicial ruling.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.the standing question here instead involves the prudential requirement that the interest a litigant seeks to assert must be within the zone of interests that the statute or in this case,treaty is designed to protect.see,shapiro,at noting that the rule of specialty is designed to protect the asylum state dignity and interests,not the interests of the accused.
unlike article iii standing,issues of prudential standing are and may be pretermitted in favor of a straightforward disposition on the merits.finstuen crutcher,cir internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,this court and others have assumed without deciding that an individual defendant has standing to assert a specialty violation where the defendant position is readily disposed of on other grounds.see,davis,at united states sensi.that is the case here as well.
with respect to the merits,the flaw in day specialty argument is fundamentally the same as the flaw in his constructive amendment argument aiding and abetting is a theory of liability,not a separate offense.yet as the supreme court explained in its seminal decision recognizing the rule of specialty,united states rauscher,the rule is keyed to particular offenses it bars trying an extradited defendant for crimes other than the offense with which he is charged in the proceedings for his extradition.emphasis added.the treaty between the united states and mexico reinforces this point as it,too,prohibits the trial of a person for an offense for which extradition has not been granted.extradition treaty.
thus,a paradigmatic example of a specialty violation would be a case in which the requesting state seeks extradition of a defendant for one offense,such as drug trafficking,but then proceeds to try the defendant on a different offense,such as securities fraud.such a prosecution would violate the norm of international comity upon which the rule of specialty is premised.after all,if the united states wishes to protect its own citizens from prosecutions when they are extradited for trial in a foreign nation,so too must it honor the same limitation in the reciprocal situation.see united states andonian,cir.
the rule concern with unexpected prosecutions on unextradited offenses accordingly makes great sense.but aiding and abetting liability,far from being a separate offense,is closely linked to the principal violation.its capacity to surprise or prejudice either the extradited defendant or the extraditing sovereign is therefore sharply limited.moreover,the rule of specialty has never been used to limit a requesting state ability to try a defendant for an extradited offense under a particular theory of liability,rule of evidence,or rule of procedure.see,united states thirion,cir rule of specialty not violated by jury instruction regarding theory of vicarious liability united states flores,cir rule of specialty has never been construed to permit foreign intrusion into the evidentiary or procedural rules of the requisitioning state.consistent with this long line of decisions and further undercutting day claim that the rule of specialty required mexico to make a determination as to whether he could be tried under an aiding and abetting theory the extradition treaty between the united states and mexico makes absolutely no mention of theories of liability.see extradition treaty.
we accordingly hold that where,as here,a defendant is tried for the exact offenses described in his extradition agreement,the principle of specialty does not bar a trial court from instructing the jury that it may convict on such offenses under an unmentioned aiding and abetting theory.
day presses an additional specialty argument with respect to the trial court sentence of forfeiture,which he contends was not mentioned in his extradition agreement.this,too,is without merit.for like the issue of jury instructions regarding particular theories of liability,a district court decision to impose a judgment of forfeiture is collateral to the rule concern over prosecutions on offenses.a forfeiture judgment is not a criminal offense,but rather a particular form of punishment for otherwise proscribed conduct.united states saccoccia,cir.thus,as the first circuit explained in saccoccia,a defendant may be subjected to a forfeiture order even if extradition was not specifically granted in respect to the forfeiture allegations.id.underscoring this fact,the extradition treaty says nothing about limitations on forfeiture.see extradition treaty.we therefore hold that the rule of specialty was not violated by the forfeiture judgment imposed against day.
day next challenges his conviction for conspiracy to commit transportation money laundering in violation of a b i.the statute makes it a crime to transport 
a monetary instrument or funds from a place in the united states to or through a place outside the united states knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.
a b i.day arguments concern three aspects of this statute first,whether the government proved that day transported gold with the requisite design to conceal second,whether gold is a monetary instrument or funds covered under the statute and third,whether the trial court issued an improper jury instruction on the meaning of the term proceeds.we consider these arguments in turn.
day first argument involves the statute requirement that a defendant must transport a monetary instrument or funds knowing that such transportation is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds.a b i.day contends that the government did not prove the necessary design to conceal because even though day and his confederates hid the gold in the process of transporting it across the mexican border,the government did not prove that the purpose of the concealment was to hide the location,source,or ownership of the gold from the government.we review this challenge for sufficiency of the evidence,asking whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
the essence of day argument is that the outcome of his case is dictated by the supreme court decision in cuellar united states,d.in that case,the supreme court held that there was insufficient evidence to convict a defendant of transportation money laundering where the evidence only established that the defendant hid cash proceeds of drug trafficking under a floorboard in his car for the purpose of transporting it across the border to mexico.id.at.as the court explained,t here is a difference between concealing something to transport it,which is not punishable under the statute,and transporting something to conceal it,which is.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in cuellar,however,there was insufficient evidence of the latter purpose that is,no evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the transportation was designed to conceal an attribute listed in the statute.id.at.in fact,the only purpose of the transportation to which the government own expert witness testified in cuellar was to compensate the leaders of the operation.id.at.so too here,argues day,because even though the gold was hidden in order to get it across the border,the purpose of the transportation was simply to get the gold to mexico in order to compensate him.
we do not think cuellar sustains day argument.although it held that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute,id.at,cuellar also made clear that a jury may infer the requisite design to conceal based on circumstantial evidence that the defendant knew that taking the funds to mexico would have had one of the relevant effects listed in the statute,id.at.in cuellar,no such circumstantial evidence existed because the government did not point to any evidence in the record to support such an inference.id.but here,the government has pointed to a record replete with evidence showing that day not only knew that transporting the gold to mexico would have the effect of concealing the location,nature,and source of his unlawful proceeds,but also that he transported the gold for precisely that purpose.
for example,just before glenn teal brought the second shipment of gold to day in mexico in february,day told him that he did not want to leave the gold at carroll house in new jersey.as day explained to carroll,he wanted to move the gold because he was afraid that things were going to get hot given that stewart had just had a with law enforcement officers.indeed,day fears were confirmed when,shortly after he made these remarks,carroll was arrested and his house was searched on march a search that would have turned up the gold amounting to roughly of the fraud scheme proceeds had day not successfully concealed its location by transporting it to mexico just days earlier.a rational jury could infer based on this evidence that one of the reasons why day had the gold moved to mexico was to conceal its location from american authorities who he correctly feared were on the verge of discovering its whereabouts a quintessential act targeted by the transportation money laundering statute.
moreover,the government adduced additional evidence indicating that day intended through transportation of the gold to conceal the source,nature,and ownership of the fraud proceeds.for instance,day steadfastly declined to move the gold himself at least eight witnesses testified that day asked them to help move the gold into and out of mexico on his behalf.day also used a false name when negotiating with a gold dealer to exchange the gold for a wire transfer.and a reasonable jury could have relied on the byzantine path that the gold took during the conspiracy.just like day himself after his scheme unraveled,it can truly be said in this case that the gold was on the lam first from arizona to new jersey then to houston,texas next to day home in lo de marcos,mexico then to juarez,mexico then back to the united states in albuquerque then to washington and finally to a gold dealer in canada.in sum,based on that path and the other evidence of day purpose in moving the gold,we hold that a rational jury could have found the design to conceal element of transportation money laundering proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
day contends that even if there was sufficient evidence to support the design to conceal element,his conviction should be reversed because gold is not a monetary instrument or funds as required by a.this challenge implicates two issues and two standards of review.first,day argument that the district court erred in interpreting the legal meaning of offense elements in particular,the meaning of monetary instrument and funds is subject to de novo review.see united states weaver,cir.second,insofar as day challenges the jury finding that the government adequately proved the relevant offense element,we review that argument for sufficiency of the evidence.see jackson,at.
day primary argument is that,as a matter of law,gold does not constitute a monetary instrument or funds under the money laundering statute.we note that the statute is phrased in the disjunctive a person violates the law by transporting a monetary instrument or funds in accordance with the other elements of the offense.a emphasis added.in order to prevail,then,day must establish both that gold is not a monetary instrument and that it is not funds as expressed in the statute.because we conclude that day argument fails with respect to the funds prong,we need not address whether gold may also be a monetary instrument.
day asserts that gold is not encompassed within the meaning of the term funds for two interrelated reasons first,the money laundering statute does not define the term and second,in the absence of a statutory definition,to permit the government to rely on definitions from dictionaries and other criminal provisions would render the statute unconstitutionally vague.day is correct as to the former proposition the money laundering statute does not define the meaning of funds but he is wrong as to the latter.it is beyond cavil that a criminal statute need not define explicitly every last term within its text,for as the supreme court has repeatedly explained,where terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.jones united states,d internal quotation marks omitted construing the meaning of used in i.in fact,in chapman united states,the court construed the undefined term mixture as it was used in b b v by looking to its ordinary meaning and proceeded to hold that such a construction did not leave the statute unconstitutionally vague,d.
turning to the ordinary meaning of funds,we think the term refers to assets of monetary value that are susceptible to ready financial use.this is the meaning captured by black law dictionary,which defines fund as a sum of money or other liquid assets established for a specific purpose.black law dictionary ed.a liquid asset is defined by to current asset,id.at,which means a n asset that is readily convertible into cash,id.at.so too is this ordinary meaning expressed in dictionaries random house defines funds to mean money immediately available pecuniary resources.random house dictionary of the english language ed.pecuniary is defined,in turn,to mean of or pertaining to money.id.at.we accordingly conclude that gold can constitute funds under the transportation money laundering statute where it is moved as a liquid,monetary asset.
our conclusion finds support in the purpose and structure of the money laundering statute.at its core,day argument is that a defendant can violate the transportation money laundering provision if he moves cash or some other ordinary financial instrument with a design to conceal its source,ownership,or other listed attribute,but not if he takes the further deceitful step of first converting the cash into the more financial asset of gold.to accept day argument would turn the transportation money laundering statute on its head,creating an odd safe harbor for criminals to transport and conceal their criminal proceeds where they engage in more deceit and concealment,not less.we do not think congress could have intended such a result,and we thus hold that gold can constitute funds within the ordinary meaning of a.
having settled in the affirmative the legal question of whether gold can ever constitute funds under a,we must next consider whether the government presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude in this case that day transported gold as funds under the ordinary meaning of that term.we hold that it did.
the government adduced testimony from carroll,neufeld,and stewart that day specifically referred to gold as a good financial investment in conversations with each of them.the government also introduced testimony from a gold dealer who explained that people commonly hold gold funds as a pecuniary investment asset,and that g old is an investment for many many people.significantly,during the conspiracy,day used his gold in a manner that took advantage of its liquidity as an investment asset,essentially using it as a substitute for cash.to that end,a canadian gold dealer testified that day made a series of transactions in which he shipped gold in exchange for cash wire transfers.day counsel even declared during his opening statement that one reason why day had gold shipped to him in mexico was s o he can spend it.day counsel also highlighted the liquid,pecuniary nature of gold during his closing argument,when he stated that gold is something you can hold in your hand with a serial number on it.that is the value.that is what you can take into the gold dealer.
that sufficient evidence existed for a jury to conclude that day transported gold in its capacity as funds does not mean,of course,that every transportation of gold necessarily qualifies as such.if day had transported the gold for the purpose of filling or crowning a tooth,to make jewelry,or to manufacture microprocessors,such uses would not have fallen within the ordinary understanding of a fund as a sum of money or other liquid asset or pecuniary resource.it hardly needs mentioning,though,that no such evidence was adduced in day defense the government instead demonstrated that day gold remained in bar and coin form throughout the scheme and was used essentially as a bank account for his various exchanges with gold dealers.in sum,there was ample evidence for a jury to conclude that day transported the gold in its capacity as a liquid,monetary asset 
day next argues that venue for his criminal trial was improper in the eastern district of virginia.to establish venue,the government must adduce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the defendant committed an overt act in furtherance of the charged conspiracy inside the appropriate judicial district.united states green,cir see also i.
contrary to day claims,venue was proper in the eastern district of virginia based on at least two classes of overt acts.first,a jury could have reasonably concluded that venue was justified based on phone calls that carroll made in furtherance of the conspiracies while in the eastern district of virginia.carroll testified that in may,while in crewe,virginia,he made phone calls to and received a phone call from a gold dealer in arizona to shore up the pricing for day gold purchases.in addition,the jury could have reasonably concluded that emails sent by day to dla personnel in richmond,virginia,constituted overt acts in furtherance of the wire fraud,money laundering,and smuggling conspiracies.for instance,stewart sent multiple emails to dla personnel located within the district regarding contracts that one of his companies had won during the wire fraud scheme and on which he had received payment from the dod in a specified account.day and his subsequently used funds from that same account to,among other things,pay mehr and teal to transport the gold to mexico 
day argues that the foregoing acts were de minimis in context and completely legal,and therefore insufficient to give rise to venue in the district.in making this argument,however,day confuses the question of how much an overt act furthers a conspiracy with the question of whether it furthers the conspiracy.it is the latter question that matters for venue purposes,and the circuits have recognized that simple acts such as phone calls from a district can give rise to venue in conspiracy cases.see,united states smith,cir united states lewis,cir.venue was therefore proper in the eastern district of virginia.
day final challenges to his convictions concern the trial court evidentiary rulings with respect to a government report describing mishandled evidence,and bad act evidence under federal rule of evidence b.we review the trial court rulings for abuse of discretion and will only overturn an evidentiary ruling that is arbitrary and irrational.united states cloud,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.upon examining the record,we hold that the district court did not err in either ruling.moreover,given the volume of incriminating evidence produced,any error would have been harmless.
day argues that the district court abused its discretion by declining to admit a government report of an investigation that described how several pieces of evidence used to convict him namely,certain nonconforming parts that day had delivered to the dod during his wire fraud scheme were mishandled by a particular lead investigator.day first contends that the report should have been admitted into evidence under federal rules of evidence and because the report was relevant to the integrity of the evidence presented to the jury,including issues regarding chain of custody and unauthorized access to the evidence.
we find this argument unpersuasive.for starters,the trial court decision to exclude the report was founded not on a determination that the report was irrelevant under rules and,but rather on a rule finding that the report improperly prejudicial harm would exceed its probative value.this finding was soundly reasoned.in particular,with regard to the report limited probative value,the trial court specifically asked day counsel whether he had any reason to contend that any of these chain of custody rules were violated,to which counsel candidly responded n ot at this time.the court then inquired whether day counsel had any evidence that shows that the mishandled evidence was in any way mutilated or damaged so that the quality of the testing might be called into question.again,day counsel forthrightly responded no.the district court itself found that the report does not suggest that any of the evidence is tainted,or is wrong in this case.given the limited probative value of the report,the district court reasonably concluded that introducing the report would present a real danger of unfair prejudice given its general conclusion that a lead investigator had not complied with certain dod evidentiary procedures.
day also argues that he should have been permitted to introduce the report for a separate purpose to impeach the lead investigator character for truthfulness under federal rule of evidence b.this argument fares no better.in contrast to day assertion,rule b does not require the admissibility of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of impeaching a witness character for truthfulness it actually does the opposite.the rule provides that e xcept for a criminal conviction under rule,extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness conduct in order to attack or support the witness character for truthfulness.b emphasis added.rule b instead allows for precisely what the district court did here the court may,on,allow instances of a witness conduct to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.id.thus,the district court properly gave day wide latitude to the lead investigator regarding his conduct,permitting inquiry into his unauthorized access to the evidence room,inaccurate inventory of parts,and failure to document evidence transfers,custody forms,and shipping information.we accordingly hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the report.
day next contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting certain uncharged bad act evidence against day,including evidence about his use of foreign bank accounts and false names,and his purchase of several expensive watches.day argues that the introduction of this evidence violated federal rule of evidence b,which prohibits introduction of such other acts for the general purpose of prov ing a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.
we reject this argument for the simple reason that it fails to recognize the distinction between extrinsic other act evidence and intrinsic other act evidence.see united states lighty,cir.as we have explained,evidence of uncharged other acts is intrinsic and not subject to rule if the acts arose out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense,or if evidence of the uncharged conduct is necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.united states siegel,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the evidence of which day complains falls within this definition because each item arose out of the same series of transactions as the charged offenses and was necessary to complete the context of the crime on trial day foreign bank transfers took place during the heart of the scheme,in,and involved proceeds from the dla contracts the false name evidence demonstrated day effort to conceal his connection to the scheme proceeds and evidence concerning his watch purchases showed one medium through which day received proceeds from the scheme.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.
we turn now to day challenges to his sentence of imprisonment.specifically,day argues that his month prison sentence should be vacated because it was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we reject each argument for the reasons below.
day argues that the district court committed procedural error when it imposed an unwarranted enhancement for obstruction of justice,resulting in an incorrect calculation of his guidelines range.the trial court obstruction enhancement was proper for many reasons,however,among them that day had attempted to bribe mexican officials in an effort to escape from custody.day also physically tried to escape from mexican authorities.further,day had formulated a plan to enlist mexican cartel members to conduct an attack on a prison van in which he would be transported in yet another attempted prison escape,this time in virgini
