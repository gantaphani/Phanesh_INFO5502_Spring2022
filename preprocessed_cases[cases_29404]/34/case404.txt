appellant derek graham was on probation in massachusetts for various drug offenses.when he failed to comply with probation reporting requirements,the police secured a warrant for his arrest.to execute this warrant,officers entered an apartment,and,after finding graham in one of the apartment bedrooms,they arrested him and searched the room.the search yielded a shotgun and ammunition.based on this evidence,a federal grand jury charged graham with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.
graham sought to suppress the evidence,arguing that the police violated the fourth amendment of the united states constitution in acquiring it.after the district court resolved the suppression motion against graham,he entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving the right to appeal the suppression ruling.he now exercises that right.
graham argues that both the officers entry into the apartment and the subsequent search of the bedroom where he was arrested violated the fourth amendment.he claims that because he was a social guest in the apartment,the police needed to first obtain a search warrant to enter the apartment,in addition to the arrest warrant they had procured.additionally,he argues that even if the arrest warrant justified the entry into the apartment,the police still needed a search warrant to conduct the search of the bedroom.
in response,the government argues that the entry by the officers was permitted under the rule of payton new york,d,because they had a warrant for graham arrest,and they reasonably believed prior to entry that graham resided at the apartment.as for the subsequent search of the bedroom,the government submits that the search was justified as either a valid probation search or a search incident to arrest.we affirm.
background 
we state the relevant facts as the trial court found them,consistent with record support.united states ruidiaz,cir.
after committing various drug offenses,derek graham was sentenced to probation by a massachusetts state court.the probation order,issued in,required graham to comply with several standard conditions.the order also included the following search condition 
on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that a condition of the probationer probation has been violated,a probation officer,or any law enforcement officer acting on the request of the probation office,may search the probationer property,his or her residence,and any place where he or she may be living,and may do so with or without a search warrant,depending on the requirements of law.
graham signed the probation order,indicating that he had read and understood the conditions of probation.
although on probation for drug offenses,graham had previously pled guilty to possessing firearms illegally,and the police connected him with a violent gang in his neighborhood known as the crown path gang.this gang had an ongoing rivalry with a gang from a neighboring area known as the everton young guns.
graham fell out of compliance with the probation order in,failing to meet the order reporting requirements.as a result,graham probation officer,thomas todd todd,sought and obtained a warrant for his arrest.todd understood graham to be living with his mother in dorchester,massachusetts.the police attempted to execute the warrant at this location but did not find him there.
over the next few months,todd learned that graham had potentially violated another one of the conditions of his probation,this one requiring him to obey all local,state,and federal laws.specifically,another probationer told todd that graham had brandished a weapon on him and a member of the everton young guns told todd that the gang suspected graham was responsible for several shootings of their members.
at first unable to locate graham,in time the authorities began to hone in on his whereabouts.in may,todd learned from another probation officer that graham had been staying at a house on the corner of harvard street and harvard park.the address of this building was harvard street.after receiving the tip,todd drove by the house.he recalled having previously seen another member of the crown path gang on the house porch.todd provided the boston police department with this information.the police then informed todd of a report of a domestic incident at harvard street,identifying graham as the offender.the report stated that chanice meadows chanice alleged that she had been threatened by her daughter boyfriend,derek graham.the report listed graham address as harvard street.
based on this information,a magistrate added the harvard street address to the arrest warrant for graham.todd again contacted the boston police department and requested that the warrant be executed.todd informed the police that graham might be armed,that graham was subject to a probation search condition,and that a probation officer would be available to perform the probation search if graham were found.the police informed todd that the warrant would be executed the next day,a saturday.
around on saturday morning,police officers went to harvard street with the arrest warrant.they showed a picture of graham to the person who answered the door and were directed to the apartment.chanice answered the door to the apartment but denied that graham was present.the officers informed chanice that they had a warrant and entered the apartment to look for graham.
they discovered graham in the apartment rear bedroom.the officers noticed a number of items in the room,including men clothes on the floor and in a duffel bag,several boxes of shoes against a wall,men toiletries on a bureau next to a bed,and a newspaper clipping and several pictures on a wall in the room.the newspaper clipping concerned the murder of a member of the everton young guns the crown path gang rival gang and the pictures were of individuals making associated with the crown path gang.
the officers arrested graham,handcuffed him,and brought him to the living room,which was in the front of the apartment.they then contacted the probation officer on duty,who arrived at the apartment fifteen minutes later with copies of graham probation documents.the probation officer asked the officers to search the bedroom where graham was found.in the course of this search,the police found a sawed off shotgun and ammunition in the drawer of a dresser.the officers also discovered a small safe underneath the bed.using a knife,an officer opened the safe and discovered various types of ammunition.
state court proceeding 
massachusetts charged graham with possession of a shotgun and ammunition in violation of state law.graham moved to suppress the evidence.after a suppression hearing,the state court granted graham motion.
the state court concluded that the officers entry into the apartment was justified under payton because the officers reasonably believed that graham resided at the apartment.the court,however,determined that the subsequent search of the room where graham was found violated graham rights under the massachusetts declaration of rights in the massachusetts constitution.the court explained that article of the massachusetts constitution,as interpreted by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts in commonwealth lafrance,barred probation searches executed without a search warrant unless one of the established exceptions to the search warrant requirement applied.finding that no such exception applied in graham case,the state court suppressed the evidence 
federal district court proceeding 
subsequent to the state court resolution of the suppression issue,the united states charged graham in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.
like the state court,the federal court concluded that the police entry into the apartment was permissible under payton.the court ruled in the alternative that the probation order itself allowed the officers to enter the apartment.unlike the state court,however,the district court concluded that the police did not need a search warrant to search the room where graham was found.
the district court determined that the police collected the evidence from the bedroom pursuant to a valid probation search.relying on united states knights,d and samson california,d,two cases analyzing warrantless searches of defendants on conditional release the court concluded that as a probationer,graham had such a reduced expectation of privacy that a warrantless search was reasonable under the fourth amendment.the court rejected graham argument that the search violated the fourth amendment because the police,in defiance of state law,failed to obtain a search warrant.the court determined instead that the admissibility of evidence in a federal proceeding is governed solely by federal law,and federal law did not require a search warrant.
the court also stated that an alternative basis for upholding the search,that it was a valid search incident to arrest.although graham had been handcuffed and removed from the room prior to the search,the court determined that the areas searched and items seized were within his reach at the time of his arrest.
when reviewing the disposition of a suppression ruling,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its ultimate constitutional conclusion de novo.united states nascimento,cir.
a.the entry into the apartment 
graham first challenges the initial entry into his apartment,understanding that if we find this entry unjustified the evidence discovered subsequent to it must be suppressed.graham contends that because he did not reside at the apartment,because he was merely an overnight guest,the police needed a search warrant in order to enter the apartment,in addition to the arrest warrant that they procured.he also argues that the entry into the apartment was not permissible under payton,because the officers did not reasonably believe that he resided in the apartment.the government disagrees,contending that the arrest warrant itself,coupled with evidence supporting a reasonable belief that graham resided in the apartment,was sufficient under payton to permit entry into the apartment.
payton is the lodestar.in that case,the supreme court held that police armed with an arrest warrant for a suspect founded on probable cause may enter the dwelling of that suspect when there is reason to believe he is within.at.subsequent to payton,courts have held that even where it is discovered after entry that the dwelling is not the suspect,the initial entry may be justified under payton provided the police reasonably believed,prior to entry,that the suspect did reside at the dwelling.united states lovelock,cir observing that although payton requires that the entering officers reasonably believe that the subject of the arrest warrant resides at the place entered,that belief need not ultimately be correct united states risse,cir the officers assessment need not in fact be correct rather,they need only reasonably believe that the suspect resides at the dwelling to be searched and is currently present at the dwelling.citations omitted united states route,cir same.
whether graham actually resided at the apartment,then,is not dispositive so long as the police reasonably believed prior to entry that he resided at the apartment and would be present.see united states weems,cir citing united states gay,cir,for the proposition that payton allows entry because officers had a reasonable belief that subject of arrest warrant lived at the house they entered see also united states thomas.at issue in this case is whether the police had a reasonable belief of residence,and not the second requirement,whether they had reason to believe graham was within the apartment when they entered.
in determining whether the officers possessed a reasonable belief that graham resided at the apartment,we examine the basis for that belief.united states bervaldi,cir examining the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of law enforcement agents viewed in the totality citation omitted lovelock,at.of course,certain facts will almost always give rise to a reasonable belief that the subject of an arrest warrant resides at the place entered.for example,in united states route police concluded that the subject of the arrest warrant resided at the house entered because his credit card applications,utility bill,car registration,and mail were directed to the house,nn.cir.however,the police need not possess such indicators of residence in order to form a reasonable belief that a suspect resides at a given place.
two cases from the eighth circuit,united states clayton,cir and united states risse,cir,are instructive.in clayton,a police record indicated that the defendant resided in a particular house.at.officers were also told by an anonymous caller that the defendant resided at this house and were told by a person leaving the house,immediately prior to their entry,that the defendant was inside.the eighth circuit concluded that this information gave police a reasonable belief that clayton lived at the residence.id.at.in risse,the subject of the arrest warrant told police that she was staying at a certain place and that officers could contact her there.at.a confidential informant further told police that the subject was living at the same place with another person,and police had been unable to contact the subject at a different,permanent residence she maintained.id.at.the court concluded that this information supported a reasonable belief of residence.id.at see also case kitsap county sheriff dep t,cir discussing information giving rise to reasonable belief lovelock,at same.
similarly,we can safely conclude here that the police possessed a reasonable belief that graham resided at the apartment.the police based their residence determination on five pieces of information.first,they possessed a police report describing a domestic incident that occurred at the apartment.the report listed graham as the offender and,critically,listed the apartment as graham address.second,another probationer told todd,graham probation officer,that graham was staying at the apartment.see risse,at noting police could reasonably interpret colloquial phrase staying with to mean living with see also lovelock,at.third,immediately prior to entering the apartment,officers showed a picture of graham to a person outside the apartment who pointed the officers towards the apartment.fourth,todd,on a prior occasion,saw a member of the gang graham was associated with on the porch of the apartment.fifth,officers had been unable to locate graham where previously he had been living.see risse,at noting that police inability to locate subject of arrest warrant at a location previously associated with the subject could support a reasonable belief that subject was residing at a different location.taken together,this information supported a reasonable belief that graham resided in the apartment.
in challenging this conclusion,graham criticizes individually each piece of information the officers relied on in forming their belief.but,as established above,we examine the information known to the officers in the totality and not in isolation.see lovelock,at rejecting defendant argument that police did not possess reasonable belief of residence where defendant sought to segment,isolate,and minimize each item of evidence that contributed to the existence and reasonableness of the officers belief.
graham also points to a litany of facts to support his contention that he did not reside at the apartment.he notes that he did not have a key to the premises,that his clothing was on the floor and in a duffle bag and not put away in closets and dressers,that he had decorated the bedroom with only a few photos and a news clipping,and that both his shotgun and the safe where he kept his ammunition were readily portable items.this quarterbacking does nothing to assist our analysis.what the police discovered after they entered the apartment can not help us determine what the officers could have reasonably believed before entering the apartment.based on the reasoning provided above,we conclude that the officers were justified in believing graham resided at the apartment.
graham also argues that payton does not determine the outcome here,but rather two other supreme court cases,steagald united states,d and minnesota ol
