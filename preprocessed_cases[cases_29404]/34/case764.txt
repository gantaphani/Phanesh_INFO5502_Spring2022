during a routine patrol of a bronx apartment building,new york city police department nypd officer chris aybar observed defendant jose diaz sitting in a stairwell while holding a plastic cup that seemed to aybar to smell of alcohol.officer aybar initially intended only to issue diaz a summons not to make an arrest for violating new york law.she ordered him to stand against the wall and produce identification.diaz stood and then,as if to retrieve something,fumbled with his hands in his jacket pockets and rearranged his waistband.officer aybar frisked diaz and felt a bulge on the side of his jacket she opened his jacket pocket and discovered a loaded handgun.she then arrested diaz,who was later found guilty,by the presiding district judge jesse furman,judge acting as trier of fact,of being a previously convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.he received a sentence of months imprisonment.
before the trial,diaz filed a motion to suppress evidence about the presence of the gun on fourth amendment grounds.the district court denied the motion,concluding that the search was a lawful search incident to an arrest supported by probable cause.having thereafter been convicted,diaz now appeals that denial,arguing that officer aybar lacked probable cause to arrest and search diaz for violating new york city law,admin.code b,because an stairwell is not a public place within the meaning of that law,and in any event,the warrantless search was not a lawful search incident to an arrest because officer aybar did not intend to arrest diaz when she began the search.
we disagree.we conclude that officer aybar had probable cause to arrest diaz inasmuch as she had a reasonable belief that an stairwell is a public place for purposes of the law and that diaz was violating that law.and because she had probable cause to arrest diaz and ultimately did arrest him the warrantless search was a lawful search incident to an arrest,even though officer aybar testified that before finding the gun she intended only to issue a summons,not to make an arrest.
background 
on the night of march,nypd officers chris aybar and jose espinal entered a,private apartment building located at east street in new york city borough of the bronx,to conduct a patrol as part of the nypd clean halls program pursuant to which officers enter common spaces in residential buildings with the building owner consent in an effort to deter crime,principally drug dealing and trespassing.upon entering the apartment building through the front door,which was propped open with a newspaper the officers immediately smelled marijuana.
they proceeded to climb the stairs to the landing,where they saw three men defendant jose diaz,collin maloney,and joshua knox.diaz was sitting next to a bottle of vodka and holding a red plastic cup.as officer aybar approached diaz,she saw clear liquid in the cup and smelled what seemed to be alcohol.maloney was also holding a red plastic cup,and knox was holding a lit blunt marijuana cigarette in one hand and a box of roaches butts of smoked marijuana cigarettes in the other.
officer aybar testified that she did not initially intend to arrest diaz,only to issue him a summons for violating new york law which provides that n o person shall drink or consume an alcoholic beverage,or possess,with intent to drink or consume,an open container containing an alcoholic beverage in any public place admin.code b.officer aybar had previously received training on the law and had issued approximately fifty summonses for violations,often in apartment buildings 
because officer aybar did not feel safe confronting diaz while he was seated,she ordered him to stand against the wall and produce his identification.diaz stood,and then,as if to retrieve something,fumbled with his hands in his jacket pockets and rearranged his waistband.fearing,because of his movements,that her safety was threatened,officer aybar frisked diaz and felt a bulge on his jacket.she opened his jacket pocket and discovered a loaded caliber taurus firearm.she then handcuffed diaz and transported him to the police station,where she issued him a summons for the violation.
on may,a grand jury returned a indictment charging diaz with possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon in violation of g.diaz filed a motion to suppress evidence concerning the firearm on fourth amendment grounds.on july,during an evidentiary hearing on that motion,diaz testified that he was not drinking alcohol in the stairwell he produced his identification when officer aybar asked for it and officer aybar took the jacket which he was not wearing from him and searched it rather than frisking him.
following the hearing,the district court denied the suppression motion by opinion and order dated august.see united states diaz,supp.crediting the officers testimony over that of diaz,id.at,the district court found that officer aybar indisputably had probable cause to believe that diaz was drinking alcohol or possessing alcohol with intent to drink it,based on officer aybar testimony that she smelled alcohol and observed diaz holding a red plastic cup containing a clear liquid while sitting in close proximity to an open bottle of vodka,id.at.
the district court rejected diaz argument that officer aybar lacked probable cause to arrest him on the ground that an stairwell is not a public place within the meaning of the law.see id.at.it noted that a compelling argument could certainly be made that the common areas of residential buildings do not qualify as public places for purposes of the law,but ultimately concluded that it need not resolve that unsettled question of state law because,even if officer aybar was mistaken in her belief that the stairwell qualified as a public place for purposes of the law,her mistake was an objectively reasonable one that did not violate the fourth amendment.id.at.
the district court also rejected diaz argument that the search could not be justified as a search incident to an arrest because officer aybar did not intend to arrest diaz until after she found the gun.see id.at.in reaching this conclusion,it relied on united states ricard,cir,where we held that a search conducted in similar circumstances was a constitutional search incident to an arrest,id.at.the district court noted,however,a tension between ricard and the supreme court subsequent decision in knowles iowa,in which it held unlawful a search conducted after an officer had already issued a citation for a traffic infraction.see diaz,supp.at citing knowles,at 
after the district court denied diaz motion to suppress,the case proceeded to a bench trial on stipulated facts.on september,diaz was found guilty of possessing a firearm as a previously convicted felon in violation of g.he received a sentence of months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
diaz appeals from the denial of his motion to suppress evidence concerning the gun found in his jacket on the grounds that officer aybar lacked probable cause to conduct the search,and in any event,the warrantless search was not justified as a search incident to an arrest because officer aybar did not intend to arrest him when she began the search.we disagree in both respects

ii.probable cause 
diaz first argument fails because at the time of the search,officer aybar had probable cause to arrest diaz for a violation of new york law based on a reasonable belief that an stairwell is a public place for purposes of that law.
a police officer ordinarily has probable cause to arrest when he or she ha s knowledge of,or reasonably trustworthy information as to,facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.manganiello city of new york,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.an officer assessment in this regard need not be perfect because the fourth amendment allows for some mistakes on the part of government officials,including reasonable mistakes of law.heien north carolina,see also herring united states,when a determination was based on reasonable but mistaken assumptions,the person subjected to search or seizure has not necessarily been the victim of a constitutional violation.
officer aybar determination was predicated on the new york law,which provides that n o person shall drink or consume an alcoholic beverage,or possess,with intent to drink or consume,an open container containing an alcoholic beverage in any public place,admin.code b where public place is defined,in pertinent part,as a place to which the public or a substantial group of persons has access,including,but not limited to,any highway,street,road,sidewalk,parking area,shopping area,place of amusement,playground,park or beach located within the city,id.a.diaz argues that the stairwell where he was found with an open container of alcohol is not a public place because,although it is a common area,it is located within a locked residential building in his view,canons of construction such as ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis support his construction of the law.but as the district court correctly acknowledged,diaz,supp.at,the question presented here is not whether a common area of an apartment such as a stairwell constitutes a public place within the meaning of the law,but only whether officer aybar had an objectively reasonable belief that it so qualified.
the supreme court decision in heien provides clear guidance in this regard.there,two north carolina police officers found cocaine in a vehicle they had stopped because one of its two tail lights was inoperative,which the officers believed to be a violation of state law.heien,at.this belief turned out to be mistaken on appeal,a state appellate court determined that the applicable state law required only one working tail light.id.at.the supreme court held that the stop and subsequent search,although premised on an erroneous understanding of the traffic law,was nonetheless constitutional because reasonable suspicion can rest on a mistaken understanding of the scope of a legal prohibition,id.at,so long as that mistaken understanding was objectively reasonable,id.at emphasis omitted that was so in heien because,at the time of the stop,the north carolina law was ambiguous,and the state appellate courts had not previously resolved the ambiguity.see id.at.
the test for whether an officer mistake of law was objectively reasonable is not as forgiving as the one employed in the distinct context of deciding whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity,id.at,often where a party brings a claim under bivens or for a violation of their constitutional rights.heien,at a n officer can gain no fourth amendment advantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is to enforce.indeed,as justice kagan explained in her concurring opinion in heien,the test is satisfied only when the law at issue is so doubtful in construction that a reasonable judge could agree with the officer view.id.at kagan,concurring internal quotation marks omitted see also united states stanbridge,cir.concluding that statutory ambiguity is a prerequisite to a determination that an officer mistake of law was objectively reasonable united states,cir.same 
we think that officer aybar belief that the stairwell qualified as a public place within the meaning of the law was an objectively reasonable prediction of the scope of the law when it was made.as in heien,her assessment was premised on a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous state law,the scope of which had not yet been clarified.even now,the new york court of appeals has not addressed whether a common area inside an apartment building is a public place within the meaning of the law,and the other new york courts that have done so have reached conflicting conclusions.compare people medina,misc,sup.bronx cty.concluding that an lobby is a public place for purposes of the law,with people chavez,misc,crim.bronx cty.concluding that an elevator is not a public place within the meaning of the law see also united states brown,jbw,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july,relying on medina to conclude that a bodega is a public place within the meaning of the law.in light of these conflicting precedents,officer aybar belief that an stairwell is a public place within the meaning of the law was a reasonable,even if mistaken,assessment of the scope of that law at the time it was made.thus,contrary to diaz contention,officer aybar had probable cause to believe that diaz had violated the law 
iii.search incident to an arrest 
diaz next contends that the search was not a lawful search incident to an arrest because,at the time of the search,officer aybar did not intend to arrest diaz and would not have ultimately done so had she not discovered the gun as a fruit of the search.we are not persuaded.
the doctrine is an exception to the general requirement that an officer must obtain a judicial warrant supported by probable cause before conducting a search.see riley california,recognizing a search incident to an arrest as a specific exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.it serves two interests protecting arresting officers and safeguarding any evidence of the offense of arrest that an arrestee might conceal or destroy.arizona gant.these interests are not evaluated on a basis,but are assumed to be present whenever an officer is justified in making an arrest.riley,at.it makes no difference whether the search occurs before or after the arrest,see rawlings kentucky,so long as it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest,shipley california,internal quotation marks omitted.
in united states ricard,cir,we squarely addressed whether a search incident to an arrest can be justified where an officer did not intend to make an arrest prior to conducting the search,see id.at.the officer there did not initially intend to arrest a driver stopped for speeding,but after a search of a small tinfoil packet revealed cocaine,the officer made an arrest.id.at.we held that the search was lawful because the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for speeding,regardless of whether or not the officer intended to arrest the defendant before discovering the cocaine.id.at explaining that,although the contested search was actually the cause of the defendant arrest,the fact that the officer had cause to arrest the defendant for speeding,even if he initially determined not to do so,was a sufficient predicate for a full search incident to an arrest.
diaz has conceded that ricard controls if it continues to be precedential and therefore binding on us,but contends that it does not remain binding precedent in light of the supreme court decision in knowles iowa.there,a police officer,who had probable cause to arrest a defendant stopped for speeding,issued a citation for the speeding violation before conducting a full search of the car that revealed marijuana,prompting an arrest.id.at.the supreme court held that the arrest could not be justified as a search incident to an arrest.id.at.although it acknowledged that the authority to conduct a full field search as incident to arrest is a rule that is based on the concern for officer safety and destruction or loss of evidence,but which d oes not depend in every case upon the existence of either concern,id.at internal quotation marks,the court decline d to extend that rule to a situation where the concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all,namely where a citation for speeding had already been issued during a routine traffic stop,id.at see also id.at explaining that t he threat to officer safety from issuing a traffic citation was a good deal less than in the case of a custodial arrest,and
