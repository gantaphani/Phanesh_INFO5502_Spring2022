on june,the the defendant applied for a united states passport.thereafter,the defendant was charged by a federal grand jury in a indictment with making a false statement in a passport application,in violation of misuse of a social security number,in violation of a b and possession of an unlawful identification document with intent to defraud the united states,in violation of a.after a trial,a jury convicted the defendant on all three counts.
the defendant now appeals his conviction on the ground that the district court improperly admitted expert testimony identifying the defendant as someone other than the person listed on the passport application on the basis of fingerprint analysis.after careful consideration,we affirm the conviction because we conclude that the district court did not err in admitting the expert testimony.
factual background 
on june,a man identifying himself as samuel ortiz submitted an application for a united states passport the application at a post office in dorchester,massachusetts.the application indicated that the applicant samuel ortiz was a united states citizen born in puerto rico on may.the applicant signed the name samuel ortiz on the application in the presence of the window clerk and submitted supporting documents,including a puerto rican birth certificate and a massachusetts identification card bearing the applicant picture,both under the name samuel ortiz.the clerk accepted the application and forwarded it for processing.
the application was reviewed at the national passport center in portsmouth,new hampshire by a passport specialist who testified at trial that aspects of the application led her to believe it was fraudulent she forwarded it to a fraud program manager in the boston passport agency.the program manager testified that she also observed indications of fraud and sent a letter to the applicant requesting additional documentation.she received no response,so she referred the application for investigation by the diplomatic security service dss,a law enforcement branch of the united states department of state responsible for passport and visa fraud investigation.
on march,two dss officers went to the address provided on the massachusetts identification card submitted with the address different from the one written on the application.the agents identified themselves to the woman who answered the door and,showing her the picture that had been submitted with the passport application,asked to see the person depicted in the picture.the woman led the agents inside the apartment to a man who one of the agents identified at trial as the defendant the agents questioned the man about the application and accompanying photograph.the man denied submitting the application,telling the agents that his name was víctor vargas vargas and that he was from the dominican republic.vargas gave his birth date as july,and provided the names of his parents.
the agents requested that vargas provide identification.vargas responded that he did not have any with him,but that he might have identification at his mother house.the agents offered to take vargas to his mother house to get the identification,and asked if they could take his fingerprints.vargas provided two sets of fingerprints.he then went with the agents to the address he had given as his mother home.the agents found no one at that location.
an investigation revealed that the bureau of citizenship and immigration service had an alien file for víctor vargas,born in the dominican republic on july.the date of birth and names of parents on file matched those provided by vargas to the agents in march.the established that vargas had been admitted to the united states as a legal permanent resident in december and remained a legal permanent resident in june,when the passport application was submitted.the contained an index fingerprint for víctor vargas.
investigators also discovered that the passport application submitted in june contained four latent fingerprints.the government conducted fingerprint analysis comparing the fingerprints obtained by the agents in march with the prints from vargas and the latent prints from the passport application.the analysis revealed that the fingerprints obtained by the agents matched both the fingerprint in vargas and the latent prints lifted off the passport application.
the government then brought charges against the defendant on the theory that he had fraudulently submitted the passport application under the name samuel ortiz,when he was really víctor vargas.
at trial,the defendant took the position that his name was samuel ortiz and that he had submitted a truthful passport application.to contradict this,the government sought to introduce the expert testimony of thomas liszkiewicz,a senior fingerprint specialist with the department of homeland security dhs.liszkiewicz had analyzed the fingerprints at issue in this case and,on the basis of that analysis,identified the individual who submitted the passport application under the name samuel ortiz as the legal permanent resident víctor vargas.several months before trial,the government notified the defendant of liszkiewicz proposed testimony and provided him with a report of liszkiewicz conclusions.the government also made the passport application available to the defendant for independent analysis.the defendant did not request a hearing on the admissibility of liszkiewicz fingerprint testimony nor did he make any motions with respect to liszkiewicz proposed testimony.
at trial,liszkiewicz first testified about his qualifications.liszkiewicz stated that he had been a senior fingerprint specialist at the dhs for two and a half years.he had previously spent nineteen to twenty years as a fingerprint examiner for the wilmington,delaware police department.liszkiewicz testified that,as part of his training while with the delaware police,he took courses and attended conferences on fingerprint identification methods,including two courses in basic and advanced fingerprint comparison.he also received training as an intern to fingerprint examiners in delaware.liszkiewicz testified that he is certified as a fingerprint examiner in delaware and has served there as an instructor and trainer of fingerprint identification.he stated that he has also been certified by the forensic document lab at the dhs.liszkiewicz also testified that he has performed hundreds of thousands of fingerprint comparisons and provided expert testimony on more than one hundred occasions.
after liszkiewicz testified about his background in fingerprint analysis,the government moved to qualify liszkiewicz as an expert.the defendant objected to liszkiewicz qualifications.the judge did not rule on that objection,and the defendant appears to have reserved the objection for.before allowing the prosecution to proceed,the court briefly addressed the jury,discussing the court role in admitting expert testimony but also noting the jury independent responsibility to consider whether you think the expert qualifications are sufficient to persuade you that he can give this opinion about fingerprints in this case.
liszkiewicz went on to explain certain terminology and procedures of fingerprint identification.he described to the jury the difference between inked prints,produced intentionally to reproduce the patterns on the fingers,and latent fingerprints,obtained from objects that a person touches.he described the analysis,comparison,evaluation and verification,or acev,method of fingerprint comparison he had been trained to use to determine whether two fingerprints were made by the same person.liszkiewicz explained that this method requires the analyst to first ensure that the prints involved are sufficiently clear to observe their characteristics,and if so,to compare the prints by looking at both their individual characteristics and the overall pattern.the analyst looks for matching characteristics and patterns and identifies any points of difference between the prints.an observation of at least eight matching characteristics and no unexplainable points of difference is necessary to indicate that two prints come from the same person.if the reviewer believes a match has been identified,she submits the conclusion to another examiner for verification.
liszkiewicz then testified to the comparisons he performed in the analysis at issue.first,he described a comparison of latent prints found on the passport application to the prints obtained by the agents in march.of the four latent prints found on the application,liszkiewicz described his comparison of two of left and right thumb print.he used chalks of the latent and inked prints for both the left and right thumb,and marked five matching characteristics to explain to the jury.he explained that he had chosen five characteristics for illustrative purposes,but had found a larger number of points of identity between the prints into the twenties with respect the left thumb print.he testified that he had found no points of difference between the latent and inked fingerprints.on the basis of his analysis,he concluded that the latent and inked thumb prints were made by one and the same individual.
liszkiewicz further testified that he compared the index fingerprint obtained by the agents to the corresponding fingerprint in the vargas.liszkiewicz noted the presence of a tented arch,a particularly significant characteristic because it appears in less than five percent,more like three to two percent of the population.he testified that other matching characteristics for the index finger were positively identified.on the basis of his comparison,he testified that the two prints were made by one and the same individual to the exclusion of all others.
the defendant liszkiewicz on several aspects of his testimony.the defendant questioned him about his educational background and experience.liszkiewicz acknowledged that he did not have an undergraduate degree or an educational background in science.the defendant asked whether liszkiewicz had preserved written notes of his analysis in this case,to which liszkiewicz responded that,consistent with the policies of his department,he had not.the defendant also asked liszkiewicz about his reliance on visual inspection to compare fingerprints.in response,liszkiewicz testified without objection that the visual inspection method he used was consistent with his training.the defendant also questioned liszkiewicz about the quality of the prints used.liszkiewicz testified that while it was his usual practice to compare fingerprints using the best possible image available,he had used a fax copy of the fingerprints from the for vargas because it was sufficiently clear.the defendant challenged liszkiewicz reliance on eight matching characteristics to find a match in fingerprints,pointing out that other countries require twelve to sixteen matching characteristics.finally,the defendant asked liszkiewicz if he knew of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification.the defendant asked specifically about studies establishing the premise that fingerprints are unique,the relative frequencies of individual characteristics in the population,and the probability that a given group of characteristics might occur in multiple individuals.liszkiewicz said that he was unable to identify specific studies addressing these points.
after liszkiewicz,the defendant moved,without further explanation,to exclude liszkiewicz testimony.the district court denied the motion.a redirect and followed,after which the government rested its case.at this point,the defendant requested a sidebar,during which he renewed his motion to exclude the expert testimony,stating 
your honor,i renew my motion to strike the testimony of this witness on the grounds that while he testified to common fingerprint characteristics,he is without knowledge,information or expertise about the significance of common characteristics.that is an extraordinary omission in the offering of identification or for identification testimony by this witness w ithout the ability to testify as to why those characteristics are meaningful,based on his experience,training and education,his testimony to the jury that there was identity between those prints is without foundation,would not survive any daubert standard in the world because he ca testify to whether these standards of identification are based on any identifiable science,are in any way tested the literature.there utterly no foundation for this.
the government responded that fingerprint identification had been accepted science for years in courts and that liszkiewicz was a recognized expert with relevant training and education.the court expressed agreement with the government position and denied the defendant motion.the defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal on that ground.the district court reserved a ruling on the motion.the defendant rested his case without calling any witnesses.
in his closing argument,the defendant asked the jury to disregard liszkiewicz testimony,once again attacking aspects of liszkiewicz testimony liszkiewicz ignorance about the frequence of certain fingerprint characteristics in the population,his reliance on eight matching characteristics,his method of eyeballing prints,and his lack of scientific training.after closing arguments,the district court charged the jury to independently review and consider the expert testimony in light of all the evidence presented.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.
a week after the trial had concluded,the defendant filed a written motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial pursuant to federal rules of criminal procedure and,respectively.the defendant argued that liszkiewicz testimony was inadmissible,and for the first time in the case argued that the expert testimony failed to satisfy the requirements of federal rule of evidence.as support for his argument he noted,among other things,that liszkiewicz did not memorialize his fingerprint comparisons,that he used a faxed copy of a print for one of his comparisons,and that he eyeballed the comparisons.the defendant expressly stated that he was not challenging the admission of fingerprint evidence generally,limiting his rule argument to the adequacy of liszkiewicz testimony.
the district court denied this motion,holding that liszkiewicz was qualified as an expert in fingerprint identification,that his data and methodology were within the mainstream of forensic fingerprint technology,and that any flaws in his opinion went to the weight of the evidence,rather than its admissibility.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the defendant argues liszkiewicz testimony failed to meet three criteria required by rule for the admission of expert testimony that a witness be qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education that expert testimony be based upon sufficient facts or data and that the expert appl y the principles and methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the facts of the case.
under daubert 
under rule,
i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
id.this rule imposes a role on the trial judge to ensure that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert merrell dow,d see also kumho tire carmichael,d holding that daubert applies to all expert testimony.expert testimony must be reliable,such that the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.daubert,at.the proffered expert testimony must also be relevant,not only in the sense that all evidence must be relevant,but also in the incremental sense that the expert proposed opinion,if admitted,likely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.pepsi cola of bottling,cir citing daubert,at.citations omitted.
the inquiry under rule is a flexible one.daubert,at.the trial court enjoys broad latitude in executing its function there is no particular procedure it is required to follow.see id.the supreme court has emphasized the importance of such broad latitude,noting that,without it,the trial court would lack the discretionary authority needed both to avoid unnecessary reliability proceedings in ordinary cases where the reliability of an expert methods is properly taken for granted,and to require appropriate proceedings in the less usual or more complex cases where cause for questioning the expert reliability arises.kumho tire,at.
liszkiewicz qualifications 
the defendant argues that liszkiewicz inability to answer questions about the significance of common fingerprint characteristics renders him unqualified to offer expert testimony to the jury.because the defendant objected to liszkiewicz testimony on this basis at trial,this argument was preserved,and we review the district court decision to accept liszkiewicz qualifications for abuse of discretion.see united states díaz,cir citing joiner,d.
before accepting expert testimony,a district court must determine that a witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education.it is that trial judges have broad discretionary powers in determining the qualification,and thus,admissibility,of expert witnesses.diefenbach sheridan,cir quoting richmond steel puerto rican am.ins,cir.
liszkiewicz qualifications as a fingerprint analyst are considerable.liszkiewicz testified that he has worked in the field of fingerprint analysis for over twenty years.he has completed two fbi courses in fingerprint comparison,as well as other training courses.he is a certified fingerprint examiner and police instructor.he has been deemed qualified as a fingerprint expert in over previous cases.moreover,there is no evidence that an understanding of statistical studies on the significance of recurring fingerprint characteristics is required by any standard of fingerprint identification analysis.
it is not required that experts be practitioners with optimal qualifications.united states mahone,cir.given the evidence of liszkiewicz training,experience,and skill,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding him sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert on fingerprint comparison,as that ruling fell within the broad purview of the trial court discretion.
sufficiency of liszkiewicz data and the reliability of liszkiewicz application of fingerprint analysis methods 
standard of review 
the defendant also raises an argument under the first and third prongs of rule arguing that liszkiewicz testimony was not based upon sufficient facts or data and that he did not apply the principles and methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the facts of this case.however,the defendant failed to object to liszkiewicz testimony on these grounds at trial,therefore our review is limited to plain error review.
rule a of the federal rules of evidence requires that an objection to the admission or exclusion of evidence be timely and specific in order to preserve the issue for appeal.this mandate for specificity requires the objecting party to object with the degree of detail that will adequately apprise the trial court of the basis of the objection,unless the specific ground is apparent from the context.see.a see also united states,cir unless the basis for objection is apparent from the context,the grounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may have an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be presented on appeal.united states walters,cir the reason for the specificity requirement is to alert the trial court and the other party to the grounds of the objection so that it may be addressed or cured.
as with other bases for objecting,litigants must raise a timely objection to the validity or reliability of expert testimony under daubert in order to preserve a challenge on appeal to the admissibility of that evidence.díaz,at.however,n othing in rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.d.thus,we review a claim of error not properly preserved below for plain error.díaz,at.
our review of the record indicates that the defendant objected to the admission of liszkiewicz expert testimony three times.his first objection was to liszkiewicz qualifications.the second objection gave no explanation of his grounds for objecting he stated simply and without elaboration,i move to exclude liszkiewicz testimony.the third and final objection referred to liszkiewicz qualifications and,more generally,to the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis.none of the objections made reference to the sufficiency of liszkiewicz facts or his application of fingerprint analysis methods.
the defendant first objection went to qualifications,and thus clearly did not preserve these issues for appeal.the second objection was a general objection.it did not specify any grounds for objecting and followed a lengthy covering many subjects,including aspects of liszkiewicz educational background,training,and experience the methods he employed for his analysis of the fingerprints the memorialization of his analysis the accuracy of fingerprint analysis generally the rigor of the standards he employed as compared to standards employed in other countries the reliability of fingerprint analysis as compared to dna analysis and his knowledge of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification.on the heels of such varied questioning,it can not be said that the specific grounds of the defendant objection were apparent from the context,such that rule a would be satisfied thus,the defendant second objection could not advise the district court that the defendant was raising a challenge specifically to the sufficiency of liszkiewicz data or to the application of fingerprint analysis methods under rule.
the defendant third objection likewise failed to advise the district court of these challenges to liszkiewicz testimony.this objection addressed liszkiewicz qualifications and the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis.although it was more elaborate than his first insofar as the defendant articulated some grounds for the motion to strike,it did not call the district court attention to liszkiewicz data or his application of fingerprint analysis methods in fact,both the district court and the government understood the defendant to be challenging the foundation of fingerprint analysis generally and liszkiewicz qualifications as an expert because the defendant failed to make a specific objection based on the sufficiency of the data liszkiewicz employed or his application of fingerprint analysis methods,and no such basis of objection could be considered clear from the context,the defendant objections at trial failed to adequately preserve these challenges to the admissibility of liszkiewicz expert testimony.we review these claims for plain error.
plain error analysis 
the defendant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings to establish plain error in the admission of expert testimony.united states lemmerer,cir quoting united states gómez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.nothing of that sort is implicated here.
sufficiency of the data 
the defendant argues that liszkiewicz testimony was not based on sufficient facts or data because he used a faxed image of the fingerprint in vargas to compare that print with the fingerprints obtained by the agents rather than the original print or a photograph of the original.
liszkiewicz provided unrebutted testimony that the acev method of fingerprint comparison required that the analyst ensure that the prints being analyzed are sufficiently clear to observe their characteristics.he also testified that the faxed image of fingerprint was sufficiently clear to make a compa
