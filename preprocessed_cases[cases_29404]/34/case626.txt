background 
the facts of the case,set out in the recommended decision by the magistrate judge in united states vongkaysone,wl,are summarized below.on january,a confidential informant told united states drug enforcement agency dea special agent paul buchanan that a person named jimmy was going to travel from portland,maine to massachusetts and return with crack cocaine.buchanan already knew,based on past investigation,that jimmy true name was huang nguyen.dea agents had bought crack from him on several prior occasions.
buchanan called the maine state police msp and put them on the lookout for a white car nguyen had driven during prior drug purchases.the msp found the vehicle,stopped it and searched it,finding two ounces of what was later confirmed to be cocaine base.the msp arrested nguyen and an asian female,dong lee.nguyen agreed to cooperate and told buchanan that he was a runner for lee and,for the past three or four months,had been making three or four trips a week to lowell,massachusetts to buy two ounces of crack from a person he knew as boy or little boy.
the next day,nguyen placed a recorded call to little boy in lowell to set up a buy of two ounces of cocaine base at a certain parking lot in lowell.buchanan went with nguyen to the location.shortly after their arrival,a silver honda prelude,just as nguyen had described,arrived and pulled up next to nguyen car.agents seized and searched the car occupant,whom nguyen identified as little boy.the agents seized two ounces of what seemed to be crack cocaine from little boy pocket.little boy was identified as eddy phanthai,and he agreed to cooperate.buchanan had never heard of nor dealt with phanthai before his arrest.
on january,several dea agents,including buchanan,steven thibodeau,and sheila wetherbee,interviewed phanthai pursuant to a proffer agreement.phanthai told them that his source of crack was someone he knew as na and that he would meet na once a week to buy ounces and sometimes as much as half a kilo of cocaine powder.he said that he would pay about an ounce for the powder,which he then cooked into crack cocaine for resale in maine.buchanan believed that phanthai account of his activity matched what nguyen had told buchanan.
phanthai described na as a asian man about thirty years of age,decently dressed,with short hair,about five feet seven inches and approximately pounds.phanthai said that na usually wore a collared shirt,slacks,and nice shoes and that he often wore a nice jacket.phanthai said he knew that na was from rhode island and usually drove a nissan with rhode island plates.phanthai said that he would usually call na on a sunday and meet him the next day in lowell,either inside or in the parking lot of a cambodian or vietnamese restaurant.na picked the meeting place and usually did not tell phanthai where it was until a few minutes before the exchange.phanthai said that na was always on time and sometimes a few minutes early,and that na usually arrived before he did.
phanthai further described that na would usually be inside the restaurant,so phanthai would go to na car,put the money in the glove compartment and remove the drugs.sometimes,however,na would be in his car in the parking lot,and phanthai would get into the car with na and exchange the money and drugs in person.phanthai told the agents that na usually came alone but sometimes arrived with his cousin,an asian male who was five feet seven inches tall,with short hair and dress similar to na.phanthai said that he usually spoke english to na and his cousin but sometimes spoke laotian.
after his interview with the agents,phanthai made a recorded phone call to someone he said was na to order cocaine.the agents attempted to trace the phone number but up to the time of defendant arrest they had yet to confirm independently the identity of the recipient of the call.from january through january,phanthai made a series of recorded calls to the person he said was na.the calls were made from the old colony correctional center in bridgewater,massachusetts.buchanan noted that the person phanthai was calling seemed to know phanthai and to have spoken to him before.an arranged meeting fell through twice.
on january,at about,buchanan recorded a final call between phanthai and the man phanthai identified as na.during the call,phanthai and na arranged a meeting for that evening at the thanh thanh restaurant on chelmsford street in lowell.phanthai ordered half a kilo of cocaine.there was no further contact between phanthai and na.phanthai did not ask whether na would be traveling alone.buchanan testified that in making arrangements for drug deals,such a question would not be asked and that asking too many questions might scare off the dealer.
buchanan told the other agents about the arranged drug deal and left the jail at about to drive from bridgewater to the thanh thanh restaurant in lowell.he was in contact with the agents as he drove.between and,the agents involved in the upcoming operation gathered at the lowell office of the initiative cbi,a dea task force made up of local,state and federal officers.agents were given copies of a written operational plan,and wetherbee briefed them about the operation,including what phanthai had said about the suspects physical appearances.
thibodeau was present at the briefing,which he recalled took about minutes,and he remembered the agents were told that at least one asian male and perhaps two were expected to arrive at the restaurant in a car with rhode island plates.the car was likely to be a car similar to a nissan and was expected to arrive on time at about.the agents were told that the suspect was prepared to sell cocaine to phanthai.the operational plan was to conduct surveillance at the scene,look for suspicious activity and arrest as appropriate the people matching the descriptions they had received.
at about,the agents left the cbi office in at least three cars and drove to the restaurant in order to conduct surveillance.chelmsford street is a busy area with a great deal of traffic.the restaurant has two entrances to its parking lot,one at the rear from powell street and one at the front off of chelmsford street.agents wetherbee and john bosse parked on powell street where they could see the rear entrance to the restaurant and had an obscured view of the parking lot.agents gregory boucher,barry kelly and two others parked in the lot of a business across chelmsford street with a clear view of the front entrance to the restaurant and its parking lot.agents thibodeau,greg colletti and bill hanlin parked in the parking lot of a store next to the restaurant with a clear view of its parking lot.the agents were in radio contact with one another during the operation in order to compile their observations from different angles.it was january and dark outside,but the parking lot of the restaurant was lit.phanthai was not at the scene.
at,thibodeau saw a dark acura with rhode island plates pull into the front entrance to the restaurant.two asian males were inside it.the car parked in the left rear part of the parking lot,with the driver side facing thibodeau.shortly thereafter,at about,a red honda pulled into the powell street entrance and backed into a space near the acura.thibodeau saw a man get out of the passenger seat of the honda and walk over to the passenger seat of the acura.the honda passenger leaned into the window of the acura and appeared to engage in conversation with the acura passenger.thibodeau did not observe anything being exchanged and could not overhear the conversation.boucher also observed this interaction and thought that it lasted between thirty seconds and a minute.the honda passenge
