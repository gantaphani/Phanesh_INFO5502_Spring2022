opinion of the court 
this case arises under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c.the government appeals the district court order dismissing a rico indictment of attorney paul bergrin and his.because the indictment adequately pleaded a rico violation,we will reverse and remand.
bergrin is a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor from new jersey who now stands accused of leading an extensive criminal enterprise from through.
on november,a federal grand jury in newark,new jersey returned a count superseding indictment charging bergrin and seven with a host of offenses,all allegedly connected through an enterprise called the bergrin law enterprise ble or enterprise.according to the indictment,the ble was comprised of five individuals paul bergrin yolanda jauregui thomas moran alejandro barrazo castro and vicente esteves and four corporations the law firm pope,bergrin verdesco,pa pb v the law office of paul bergrin,pc premium realty investment,and isabella international restaurant,
the indictment alleged that bergrin was the leader of the ble and played an instrumental role in all of the enterprise six criminal schemes.his alleged roles differed by scheme,with each having significant involvement in at least one scheme and little or no involvement in others.the six alleged schemes,also listed as racketeering acts,are summarized below 
racketeering act one in and,bergrin,as a partner in pb v,represented a client with the initials,who was being held on federal drug trafficking charges.informed bergrin during a private visit that.was the government key witness against him.bergrin relayed that information to drug associates along with his own message that if they killed,he could assure that escaped prison,but if they did not,would spend the rest of his life in jail.those associates subsequently murdered 
racketeering acts two and three in and,bergrin,through his law firm,law office of paul bergrin,pc,represented esteves,who was charged with federal drug crimes in monmouth county,new jersey.under the guise of providing legitimate attorney services,enterprise members bergrin,jauregui,and moran assisted esteves in arranging to have a witness against him murdered.members of the ble solicited a hitman to locate and kill the witness,traveled to meetings with the hitman,offered to assist the hitman in obtaining a gun,instructed the hitman on how to commit the murder,and then received in cash for their services to esteves.
racketeering act four in,bergrin,through his law firm,law office of paul bergrin,pc,represented a client with the initials,who was charged with robbing in essex county,new jersey.enterprise members bergrin,jauregui,and moran bribed and assisted in bribing,who was to testify for the government against.they did so by causing a third party,to participate in telephone conversations with,after which they paid in cash to change testimony.
racketeering acts five,six,and seven from to,bergrin,jauregui,and barraza castro along with several non enterprise in kilogram quantities of cocaine u nder the guise of conducting legitimate business at law office of paul bergrin,pc,pb v,premium realty investment,inc,and isabella international restaurant.as part of the operation,a stash house was maintained at isabella in newark.
racketeering acts eight and nine in and,bergrin,through his law firms,law office of paul bergrin,pc and pb v,represented a client with the initials,who ran a prostitution business in new york.bergrin helped evade new jersey parole board restrictions by telling the board that worked at the law office of paul bergrin,pc.bergrin also supported that claim with false paychecks drawn on premium realty investment,accounts.when was arrested again,bergrin took over the prostitution business,but he too was caught and charged in new york.following bergrin arrest for his role in the business,jauregui solicited,the third party in scheme three to murder a witness against bergrin.jauregui then supplied with information about the witness and paid.
racketeering acts ten,eleven,twelve,and thirteen in and,bergrin and jauregui committed and assisted others in committing wire fraud relating to the sale of real estate properties to individuals they knew to have fraudulently obtained mortgage loans.they did so u nder the guise of conducting the legitimate business of the law office of paul bergrin,pc and premium realty investment.at least one of the properties was owned by bergrin and jauregui through premium realty.bergrin and other attorneys from the law office of paul bergrin acted as closing attorneys on the transactions.
the indictment also alleged the following seven purposes of the enterprise,which we quote in full 
providing the bergrin law enterprise and its leaders,members and associates with an expanding base of clients for legal and illegal services 
generating,preserving and protecting the bergrin law enterprise profits and client base through acts of,among other things,witness tampering,murder,conspiracy to commit murder,traveling in aid of racketeering enterprises,bribery,drug trafficking,prostitution,wire fraud,and money laundering.

bergrin,jauregui,moran,and barazza castro were each charged in count one with violating rico,c,and in count two with conspiring to violate rico,d bergrin,jauregui,moran,and esteves were also charged in count three with the commission of violent crimes in aid of racketeering vicar,a 
bergrin and his moved to dismiss the rico and counts.on april,the district court heard oral argument on whether the government alleged in its indictment facts sufficient to support rico charges.two weeks later,the district court granted the motions to dismiss count one,finding that the indictment did not adequately allege a racketeering enterprise or a pattern of racketeering activity.united states bergrin,d.because charges of conspiracy to violate rico and vicar both require elements of an underlying rico charge,counts two and three were dismissed as well.id.the government filed this timely appeal

we begin our analysis by setting forth the requirements of a indictment and the rules governing a district court review of a motion to dismiss.
federal rule of criminal procedure c requires an indictment to be a plain,concise,and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.the supreme court has explained that the federal rules were designed to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleadings and are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure.while detailed allegations might well have been required under pleading rules,they surely are not contemplated by rule c.united states resendiz ponce,citations omitted quoting united states debrow.likewise,we have held 
a n indictment is sufficient so long as it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged,sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,and allows the defendant to show with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution.united states vitillo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,no greater specificity than the statutory language is required so long as there is sufficient factual orientation to permit the defendant to prepare his defense and to invoke double jeopardy in the event of a subsequent prosecution.united states rankin,cir.
united states kemp,cir.
to determine whether an indictment contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged,a district court may look for more than a mere recit ation in general terms of the essential elements of the offense.united states pan arella,cir.a district court must find that a charging document fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in the charging document fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation.see also united states schiff,cir indictment alleging failure to rectify misstatements of others does not,as a matter of law,state an offense under securities statute that criminalizes omissions of information gov t of greenidge,cir indictment alleging assault on male companion of a rape victim does not,as a matter of law,state an offense under statute that criminalizes assaulting a rape victim.

having reviewed the legal principles governing motions to dismiss indictments generally,we turn now to the specific question of what a rico indictment must allege under c.in united states irizarry,we elaborated on the pleading requirements thusly 
to establish a c rico violation,the government must prove the following four elements the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate commerce that the defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise that the defendant participated,either directly or indirectly,in the conduct or the affairs of the enterprise and that he or she participated through a pattern of racketeering activity.
cir quoting united states console,cir.we are also guided in our application of c by statutes and supreme court decisions that have more precisely defined the many operative words and phrases in the rico law,including enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity.
the united states code defines an enterprise as any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal entity,and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.according to the indictment in this case,the ble was a group of individuals and legal entities associated in fact.the supreme court held in united states turkette,and reaffirmed in boyle united states,that such an enterprise is an entity,for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct,and it is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.in boyle,the court added that an enterprise must have at least three structural features a purpose,relationships among those associated with the enterprise,and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise purpose.at.the court also listed a number of structural elements that the government need not prove to establish an enterprise 
a n enterprise need not have a hierarchical structure or a chain of command decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis and by any number of majority vote,consensus,a show of strength.members of the group need not have fixed roles different members may perform different roles at different times.the group need not have a name,regular meetings,dues,established rules and regulations,disciplinary procedures,or induction or initiation ceremonies.while the group must function as a continuing unit and remain in existence long enough to pursue a course of conduct,nothing in rico exempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts of activity punctuated by periods of quiescence.nor is the statute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated,diverse,complex,or unique for example,a group that does nothing but engage in extortion through,unsophisticated,and brutal means may fall squarely within the statute reach.
in order to be employed by or associated with a rico enterprise,a defendant must be a person legally distinct from the enterprise with which the person is employed or associated.cedric kushner promotions,king.the supreme court recognized in cedric kushner promotions that one person and one entity can be distinct.at the corporate,a natural person,is distinct from the corporation itself,a legally different entity with different rights and responsibilities due to its different legal status.and we can find nothing in the statute that requires more separateness than that l inguistically speaking,the employee and the corporation are different persons,even where the employee is the corporation sole owner.after all,incorporation basic purpose is to create a distinct legal entity,with legal rights,obligations,powers,and privileges different from those of the natural individuals who created it,who own it,or whom it employs.citations omitted.courts have also recognized that an enterprise can exist and satisfy the distinctiveness requirement when it is comprised of members that are a mixture of individual persons and entities that they control.see,united states masters,cir posner,finding an enterprise made up of a lawyer,his law firm,two police officers,and their respective police departments.
a pattern of racketeering activity is defined as requir ing at least two acts of racketeering activity,one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.it is the person charged with the racketeering offense not the entire enterprise who must engage in the pattern of racketeering activity.see,nw.bell.
t o prove a pattern a plaintiff or prosecutor must show that the racketeering predicates are related,and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.id.at emphasis in original.relatedness can be shown through evidence that the criminal activities have the same or similar purposes,results,participants,victims,or methods of commission,or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.id.at quoting e.crimes can be interrelated by a distinguishing characteristic when they are committed pursuant to the orders of key members of the enterprise in furtherance of its affairs.united states pungitore,cir.continuity includes both a closed and concept,referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition,at.continuity can be established by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.id.at.a finding of continuity,on the other hand,depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.id.emphasis in original.although f or analytic purposes relatedness and continuity must be stated separately,in practice their proof will often overlap.id.at.
racketeering activity is defined by to include dozens of crimes,including any act or threat involving murder,bribery,or dealing in a controlled substance,as well as any act which is indictable under relating to wire fraud,relating to tampering with a witness,victim,or an informant,and relating to racketeering.in keeping with congress intent,the supreme court has recognized that racketeering activities of criminal enterprises are often quite diverse and can include predicate offenses ranging from loan sharking and theft to trafficking in illicit prescription drugs and counterfeiting music albums.turkette,at in view of the purposes and goals of the act,as well as the language of the statute,we are unpersuaded that congress nevertheless confined the reach of the law to only narrow aspects of organized crime citing organized crime control act of,stat,and cong.rec.because casts such a wide net,rico reach can be exceptionally broad.
we are also guided by the supreme court expansive interpretation of rico.in numerous instances,the court has been asked to impose limits on how rico may be applied,and it has consistently declined to do so.instead,the court has repeatedly pointed to rico legislative history and a of the organized crime control act of as evidence that congress intended to create a broad and powerful new statutory weapon for the federal government to wield against individuals like bergrin and organizations like the ble.see boyle.at decision rejecting limitation that enterprise must have an ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it engages cedric kushner promotions,at unanimous decision rejecting limitation that president and sole shareholder of a company is not distinct person from company enterprise org.for women scheidler,unanimous decision rejecting limitation that enterprise must have an economic motive turkette,at decision rejecting limitation that enterprise must be legitimate entity see also,at congress drafted rico broadly enough to encompass a wide range of criminal activity,taking many different forms and likely to attract a broad array of perpetrators operating in many different ways.it would be counterproductive and a mismeasure of congressional intent now to adopt a narrow construction rico may be a poorly drafted statute but rewriting it is a job for congress,if it is so inclined,and not for this court.russello united states,congress selected the general term interest in a apparently because it was fully consistent with the pattern of the rico statute in utilizing terms and concepts of breadth.
with these definitions and points of reference in mind,we turn to the district court decision to dismiss the indictment in this case.
federal rule of criminal procedure b b allows a district court to review the sufficiency of the government pleadings on a motion alleging a defect in the indictment.the court is limited,however,in what it may consider during this analysis.its determination must be based on whether the facts alleged in the indictment,if accepted as entirely true,state the elements of an offense and could result in a guilty verdict.delaurentis,f d at a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment is not a permissible vehicle for addressing the sufficiency of the government evidence federal rule of criminal procedure b now b b authorizes dismissal of an indictment if its allegations do not suffice to charge an offense,but such dismissals may not be predicated upon the insufficiency of the evidence to prove the indictment charges.citations omitted.generally speaking,it is a narrow,limited analysis geared only towards ensuring that legally deficient charges do not go to a jury.
the district court dismissed the indictment of bergrin and his alleged based on its determination that count one both fails to set forth a pattern of racketeering and an enterprise.bergrin,d at.neither of these conclusions is correct the indictment adequately alleges all of the required to establish both a pattern of racketeering activity and an enterprise,as well as all of the other elements of a rico offense 
the indictment alleges that the ble constituted a rico enterprise because it states this element of the charged offense,is sufficiently specific both to advise the defense of what it must be prepared to defend against and to allow recognition of a double jeopardy problem in future cases,and contains facts that fall within the scope of the rico statute as a matter of law.
according to the indictment,the ble was an of five individuals and four corporations that met all of the outlined in turkette.the indictment describes the ble as a group of persons and entities that associated and engaged in a course of conduct,a pattern of racketeering activity for several common purposes,to make money,expand its client base,and was an ongoing organization though an informal one comprised of associates who operated as a unit to provide illicit services to bergrin clients and one another.the indictment also alleges facts that satisfy the boyle requirements purpose,relationships among the members though,again,relatively loose and informal,and longevity sufficient to enable the ble to pursue its goals of,inter alia,making money and protecting its own members and criminal schemes.
similarly,there are sufficient facts in the indictment to apprise the defense that the government will seek to prove that the ble is a distinct entity,not merely a different name for the individual rico defendants.the government alleges that the individual defendants,the persons worked together and in conjunction with multiple corporations to achieve common goals,and thus each individual defendant was merely a part of,not an alter ego of,the enterprise.as the supreme court noted in cedric kushner promotions,w hether the act seeks to prevent a person from victimizing,say,a small business,or to prevent a person from using a corporation for criminal purposes,the person and the victim,or the person and the tool,are different entities,not the same.at citations omitted.although cedric kushner promotions dealt with the infiltration of legitimate businesses,not enterprises,the principle remains the same if bergrin and the other individual defendants are the persons,the ble is adequately alleged to be the tool that bergrin directed.
the allegations supporting the enterprise element are not negated by the fact that the ble pursued various predicate crimes.rather,the ble versatility provides even stronger evidence that it was an ongoing association formed to pursue criminal objectives.see,masters,at the strongest evidence of an enterprise is the handling of the problem of dealing with the leader cheating wife.when that problem arose,a but effective criminal organization was in place ready to respond effectively by planning and carrying out a crime that would have been beyond the capacities of the individual defendants acting either singly or without the aid of their organizations.
the indictment also alleges facts indicating that each individual defendant engaged in at least two predicate acts,which is the basis for the assertion that each engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity.
first,it is undisputed that the indictment charges each rico defendant with committing at least two predicate acts within the last ten years,thus certainly meeting the statutory threshold set forth in.
second,the relatedness of is satisfied because the indictment states that the predicate crimes were all committed for the same or similar purposes,promoting and enhancing the bergrin law enterprise and its leaders,members and associates activities enriching the leaders,members and associates of the bergrin law enterprise and concealing and otherwise protecting the criminal activities of the bergrin law enterprise.furthermore,there are several distinguishing characteristics that imply that the predicate crimes were not isolated events.most notably,four of the six schemes involved the performance of some kind of service for bergrin clients,murdering witnesses against two clients,bribing a witness against another,and helping a fourth run an illicit business.
moreover,the indictment alleges both closed and continuity.regarding the former,the predicate offenses are alleged to have occurred over a closed period of repeated conduct,six years during which six criminal schemes were executed.several of the schemes themselves occurred over a number of years and involved repeated conduct,scheme four a drug trafficking conspiracy,which involved three individuals,four companies,and multiple predicate acts such as conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,distribution of grams or more of cocaine,and maintaining premises.as to the latter,the alleged number of schemes and the ble apparent willingness to engage in criminal acts to aid bergrin clients suggest that there is also a threat of continui ng criminal activity in the future.
as was the case with the enterprise element,the fact that the ble alleged schemes differed from one another does not establish that,as a matter of law,there was no pattern.congress intended for rico to apply to individuals who,through involvement in an enterprise,commit any combination of the many and diverse predicate acts,whether the usual organized offenses e,bribery,extortion,gambling,more violent crimes,murder,kidnapping,or more niche crimes,counterfeiting music or trafficking in illicit prescription drugs.we are not alone in agreeing with judge posner observation that a criminal enterprise is more,not less,dangerous if it is versatile,flexible,diverse in its objectives and capabilities.see united states eufrasio,cir quoting masters,at see also united states brandao,cir united states eppolito,cir.in short,t he acts of a criminal enterprise within the scope of the enterprise evolving objectives form pattern enough to satisfy the requirements of the rico statute.masters,at.
we have also noted that rico pattern requirement ensures that separately performed,functionally diverse and directly unrelated predicate acts and offenses will form a pattern under rico,as long as they all have been undertaken in furtherance of one or another varied purposes of a common organized crime enterprise,eufrasio,at,as was the case with the ble.based on the kinds of commonalities listed in,common purpose and direction from common leadership we,as well as other circuit courts of appeals,have found patterns of racketeering activity in cases with equally and in some cases,even more disparate predicate crimes.see,id.the murder conspiracy predicate was,for purposes of the pattern requirement,legally related to the gambling and extortion predicates,and they to each other,because all were undertaken to further varied and diverse scarfo enterprise purposes,namely,to control,manage,finance,supervise,participate in and set policy concerning the making of money through illegal means.each charged predicate was related one to the other also because each was carried out by idone or members of his crew,pursuant to orders of key members of the enterprise,either idone or scarfo.masters,at finding pattern when defendants participated in kickback scheme between police departments and a law firm,bribery of police to ignore illegal gambling activity,and a conspiracy to commit and cover up the murder of one enterprise member cheating wife elliott,at finding a pattern when predicate acts included arson,counterfeiting titles to stolen cars,stealing hormel meat products,attempting to influence the outcome of the stolen meat trial,stealing swift meat and dairy products,stealing a forklift and ditchwitch,stealing career club shirts,engaging in illegal drug transactions,and plotting to steal fungicide.
because the indictment in this case alleged facts sufficient to charge bergrin and his with rico violations,it should have survived a motion to dismiss,and the district court erred in finding to the contrary.
in our view,the district court principal error was its failure to accept as true all of the facts alleged in the indictment.the district court treated panarella which calls for courts to determine whether the specific facts alleged in the charging document fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal statute,as a matter of statutory interpretation,at emphasis added as though it allows inquiry into what the government will be able to prove at trial.such factfinding is impermissible at the motion to dismiss stage.id.at for purposes of determining the sufficiency of the superseding information,we assume the truth of the facts alleged.console,at the existence vel non of a rico enterprise is a question of fact for the jury.
in granting appellees motions to dismiss,the district court relied in part on findings that the indictment failed to allege a common purpose or other commonality among the predicate acts on these points,the court openly weighed the evidence and questioned the government ability prove that all of the purported members of the enterprise shared the alleged common purposes.the court began by asserting that,a lthough the government attempts to tie together the disparate predicates by arguing that they each furthered the principal goals of the enterprise,the purposes offered in the indictment undermine the assertion that the rico persons share any such common objectives.bergrin,d at.the court then listed four alleged purposes and concluded 
given these alleged objectives,it strikes the court that each pertains to paul bergrin individually as an attorney the enhancement of bergrin reputation and the preservation of his law license are clearly of unique importance to bergrin himself,as is the expansion of his law firm client base i t strains credulity to argue,for example,that alejandro barraza castro,an alleged drug dealer,shared the aforementioned purposes regarding bergrin law license and his client base.
id.at emphasis added on its face,the indictment contradicts the district court findings.the indictment avers seven not four common purposes,all of which cohere in light of the government allegation that all the members of the ble benefited from bergrin status as a licensed attorney because the special privileges granted to licensed attorneys allowed them to engage in and assist client criminals to engage in criminal activities.ble members also,according to the indictment,shared the common purpose of enriching the leaders,members and associates of the bergrin law enterprise and concealing and otherwise protecting the criminal activities of the bergrin law enterprise and its members and associates from detection and prosecution.moreover,the indictment alleges that certain entities,pb v and the law office of paul bergrin,pc were used to commit the predicate acts.it also states,though admittedly without much elaboration,that the predicate acts were committed u nder the guise of providing legitimate attorney services.
the district court also opined that t here is no core group alleged,other than paul bergrin himself,id.at,and that the bergrin law enterprise as pled is essentially paul bergrin,the licensed attorney,by another name,id.at these findings can not be squared with the indictment,which identifies a number of ble members,any combination of which a jury could find were the core group.moreover,the notion that the ble is essentially paul bergrin can not be reconciled with the indictment allegations that other individuals and entities joined together to form an enterprise,a union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.whether a jury will find that such an enterprise existed is an open question,but as a matter of law,the government pleaded facts sufficient to support such a finding.the district court was obliged to accept as those allegations as true.
in addition to making impermissible factual findings,the district court also penalized the government for failing to allege facts that are unrelated to any required element of a rico offense.for example,the court suggested that,to constitute a pattern,the predicate acts must be similar in ways not actually required by the statute or judicial precedent,that there must be similar methods employed or some temporal proximity linking the predicate acts the court also suggested that proving the existence of a distinct rico enterprise requires the government to show that the enterprise goals do not primarily benefit one specific member and that its operations do not too heavily rely on the skill or status of one specific member lastly,the court opined that a rico enterprise must have structure,defined leadership,organization,and history comparable to more traditional organized enterprises,la cosa nostra 
these factual averments are not required to prove a rico case.see supra part
