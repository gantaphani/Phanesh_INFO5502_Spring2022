sufficiency of the evidence 
patel claims that there was insufficient evidence that he committed arson.see.in evaluating this claim 
w e must determine whether the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the perspective that requires us to draw every reasonable inference and to resolve credibility conflicts in a manner consistent with the permit a rational trier of fact to find each element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.the government can meet this burden by either direct or circumstantial evidence,or by any combination of the two.moreover,the government need not disprove every hypothesis consistent with the defendant innocence rather,it is enough that a rational jury could look objectively at the proof and supportably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant guilt has been established.

arson requires proof that the defendant maliciously damaged or destroyed by fire or an explosive a building used in interstate commerce.see i united states ruiz,cir.the government sought to prove that,on february,patel committed arson by setting fire to the crossing corner market,a convenience store that patel owned and operated in beverly,massachusetts.patel argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to establish that the fire was set intentionally and that he was the one who set the fire.
the government introduced ample evidence that the fire was set intentionally.two fire cause investigators testified that the fire had been purposely set at two separate locations in the store.wayne miller,a fire and explosion analyst,testified that,based on his investigation,the fires began on the main floor of the store near the beverage coolers and in the basement under the electrical panels.he further testified that the fire was intentionally set using an open flame and readily combustible material.similarly,michael hennessy,a fire investigator certified by the international association of arson investigators and national association of fire investigators,concluded,based on his own investigation,that the fire was incendiary in nature and had two independent points of origin on the first floor and in the basement.he further concluded that the fire was started by a human act and an open flame.
to support miller and hennessy conclusions,the government presented other testimony confirming that the fire pattern indicated that separate fires had been set at two locations in the store.in addition to evidence affirmatively demonstrating an intentionally lit fire,the government presented testimony ruling out other possible accidental causes for the fire,including a malfunction in the electrical and mechanical components present in the building.
patel claims that the jury was not entitled to believe this testimony because the beverly fire department investigator,louis bennett,the first investigator to inspect the scene,testified that the fire was caused by a malfunction in the compressor that operated beneath the cooler on the first floor.as indicated above,other witnesses offered contrary testimony.where the jury hears conflicting testimony,it decides which version to credit.see united states,cir a jury can freely choose to credit particular testimony while discounting other testimony that arguably points in a different direction.there were several reasons that the jury could have decided not to credit bennett testimony.first,bennett testified that his conclusions were only preliminary.second,he admitted that he did not fully inspect the compressor.third,there was other testimony that he did not do a thorough job investigating the scene.fourth,he stated that subsequent information showing that the compressor may not have been the cause of the fire opened an avenue beyond his level of expertise.finally,at one point during the investigation,he changed his opinion from the possibility of an accidental fire to the possibility of an incendiary suspicion.in short,while reasonable people perhaps could have credited bennett testimony,we do not sit as a thirteenth juror who may set aside a verdict because we may have reached a different result.ruiz,at internal quotations and citation omitted.
patel next argues that,even if someone intentionally set the fire,there was inadequate proof that it was he.the 
government presented evidence that,even though patel did not own the building in which his store was located,he carried a insurance policy on the store contents.the government also showed that patel was in dire financial straits on the date of the fire.in the years prior to the fire,sales at his store had decreased,and he was relying,to a large degree,on revenues generated by lottery sales.in,the year before the fire,lottery sales accounted for of the store net income.just prior to the fire,the massachusetts lottery commission had revoked patel lottery license because of his repeated failure to pay the commission.a week before the fire,the commission deactivated patel lottery machines and sent a representative to patel store to retrieve the instant game scratch tickets.on the date of the fire,patel owed the commission over.
besides lottery debt,patel was suffering other financial problems.for example,patel had failed to pay a supplier a debt,and this debt had been referred to an attorney for collection.there was also evidence that patel had bounced checks to several other vendors.the month before the fire,patel had written over in checks for which there were insufficient funds.
in addition to patel financial difficulties,the government presented evidence that,when the fire began,patel was alone in the store.further,in the days before the fire,patel told several people that he thought that the circuit breakers in his store were a fire hazard.however,after the fire,he denied making such statements.
patel contends that this evidence was insufficient to convict him of arson because there was no evidence establishing a direct link between him and the fire.it is true that the evidence inculpating patel was largely circumstantial.circumstantial evidence asserts something else from which the trier of fact may either i reasonably infer the truth of the proposition or ii at least reasonably infer an increase in the probability that the proposition is in fact true.ruiz,at internal quotations and citations omitted.a guilty verdict may be based entirely on circumstantial evidence.see united states scharon,cir united states andujar,cir united states,cir.
here,the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that patel set the fire.as discussed above,there was ample evidence that the fire was set intentionally.further,the evidence showed that patel was alone at the time of the fire,giving him an opportunity to commit the crime,and he had substantial financial troubles,providing him with a motive.in addition,patel warnings that there might be an electrical fire in his store could have been interpreted as an attempt to the crime by offering a false explanation for the fire.taken together,this evidence could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that patel had set the fire 
recently,the eighth circuit rejected a similar sufficiency challenge.in united states schnapp,cir,the defendant parents owned a convenience store that the defendant managed.the store,which was covered by fire insurance,was suffering financial difficulties.see id.at.the defendant was alone in the store just before the fire began and there was evidence that the fire was set intentionally.see id.at.the court concluded that these facts supported the conviction because the evidence showed that someone had committed arson and that the defendant had the opportunity and means to commit the crime.id.at.
the seventh circuit reached a similar conclusion in united states lundy,cir.in lundy,the defendant also owned a convenience store,covered by fire insurance,that was suffering financially.see id.at.prior to the fire,the defendant moved several empty boxes to the rear of the store,a practice that the defendant previously had called a fire hazard.see id.at.on the date of the fire,the defendant was alone in the store for a half hour before the fire was reported.see id.investigators later concluded that the fire was incendiary in nature.id.the court determined that there was sufficient evidence to uphold the arson conviction because the government presented evidence of the defendant motive to set the fire,his plan,his opportunity to carry out the plan,and evidence that the store did not burn accidentally.id.at.similar to schnapp and lundy,the government presented evidence of patel motive and opportunity,that he attempted a,and that the fire was set intentionally.this evidence is sufficient to sustain patel conviction.
double jeopardy 
patel contends that his sentence for violating i arson,mail fraud,and h using fire to commit a felony must be vacated because it contains multiple punishments for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy clause,const.amend.patel claims that his sentence is unlawful because once the jury found him guilty of arson and mail fraud all of the elements of the use of fire count were met.this argument was not raised below and therefore will be considered only for plain error.see united states licausi,cir citing united states kayne,cir.
as relevant here,the double jeopardy clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.see united states,cir.the clause,however,does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.missouri hunter,d.the limited effect of the double jeopardy clause on multiple punishment claims derives from the principle that the power to define criminal offenses and prescribe punishments belongs solely to the legislature.united states handford,cir.as a result,if the legislature decides to impose multiple punishments for the same offense,it may do so.see garrett united states,d.thus,determining the permissibility of imposing multiple punishments for one course of conduct is a matter of discerning the legislature intent.see albernaz united states,d.
often,however,this intent will not be apparent.in such cases,the blockburger test is employed to determine whether the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishments.see blockburger united states.catala fonfrias united states,cir.under blockburger,where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two or more distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are two or more offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.blockburger,at.it must be emphasized,however,that for multiple punishment claims,blockburger merely provides a default rule of statutory construction and should be employed only in the absence of a clear indication of legislative intent.see,at citing hunter,at.
patel relies exclusively on blockburger in framing his argument.were we to reflexively apply blockburger to this case,patel claim might well have some merit.mail fraud and using fire to commit mail fraud appear to fail blockburger separate offense test because every element of mail fraud is an element of using fire to commit mail fraud.see whalen united states,d holding that rape and a killing committed in the course of a rape are the same offense under blockburger because the killing charge requires proof of all the elements of the rape charge and therefore,in the absence of a contrary legislative intent,separate punishments are impermissible.however,patel has entirely ignored the threshold question for reaching the blockburger analysis in the first place,namely,what was congress intent in enacting the using fire statute.this is where his argument falters.
congress intended the using fire statute to enhance the penalty for those who use fire while committing another federal felony and to authorize multiple punishments in such cases.the statute reads 
whoever uses fire to commit any felony which may be prosecuted in a court of the united states shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such felony,be sentenced to imprisonment for years t he term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall not run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.
h emphasis supplied.the statute plainly provides that a defendant who uses fire in the commission of a federal felony will be punished cumulatively for the predicate felony and for using fire to commit that felony.if further support were needed,the legislative history reinforces this intent.the legislative record states that the proposed law makes it an additional offense to use fire in connection with a felony and provides for a sentence in addition to the sentence for the predicate offense,reprinted in,legislative history to the act of.as the statute text and legislative history express,congress meant to punish using fire to commit a felony and the predicate felony cumulatively see blacharski united states,cir united states stewart,cir united states shriver,cir.
because congress explicitly authorized cumulative punishments for the predicate felony and using fire to commit the predicate felony,there was no double jeopardy violation in sentencing patel for both mail fraud and using fire to commit mail fraud,even though these constitute the same offense under blockburger.see shriver,at musone united states,d,aff.cir.patel claims that he is nevertheless entitled to relief because he was also convicted of arson.
neither the text nor the legislative history of the using fire statute reveals whether congress intended it to apply where the defendant is also charged with arson.however,there is no double jeopardy bar to imposing multiple punishments for arson and using fire to commit mail fraud because these are separate offenses under blockburger.arson requires proof that a defendant,through the use of fire,damaged a building used in interstate commerce.i.using fire to commit mail fraud requires proof that the defendant used the mails to further a scheme to defraud.see.thus,arson requires proof that fire damaged a building,which is not an element of using fire to commit mail fraud.and using fire to commit mail fraud requires proof that the defendant used the mails to further a scheme to defraud,which is not an element of arson.therefore,the addition of the arson conviction does not make patel resulting sentence an impermissible cumulative punishment because his punishments were imposed for different offenses see united states smith,cir,cert.denied,d,wl,united states gardner,cir united states zendeli,cir united states nguyen,cir united states karlic,cir united states fiore,cir.
in support of his claim,patel relies on united states corona,cir.corona,however,is distinguishable.in corona,the defendants were convicted of arson,conspiracy to commit arson,and using fire to commit conspiracy to commit arson.see id.at.the overt act for the conspiracy was setting the fire underlying the arson count.see id.at.the court held that,consistent with double jeopardy principles,cumulative punishments could not be imposed because the essence of each of the three counts was the same,arson.see id.for support,the court relied on chaney,which had held that arson could not be the predicate felony for a conviction under the using fire statute because arson and using fire to commit arson are the same offense every arson requires the use of fire,and congress did not intend the using fire statute to enhance the punishment for all arsons.see id.at supra at.the corona court determined that,where the act furthering the arson
