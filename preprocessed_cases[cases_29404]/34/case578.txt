on may,at approximately,fbi and other government agents searched the home of ivette rivera rodríguez rodríguez at calle eugenio maria de hostos in connection with a may robbery of an armored car.rodríguez and her daughter,both barefoot and in nightclothes,were handcuffed and taken outside during the search.in addition to searching the home,the agents,pursuant to another warrant,seized a white mitsubishi mirage technica plate number,which had been parked in front of rodríguez residence.
gregory beninato beninato,who was present at the time of the search,prepared and signed the affidavit which supported the issuance of the warrant to search the rodríguez home.the affidavit contained,among other things,information from three anonymous sources.a magistrate judge reviewed the affidavit and signed the warrant.the warrant contained no description of the property to be searched for or seized but referred to the attached affidavit.rodríguez requested a copy of the warrant at the outset of the search but the agents declined to give it to her.the district court found that the agents gave her the warrant with an attached list of the items sought following the search.

discussion 
plaintiffs contend that the search of the house pursuant to an invalid warrant issued on an insufficient affidavit violated their fourth amendment rights.the district court held that the defendant officers were entitled to qualified immunity because under the circumstances set forth in the affidavit,it was not unreasonable for them to conclude that one or more of the robbers might be in the rodríguez residence and that plaintiffs had failed to cast any real doubt on the validity of the warrant.
qualified immunity 
the parameters of qualified immunity are well settled and we need plow no new ground.qualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from liability and the burdens of litigation.hainey,at in determining whether a government official has qualified immunity,this court conducts a inquiry i whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation ii whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established at the time of the putative violation and iii whether a reasonable officer,situated similarly to the defendant,would have understood the challenged act or omission to contravene the discerned constitutional right.limone condon,cir.qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.a court should conduct the analysis in this sequence and at the earliest possible stage in the case.hainey,at.
ii.the warrant 
we begin our discussion with the warrant because the presence of a valid warrant is essential to the lawfulness of the search in the absence of exigent circumstances.it was clearly established law at the time of the search that a warrant must describe the things to be seized with particularity.the fourth amendment states that no warrant shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv emphasis added see in re lafayette,cir holding warrant invalid for lack of particularity.in united states morris,cir,we stated 
in requiring a particular description of articles to be seized,the fourth amendment makes general searches impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another.as to what is to be taken,nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.united states fuccillo,cir quoting stanford texas,d.unfettered discretion by the executing officer is one of the principal evils against which the fourth amendment provides protection,and thus warrants which lack particularity are prohibited.
the warrant supporting the search of rodríguez home contained no description of the property to be seized.in the space on the form calling for the magistrate to describe the person or property believed to be on the premises to be searched,the warrant simply restated the description of the premises to be searched considering only the face of the warrant,no reasonable officer could believe it described the items to be seized with particularity.
defendants contend,however,that a warrant that does not contain a description of the property to be seized may nevertheless be valid under the fourth amendment if it and is accompanied by supporting documents which contain the required description.in lafayette academy we said,the traditional rule is that the generality of a warrant can not be cured by the specificity of the affidavit which supports it specificity is required in the warrant itself in order to limit the discretion of the executing officer as well as to give notice to the party searched.at quoting united states johnson,cir.we recognized,however,that under some circumstances an affidavit may cure deficiencies which would exist were the warrant to stand alone.we said in united states klein,cir,an affidavit may be referred to for purposes of providing particularity if the affidavit accompanies the warrant and the warrant uses suitable words of reference which incorporate the affidavit.see also,groh ramirez,d listing cases from multiple circuits which have allowed warrants to be construed with reference to an incorporated affidavit.
here,the warrant stated,see attached affidavit,language which suffices to incorporate the affidavit.see massachusetts sheppard,d.a reasonable officer standing in defendants shoes could believe the warrant to be sufficient to authorize the search 
iii.the affidavit 
we next consider whether a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to search the rodríguez residence.malley,at.probable cause existed if the totality of the circumstances disclosed in the beninato affidavit demonstrates a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.gates,at.for purposes of qualified immunity,the test is whether the unlawfulness of the search would have been apparent to an objectively reasonable officer standing in defendants shoes.hainey,at.qualified immunity will be lost only if the affidavit is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable.malley,at.
the beninato affidavit,on the basis of which the warrant issued,relates the facts of an armored car robbery carried out by unidentified persons on may.with reference to the search of rodríguez residence,it contains the following information
