on march,deepak jahagirdar was seated next to,a woman,on a commercial airline flight from dallas to boston.later testified that she awoke from a nap to find jahagirdar hand inside her underpants.cursed at jahagirdar,pushed her way to the aisle,and immediately told a flight attendant that t he guy next to me had his hand down my pants.
upon landing,jahagirdar was arrested.was asked to remain onboard the airplane after the other passengers had exited,and was interviewed by massachusetts state trooper kevin hogaboom.after disembarking,was interviewed again and made a written statement.was then taken to the hospital for a rape examination.
a grand jury indicted jahagirdar on february,charging him so far as is relevant to this case with sexual abuse and attempted sexual abuse,within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states.sexual abuse includes,subject to other conditions the penetration,however slight,of the genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by any object.c.
at trial,testified that jahagirdar fingers were underneath the lip area of the vagina and that his fingers were u nderneath the outer lips labia majora and the inner lips labia minora of her genitals and she made corresponding marks on an anatomical diagram to illustrate her testimony.
on of,jahagirdar sought to impeach her by suggesting that she had not told the doctor or nurse at the hospital that she had been penetrated,and that she had in fact denied having been penetrated when asked by the doctor.jahagirdar also implied that she had settled on her description of the alleged assault after consulting a lawyer and after concluding that jahagirdar was an attractive target for a civil suit.
the government was then allowed to offer evidence from the trooper who had interviewed at the scene.he testified that,when he asked whether she had been penetrated,she stated that she had been,and that,on the basis of her response,he recommended that jahagirdar be charged with rape.
there was also testimony from flight attendants and secret service agents who were on board the plane as to visible emotional distress,and expert testimony that a large quantity of dna was found on jahagirdar hands,consistent with his fingers having come into contact with her vaginal secretions.however,the expert agreed that it was also possible that jahagirdar could have picked up skin cells from the waistband of pants,so this forensic evidence did not incontrovertibly establish just where jahagirdar had placed his hand.
jahagirdar testified in his own defense.he admitted that he had placed his hand in pants,but claimed that had begun and encouraged a sexual encounter,that his hand touched only her pubic hair area,and that he withdrew his hand when he began to feel guilty about betraying his wife trust.
the jury convicted jahagirdar of sexual abuse.the district judge sentenced jahagirdar to months imprisonment,a term of supervised release,and a fine.jahagirdar now appeals,challenging the critical jury instruction as to the scope of the statute,the admission of statements to the trooper,and certain of the district court sentencing determinations.
jahagirdar first argument on appeal is that the district court erroneously instructed the jury as to an element of the offense.section criminalizes knowingly.engag ing in a sexual act with another person if that other person is physically incapable of declining participation in,or communicating unwillingness to engage in,that sexual act.section in turn defines sexual act we underscore the most pertinent language as 
a contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus,and for purposes of this subparagraph contact involving the penis occurs upon penetration,however slight 
b contact between the mouth and the penis,the mouth and the vulva,or the mouth and the anus 
c the penetration,however slight,of the anal or genital opening of another by hand or finger or by any object,with an intent to abuse,humiliate,harass,degrade,or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person or 
d the intentional touching,not through the clothing,of the genitalia of another person who has not attained the age of years with an intent to abuse,humiliate,harass,degrade,or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person emphasis added.
jahagirdar requested that the court instruct the jury that penetration of the genital opening in section c refers to the penetration of the vaginal orifice.the government requested an instruction stating that genital opening includes not only the vagina itself,but also the anterior parts known as the vulva and labia,so that penetration of the labia majora,or outer lips,of the vulva is sufficient to find jahagirdar guilty of violating section.
the district court chose a middle ground,instructing the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that jahagirdar placed his finger or hand beyond ds labia majora to at least the labia minora or inner lips the government is not required to prove that he penetrated her vaginal or i fice.jahagirdar objected.on appeal,jahagirdar continues to press his argument that genital opening means vaginal orifice.
the term genital opening is not itself a medical term of art.the term genitalia refers to the external and internal organs of reproduction,stedman medical dictionary ed,but esp ecially the external organs,random house dictionary ed.unabridged.for women,the external genitalia include the mons pubis,the labia majora,the labia minora,the clitoris,and the vaginal orifice.gray anatomy ed.the term vulva includes all these parts.id.
taken by itself,the term genital opening could conceivably refer to any of at least three successive openings in the female genitalia the exterior opening bounded by the outer lips or labia majora,the interior opening bounded by the contained inner lips or labia minora,and the opening,yet further along the same channel,called the vaginal orifice.
the most straightforward reading of genital opening is that the term encompasses all three orifices including the reading given support by the statutory phrase penetration,however slight.nor is it clear why congress would have sought to distinguish among them,treating more leniently the deliberate insertion of a finger into the outermost that the perpetrator must be acting without consent and for the mostly malign purposes described in the statute.
the literal reading becomes almost conclusive when one comes to understand that,under state law,the definition of rape whether penile rape or the variant digital rape with which jahagirdar was almost always satisfied under state law by penetration of the labia majora,regardless of whether the statute refers to the genital opening as some do,the female sex organ as others do,or even in a few cases the vagina.under this rule,known as the least penetration doctrine,rape laws are designed to punish the fact,not the degree,of penetration,state albert.
w here congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word morissette united states.here,no single term is used in all of the state statutes,but the cluster of terms has been given the same meaning by construction,and the rationale of morissette strongly supports the straightforward reading of the statute that we adopt.
jahagirdar textual response is to point to use of the term vulva in subsections a and b of the definitional statute,section,and argue that congress must have meant to distinguish between vulva and genital opening or else it would simply have repeated the prior,more specific term in subsection c.but if congress had deliberately intended to depart from the approach,the obvious way would been to say vaginal orifice instead of genital opening.
although congress purpose in using genital opening rather than repeating vulva can not be known for sure,one plausible explanation exists and gives jahagirdar no help.in subsection a,congress concern was with penetration by the penis,and in subsection b,with contact between the mouth and either penis,vulva,or anus in b
