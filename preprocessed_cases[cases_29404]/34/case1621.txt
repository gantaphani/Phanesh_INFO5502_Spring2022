leopoldo cabrera beltran was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and heroin.he challenges his conviction and sentence on multiple grounds.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the government.united states murphy,cir.prior to,the defendant worked for a mexican drug trafficking organization in which branden dodson dodson was involved.in,the defendant convinced dodson to work directly for him and make both international and domestic trips at his direction.this drug trafficking and distribution scheme is best understood in terms of the vehicles used in the operation to transport drugs and money.
nissan sentra sometime in late december of,dodson assisted his fiancee,stacy dodson,in delivering a sentra to mexico to be outfitted with secret compartments.once in mexico,dodson recruited katrina dodson,his,to assist him in driving the sentra from mexico to chicago.upon arriving in chicago,they met up with the defendant and another individual and followed them to a detached garage where the defendant directed them to leave the sentra.the defendant paid dodson for the delivery.
in september of,the sentra was stopped,and a search of the vehicle yielded concealed in the front fender.dodson,the registered owner,was not in the vehicle however,when dodson received a dea notice of seizure relating to the money,the defendant requested a copy.
nissan murano in june of,dodson recruited thomas breeden to deliver a murano to the drug organization in mexico.while in mexico,the two men met up with the defendant,who gave to dodson for the purpose of purchasing a jetta.
volkswagen jetta dodson used the to purchase a jetta in the united states.the defendant assisted him in obtaining a permit required to drive the vehicle to mexico.dodson then delivered the jetta to the defendant in mexico.in august of,dodson used the jetta to make two drug smuggling trips at the defendant direction.in the first trip,he picked up the jetta from the defendant in mexico,drove it to michigan,met the defendant,and then delivered it to nebraska.he was paid for this trip.in the second trip,he picked up the jetta from the defendant in nebraska and delivered it to the defendant in mexico.shortly thereafter,dodson delivered the jetta to the defendant associate in michigan and then drove it to the defendant in nebraska.he was paid for this trip.
in october of,dodson picked up the jetta from the defendant in nebraska and delivered it to him in mexico.the defendant returned the jetta to dodson,and dodson delivered it to the defendant in missouri.dodson then drove the jetta to nebraska and left the vehicle in an airport parking lot.the defendant paid dodson for this trip.similarly,in november of,the defendant associate gave dodson the jetta in nebraska,and dodson delivered it to the defendant in mexico.
isuzu rodeo in september of,breeden travelled to mexico,picked up a rodeo from the defendant,and drove it to nebraska.he was paid for making this trip.at some point during the trip,the rodeo broke down,and the defendant provided assistance.
buick in december of,breeden met the defendant in omaha and delivered a buick to the defendant and the defendant brother in chicago.the defendant paid breeden and gave him additional money for dodson to purchase another vehicle.
in january of,dodson was stopped in the jetta at the united states mexico border.customs officials recovered fifteen packages concealed in a hidden compartment.the packages contained kilograms of heroin and kilograms of cocaine.dodson was arrested,and the defendant was subsequently arrested.law enforcement searched two residences associated with the defendant and recovered evidence of drug activity.during the searches,law enforcement also found two vehicles with hidden compartments.one of the vehicles was registered to the defendant.
the defendant was indicted and convicted of conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and heroin.he was sentenced within the guidelines range after application of a enhancement for his role in the illegal operation.
the defendant first contention is that his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments were violated when the district court during voir dire struck three prospective jurors who expressed an inability to accept english translations of spanish testimony and documents.the district court,sua sponte,struck these jurors for cause.because the record establishes that the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the jurors,we reject this argument and affirm the district court.
during voir dire,the judge asked the prospective jurors whether any of them were fluent in the spanish language.trial transcript.she explained her reason for asking the question as follows 
now,the reason i asking you this question is can see that we have interpreters here.i not sure if any of the witnesses who will be testifying in this case will be using interpreters,but it extremely important that when a jury decides the case,if there is a foreign language involved,you must decide the case on the translation that is provided to everybody in the courtroom.we do want basically a shadow translator in the jury box.
trial transcript.three of the prospective jurors indicated some ability to understand the spanish language,so the judge asked each of them a question concerning their ability to accept english translations of the spanish language.each of the prospective jurors expressed an inability to do so 
the court if you were chosen to be a juror in this case and you disagreed with the interpretation or translation by the interpreters,could you base your decision on what the translator all of these translators are court certified.would you have any problem in basing your decision on what the translators have done 
prospective juror well,your honor,i certain if i disagreed with the translator,it would have to be a matter that i would bring up either to the court or to fellow jurors.i also testified in civil court in a foreign country in a foreign language,portuguese in this case,and i know the differences between translation and what was actually said in the court,so it a matter of some sensitivity to me.
the court i f you were to believe that the translators were not accurately translating what the witness might be saying,would you be able to base your decision on what the translator has said,or would you have problems with that 
prospective juror it would depend on,you know,what was said.if,you know,the difference.i could give you a specific answer.
the court all right.you heard my question to the other two potential jurors.would you have difficulty if you felt that there was a translation that you did agree with 
prospective juror yes.
trial transcript.the court,sua sponte,struck each of these prospective jurors for cause of the three,only one was excused based solely on his inability to accept english translations.the other two were excused based on this inability and other factors.see trial transcript.
the defendant first argues that the striking of prospective jurors violated his right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.the supreme court plurality and dissenting opinions in hernandez new york,d,a factually similar case,guide our resolution of the defendant equal protection claim.hernandez involved a batson challenge to the striking of two prospective latino jurors.at trial,the prosecutor explained that his decision to peremptorily strike the potential jurors was based on his uncertainty as to whether they could accept the interpreter as the final arbiter of what was said by each of the witnesses,especially where there were going to be witnesses.id.at plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted.a majority of the court concluded that the prosecutor rationale was a basis for striking the jurors that did not contravene the equal protection clause.see id.at plurality opinion id,concurring.
although hernandez involved a batson challenge rather than a challenge as in the instant case,seven of the supreme court justices in hernandez took the opportunity to note that a juror inability to accept a translator interpretation would support a valid challenge.in the plurality opinion,the court acknowledged that a juror inability to accept a translation would be a valid challenge.id.at plurality opinion while the reason offered by the prosecutor for a peremptory strike need not rise to the level of a challenge for cause,the fact that it corresponds to a valid challenge will demonstrate its character.internal citation omitted.similarly,the three dissenting justices collectively espoused the same opinion.see id.at stevens,dissenting i f the prosecutor concern was valid and substantiated by the record,it would have supported a challenge for cause.id.at blackmun,dissenting concurring in that part of justice stevens dissent accordingly,in consideration of hernandez,we hold that the striking of prospective jurors based on their perceived inability to accept an interpreter as the final arbiter of what was said or written does not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment 
the defendant also argues that the striking of the prospective jurors violated his rights under the sixth amendment.in selecting a jury,t he trial judge is in the best position to make judgments about the impartiality and credibility of potential jurors based on the judge own evaluations of responses to questions.united states barber,cir internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a s a matter of law,the trial court is to exclude veniremen who can not be impartial.united states turner,cir.we review challenges to the qualifications of jurors under an abuse of discretion standard.id.at.a district judge retains a very broad discretion in deciding whether to excuse a juror for cause and his decision will not be overturned except for manifest abuse of that discretion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the sixth amendment entitles a defendant to a trial by an impartial jury.const.amend.vi.a juror is impartial only if he can lay aside his opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court patton yount,d emphasis added see also smith phillips,d due process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.
it is integral to the promise of a fair trial that all jurors in a particular case base their decision on the same evidence.see sheppard maxwell,d noting the requirement that the jury verdict be based on evidence received in open court,not from outside sources evidence that is received in open court is determined,in large part,by the district court,which has broad discretion in the control of evidence.united states gomez,cir.in our view,the court right to control the evidence may include requiring the jury to accept,as evidence,translations by translators.we reach this conclusion because a juror who,during trial,refuses to accept a translation,in favor of his own interpretation of a language,is effectively deciding to base his verdict in the case on evidence different than that considered by the other jurors.fundamental to our jury process is the requirement that all jurors consider the same evidence.
that the prospective jurors only anticipated the possibility that they would be unable to accept translations is sufficient to support the district court in light of the considerable discretion it is afforded in this area as a result,the district court decision to strike the prospective jurors was not a manifest abuse of its discretion and did not contravene the sixth amendment.
the defendant second contention also concerns the sixth amendment.at trial,the government used treasury enforcement communications system tecs records to show that the defendant and other crossed the border on certain dates and in certain vehicles.the defendant argues that the admission of the tecs records into evidence violated his sixth amendment confrontation clause right to the border patrol personnel who produced the information and statements contained in the tecs records.because we hold that tecs records are not testimonial,we reject this argument.
according to the government evidence,tecs is a case management system maintained by customs and border protection,a division of the department of homeland security.the system is used to keep a record of who and what enters the united states.the information contained in a tecs record may include a person name,date of birth,potentially what document they used,potentially which method they used to enter into the united states,and potentially which method they used to exit the united states.trial transcript.for vehicular border crossings,tecs maintains a record of the vehicles used and their license plates.for air travel across the border,tecs records may also include information on the departing and receiving airports.
at trial,the defendant objected to the admission of the tecs records on hearsay grounds only.he raised a confrontation clause argument for the first time in his memorandum in support of his motion for a new trial.
an objection to the admission of evidence must be both specific and timely.see.a.the hearsay objection at trial can not be understood to include a confrontation clause objection,see united states dukagjini,cir noting that a hearsay objection would not in itself preserve a confrontation clause claim,and the objection was untimely,see united states parodi,cir timeliness of objection under rule requires that it be made at the time the evidence is offered internal quotation marks omitted united states gibbs,cir en banc holding that confrontation clause objection made for first time in rule motion for acquittal following government,despite prior hearsay objection to same evidence,was untimely.accordingly,the issue was not preserved for appeal,and we review for plain error.see united states olano,d.
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.this clause bars the introduction of testimonial statements unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant.see crawford washington,d.inherent in this rule,however,is the limitation that a statement must be testimonial to be excludable under the confrontation clause.united states udeozor,cir.only statements of this sort cause the declarant to be a witness within the meaning of the confrontation clause.davis washington,d.
the most comprehensive definition of the term testimonial is found in crawford,where the supreme court provided three formulations of what it refers to as the core class of testimonial statements.at.these formulations include 
ex parte testimony or its functional equivalent that is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions and statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
interpreting crawford,this court has concluded that the common nucleus of the core class of testimonial statements is whether a reasonable person in the declarant position would have expected his statements to be used at trial that is,whether the declarant would have expected or intended to bear witness against another in a later proceeding.udeozor,at.recently in melendez diaz massachusetts,d,the supreme court held that a forensic laboratory report was testimonial and,therefore,the analysts were subject to confrontation under the sixth amendment.at.because the defendant wishes to compare the tecs records in this case to the lab report in melendez diaz,we review the facts of that case by comparison.
in melendez diaz,the supreme court held that affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis were testimonial because they fell within the core class of testimonial statements that the court had previously laid out in crawford.at internal quotation marks omitted.in reaching this holding,the court relied heavily on the fact that the affidavits at issue were specifically created for trial purposes.see id.at acknowledging that affidavits were made for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant id.at noting that the analyst statements contained in the affidavit were prepared specifically for use at petitioner trial.
unlike the affidavits at issue in melendez diaz,the tecs records in this case were not created for trial.to the contrary,the information contained in the tecs records was entered for the mere purpose of maintain ing a record of what was coming into the united states.trial transcript.the customs service officials who enter the license numbers of vehicles crossing the border into the tecs system have no motivation other than to mechanically register this unambiguous factual matter.united states puente,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as the ninth circuit has explained,tecs records are records of routine,nonadversarial matters and the simple recordation of license numbers of all vehicles which pass a station is not of the adversarial confrontation nature.united states orozco,cir.
in melendez diaz,the supreme court explained that b usiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules,but because having been created for the administration of an entity affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial they are not testimonial.at.this language does not mean that all business and public records are.see united states jackson,cir noting that under melendez diaz,business records are not per se nontestimonial,but they are generally emphasis in original.however,it does indicate that business and public records are if they were created for the administration of an entity affairs rather than for proving some fact at trial.melendez diaz.at see also id.at documents kept in the regular course of business may ordinarily be admitted at trial despite their hearsay status.but that is not the case if the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.internal citation omitted.
at least two federal courts have held that tecs records are admissible under the public records exception to hearsay.see puente,at orozco,at we agree.the information contained in the tecs records was registered merely to administer the affairs of the united states customs and border patrol.this reason is entirely unrelated to proving some fact at trial.the tecs records,thus,are,see melendez diaz.at,and their admission into evidence did not violate the confrontation clause,see michigan bryant,d noting that when a statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creating an substitute for trial testimony the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence,not the confrontation clause.
the defendant next challenges his conviction under an indictment that charged him with conspiracy to import and distribute kilogram or more of heroin and kilograms or more of cocaine.the jury found the defendant guilty of the heroin offenses in the same amount as alleged in the indictment.however,the jury found the defendant guilty of the cocaine offenses in the amount of grams or more,but less than kilograms,an amount less than that alleged in the indictment.the defendant argues that his conviction on the lesser included offense amounted to a variance and thus requires reversal.
a defendant charged with conspiracy to import or distribute an amount of a controlled substance can,if the evidence warrants,be convicted of one of the lesser included offenses based on a smaller amount of the substance.united states brooks,cir.such a verdict is permissible as an offense necessarily included in the offense charged.c.because the lesser included offense is included in the charged offense,there is no variance.see united states martinez,cir t his results in neither a prejudicial variance from,nor a constructive amendment to the indictment because the defendant was merely convicted of a offense and all the elements of the former necessarily include those of the latter.
the defendant also argues that the indictment was defective.it is unclear whether the defendant argues that the indictment suffered from multiplicity or duplicity.however,the defendant did not allege any defect in the indictment prior to trial as required by rule b b of the federal rules of criminal procedure.because the defendant fails to provide a showing of good cause,his claim that the indictment was defective is waived.see.e united states price,cir applying waiver rule to multiplicity and duplicity challenges where a defendant failed to raise the issues prior to trial.
the defendant next contends that the trial court erred during jury deliberations by giving an allen charge rather than granting a mistrial.after a trial,jury deliberations began on the afternoon of october.at midday on october,the jury submitted a note to the court that read,judge,we can not all come to an agreement.do you want our response now trial transcript.the district court judge encouraged the jury to continue deliberating.later that afternoon,the jury submitted a second note that read,we have no unanimous verdict on any of the counts and do not foresee this happening.trial transcript.at that time,the judge gave the jury a modified allen charge and dismissed the jury for the day.the jury reached a verdict the next day of court before lunchtime.
the defendant did not move for a mistrial after the jury announced its inability to reach a verdict,nor did he object to the giving of an allen charge we therefore review the claims for plain error only.see olano,at united states ford,cir.
the court has considerable discretion and is in the best position to gauge whether a jury is deadlocked or able to proceed further with its deliberations.united states seeright,cir.we can not conclude that the district court judge in this case committed plain error in giving the modified allen charge after receiving two jury notes expressing an inability to reach a verdict.nor can we conclude that the court plainly erred by not,sua sponte,ordering a mistrial after approximately two days of jury deliberations.
the defendant also contends that the district court should have granted his motion for acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.the jury verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence,taking the view most favorable to the government,to support it.united states burgos,cir en banc emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states green,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendant does not challenge the quantity of the evidence.rather,he argues that the testimony of the witnesses was vague,uncertain,and incredible.the jury has already assessed the credibility of the witnesses,and this court can not do so on appeal.see murphy,at the jury,not the reviewing court,weighs the credibility of the evidence.substantial evidence supported the verdict,and the district court did not err in denying the motion for acquittal 
the defendant next contends that the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of lorenzo salgado,who testified that he purchased heroin from the defendant on several occasions prior to any of the conduct alleged in the indictment.the district court admitted the evidence under federal rule of evidence b.
under rule b,
e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.
b.rule b is an inclusive rule,admitting all evidence of other crimes or acts except that which tends to prove only criminal disposition.unite
