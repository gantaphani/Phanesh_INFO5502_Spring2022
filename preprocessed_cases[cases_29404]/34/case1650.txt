charlene ross brought claims against washington mutual bank wamu for false reporting of credit information and unfair debt collection practices.but she tarried too long,and by filing outside of the fair credit reporting act fcra statute of limitations she lost any fcra claims she may have had,whatever their merit.
ross has tried to skirt this deficiency by bringing several state law claims.those claims,in the main,are preempted by b f,the fcra preemption provision.and though ross contends her claims are expressly authorized by another fcra provision,e,she fails to present evidence that wamu acted with the malice or willful intent to injure necessary to benefit from this section.ruling otherwise would require us to broaden the definition of malice to include mere negligence,and such a holding would vitiate both the fcra statute of limitations and its preemption provision.
only ross unfair debt collection practices claim survives preemption,but it too fails because she can not prove proximate causation,an element of her state law claim.the district court awarded wamu summary judgment on both of these claims,and we now affirm.
james williams executed a mortgage on a home on may.this loan was eventually assigned to wamu,and wamu held it for all periods relevant to this case.the fdic is involved in this case as the receiver of washington mutual bank.on or about august,williams quitclaimed his interest in the property to charlene ross,and the two married the following month.the relationship soured,and in april ross secured a domestic violence protective order evicting williams.ross obtained another order the following month naming her as the property owner.williams,however,retained sole responsibility for the loan.
ross contacted wamu about this arrangement in july.at that time,ross confirmed that any payments she made would be properly credited to the mortgage,requested an irs form to claim a tax deduction for mortgage interest,and asked that she receive monthly mortgage statements at the address of the encumbered home.ross then sent wamu the necessary documentation,including her social security card,the may order,and the august quitclaim deed.in the process of fulfilling ross requests,wamu mistakenly listed ross name on the mortgage.
the loan went into default when no payments were made from june through september.on september,ross discovered that wamu had reported negative information about her to consumer reporting agencies cras.wamu took this action based on its mistaken belief that ross was responsible for the loan.ross contacted wamu,but wamu informed her that it did not know why the name on the loan was changed.she also contacted the cras directly,but they could only confirm that wamu had indeed placed the negative trade line on her report.
wamu began pursuing foreclosure proceedings in october,but in february ross made the payments necessary to reinstate the mortgage.later in,ross contacted wamu about the loan appearing on her credit reports.wamu conducted an investigation,suspended credit reporting for the loan,and notified ross of these actions in a september,letter.
but in june the loan again went into default.in august,ross notified wamu that one of the cras was still reporting the loan on her credit report.wamu conducted another investigation,acknowledged that ross was not responsible for the loan,and directed the cras to remove the loan from ross credit report.the loan has not been on ross credit reports since december,but as a result of the negative trade line,she alleges she was denied credit on multiple occasions,including a business loan that ross claims would have allowed her to open an facility that would have made in annual profits.
other events occurring in ross life during this time period are relevant to her claims.between and,ross experienced numerous difficulties while employed as a high school teacher in the school system.during this time,she pursued two employment discrimination charges and claims to have developed carpal tunnel syndrome and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd.this is also when wamu,acting on its mistaken belief that ross was responsible for the loan,placed debt collection calls to ross work.
wamu again began pursuing foreclosure proceedings in february.on may,ross filed suit in north carolina state court seeking to enjoin the foreclosure.she also alleged north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act ncudtpa claims against wamu.the court denied her motion for a preliminary injunction,and the trustee sold the home.on august,ross dismissed her lawsuit against wamu without prejudice.
then on august,ross again filed a complaint against wamu in north carolina state court.ross alleged common law defamation claims,violations of the fcra,and violations of the ncudtpa.ross sought actual,statutory,and punitive damages for her wrongfully damaged credit scores,emotional distress,poor health,lost income,and lost business opportunities.wamu removed the action to federal court on november.wamu then moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on july.ross washington mutual bank,d.ross now appeals the grant of summary judgment on her ncudtpa claims.
the ncudtpa regulates trade practices.included within this statutory scheme are several consumer protection provisions.id,to.article of the ncudtpa contains a general ban on unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.id.a.article of the ncudtpa is the north carolina debt collection act ncdca,which prohibits various unfair debt collection practices.id.to.we will first evaluate ross claims under article of the ncudtpa before turning to her ncdca claims under article.
ross claims that wamu reporting of incorrect information to cras violates the ncudtpa,which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.a.but the fcra preemption provision,b f,preempts this claim,regardless of its underlying merits.
the fcra is a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to regulate the consumer reporting industry.a.congress recognized both the vital role of cras and the need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.id.cras provide a critical economic service by collecting and transmitting consumer credit information.see cushman trans union,cir.but cras can make mistakes by reporting inaccurate credit information.see id.these errors are detrimental to the consumer,the creditor,and the economy as a whole.see id.
accordingly,congress determined that while cras must be allowed to perform their function,a regulatory framework was necessary to prevent errors in credit reporting and remedy those that do occur.in,congress accommodated both of these interests by enacting the fcra,a comprehensive series of restrictions on the disclosure and use of credit information assembled by consumer reporting agencies.ftc manager,retail credit.the fcra has been drawn with extreme care,reflecting the tug of the competing interests,and courts must respect the balance struck by congress when interpreting its provisions.nelson chase manhattan mortgage,cir.
as originally enacted,the fcra generally permitted state regulation of the consumer reporting industry.with but few exceptions,the original preemption provision,a,preempted state laws only to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of the fcra.as part of the ongoing process of this statutory scheme,congress amended the fcra with the consumer credit reporting reform act of ccrra,stat,to.the ccrra added a strong preemption provision,b,to this comprehensive legislative framework.the purpose of this new subsection was,in part,to avoid a patchwork system of conflicting regulations.michael epshteyn,note,the fair and accurate credit transactions act of will preemption of state credit reporting laws harm consumers,geo.
included within the new subsection added by the ccrra is b f,the preemption provision at issue in this case.it states 
no requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any state with respect to any subject matter regulated under f section of this title,relating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies 
section describes the responsibilities of those who report credit information to cras.section a explains the d uty of furnishers of information to provide accurate information,which includes correcting any errors in reporting.a.section b contains the duties of furnishers of information a fter receiving notice of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a person to a consumer reporting agency.b.these duties include conducting an investigation into the dispute and correcting any errors discovered with the cras.id.
ross ncudtpa claim under runs into the teeth of the fcra preemption provision.her claim concerns wamu reporting of inaccurate credit information to cras,an area regulated in great detail under a b.because ross ncudtpa claim seeks to use as a requirement or prohibition under north carolina law concerning subject matter regulated under section,it is squarely preempted by the plain language of the fcra.b f.
ross,however,argues that her claim is expressly authorized by e because wamu acted with malice or willful intent to injure.this argument is unavailing.
our analysis begins with an overview of e.section regulates the disclosures that cras must provide to consumers under.section requires cras to disclose to consumers the information in their credit file upon request.sections a through d contain the procedures cras must follow when providing these disclosures.section e then states 
except as provided in sections and of this title,no consumer may bring any action or proceeding in the nature of defamation,invasion of privacy,or negligence with respect to the reporting of information against any consumer reporting agency,any user of information,or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency,based on information disclosed pursuant to section,or of this title,or based on information disclosed by a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse action,based in whole or in part on the report except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.
congress intended this section general bar on defamation,invasion of privacy,and negligence actions to be the quid pro quo for providing full disclosure under the fcra.see thornton equifax,cir.the only exception to this bar is a narrow one,requiring proof of malice or willful intent to injure the consumer.e.
thus,the e authorization ross seeks involves a inquiry.first,we ask whether the claim falls within the scope of e,which includes only claims based on information disclosed pursuant to section,or of this title,or based on information disclosed by a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse action,based in whole or in part on the report.the second step in the analysis involves determining whether the malice or willful intent to injure exception to the general bar against state law actions applies.e.
as an initial matter,it is unclear that ross contentions even fall within the scope of e.for starters,any cause of action ross may have had under or is now plainly by the fcra statute of limitations.see.turning to the body of e,ross must show that her action is based on information disclosed pursuant to section,or or based on information disclosed by a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse action,based in whole or in part on the report.e.sections and,as noted above,apply only to cras.wamu is not a cra.see a f.section applies only to users of consumer reports.wamu is not a user of consumer reports ross.the final e category for actions based on information disclosed by a user of a consumer report to or for a consumer against whom the user has taken adverse action,based in whole or in part on the report does not appear to apply because wamu neither used ross consumer report nor took adverse action based on information in ross report or information disclosed by a user.e.thus,it is not clear that ross ncudtpa claim under falls within the ambit of e.see ross washington mutual bank,d,johnson jp morgan chase bank,d,knudson wachovia bank,d.
even if we assume arguendo that e applies,ross can not meet the second step of the analysis.viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to ross,wamu did not act with the malice or willful intent to injure necessary for ross to qualify for the e exception.e.
as a preliminary matter,the fcra does not define malice.courts are split on whether state or federal law governs the meaning of malice in e.ross cites north carolina law for the definition 
actual malice may be proven by evidence of or personal hostility on the part of the declarant or by a showing that the declarant published the defamatory statement with knowledge that it was false,with reckless disregard for the truth or with a high degree of awareness of its probable falsity.
dobson harris,internal quotation marks omitted.and this court has previously looked to state law for the definition as well.beattie nations credit financial services,app x,cir looking to south carolina law for the definition of malice.
other courts have reasoned that substantive aspects of federal statutes should be governed by federal law.see,thornton.equifax,cir.these courts have suggested the actual malice standard from new york times sullivan,as an appropriate definition.see gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,cir morris equifax information services,llc,cir thornton,at.accordingly,these courts look to whether the statement in question was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.new york times,at.
we need not resolve this matter because ross can not create a genuine issue of material fact under either definition.furthermore,the critical aspect of malice at issue in this wamu reported information it knew was included under both the state and federal definitions.
ross argues that wamu acted with malice because wamu reported negative loan information about ross to cras even though it knew ross was not responsible for the loan.ross principally relies on an august,note in wamu records as the basis for this contention.this note states,we reported the loan on her credit report which we can not as she does not have note liability.we corrected the credit reports and she will no longer be reported as having a loan w wamu.in ross view,this note,coupled with the fact that one cra continued to report ross loan into december,is evidence that wamu continued to report negative credit information even after it learned of its falsity.
but this can not be.ross has not brought forth evidence proving the key element of wamu knew the loan information was incorrect at the time of reporting.quite the contrary.the record is replete with evidence that wamu made a regrettable but honest mistake and took action to remedy this error once ross brought it to wamu attention.wamu initial error,putting the loan in ross name,occurred in the course of its efforts to comply with ross wishes.ross presented a unique and rather complicated set of circumstances.she lived in the home financed with the mortgage in question,requested that monthly mortgage statements be mailed to her,and asked for a mortgage interest deduction form.yet she was not the one responsible for the loan.in the course of completing the paperwork to accommodate ross situation,wamu mistakenly put the loan in ross name.
when ross notified wamu that it was reporting false loan information to the cras,wamu suspended credit reporting on the loan and sent a letter to ross notifying her of its remedial efforts.when ross later informed wamu that one cra was still reporting the loan,wamu again took corrective action,contacting the cra and asking it to remove the loan from ross report.these are not the actions of a malicious business entity.they are evidence of wamu efforts to right its wrong.
the linchpin of ross argument is that one cra continued to report incorrect loan information after wamu knew
