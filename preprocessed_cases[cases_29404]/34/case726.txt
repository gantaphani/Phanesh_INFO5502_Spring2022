david faulkingham is charged with possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute heroin.on the day of his arrest he made inculpatory statements to agents of the maine drug enforcement agency mdea.the agents did not give the required warning under miranda arizona,d,before faulkingham made the statements.faulkingham own statements were thus ordered suppressed under miranda.his statements,however,also led to the discovery of derivative evidence that was important to the government case against him.that derivative evidence was testimony by a coconspirator and the drugs themselves,and it is the subject of this appeal.
faulkingham argued,and the district court agreed,that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine,common to fourth amendment jurisprudence,should also apply to the derivative evidence,given the facts of this particular miranda violation under the fifth amendment.united states faulkingham,d.in the end,the court granted the motion to suppress,believing that suppression of the derivative evidence will serve to remind law enforcement that even in the excitement of the moment law enforcement retains an important duty to inform an individual taken into custody of his constitutional rights.id.at.
individuals in custody should,of course,be informed of their rights.but we disagree that in this case the concerns that animate the fifth amendment require the suppression of the derivative evidence,as opposed to the suppression of faulkingham own unwarned statements.
we outline the facts in this case as found by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district judge,and supplemented from the record.on july,mark leonard,an agent of the mdea,received information from a confidential informant that faulkingham was a drug dealer who lived on route in tremont,maine,and drove a tan lincoln town car.the confidential informant also told leonard that faulkingham driver license was suspended,a fact that leonard confirmed later that day.
on august,leonard and another mdea agent,robert hutchings,set off for tremont to follow up on the information leonard received from the confidential informant.on their way,the agents obtained a jail photograph of faulkingham from the hancock county sheriff department.
when the agents reached the residence,they observed it from their car,which was parked in a driveway not far away.at approximately,the agents saw a tan lincoln town car leaving the driveway of the residence.they followed the town car,until it slowed down to a stop.leonard and hutchings thought the driver of the town car matched the person in the photograph of faulkingham.
hutchings approached the car,showed his identification shield,said he was an mdea agent,and told the driver to shut his car off,and get out of the car.faulkingham identified himself.hutchings conducted a patdown search and found cash,heroin,and a syringe on faulkingham.hutchings then arrested faulkingham for operating his vehicle after suspension of his license,handcuffed him,and seated him in the back seat of the agents car.hutchings said to faulkingham j ust sit here.i do want you to say anything to me at this point.i have some paperwork we going to have to do.i have some paperwork i going to have to read to you.hutchings also told faulkingham that he was seek ing his cooperation.among the paperwork to which hutchings referred was a form containing the miranda warning,which,if signed,would confirm that faulkingham had received the warning.
hutchings stored the evidence from the patdown search in the trunk of the car.when he returned to faulkingham,he did not give him the miranda warning,even though,as the magistrate judge noted,hutchings understood that he had a suspect in custody that he intended to interrogate.united states faulkingham,no.crim,wl,at.may.faulkingham told hutchings that he would be sick in about two hours from heroin withdrawal.hutchings explained to faulkingham that if he got sick,the agents would get him medical attention.faulkingham did not then show physical signs of being under the influence of any drugs,and the agents kept checking with faulkingham throughout the process to see how he was feeling.
in the meantime,agent leonard dealt with the two other passengers in the town car.after confirming that there were no warrants for the passengers,he told them they could leave,and they left the scene on foot.
faulkingham told hutchings that if he was going to cooperate,then the two passengers who were walking away would pose a problem.one of the passengers,faulkingham said,was the roommate of his supplier,and as soon as he returned to his home the heroin will either be flushed or hidden or something.faulkingham also asked the agents what type of deal he could get if he decided to cooperate.the agents explained that they were not authorized to make any deals,but would pass on information about his cooperation to the prosecutor,who could work out a deal with faulkingham attorney.
leonard and hutchings searched faulkingham car,but found no other significant evidence.while they were searching the car,faulkingham wife,who happened to drive by the scene,stopped in her red pickup truck.she was dismayed when hutchings told her of faulkingham arrest and said faulkingham had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program.hutchings gave faulkingham wife permission to speak with him.faulkingham apologized to her,and asked her to get some bail money and to call his attorney.
as the agents were finishing up their search of faulkingham car,faulkingham got the agents attention,and when they walked up to their car,he told them that if he was going to cooperate and be helpful to them,he would have to be on the phone with his supplier by hutchings and leonard both realized that it was already leonard called the agents supervisor,peter arno,to get instructions on how to proceed.arno gave the agents permission to have faulkingham contact his supplier and record the phone call.
faulkingham asked the agents to leave the roadside so that he would not be seen.after releasing faulkingham from the handcuffs,hutchings drove the agents car,with faulkingham in it,to a marina about a mile away.leonard followed them in the town car.at the marina,faulkingham made a few attempts to contact his supplier,but he failed because of bad reception.faulkingham also suspected that his supplier did not answer the phone because he did not recognize the caller id number,or because the supplier roommate had already informed the supplier of faulkingham arrest.the agents asked faulkingham how he was feeling to be sure he was not yet sick.faulkingham continued to appear normal.
because faulkingham could not reach his supplier from the marina,he persuaded the agents to go to his house and make the phone call from there.when they arrived at faulkingham house,he did make contact with mark power,who he said was his supplier faulkingham told power that he had been stopped by the police just for a driving thing,and had been released by the police.he also told power that he should come over to the faulkingham residence with the heroin in order to hide it because mdea agents were in the area.eventually,power arrived at the residence.after being confronted by the agents,power also agreed to cooperate,and drugs were seized from power residence.
throughout the agents contact with faulkingham,they did not administer the miranda warning to him.at the suppression hearing,they conceded that they should have but had not done so.they explained that lack of time and the rapid pace of the events on the day of the arrest were the reasons for their omission.
faulkingham,power,and another coconspirator were indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and possessing heroin with the intent to distribute it,in violation of a,and.
faulkingham filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the mdea agents while in their custody,mark power testimony,and the heroin to which power statements led the agents.the magistrate judge decision recommended the motion as to faulkingham statements be granted because the agents did not give him the miranda warning,but that the motion as to power statements and the physical evidence be denied,because the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply to the miranda exclusionary rule.faulkingham,wl,at.
the district court modified the magistrate judge recommended decision by applying the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to this miranda violation,and suppressing not only faulkingham custodial statements,but the derivative evidence of power statements and the drugs.faulkingham,d.the district court appropriately rejected any per se application of the fruits doctrine to the miranda violation,and made factual findings.id.at.it found that the miranda violation was not a technical one,and that it followed from that violation that faulkingham did not knowingly and intelligently understand that he was waiving his privilege against compulsory.id.at.the court found that all the derivative evidence at issue was obtained through faulkingham unwarned statements,and that the derivative evidence would not otherwise have been inevitably discovered.id.at.the district court agreed with the magistrate judge factual findings that there were no coercive official tactics by the police and that faulkingham statements were voluntary.id.at.the court did not find that the agents had deliberately violated faulkingham miranda rights.id.at.it stated,however,that their failure to give the warning was negligent,at best.id.it then reasoned that faulkingham statements were coerced by the lack of a miranda warning.id.at.it concluded that the deterrence rationale for miranda dictated the suppression of both faulkingham statements and the derivative evidence.id.at.
the government now appeals from the suppression order.it argues that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine does not apply to miranda violations.the government also argues that this court opinion in united states byram,cir,on which the district court based its decision,does not apply to this case,and that even if the factors considered by the court in byram were to be used here the derivative evidence should not be suppressed.
on an appeal of a disposition of a motion to suppress,we accept the district court findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and evaluate its legal conclusions de novo.united states chhien,cir.thus,we must determine anew whether the evidence obtained as a result of faulkingham unwarned statements should be suppressed under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.
the requirement that a confession must be voluntary in order to be admitted into evidence rests on two constitutional bases the fifth amendment right against and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.dickerson united states,d.it is clear that faulkingham statements to the agents were not obtained in violation of the due process clause,because an examination of the totality of all the surrounding the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,schneckloth bustamonte,d,shows that faulkingham expressed a willingness to cooperate with the mdea agents,and spoke freely to them about his supplier,without even being formally questioned by the agents.
it is also clear,however,that faulkingham statements were obtained in violation of the fifth amendment because he was not given a miranda warning.as the district court correctly decided,his statements to the agents should therefore be suppressed.the question here is whether the reasons for mandating a miranda warning to offset the impact of an inherently coercive custodial interrogation on an individual fifth amendment rights not to incriminate himself,dickerson,at,should also lead to the suppression of derivative evidence,the leads to which are obtained from the statements of a defendant during an unwarned interrogation.in other words,should the evidence derived from faulkingham statements,or fruits evidence,also be suppressed because the agents violated the miranda rule in considering this question,it is important to keep in mind the twin rationales for miranda trustworthiness and deterrence.oregon elstad,d.
in elstad,the supreme court reversed the suppression of derivative evidence in the form of a later warned and voluntary statement,after the initial statement was given without a miranda warning,and was itself suppressed.at.the court rejected the application of the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis to determine whether the second statement should be suppressed.instead,it focused on whether the second statement was voluntarily made,and concluded that because it was voluntary,it was admissible in evidence.id.at.
after the supreme court decision in elstad,several circuits adopted a flat rule that a miranda violation may never lead to suppression of derivative evidence.see,united states sterling,cir united states desumma,cir united states,cir united states,cir.
by contrast,this court has expressed the tentative view,in the absence of further guidance from the supreme court,that elstad does not wholly bar the door to excluding evidence derived from a miranda least where the miranda violation is not merely technical,where there is a substantial nexus between the violation and the fruits evidence,and where the fruits evidence,in byram a second statement made in open court,is not itself preceded by an adequate miranda warning.byram,at.
there are at least three categories of evidence that may be derivative fruits of an confession physical evidence,statements by a witness who is not the unwarned defendant,and later statements by the defendant himself after an initial unwarned statement.our decision in byram and the supreme court decision in elstad involved the third statements by the defendant.this case involves,instead,only the first two evidence and statements of another witness.
it is entirely plausible to think that the admissibility of these three different categories of evidence derived from custodial statements should be analyzed in different ways nonetheless,the supreme court thus far has not differentiated in its analysis between the three categories of derivative evidence and,to the contrary,has used broad language,discouraging the use of the fruits doctrine following a miranda violation,whatever the nature of the derivative evidence.elstad,at.t he miranda presumption does not require that the statements and their fruits be discarded as inherently tainted.in deciding that the fruits doctrine did not apply to the miranda violations on the facts of elstad,the court had to distinguish a violation of the miranda rule from violations of different clauses of the constitution to which the fruits doctrine does apply.
the most common application of the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is as a remedy for violations of the fourth amendment,which protects against unlawful arrests and searches.the supreme court first articulated the fruits doctrine in a case where the defendant fourth amendment rights were violated.wong sun united states,d see also taylor alabama,d dunaway new york,d.the court has also applied the doctrine to some violations of the fifth amendment,nix williams,d citing murphy waterfront comm n,d,which stated that the doctrine applied to the fruits of compelled testimony,and to violations of the sixth amendment under the massiah doctrine id.at.citing united states wade,d,which applied the fruits doctrine to courtroom identifications resulting from pretrial identifications at which no defense counsel was present,id.at.perhaps for that reason,elstad discussed the particular fifth amendment concerns protected by the miranda rule.
elstad drew a distinction between fourth amendment rights and fifth amendment rights,the latter being those that implicate miranda warnings,and said that a procedural miranda violation differs in significant respects from violations of the fourth amendment.elstad,at.elstad stated that the purpose of the exclusionary rule under the fourth amendment is to deter unreasonable searches,no matter how probative their fruits.id.the fourth amendment is specifically concerned with an individual privacy and security and so with the methodology that law enforcement officers use in their searches.bustamonte,at.by contrast,elstad reasoned that the fifth amendment,by its terms,is not concerned
