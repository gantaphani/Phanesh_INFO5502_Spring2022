dwayne thompson appellant or thompson appeals the district court judgment entered on march.thompson argues that the district court erred in failing to suppress a the fruits of a search which,he contends,law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct,and b statements he made while in custody,prior to being presented to a magistrate judge.thompson claims that such statements violated the mcnabb mallory rule.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm the district court denial of appellant motion to suppress the fruits of the search,but we will reverse the district court suppression ruling regarding thompson statements.accordingly,we will vacate and remand thompson judgment of conviction.
factual and procedural history 
from until july,dwayne thompson was the supplier for a cocaine distribution network known as the cali connect.the cali connect shipped cocaine to the east coast where it was distributed,including in and around the pittsburgh area.thompson transported cocaine from california to pittsburgh either in one of his own vehicles or in rentals cars.after completing his deliveries,thompson would wait for the money before returning to california,or receive payment on his next trip to the area.
investigators became aware of thompson through their cooperating witnesses and a wiretap investigation.several cooperating witnesses named thompson as the source for the cali connect cocaine.in wiretapped phone conversations with other targets,thompson made comments that investigators interpreted to be.
a.the traffic stop 
on june,thompson was involved in a traffic stop near amarillo,texas.trooper livermore of the texas department of public safety was running traffic on i near amarillo,texas,along with his partner,chad grange.within the law enforcement community,i is a known corridor for narcotics,weapons,and money.app.shortly before,livermore saw a maroon pickup truck,with a cover on the bed,traveling eastbound at a speed of mph in a mph zone.it is illegal under texas law to travel in excess of a posted speed limit.livermore stopped the truck and approached the passenger side window.thompson was the sole occupant of the pickup truck.
livermore spoke with thompson and advised him of the reason for the stop.livermore asked thompson where he was going.thompson replied that he was en route to indianapolis and that he would be staying there for approximately three weeks.livermore observed that thompson only had one suitcase for such a long trip,and it raised his suspicions.livermore said,i did think it was the norm to have that size luggage for the length of the trip.app.
livermore also claimed that thompson appeared nervous he did not make eye contact,his voice was shaky,and a vein in the side of his neck was pulsing.thompson signs of nervousness,in conjunction with the small suitcase,the fact that i is a known drug corridor,and knowledge that california is a source state,aroused livermore suspicions that this trip was a trip.
livermore went back to the patrol car and ran thompson criminal history.the criminal history check showed several dated narcotics offenses,and a more recent prior conviction for a firearm offense.when livermore asked thompson still in the car about his criminal history,thompson disclosed only the firearm conviction.
livermore began to write up the citation for the speeding ticket and asked thompson if he could search the vehicle.thompson said that he could not.at this point,livermore consulted with sergeant grange,and they decided to call for a k detection team.
the k unit was contacted at,eleven minutes after the initial stop.the officers were notified at that the k unit was en route.it took the k unit approximately thirty minutes to arrive at the scene.prior to the k search,thompson agreed to accept responsibility for anything that might be discovered in the truck.
when the k unit arrived at the scene,the dog alerted after his first pass by scratching at the back of the pickup truck.the officers then searched the vehicle and opened the locked using a key provided by thompson.when they opened it,they immediately smelled marijuana.beneath a tarp lay five large,plastic tubs containing marijuana.
thompson was arrested and transported to the texas highway patrol district office.officers spoke with investigators regarding the cali connect,who informed them that they should check the back tailgate area,as that is where thompson had been observed to keep narcotics.the troopers searched the area and found six kilograms of cocaine.thompson was charged locally for the marijuana found in the vehicle.he posted bond,was released,and was not informed about the discovery of cocaine.
failure to timely present 
a few weeks later,a drug enforcement administration dea task force executed a series of search warrants on residences believed to be associated with cali connect members,including thompson,in pennsylvania,indiana,and california.the task force members executed a search warrant on thompson home at,on july.
thompson was found in an upstairs bedroom,on the phone.he was taken outside to a patrol car briefly,then returned inside where dea agent strobel read thompson his miranda rights.no separate,written miranda waiver was signed at that time,or later.thompson sat at a table in handcuffs,surrounded by uniformed officers,while the search was conducted.during the search,the officers played wiretap recordings of thompson and others involved in cali connect,obtained while investigating the group.thompson remained there until the search concluded at a.investigators recovered two kilograms of cocaine from the search.
at the conclusion of the search,agents drove thompson to the dea field office in los angeles for processing.due to the distance,traffic,and a for fast food,the drive took approximately an hour and a half.officers did not question thompson during the ride,but did lay the case out for him.app.agent strobel also informed thompson about the value of cooperation.
they arrived at the dea office shortly after,when thompson was processed and placed in a holding room.processing takes approximately twenty minutes,and it is dea policy to process prisoners before taking them to court for their initial appearances.in the early afternoon,agent strobel asked thompson what he wanted to do.app.thompson informed the officer that he wanted to cooperate.at that time,more than six hours had passed since his arrest at approximately 
at this point,agent strobel and another dea agent,christopher balchon,began interviewing thompson.over the course of the afternoon,thompson offered information about his cocaine sources in the area and about his coconspirators.in addition,they had thompson place a series of phone calls in an effort to solicit a reverse on one of the alleged.
agent balchon did not present thompson with a written waiver of his right to prompt presentment until,nearly twelve hours after his arrest.thompson was advised at this point about his right to a speedy appearance,and of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel.thompson signed the form.thompson then requested that the interview cease,and he was taken to metropolitan correctional center to spend the night.
thompson continued to cooperate the next day,but it became clear that thompson would be unable to arrange the,and the effort was abandoned.the agents returned him to metropolitan correctional center and delivered him for presentment the next morning.thompson was presented nearly hours after his initial arrest.
procedural posture 
following the denial of several motions to suppress,thompson pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of,and one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments,in violation of h.as part of the plea,thompson preserved the right to appeal several adverse suppression rulings,including those at issue in this appeal the denial of the motion to suppress evidence seized in the texas traffic stop and the denial of the motion to suppress statements obtained following the execution of search warrants at his home and various other locations.
thompson was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for months and five years of supervised release on the drug conspiracy count a term of imprisonment for months and three years of supervised release on the money laundering count,to run concurrently and a special assessment.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction under to review the district court judgment of conviction.we review a district court order denying a motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review.we review findings of fact for clear error,but we exercise plenary review over legal determinations.united states lewis,cir 
iii.analysis 
reasonable,articulable suspicion to extend the traffic stop 
thompson first contends that the troopers who were involved in the traffic stop lacked articulable suspicion that would justify the extension of their traffic stop to include a k search.
after a traffic stop that was justified at its inception,an officer who develops a reasonable,articulable suspicion of criminal activity may expand the scope of an inquiry beyond the reason for the stop and detain the vehicle and its occupants for further investigation.united states givan,cir.an inchoate hunch does not satisfy the standard of reasonable suspicion rather,the fourth amendment requires that law enforcement have some minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.united states sokolow,quoting ins delgado,internal quotation marks omitted see also united states cortez,an investigatory stop must be justified by some objective manifestation that the person stopped is,or is about to be,engaged in criminal activity.this level of suspicion is less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence and less demanding than that for probable cause.sokolow,at internal citations omitted.
in determining whether there was a basis for reasonable suspicion,a court must consider the totality of the circumstances,in light of the officer experience.givan,at see also united states arvizu,when discussing how reviewing courts should make determinations,we have said repeatedly that they must look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.citing cortez,at.
the supreme court has stressed that the totality of the circumstances standard enables officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.arvizu,at quoting cortez,at internal quotation marks omitted.further,while the individual factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion may be innocent in isolation,together they must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers.united states mathurin,cir quoting karnes skrutski,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,courts are not permitted to analyze factors individually,as innocent factors taken together may appear suspicious to an experienced officer.terry.ohio.
the parties agree that trooper livermore initial justification for the stop was lawful because thompson was driving miles per hour in a miles per hour zone a police officer who observes a violation of state traffic laws may lawfully stop the car committing the violation.united states bonner,cir citing pennsylvania mimms.thus,the only question before us is whether livermore had reasonable articulable suspicion to extend the stop to include a k search.
at the time of the stop,livermore had been involved in approximately traffic stops both as a state trooper and as a member of a local police department.ten of the stops involved felonious amounts of contraband and thirty misdemeanor arrests,all along the corridor thompson was stopped on.livermore was trained to recognize indicators of drug smuggling and other criminal activities at the training academy and on the job.
livermore testified that thompson explanation about the length of his trip and the amount of luggage was suspicious.livermore noted that the amount of luggage appeared to be inconsistent with the stated length of the trip.livermore also observed thompson behavior and physical characteristics as additional indicators of suspicious activity.thompson was visibly nervous,with a shaky voice and a vein on his neck pulsating rapidly.his answers to questions came out hesitatingly,and he neglected to mention his prior involvement with controlled substances or narcotics when questioned by livermore.
based upon livermore testimony and experience,the district court concluded that he possessed a reasonable articulable suspicion in terms of articulating his basis for those suspicions.app.the court determined that,based on the totality of the circumstances,viewing the officer experience and training,that the investigatory stop was appropriate and under the fourth amendment was more than an inchoate hunch.id.at.
thompson,in arguing that the district court erred in finding that livermore had reasonable articulable suspicion,relies upon the supreme court decision in reid georgia.in reid,a dea agent observed reid looking back in the direction of a second man,who possessed a matching shoulder bag.the agent stated that when he approached them,both men appeared to be nervous.the court found that the evidence relied on in this case would describe a very large category of presumably innocent travelers,who would be subject to virtually random seizures were the court to conclude that as little foundation as there was in this case could justify a seizure.reid,at.the supreme court further held that the agent suspicion that reid and his companion were attempting to conceal the fact that they were traveling together was more an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,than a fair inference in the light of his experience,and was simply too slender a reed to support the seizure in this case.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
unlike in reid,thompson behavior,when examined in totality,serves to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers.mathurin,at quoting karnes,f d at internal quotation marks omitted.during livermore stop of thompson,there were many factors that piqued the officer suspicion,not simply nervousness and glances.accordingly,it was reasonable for livermore to infer,based upon his experience as a state trooper and as a member of the local police,that thompson was engaged in illegal activity.
in reviewing the totality of the circumstances,we agree with the district court that livermore had a reasonable,articulable suspicion to believe that thompson was engaged in an illegal activity,and to extend thompson traffic stop to include a k search.we will affirm the district court denial of thompson motion to suppress relating to the traffic stop on june.
b.the mcnabb mallory rule 
thompson next argues that certain statements he made on july,specifically,his confession should be suppressed on the basis that his interrogation violated his right to prompt presentment.
the federal rules of criminal procedure require that a defendant who has been arrested within the united states be brought without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge.a a.in a series of cases,the supreme court gave teeth to this rule by requiring the exclusion of any confessions obtained during an unreasonable period of detention that violated the prompt presentment requirement.see mcnabb united states,mallory united states,see also corley united states,confirming that even voluntary confessions should be suppressed if they occurred during a period of unreasonable delay.the right to speedy presentment not only checks the likelihood of coercive questioning,but also avoids all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.corley,at quoting mcnabb,at.presentment is the point at which the judge is required to take several key steps to foreclose government overreaching informing the defendant of the charges against him,his right to remain silent,his right to counsel,the availability of bail,and any right to a preliminary hearing giving the defendant a chance to consult with counsel a
