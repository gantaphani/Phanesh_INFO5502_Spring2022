on october,a indictment was filed in the united states district court for the district of maine charging dwayne anderson with knowingly and intentionally distributing five or more grams of cocaine base in violation of a and b b.after a jury trial in april,anderson was convicted and sentenced.in this appeal,anderson contests both his conviction and sentence.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
a.the offense 
on july,eric besore besore contacted steven thibodeau thibodeau,a policeman of eight years experience,who,at the time,was working for the task force hida of the drug enforcement administration dea.prior to this contact,besore had agreed to assist thibodeau with investigating drug trafficking by providing thibodeau with information and by making controlled purchases of drugs under thibodeau supervision.in exchange for this assistance,thibodeau assisted besore with having a criminal speeding charge dismissed by the state court.on the morning of july,besore called thibodeau to say that he might be able to purchase drugs that day from an individual nicknamed hoot.
following a brief phone conversation,besore agreed to meet with thibodeau at the dea office in portland,maine to set up a controlled purchase.once besore arrived,thibodeau and other agents proceeded to instruct besore on how they wanted the controlled purchase to take place.they gave besore to purchase the drugs and outfitted him with an electronic transmitting device that looked and sounded like a pager.they told besore they would be monitoring his conversations.finally,thibodeau conducted a search of besore to ensure that besore did not have any drugs or money of his own on his person.besore vehicle was also searched.
once these preliminary steps were completed,besore set out in his car to westbrook,maine to meet hoot.he was accompanied by an entire surveillance team sent to observe the purchase and ensure his safety.two members of this team were thibodeau and barry kelly kelly.kelly was charged with listening to and recording the transmissions coming from besore electronic transmitting device.thibodeau,driving his own car,followed besore.
besore eventually stopped at a parking lot at the corner of king and brown streets in westbrook.to hear the transmissions coming from besore electronic transmitting device,kelly had to be within feet of besore car.he therefore parked his own car a block away.thibodeau,trying to avoid arousing suspicion,moved his car often but kept in contact with besore by cell phone.
shortly after arriving at the parking lot in westbrook,thibodeau and kelly noticed that a uniformed westbrook police officer driving an unmarked cruiser had stopped a car nearby for speeding.fearing the prospective drug seller might be frightened away by the flashing blue lights,thibodeau approached the police officer while other surveillance team members kept watch on besore.at this point,kelly learned,from monitoring the transmissions,that hoot planned to meet besore up the street.accordingly,besore moved his car up the street,and kelly followed.
when thibodeau finished talking with the police officer,he noticed that besore car had moved.however,he heard by radio that besore was headed to pick up his seller.moments later,thibodeau found besore at an intersection.a green subaru occupied by a lone female was parked behind besore kelly was parked behind the subaru.when thibodeau slowly passed besore car,he observed besore in the driver seat and a black male,whom he later identified as anderson,in the passenger seat.thibodeau could not see what took place in the car but when he reversed direction,besore and anderson were still in besore car.
as thibodeau was driving by besore and anderson,kelly remained parked behind the subaru and continued to listen to and record the transmissions received from besore electronic transmitting device.as he did this,kelly also observed besore vehicle.he soon saw anderson exit besore car and enter the subaru parked directly behind besore vehicle.besore then drove away,and kelly ended his surveillance.kelly,however,retained possession of the tape used to record the transmissions from besore electronic transmitting device.at some point subsequent,kelly also made a copy of the tape.
after the controlled purchase was completed,thibodeau headed toward where besore had agreed to meet him.besore made a and followed thibodeau,who kept besore car in sight until the two met a few minutes later.at the meeting place,besore exited his vehicle and gave thibodeau a plastic bag filled with a certain substance.thibodeau then conducted the same search of besore that he had carried out prior to the controlled purchase.no contraband or cash was found on besore.
thibodeau then conducted a field test on the substance in the plastic bag.the field test came back positive for cocaine base and appeared to be in crack form thibodeau put the substance in an evidence envelope marked,which he took to the dea office and locked in the safe.following standard procedure,he then mailed the drugs in a bag with his initials to the dea laboratory in new york to validate the identity of the substance,as well as its weight and purity.brian,a dea forensic chemist,tested the substance given by besore to thibodeau.after testing,confirmed that the substance was cocaine base and determined its net weight to be grams.
b.the trial 
on october,the grand jury returned its indictment against anderson.on april,a trial commenced in the district court.for the purposes of this appeal,there were a number of key flashpoints during the trial.we relate them here in turn.
the transcript 
the day before trial,on april,the government filed a motion in limine requesting that the district court rule on whether the jury would be allowed to view a transcript of the recording containing the transmissions from the electronic transmitting device worn by besore.the recording was a copy made from the original.the government argued that it would be permissible for the transcript to be used as an aid to the jury while the actual tape was being played.the defense argued that the transcription was inaccurate,that it was not notarized,that the date was incorrect,and that there was no indication on the transcript as to who prepared it.
having listened to the tape,the court asked the defense to identify any inaccuracies in the transcript.the defense merely responded that words were missing,the conversation did not flow,and parts of the tape were unintelligible.noting that the defense had not identified specific inaccuracies in the transcript,the court ruled as follows 
we all know that it the tape itself the jury should be directing themselves to in terms of what should guide their deliberations.the transcript is merely an aid.
to the extent that the defense has an alternative transcript,i will provide that to the jury at the same time and inform them that they can use either one,if they wish,for an aid,whichever helps them the best.
based on my review of the tape compared to the transcript,i going to permit the transcript provided by the government to go to the jury.i am going to give them the standard instruction,however,with regard to the use of the transcripts.
at trial,the defense argued that the transcript had not been authenticated.the court said that it assumed that the transcript would be authenticated by whomever prepared it.however,the individual who actually transcribed the tape and made the transcript was the prosecutor,who would not be able to take the stand as he was representing the government at trial.the government therefore took the position that the transcript could be authenticated by having the agent who made the recording,kelly,compare the contents of the tape with the transcript to determine that the transcript accurately reflected the contents of the tape.the defense also argued that since the conversations documented in the transcript were hearsay,the testimony of besore,who actually took part in the conversations,was required to properly authenticate the transcript.however,the defense conceded that it would no longer have any hearsay objections to the transcript if the defendant voice could be identified on the tape.the district court then informed the parties that it would wait to rule on whether the transcript could be properly authenticated until after kelly took the stand.
on direct examination,kelly testified that his primary role was to record any and all conversations relating to the electronic transmitter worn by besore.he testified that he was able to hear what was being transmitted from besore electronic transmitting device at the same time that it was being recorded.kelly also said that he could identify the defendant voice on the tape.finally,kelly testified that he compared the tape to a transcript that the prosecutor office had given him and concluded that the transcript accurately reflected the conversation.
the defense objected,disputing the foundation for kelly ability to recognize the defendant voice on the tape.this objection,however,was overruled,and the transcript was admitted into evidence.
the government then moved to play the tape and give the jury the transcript as an aid in listening.the defense once again objected but was overruled,and the transcript was distributed.the court told the jury 
you are going to be given a transcript of certain tape recordings that are going to be played for you.i want to caution is the transcript is being given to assist you in listening to the tape.the tape,not the transcript,is the evidence in this case,and any difference that you see between the transcript and the tape must be resolved in favor of what you hear on the recording.
let me repeat that so that you clear.the tape recording is the evidence.so if you me just make something,the color brown on the tape,and the transcript says green,the what you hear on the tape that governs and you are to disregard what you see on the transcript if you see it different.obviously,if it the same,it makes no difference.the transcript is merely to assist you,but it the tape recording that governs.i guess i said that three different ways,three different times,so i think it probably pretty clear.
there was no objection to the instruction.the tape was then played for the jury however,it was garbled and not at all clear.after the tape ended,at the court direction,the transcripts were collected.the court did not allow the transcripts to go into the jury room.
at the close of all the evidence,the court provided the following limiting instruction to the jury 
during the course of this trial,you listened to a tape recording and were provided a transcript to assist you.remember,the tape recording,and not the transcript,is the evidence in this case,and any difference between the transcript and the tape must be resolved in favor of what you heard on the recording.
the jury,after deliberating for nearly two hours,sent a note to the court requesting that it be provided with the original tape recording.the jury further requested that the court provide it with a copy of the transcript to help it in listening to the tape.when the court proposed to explain that the original was not available but to exercise its discretion to provide the transcript,the defense objected that the jury would rely too heavily on the transcript.specifically,the defense argued 
our basis,judge,is that at this point in time,where the jury is obviously having some difficulty in listening to the tape because of the quality of the tape,the transcript is really essentially going to be substituted for the tape itself.just reading the transcript,we believe,at this time is going to leave an imprint upon the jurors minds as to exactly what is said,and they are certainly the best arbiter as to what said on that tape,judge.so we would object to the transcript going in because at this point there no difference between the transcript and the tape as being evidence.
the court directed counsel to united states ademaj,cir,in which we held that a jury could be given access to an authenticated transcript subject to a limiting instruction.on the basis of this case,the court concluded that while it would not merely hand over the transcript to the jury,it was within its discretion to permit the jury to have the transcript while they listen to the tape recording that been admitted already into evidence.the court would also provide a limiting instruction.when the defense challenged the authenticity of the transcript,the court replied,i ruled on that that in.after the parties were given time to read ademaj,the defense agreed that the jury be returned to the courtroom to listen to the tape again with the transcript and another limiting instruction.
when the jury returned,the court announced that the original recording was not available but that the parties had agreed that the copy would be played while the jury followed with the transcript.the court reminded the jury that 
the transcript is only being provided to assist you.the tape,and not the transcript,is the evidence in the case,and any difference that you hear between the transcript and the tape is to be resolved in favor of what you hear on the recording,period.
after the tape was played again,the transcripts were collected,and the jury returned to its deliberations.
admission of besore prior conviction 
during the of thibodeau,the defense,on two occasions,asked him about his relationship with besore.on the first occasion,thibodeau testified that he had worked with besore on several occasions,that besore was reliable,and that besore was a trustworthy individual.when thibodeau was asked if he was aware if besore had a criminal record,he answered in the affirmative the following exchange then took place 
defense okay.were you aware that he was convicted of 
prosecutor objection.this is rule information,and it for of the witness,besore.
prosecutor your honor,rule is one of the rules which you use to impeach a witness,but you have to impeach the witness,besore emphasis added.you ca impeach him through a third witness no of this witness,of besore.
defense it is allowed,your honor.pursuant to rule,a witness,thibodeau may testify with give an opinion as to the truthfulness or untruthfulness character of an individual,besore,and then he can give that opinion.and i i allowed to use extrinsic evidence in the form of convictions cross examine that witness thibodeau with respect to that opinion.
prosecutor he thibodeau has given an opinion about the guy besore truthfulness.
defense he just did.
prosecutor he did not.he said he was trustworthy.
the court to him,that all he thibodeau said,that besore was trustworthy.i not going to allow the question under rule and under rule.
second,later in the of thibodeau,thibodeau testified that he could not recall what besore said when they met after the controlled purchase but that besore turned over what he had bought.the defense then asked,a nd you believed that that was true do you believe besore and trust him thibodeau replied,absolutely.although acknowledging the court earlier ruling,the defense once again argued that besore prior conviction should be admitted because we should be able to show that as it relates to this officer thibodeau credibility how credible this person is.the following exchange then ensued 
the court clarifying you want to impeach this witness thibodeau credibility because he believes somebody you say he should be believing 
defense this officer is saying that besore believable.there is extrinsic evidence that we have with respect to convictions that would demonstrate that besore is not believable.
the court all right.go ahead.
prosecutor judge,it improper impeachment of this witness thibodeau,plus the agent has already testified about the basis only thing that changed since the last ruling is this agent described what he observed during the transaction and said,when besore got out of the car and handed him the drugs,he believed that he got these drugs during the transaction.his thibodeau testimony says,i do remember what besore told me.
the court i not going to allow basis.
chain of custody 
prior to the commencement of trial,the the same time the government had made its motion in limine regarding the moved in limine to exclude the drugs thibodeau recovered from besore,on the basis that the government would be unable to establish a clear chain of custody absent besore testimony.the court declined to rule on the defense motion at that time,indicating that it was not yet certain that besore was not going to testify at trial.
at trial,on the redirect examination of thibodeau,the government sought to admit into evidence the drugs that were given to thibodeau by besore.the defense objected,claiming that the government had not established a clear chain of custody.the court overruled this objection and allowed the drugs to be admitted into evidence.
missing witness instruction 
on april,at the start of the trial,the government informed the defense and the court that,despite its attempts to subpoena besore to testify,besore was not present.moreover,besore never appeared during the remainder of the trial.
at the close of all the evidence,in a meeting in chambers,the defense requested that the court give the following missing witness instruction to the jury 
if it is peculiarly within the power of the government to produce a witness who could give material testimony,or if a witness,because of his relationship to the government,would normally be expected to support the government version of the events,the failure to call that witness may justify an inference that his testimony would in this instance be unfavorable to the government.you are not required to draw that inference,but you may do so.no such inference is justified if the witness is equally available to both parties,if the witness would normally not be expected to support the government version of the events,or if the testimony would merely repeat other evidence.
the defense requested this instruction relying in part on united states pérez,cir.the government filed a memorandum of law regarding missing witness instruction in which it set forth its opposition to the charge being given.the government response included a copy of besore subpoena,his grand jury testimony,and the affidavit of nancy evans,a paralegal specialist for the government,describing communication with besore about his duty to appear,besore statement to the government that he feared his testimony would endanger his family,and information about his general inability to keep interview appointments.
using the framework for missing witness instructions set out in pérez and other cases the court ruled as follows 
the witness here appears to be a,what i call,independent contractor,confidential informant.he worked when he wanted to work for the government,and at other times,god knows what he was doing,but he certainly was a government agent,nor was he a government employee,nor was he a government informant working undercover.and that sets a different relationship to the government than a police officer or dea agent who fails to appear.
second,it unclear to me that this fellow was favorably disposed to testify totally on behalf of the government there are probably some issues he testify favorably and some issues he testify not favorably.
and,clearly,the relationship he has with the government does,in my view,make him fully favorably disposed,nor do i find he peculiarly available to the government as to be within their control,exclusive or otherwise.the defendant in this case had the same ability to seek out and subpoena this individual as anybody else they did not there certainly was no requirement that the government even put this individual on even if he was available,making the defendant ability to subpoena him and put him on even more important.
i also note that no subpoena was served by anyone in this case other than the government,and if he was such a key witness,the subpoena certainly would have been served by both sides.i going to deny the request for the missing witness instruction.
sentencing 
at the conclusion of the jury trial,anderson was convicted.on july,the united states probation office completed anderson presentence report psr.the psr identified the drug quantity as grams of crack cocaine,which produced a base offense level of.however,the psr also explained that anderson stood convicted of a drug offense and had previously been convicted of drug offenses,as described in psr and a massachusetts conviction and a massachusetts conviction.this made him a career offender.his total offense level,therefore,became.
anderson was initially assessed six criminal history points,which placed him at a criminal history category chc iii.however,because he was classified as a career offender,his chc was automatically increased to vi.
according to the psr,the statutory term of imprisonment was at least five years and no more than,pursuant to b b.at a total offense level of and chc vi,anderson guideline range was to months in prison.
anderson raised a number of specific objections to the psr.first,he contested the initial assignment of a base offense level of,noting that such an assignment was based on the fact that he had been convicted for possessing crack cocaine.anderson pointed out that he was convicted for possessing not crack cocaine,but cocaine base.second,anderson objected to the conclusion reached by the psr that he qualified as a career offender,on the grounds that the psr and convictions did not qualify.finally,he disputed being placed preliminarily in chc iii as a result of the six criminal history points he was assessed.
a presentence conference took place on december.at this conference,anderson continued to press his objection to the base offense level of,disputing any references to crack cocaine in the psr.he again noted that the substance found at trial was cocaine base,not crack cocaine.then,he argued that since the substance found was cocaine base,and because there is nothing chemically different from,between cocaine base and cocaine powder,he should be sentenced on the basis of grams of cocaine powder,which would produce a base offense level of he also reiterated his objection to the psr conclusion that he be classified as a career offender.
the district court ordered both parties to submit sentencing memoranda indicating objections and the grounds for the objections with supporting case law.these sentencing memoranda,once submitted,focused primarily on two issues.first,the parties discussed whether anderson was indeed a career offender second,they discussed anderson argument relating to the distinctions between crack cocaine,cocaine base,and cocaine powder.
regarding the second issue anderson argued that the government had failed to make any showing that the substance recovered by thibodeau from besore was crack cocaine.he also reiterated his argument that there is no chemical distinction between cocaine base and cocaine powder.relying on united states brisbane,he then pointed out that an ambiguity existed in the governing statute.as a result,he argued that the district court,following the example of the circuit,should apply the rule of lenity and sentence him under the statute governing the applicable amount of cocaine powder,b c.in other words,he argued that rather than face a mandatory minimum under b b,he should face only the default maximum of years under b c.
in response,the government first pointed out that the district court was not bound by the circuit opinion in brisbane.in addition,the government contended that this court opinion in united states,cir opinion on panel rehearing,was more on point and controlling on the issue.
on april,the district court conducted a sentencing hearing.at the outset,the government resolved the issue of whether anderson was a career offender,conceding that he did not have the two predicate offenses required under a and that he should have been placed in chc iii.with respect to the appropriate classification of the drugs recovered from besore following the controlled purchase crack cocaine,cocaine base,or cocaine powder,the court held that the psr correctly concluded that the drugs were crack cocaine.summing up and noting that anderson was accountable for the distribution of grams of cocaine base,crack,that his base offense level was,and that he was placed in chc iii,the court determined that anderson had a guideline range of to months.
the court then sentenced anderson to months of imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a assessment.a timely notice of appeal was filed,objecting to both the conviction and the sentence.
ii.discussion 
a.the transcript issue 
we review the district court decision to allow the use of the transcript for abuse of discretion.united states,cir united states campbell,cir.
the appellant makes two separate arguments about the transcript used by the jury at trial.his first argument is that the individual who prepared the transcript did not take the stand to authenticate it.in this case,the individual who actually transcribed the tape and made the transcript was the prosecutor,who was not able to take the stand as he was representing the government at trial.the government therefore took the position that the transcript could be authenticated by having the agent who made the recording,kelly,compare the contents of the tape with the transcript to determine that the transcript accurately reflected the contents of the tape.this was deemed sufficient by the district court to authenticate the transcript.the appellant,however,contends this decision was erroneous.
we,however,discern no problem with kelly authenticating the transcript.in united states carbone,cir,we wrote that when transcripts are offered for use,either as evidence or a jury aid,they should be authenticated in the same manner as tape recordings that are offered in evidence,by testimony as to how they were prepared,the sources used,and the qualifications of the person who prepared them.id.at.in this case,the government could not provide this testimony because the individual who could best offer such information was prohibited from providing it.that,however,did not mean that the transcript could not be authenticated.in other cases,we have approved the use of transcripts that were authenticated by individuals other than the transcribers.for example,in ademaj,at,we approved the authentication of transcripts where the transcripts were authenticated by an individual other than the transcriber.in that case,a cooperating witness listened to the tapes of conversations in greek and orally translated them into english.a dea agent then reduced the cooperating witness oral translations to writing.at trial,a interpreter testified that she had reviewed and compared these conversations with the transcripts prepared by the cooperating witness and the dea agent and found the transcripts to be accurate.
the instant case presents a similar situation.the interpreter in the transcript to the tape recording and testified that the transcript fairly and accurately represented the conversation on the tape.in fact,we think that kelly was in an even better position than the interpreter in ademaj to authenticate the transcript,as he himself had listened to the conversation between anderson and besore while monitoring the controlled purchase.
we also wish to point out that if the appellant was so concerned about the authenticity of the government transcript,he could have submitted his own.the district court specifically invited anderson to submit his own transcript.anderson,however,failed to do so.in a number of cases,we have rejected a party claim about the admissibility of a transcript when the district court had invited the party to submit a transcript of its own,and the party declined to take up this invitation.see,ademaj,at united states pion,cir.this case is no different.
anderson second argument relating to the transcript is that because of the poor quality of the tape,the was to serve merely as an aid in interpreting the real evidence,the the actual evidence that the jury relied upon in handing down its conviction.we encountered a nearly identical argument in united states deleón,cir.however,as in that case,we reject the appellant claim.
first,we note that the district court reminded the jury at least three separate times that the tape,not the transcript,constituted the evidence in this case and that any discrepancies between the two were to be resolved in favor of the tape.in deleón,we found such a limiting instruction to be an important factor in rejecting the appellant argument.in this case,we think that such an given the fact that it had been repeated several times by the district that the jury did not rely on the transcript to convict the appellant.
in united states robinson,cir,the sixth circuit provided relief to an appellant making an argument similar to the one made here by anderson.in that case,the district court had likewise provided a limiting instruction,telling the jury to only consider the tape,not the transcript,as evidence.the sixth circuit,however,held the following 
this court is keenly aware that there is a distinct difference between evidence and an aid used to assist the jury in understanding the evidence.however,the distinction becomes nebulous where,as here,the evidence is unintelligible.the practical effect of using an aid to comprehend unintelligible matter is that the aid becomes the evidence while the district court provided an adequate limiting instruction,its directives are only viable when the tape is clear enough for a juror to detect that the tape is at variance with the transcript.but where,as here,the tapes are partially inaudible,the juror is precluded from making an intelligent comparison.hence,the likely result is that the transcript becomes the evidence.
id.at.we,however,believe that this case is different from robinson in one key respect.in robinson,the prosecution submitted recordings that were in many portions so greatly inaudible as to render any attempt at transcription speculative.nevertheless,the prosecution provided the jury with what it purported to be transcripts of the recorded conversations.in this case,however,the government never attempted to interpret portions of the tape that were unintelligible.rather,the transcript specifically noted those portions of the tape that were unclear.thus,the jury in this case was not able to turn to the transcripts to comprehend the unintelligible portions of the conversation,as the transcript likewise provided no assistance.accordingly,we find robinson to be inapposite here.
second,even if there was error in the use of the transcript,we believe that it was harmless.see united states andiarena,cir.the tape and the accompanying transcript constituted only a small part of the government case.there was other,overwhelming circumstantial evidence that anderson had engaged in the drug transaction in question.thibodeau and kelly,two members of the surveillance team that observed the transaction,testified in detail about the following the constant electronic monitoring of besore conversations the constant visual surveillance of besore car by team members and the thorough searches of both besore and his vehicle before and after the controlled purchase.thus,even without the tape and the transcript,there was strong circumstantial evidence of guilt.
admission of besore prior conviction 
the appellant next argument is that the district court erred by not allowing him to introduce evidence of besore felony conviction.a challenge to a limitation on the scope of is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states kaplan,cir.
for a number of reasons,we reject anderson argument.before we discuss our reasoning,we wish to point out that the parties,in their briefs,disagree about exactly whose credibility would be attacked if the appellant were permitted to introduce evidence of besore felony or thibodeau.because the appellant claim fails in either case,we address both scenarios.
we begin with the scenario in which it is besore credibility that is being attacked.reads as follows 
a opinion and reputation evidence of character.the credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation,but subject to these limitations the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness,and evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.
b specific instances of conduct.specific instances of the conduct of a witness,for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness character for truthfulness,other than conviction of a crime as provided in rule,may not be provided by extrinsic evidence.they may,however,in the discretion of the court,if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness,be inquired into on of the witness concerning the witness character for truthfulness or untruthfulness,or concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being has testified.
as support for his position that the prior conviction evidence should have been permitted,the appellant cites to.b,the provision that states that extrinsic evidence,such as evidence of a prior conviction,may be inquired into on concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being has testified.see.b.the appellant argues that because thibodeau testified about besore trustworthiness,the appellant should have been allowed to present thibodeau with evidence of besore prior conviction,a conviction that is probative of besore character for untruthfulness.
anderson argument,however,contains a fundamental,the fact that besore can not be considered a witness.as the government correctly points out,besore never testified.rule b makes clear that evidence of a prior conviction may be inquired into on concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being has testified emphasis added.here,however,besore was not a witness,so proof of his prior conviction is not permitted.
the appellant counters that since thibodeau was allowed to discuss besore and his positive interactions with besore under rule a,it is only fair that he the appellant be allowed to rebut that testimony and provide proof of besore prior conviction.this argument fails.rule a,like rule b,states that the credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported in discussing his view that besore was trustworthy,thibodeau was not attacking or supporting the credibility of a witness,because,as discussed above,besore did not testify.
rule b forecloses the appellant from arguing that it was really thibodeau,the witness,whose credibility was being attacked,and that he could get into evidence besore felony conviction through the back door when the front door was barred.rule b refers to specific instances of the conduct of a witness as appropriate for inquiry through.as discussed above,besore was not a witness.therefore,the district court was correct in finding that specific instances of his conduct were not admissible during thibodeau.
chain of custody 
anderson third argument is that there is a gap in the chain of custody for the drugs that the government sought to admit into evidence.anderson notes that although thibodeau testified that he received the drugs from besore,besore did not take the stand to testify that he in fact received the drugs from anderson.thus,it was possible,suggests anderson,that besore hid drugs on his person or in his vehicle in an effort to frame anderson.he argues that without besore testimony,there was no way for the district court to determine that besore had not exchanged,tampered with,or contaminated the evidence since the meeting with anderson in besore car.to anderson,then,besore represents a gap in the government chain of custody.in light of this gap,anderson contends that the district court erred in admitting the drugs.
we review the district court chain of custody determination for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir.in united states abreu,cir,we set forth the standards to be applied by the district court in such cases 
in determining whether the evidence is admissible,the trial court must conclude that it was reasonably probable that the evidence had not been altered since the occurrence of the crime.the evidence in question is properly admitted if it is readily identifiable by a unique feature or other identifying mark.on the other hand,if the offered evidence is of the type that is not readily identifiable or is susceptible to alteration,a testimonial tracing of the chain of custody is necessary.the purpose of testimonial tracing is to render it improbable that the original item either has been exchanged with another or has been tampered with or contaminated.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we also noted that e ven though there may be gaps in the chain of custody for a certain piece of evidence,such gaps factor into the weight given to the evidence rather than its admissibility.id.
in this case,because the drugs that the government sought to admit were not readily identifiable in any way,a testimonial tracing of the chain of custody was required.at trial,the government endeavored to provide the necessary tracing.thibodeau testified that after the controlled purchase,he met besore at a spot,where besore gave him the drugs he had purchased from anderson.thibodeau then conducted a field test that proved positive for cocaine.thibodeau then put the drugs in an evidence envelope,marked it with an identifying number that he recited at trial,took the envelope to the dea office,and locked it in the safe.thereafter,following standard procedure,he mailed the drugs in a bag that contained his initials to the dea laboratory in new york.at that point,the forensic chemist who analyzed the drugs,forged the next custody link.he identified the bag by his initials,by the date he received it,and by the date he sealed it again.also established that until the bag was returned to maine for the trial,it remained in the custody of the dea laboratory in new york.
anderson contests the strength of the first link in this,he argues that there is no proof that the drugs besore gave to thibodeau were the same ones besore had purchased minutes earlier from anderson.however,we think that the district court was correct in finding that the chain of custody provided by the government was sufficient for admitting the drugs into evidence.we have held that the prosecution evidence must be infallible.united states ladd,cir.in this case,there was sufficient evidence for the district court to find that the drugs the government sought to admit were indeed the ones that anderson had given to besore.both besore and his vehicle were searched extensively prior to the controlled purchase.moreover,after the controlled purchase was completed and besore left to meet thibodeau at the meeting place,besore remained in thibodeau sight during the drive.thus,there was no way that besore could possibly have contaminated or exchanged the evidence.thibodeau testimony was sufficient to establish that the drugs were what the government claimed them to be.see.a noting that for authentication purposes,sufficient evidence is required to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.moreover,as the appellant himself points out,even if information about the origin of the drugs provided to thibodeau did represent a gap in the chain of custody,such a gap factored into the weight given to the evidence rather than its admissibility.see abreu,at.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the drugs into evidence.
missing witness instruction 
anderson fourth argument is that the district court erred in refusing to issue to the jury the missing witness instruction he desired.we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see pérez,at united states deluca,cir.
in pérez,we set forth the requirements for a missing witness instruction 
a s a preliminary requirement to the consideration of a missing witness instruction,a criminal defendant must demonstrate that the uncalled witness is either favorably disposed to testify on behalf of the government by virtue of status or relationship or peculiarly available to the government.united states deluca,cir.once past that point,the court must consider the explanation if any for the witness absence and whether the witness,if called,would be likely to provide relevant,testimony.united states lewis,cir.
pérez,at.in this case,anderson failed to satisfy his threshold burden.he did not show that besore was favorably disposed or peculiarly available to the government.with regard to demonstrating that besore was favorably disposed to testify on behalf of the government,the district court noted that besore was not a government agent who was in the government employ.instead,he was a private citizen,who,in the court view,was an independent contractor.although besore had cooperated in exchange for thibodeau recommendation that besore criminal speeding charges be dismissed,we have made clear that the mere fact of cooperation does not make a witness favorably disposed to the government.see deluca,at.here,moreover,it was far from clear to the court that besore was favorably disposed to testify totally on behalf of the government.instead,as the court explained,there are probably some issues on which he testify favorably and some issues on which he testify not favorably.thus,the district court was justified in finding that besore was not favorably disposed to the government.
nor did anderson demonstrate that besore was peculiarly available to the government.the government explained in detail its efforts to secure besore presence at trial and how it had failed.see united states,cir.not only had the government served besore with a subpoena to appear,but the government paralegal specialist had reminded him of that obligation.the paralegal specialist affidavit described her communications with besore and his reply that he feared his testimony would endanger his family.notwithstanding these contacts,by the time of trial,it appeared the government did not even know where besore could be found.that the government could not get besore to appear,despite such efforts,demonstrates conclusively that he was not available to the government,much less peculiarly available.
moreover,anderson had the same ability as the government to seek a subpoena to require besore appearance at trial.anderson clearly knew besore might be a witness and indeed had reason to believe he might be important to his defense.as the defense conceded,however,it never tried to subpoena besore.neither did anderson seek a continuance to press his search for besore.see id.at.instead,he simply requested the missing witness instruction.see id.pointing out that absent some effort to secure witness appearance,request for missing witness instruction indicates that defense counsel is more interested in exploiting the witness absence than seeing him produced quoting united states díaz,cir.the fact that anderson was able to subpoena besore yet failed to do so gives us additional reason to believe that the district court was correct in finding that besore was not peculiarly available to the government.
with anderson failure to satisfy his threshold burden for the issuance of the missing witness instruction,it is irrelevant whether besore would have provided relevant,information.anderson goes on at length about how besore,had he testified,would have provided important information about the conversation that he had with anderson during the controlled purchase,about whether the drug evidence had been contaminated or exchanged,and about any motive that he had to frame anderson.that besore could have provided such information,however,does not matter,since anderson was unable to show during the preliminary inquiry that besore was favorably disposed or peculiarly available to the government.
anderson likewise ignores the importance of this threshold inquiry in his attempt to distinguish case in which we upheld the district court decision to deny a defendant request for a missing witness instruction.in pérez,a confidential government informant who took part in a drug deal with the defendant did not testify at the defendant trial.to anderson,our decision to affirm the district court denial of the missing witness instruction in that case was based on the fact that the government possessed a qualified privilege to withhold the identity of confidential informants.anderson argues that this case is different,as the government disclosed the identity of besore prior to trial.he contends that the government possesses no qualified privilege in this case,and the rationale undergirding the pérez decision is inapplicable here.
anderson reasoning,however,is flawed.although we did note in pérez that the government possessed a qualified privilege with respect to disclosing the identity of its confidential informants,it was not the government interest in confidentiality that led us to uphold the district court denial of the missing witness instruction.rather,it was the fact that the defendant in pérez had made no attempt to force the government to disclose the confidential informant identity prior to trial,despite being able to do so.we wrote that i nstead he waited until both sides had rested and then,despite having made no effort to obtain the informant identity in the usual manner,implored the court to instruct the jurors that they could draw an adverse inference from the government failure to offer the confidential informant testimony.pérez,at.
thus,rather than presenting a set of facts different from this case,pérez is actually quite similar.that the defendant in pérez could have taken steps to obtain the informant identity yet chose not to do so meant that he did not satisfy his burden in demonstrating that the missing witness was peculiarly available to the government.the same is true in this case.as we have discussed,anderson could have issued a subpoena to besore but elected not to do so.the result of such inaction on anderson part is that he failed to satisfy his burden in demonstrating that besore was peculiarly available to the government.as the government correctly points out,then,the critical issue here is not whether the government possesses a qualified privilege as to its confidential informants,but instead whether the witness is favorably disposed or peculiarly available to the government.because anderson failed to satisfy his burden as to this threshold showing,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the missing witness instruction.
sentencing 
anderson next contests two aspects of his sentencing.first,he argues that the district court erred in computing his sentence under the guidelines.the district court found that anderson was responsible for the distribution of grams of crack cocaine.accordingly,the court,taking into account that anderson was placed in chc iii,found that anderson guidelines range was months.anderson,however,claims that the district court erred in its finding that he had distributed crack cocaine.he contends that the trial had only established that he was responsible for distributing cocaine base,not crack cocaine in particular.this distinction is important because we have noted that f orms of cocaine base other than crack are treated as cocaine hydrochloride cocaine powder for purposes of calculating the gsr guidelines sentencing range.united states robinson,cir citing.c,amend.anderson therefore states that his base offense level should have been calculated based on grams of cocaine hydrochloride cocaine powder.the guidelines establish a base offense level of for a quantity involving less than grams of cocaine hydrochloride cocaine powder.see c.at a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iii,anderson contends that his gsr should have been months.
we have held that w hether a particular substance is crack or cocaine for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is a question of fact to be determined by the court.robinson,at.the sentencing court must be accepted unless it is clearly erroneous.see united states cyr,cir.when the nature of an illicit substance is material at sentencing,the government has the burden to prove the substance identity by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states legarda,cir.
we believe that the government has satisfied its burden.at trial,thibodeau testified that minutes after the conclusion of the controlled purchase,besore turned over to him the substance he had bought from anderson.without objection,thibodeau identified the substance as rock cocaine or crack cocaine in what we call plastic bags and explained that the bags were cut and twisted to keep the rock clean.see robinson,at noting that crack is the street name for a form of cocaine base,usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate,and usually appearing in a lumpy,rocklike form quoting c d.twice more in his testimony,thibodeau referred to the drug besore gave him as the rock form of cocaine base.
similarly,the government expert,the dea chemist brian,testified that he had received from maine small bags each of which contained a,substance,and that the net weight was grams.describing the procedure he followed,explained that he ground the rocks into powder so that they could be evaluated through three separate tests.based on his professional experience and the test results,without objection,identified the drugs as cocaine base.confirmed that when the drugs arrived they were in the rock form that is characteristic of crack cocaine.see id.
anderson challenges this testimony in two ways.first,he claims that thibodeau lacked the training and experience needed to identify the drug as crack cocaine.he points out that thibodeau testified that he had been working as a hida agent for only months.although this is true,thibodeau had also worked as a policeman for eight years.both in his work as a police officer and as a hida agent,he had participated in hundreds of controlled purchases.see id.noting that we often have permitted law enforcement officers,not formally trained as experts,to furnish opinions based on their experience.moreover,we note that at trial,anderson never disputed thibodeau qualifications in making a visual identification of the drug or in performing the field test that proved positive for crack cocaine.see united states díaz,cir noting that litigants must raise a timely objection to preserve a challenge on appeal.
to drive home his point that thibodeau lacked the experience needed to identify the drugs as crack cocaine,anderson points out how thibodeau seemed to confuse the terms crack cocaine and cocaine base and use them interchangeably in his testimony as though there was no difference between the two.for example,anderson points to the following exchange 
q okay.on your conversation with besore,what kind of drugs did you think you might be buying that day 
thibodeau crack cocaine.
q all right.cocaine base 
thibodeau correct.
we,however,see no confusion on thibodeau part in this exchange.rather,we think that he is demonstrating his knowledge of cocaine base and its different forms,since,as we noted above,crack cocaine is a kind of cocaine base.
anderson second challenge is based on the fact that the government did not elicit any testimony from pertaining to the different forms of cocaine base or whether the cocaine base he tested was the type of cocaine base referred to as crack.this argument,however,is unavailing,because even though did not explicitly identify the drugs he tested as crack cocaine,mentioned several times during his testimony that he had tested the rock form of cocaine base.as we noted in robinson,cocaine base in a rock form is usually considered to be crack cocaine.see robinson,at.
moreover,we have encountered a nearly identical argument in previous cases.see,united states ferreras,cir united states martínez,cir robinson,at.for example,in ferreras,the defendant argued that the government had failed to prove that the cocaine base in his possession was in fact crack cocaine.in response,we wrote 
o nce the government laid a proper foundation by introducing a chemical analysis proving that,chemically,the contraband was cocaine base,no further scientific evidence was needed.instead,the government could bridge the evidentiary gap between cocaine base and crack cocaine by presenting lay opinion evidence or an opinion proffered by an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic credentials from a reliable witness who possesses specialized knowledge gained by experience in dealing with crack or familiarity with its appearance and texture.
at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in this case,the government followed this framework to the letter.as we discussed above,the government,through,introduced chemical test results demonstrating that the drugs recovered from besore were indeed cocaine base.this,combined with thibodeau testimony,was sufficient for the district court to find that anderson had distributed crack cocaine.therefore,we hold that the district court did not err in finding that anderson was responsible for the distribution of grams of crack cocaine and computing his sentence accordingly under the guidelines.
anderson second argument regarding his sentence is that the district court violated his constitutional rights in determining that a mandatory minimum sentence applied to him pursuant to b b iii.the constitutionality of a sentence is a question of law subject to de novo review.see mistretta united states,d.
anderson entire argument is based on a may case decided by the circuit,united states brisbane.brisbane related to the proper manner of interpreting the sentencing scheme in b a,b,and c.that scheme is considered to establish two tiers of penalties for offenses involving cocaine,with higher penalties for crack cocaine and other forms of cocaine base and lesser penalties for cocaine powder.see b a,b,and c see also united states richardson,cir robinson,at.
for example,b b iii provides for a mandatory minimum sentence for an offense involving grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base.b b iii.section b b ii ii,by contrast,provides for a mandatory minimum sentence for offenses involving grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine,its salts,optical and geometric isomers,and salts of isomers.b b ii ii.importantly,no mandatory minimum sentence applies to an amount of cocaine base that is less than grams or an amount of cocaine that is less than grams.see b c.
in brisbane,the circuit ruled that such a sentencing scheme was ambiguous.see at.anderson notes that the ambiguity lies in the fact that references to cocaine base and cocaine in b involve the same substance.he leads us to this conclusion by pointing out that cocaine in its naturally occurring form is a base.therefore,the phrase cocaine base,in scientific terms,is redundant.in other words,to a scientist,cocaine and cocaine base are synonymous they both refer to a substance with the same chemical formula.
according to anderson,to understand the statutory terms in this way creates an ambiguity in the statute.for example,if one is to read the mention of cocaine in b b ii ii as referring to cocaine base,then the statute would be read in such a way that a mandatory minimum sentence applies for an offense involving grams or more of cocaine base.this,however,is contrary to the scheme set forth in b b iii,which states that a mandatory minimum sentence applies for an offense involving five grams or more of cocaine base.see united states isler,cir.
as a result of such an ambiguity,the circuit in brisbane decided to apply the rule of lenity and ordered the lower court to sentence the defendant in that case under the more forgiving penalty provisions relating to cocaine powder discussed in b b ii ii and b c and not cocaine base discussed in b b iii.in this case,anderson urges us to follow the lead of the circuit and find an ambiguity in the statute.he asks us to likewise apply the rule of lenity and sentence him on the basis of an offense involving cocaine powder.if we were to follow such an approach,no mandatory minimum sentence would apply to anderson,since the statute states that no mandatory minimum applies for an amount of cocaine powder that is less than grams.anderson would only face the default maximum of years under b c.
we,however,decline anderson invitation.in isler,at,we were presented with the opportunity to adopt the position that the circuit articulated in brisbane.we elected not to do so,noting that brisbane was a case from another circuit that concedes it is expressing a minority vi
