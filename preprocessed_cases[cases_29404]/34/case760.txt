babilonia conviction arises out of a murder plot that targeted babilonia abusive boyfriend matthew allen.babilonia had told others,including roger key,about the abuse she suffered,and key hired an associate,jiya canady,to kill allen.babilonia provided key with a photo of allen before the attempted murder.on november,canady drove the shooter,jose capriata,to a location in brooklyn where they had been told allen was staying,and capriata shot a man who turned out to be an innocent bystander.
on february,babilonia pled guilty to a superseding information charging a federal stalking conspiracy in violation of and.pursuant to her plea agreement,the government agreed to dismiss open charges for conspiracy and attempted against her.the parties stipulated to a sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the agreement further noted that neither party would seek a departure,upward or downward,from the stipulated range.
after the conclusion of key trial,the district court advised the parties of its intention to consider an upward departure from babilonia guidelines range and requested that the government highlight evidence presented at key trial relating to babilonia participation in the allen plot.the government provided testimony from canady,a cooperating witness telephone records and cellsite location maps for babilonia,key,and canady cell phones and the photograph of allen that babilonia had texted to key.on september,the district court imposed the maximum statutory sentence of months.
we review the reasonableness of a sentence and the procedure followed at sentencing for abuse of discretion.united states cavera,cir.en banc.a sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the sentencing guidelines range,treats the sentencing guidelines as mandatory,fails to consider the section a factors,selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.united states aldeen,cir.quoting united states chu,cir.we vacate sentences for substantive unreasonableness only in exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,that is,when sentences are so shockingly high,shockingly low,or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law that allowing them to stand would damage the administration of justice.aldeen,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
babilonia sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.the district court provided the parties with advance notice that it was considering an upward departure under policy statement,which provides that the district court may depart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement and that did not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range.during the sentencing proceeding,the district court explained why it had decided to upwardly depart babilonia had played a significant role in the plan to stalk and murder matthew allen.babilonia app.the district court explanation was sufficient.see united states campbell,cir.f or departures,the district courts need not make talismanic reference to the intermediate guidelines levels,so long as there is careful explanation in the record of the reasons for the extent of the departure.
nor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying babilonia request for a fatico hearing.the district court is not required,by either the due process clause or the federal sentencing guidelines,to hold a evidentiary hearing in resolving sentencing disputes.all that is required is that the court afford the defendant some opportunity to rebut the government allegations.united states slevin,cir.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
babilonia made her request for a fatico hearing after the district court announced that it intended to impose a statutory maximum sentence.the district court gave notice of its intent to consider such a sentence,however,months before the sentencing proceeding.during the sentencing proceeding,the district court gave babilonia ample opportunity to contest the accuracy of facts that the district court was considering in its determination,and babilonia voiced her objections to the inferences that the district court drew from those facts.although the district court concluded,after its discussion of those facts and inferences,that babilonia played a significant role in the plan to stalk and murder matthew allen,babilonia app,that determination did not involve a new issue on which babilonia had not been heard.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion or violate babilonia due process rights by declining to hold a fatico hearing.
finally,babilonia sentence was not substantively unreasonable.if the ultimate sentence is reasonable and the sentencing judge did not commit procedural error in imposing that sentence,we will not second guess the weight or lack thereof that the judge accorded to a given factor or to a specific argument made pursuant to that factor.united states fernandez,cir,abrogated on other grounds by rita united states.
the district court considered the duress that babilonia was under in light of the abuse she suffered,set forth in the mitigation report,personal statement,and letters she submitted to the court.considering that evidence in light of all of the section a factors,however,the district court determined that the mitigating effect of the abuse was outweighed by babilonia involvement in the plan to kill allen,which included texting a photograph of allen to key before the attempted murder.the fact that the district court did not balance the sentencing factors in the way babilonia desired does not render the sentence unreasonable.
factual basis for plea 
davis argues that his guilty plea to aiding and abetting a section c offense lacked a sufficient factual basis.on october,davis pleaded guilty to count one conspiracy to distribute narcotics and count two using,carrying,and possessing firearms,and aiding and abetting the same,in connection with the narcotics conspiracy of the second superseding indictment.during the plea hearing,davis described in his own words his conduct related to the two charged crimes.to that end,the district court posed a series of questions to davis,the government,and davis counsel.at one point in the colloquy,the district court offered to adjourn the hearing and resume in the morning after davis had been able to confer further with his counsel davis,through his attorney,declined the offer.the government then proffered what it planned to prove at trial for both counts.davis raised no objection to the government recitation and subsequently pled guilty to both counts.the district court confirmed that davis was entering his plea knowingly and voluntarily and,finding that there was a factual basis for the plea,accepted davis plea.
