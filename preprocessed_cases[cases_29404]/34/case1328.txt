opinion of the court 
this appeal by gary johnson from the denial of his petition for habeas corpus by the district court of the eastern district of pennsylvania requires us to decide an issue of first impression in this circuit do the teachings of bruton united states,d,apply to a bench trial in a criminal proceeding bruton and its progeny established that in a joint criminal trial before a jury,a defendant sixth amendment right of confrontation is violated by admitting a confession of a codefendant that implicates the defendant,regardless of any limiting instruction given to the jury.see richardson marsh,d cruz new york,d.we hold that the bruton rule is inapplicable to the incriminating confession of a codefendant in a joint bench trial.by its own terms,bruton applies to jury trials only.in so deciding we agree with every united states court of appeals that has considered the question because of this threshold determination,we easily dispose of johnson claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,d 
our review is limited to those issues approved by this court in issuing a certificate of appealability whether johnson was denied the right to effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel where trial counsel failed to litigate a motion for severance under bruton and appellate counsel failed to raise the severance issue on appeal whether johnson was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel where trial counsel failed to move the trial judge to recuse himself and whether the superior court determination of these issues was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,united states supreme court precedent.
the merits of this habeas appeal are further circumscribed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.when,as here,the legal claims of a petitioner in custody pursuant to a state court judgment have been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,under d the only question that matters is whether the adjudication of the claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.lockyer andrade,d d.
because this appeal raises only questions of law,we set forth a brief description of the facts in the margin appellant gary johnson and shawn davis were found guilty of second degree murder and criminal conspiracy after a bench trial in the common pleas court of philadelphia.each gave conflicting statements to the police implicating the other.davis sought to suppress his statement but the state trial judge,judge latrone,denied his motion.at the behest of johnson defense counsel,judge latrone did,however,order that the statement be redacted prior to presentation to the court by substituting an x in place of johnson name.
at the joint trial of both johnson and davis,also held before judge latrone,the statement was only admitted against davis,not johnson.the trial judge found johnson guilty of murder in the second degree and of conspiracy.at trial,johnson was represented by bernard turner.after attorney turner withdrew his appearance,attorney louis savino entered his appearance and filed motions.these motions were denied and johnson was sentenced on february,to life imprisonment for murder in the second degree and a concurrent term of one to two years for criminal conspiracy.
following johnson conviction,judge latrone wrote an extensive opinion in which he addressed the bruton issue raised by johnson in motions,stating the primary reasoning behind the bruton court decision was that there was a tremendous risk due to the practical and human limitations of a jury that it would or could not follow instructions to disregard the prejudicial statements of a codefedant at a joint trial.commonwealth johnson.term,slip op.at,wl,latrone,trial.op.judge latrone explained that the teachings of bruton could not be applied to johnson case because this court presided over a trial without a jury and that the risks inherent in the jury system of which the bruton court was so concerned would seemingly not exist when a judge is sitting as a trier of fact.id.at.
on appeal,the superior court of pennsylvania in a memorandum disposition adopted the trial court opinion in its entirety and affirm ed on the basis of the opinion of the trial court.commonwealth johnson,slip op.at.august,commonwealth johnson.similarly,on a subsequent appeal from the common pleas court denying johnson petition for relief,the superior court in a memorandum disposition adopted in full several pages of the judge opinion explaining that the teachings of bruton could not apply because the stated rationale of the united states supreme court limited its application only to jury trials in criminal cases.commonwealth johnson,slip op.at.april,commonwealth johnson.
the bruton rule is inapplicable to the incriminating confession of a codefendant in a joint bench trial because bruton applies solely to jury trials.in so deciding,we join the myriad courts of appeals that have recognized that the rule and rationale of bruton do not apply to bench trials see,castro,at a jury may have difficulty in disregarding extrajudicial statements implicating a defendant.we will not presume that a judge suffers from the same disability.indeed,the presumption is to the contrary.cardenas,at nothing in bruton,or in later supreme court cases discussing bruton,suggests that in a bench trial a judge is incapable of disregarding inadmissible extrajudicial statements implicating a defendant.rogers,at to apply bruton to bench trials would be to conclude that judges,like jurors,may well be incapable of separating evidence properly admitted against one defendant from evidence admitted against another.faulisi,at bruton is simply inapplicable in the case of a bench trial.cockrell,at the bruton rule does not apply to petitioner because she was tried by the court and not by a jury.nothing in bruton suggests that a judge is incapable of applying the law of limited admissibility which he has himself announced.see also charles wright kenneth graham,federal practice procedure,at ed.supp b ecause bruton seeks to protect the defendant against the inability of the jury to understand or abide by limiting instructions,the bruton doctrine does not apply in cases tried to the court.
we also join the cardenas and rogers courts in rejecting the notion that lee illinois,d,expanded the bruton doctrine to encompass bench trials.lee dealt with whether a state trial judge reliance upon a codefendant incriminating confession in a bench trial violates the right to confrontation,not,as in bruton,whether the mere admission of such a confession is a violation.id.at.the court accordingly observed that lee was not strictly speaking a bruton case.id.at.bruton,the court explained,was based on the fact that a confession that incriminates an accomplice is so devastating that the ordinarily sound assumption that a jury will be able to follow faithfully its instructions could not be applied.id.in contrast,in lee the question was not whether the judge had been able to disregard the evidence,but whether the judge actual use of the incriminating confession was permissible the court concluded that it was not.
the holding of lee is thus distinguishable from,and does not expand the reach of,bruton.a bsent an express reliance by a trial judge on a defendant facially implicates a determining that guilt,we do not see how a sixth amendment confrontation issue can arise in a bench trial.no such express reliance exists in the instant case.cardenas,at.see also rogers,at lee simply did not make bruton applicable to bench trials.
because bruton does not apply to a bench trial,johnson can not have been deprived of any constitutional right based on bruton.accordingly,trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to make a pretrial motion for severance after the redacted statement of johnson codefendant was admitted into evidence,and the pennsylvania superior court adjudication of this issue was not contrary to,or an unreasonable determination of,supreme court precedent.
