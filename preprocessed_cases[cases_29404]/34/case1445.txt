following a jury trial,clayton thomas was convicted of the shooting death of harry james,the owner of a speakeasy in philadelphia.he was also convicted of crimes related to the wounding of peter fuller,a patron of the speakeasy.thomas alleges that his identification by fuller was tainted by an unconstitutionally suggestive photo array and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress or otherwise object to fuller identification at trial.after finding defense counsel performance deficient,the district court issued a writ of habeas corpus directing the commonwealth to retry or release thomas.because we agree with the district court that counsel error in failing to move to suppress or object to the identification at trial fatally undermined the reliability of the verdict,we will affirm.
the facts underlying this appeal were succinctly summarized by the pennsylvania superior court in rejecting thomas appeal in his state proceedings 
the charges stemmed from the robbery of a speakeasy located in the city of philadelphia.accompanied by a person who acted as lookout,thomas entered the speakeasy brandishing a firearm and ordered the occupants to the floor.the proprietor of the establishment,harry james,had been playing chess with a customer,peter fuller.james was fetching a beer for another customer when thomas arrived.instead of complying with thomas order,james leaped at thomas and began to struggle with him.during the course of this altercation,thomas shot james in the chest.the victim subsequently died of his wound.thomas also shot fuller in the shoulder.fuller survived.
after the robbery and shooting,the police talked with at least two eyewitnesses,christopher young and fuller.young,an acquaintance of thomas,originally failed to identify thomas as one of the assailants,but,after making several inconsistent statements about the incident,did identify thomas.he later testified that he was threatened by the police,and that he feared being arrested if he did not name someone.he also had several criminal charges pending against him when he testified on behalf of the commonwealth at thomas trial.
fuller,the surviving shooting victim,described his assailant as a black male,and was shown some pictures of black males arrested for robbery,but made no identification at that time weeks later,he was shown about more photos,but still could not identify anyone.at that time,the detective allegedly pulled two pictures from the group and asked fuller to take a real good look at them,and fuller made a tentative identification at the pretrial hearing and at trial,fuller testified that he would not have made the identification if the detective had not strongly suggested that the two pictures highlighted were of the perpetrators.fuller could not make an identification at the hearing.because no identification was made,counsel for thomas withdrew his suppression motion as to identification,as there was no identification to be suppressed.however,at trial,fuller made a spontaneous identification of thomas,and counsel failed to object or move to suppress the identification.at trial,the testimony of young and fuller identification were the only evidence connecting thomas to the crime.
thomas was convicted by a jury of murder,robbery,aggravated assault,and possession of an instrument of crime,and was sentenced to imprisonment for life.thomas codefendant,his son shaurn,was acquitted of all charges against him,which arose from his alleged role as the lookout.
thomas appealed from his conviction,and the superior court affirmed thomas did not seek certification with the pennsylvania supreme court.thomas thereafter filed pro se for state relief,and then retained counsel,who filed an amended petition and a supplemental petition.the court summarily denied relief on all claims,including his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,without holding an evidentiary hearing.the superior court affirmed and the pennsylvania supreme court denied certification.
after exhausting his state remedies to no avail,thomas filed a petition for habeas corpus in the eastern district of pennsylvania,making claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,based on a trial counsel failure to object to an alleged bruton violation and b counsel failure to move to suppress an unreliable witness identification,and prosecutorial misconduct in improperly bolstering the credibility of certain witnesses the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge,who held an evidentiary hearing.the magistrate judge recommended granting the habeas petition solely with respect to the ineffective assistance claim for failure to move to suppress the identification and recommended denying it with respect to all other claims.the commonwealth filed objections to the recommendation that the petition be granted,while thomas did not file any objections.the district court adopted the recommendation with respect to denying the specified claims,and,after conducting a de novo review,agreed that the petition should be granted as to the ineffective assistance claim based on the failure to move to suppress the identification for the reasons presented in its memorandum and order.the commonwealth appeals.
the commonwealth argues that the magistrate judge erred in granting an evidentiary hearing and the district court erred in relying on evidence from that hearing,as it failed to honor the presumption of correctness accorded to state court findings the district court erred in finding that counsel conduct was objectively unreasonable simply because a better strategy may have existed the district court improperly placed the burden of proof on the commonwealth to show that the evidence should not have been suppressed and fuller identification was cumulative,making its suppression harmless and.after setting forth the general habeas corpus standards applicable here,we will consider the arguments in that order.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the district court decided this case under the unreasonable application provision of the statute first section.a state court decision is an unreasonable application under d if the court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.gattis snyder,cir.the unreasonable application test is an objective federal court may not grant habeas relief merely because it concludes that the state court applied federal law erroneously or incorrectly.jacobs horn,cir.
aedpa deferential standards of review do not apply unless it is clear from the face of the state court decision that the merits of the petitioner constitutional claims were examined in light of federal law as established by the supreme court of the united states.id.quoting everett beard,cir.in other cases,federal habeas courts apply standards of review.id.under those standards,federal habeas courts conduct a de novo review over pure legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact.id.
a.the presumption of correctness and the federal evidentiary hearing 
according to the habeas corpus statute 
in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
as noted,the commonwealth contends that the presumption of correctness from e was ignored by the magistrate judge in granting the evidentiary hearing,and that evidence from this hearing should not have been considered by the district court.although the commonwealth rests its arguments entirely on e,the propriety of the grant of an evidentiary hearing is the province of e.that section proscribes a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing i f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.e.
by its terms e applies only to prisoners who have failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.williams taylor,d.our first inquiry is whether the factual basis was indeed developed in state court,a question susceptible,in the normal course,of a simple yes or no answer.id.at.the commonwealth appears to be arguing that the factual basis for thomas claim was in fact developed in state court because the subjective intent and motivation of counsel in taking or not taking actions during trial,that are later challenged as ineffective assistance,are irrelevant to the strickland inquiry however,as we discuss in the next section,the intent or motivation of counsel is relevant to the strickland inquiry,and therefore the factual basis for the ineffective assistance claim here was not developed in the pennsylvania proceedings.as we observed in marshall hendricks,in the course of declining to defer to a state court strategy determination similar to the one reached here 
we conclude that strickland requires an analysis based on a complete record.the reviewing court reasoning under the first prong needs to be made with an understanding of counsel thought process,so that a conclusion whether counsel was ineffective can be made based on facts of record,rather than on assumptions.
the failure inquiry does not end once it is determined that the factual basis of a claim had not been developed in state court.because i n its customary and preferred sense,fail connotes some omission,fault,or negligence on the part of the person who has failed to do something,a person is not at fault when his diligent efforts to perform an act are thwarted,for example,by the conduct of another or by happenstance.williams,at.accordingly,u nder the opening clause of e,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.id.at.here,thomas requested an evidentiary hearing before the commonwealth pcr court to develop the record with respect to counsel choice not to object to or file a motion to suppress the identification.the hearing was denied,and therefore thomas is not at fault for failing to develop the factual basis for his claim.section e is thus inapplicable.see,mason mitchell,cir.accordingly,we find no fault in the magistrate judge holding of a hearing.
b.the ineffective assistance claim 
in strickland washington,the supreme court held 
a convicted defendant claim that counsel assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction has two components.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
d.accordingly,we must undertake the familiar inquiry by considering whether counsel performance was so deficient as to constitute a denial of counsel and whether the alleged errors prejudiced thomas by depriving of a fair trial.
deficient performance 
with respect to the deficient performance prong,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.however,b ecause of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.quotation omitted.s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.id.at.
to overcome the strickland presumption that,under the circumstances,a challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy,a habeas petitioner must show either that the suggested strategy even if sound was not in fact motivating counsel or,that the actions could never be considered part of a sound strategy.it is the former showing that we are presented with here.
our review reveals a tiered structure with respect to strickland s strategic presumptions.at first,the presumption is that counsel conduct might have been part of a sound strategy.the defendant can rebut this weak presumption by showing either that the conduct was not,in fact,part of a strategy or by showing that the strategy employed was unsound.see,rice marshall,cir.in cases in which the record does not explicitly disclose trial counsel actual strategy or lack thereof either due to lack of diligence on the part of the petitioner or due to the unavailability of counsel,the presumption may only be rebutted through a showing that no sound strategy posited by the commonwealth could have supported the conduct see yarborough gentry,d noting that the strategic presumption has particular force where a petitioner bases his claim solely on the trial record,creating a situation in which a court may have no way of knowing whether a seemingly unusual or misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motive quoting massaro united states,d.however,if the commonwealth can show that counsel actually pursued an informed strategy one decided upon after a thorough investigation of the relevant law and facts,the weak presumption becomes a strong presumption,which is virtually unchallengeable.see strickland,at.see also bullock carver,cir discussing the strickland presumptions.
here,thomas rebutted the weak presumption that counsel actions might have been strategic by offering testimony from counsel that his actions,in failing to move to suppress or object,were not in fact part of a strategy.indeed,counsel testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he did not see the need to go forward with his already submitted suppression motion once fuller recanted his identification in the hearing and that he believed he was not permitted to object or move to suppress the identification once it had already been made we note also that the purported the identification in order to fuller about the improper police efforts in obtaining the not even appear to be reasonable.even if the identification was never made or was suppressed,counsel was still free to question fuller about the police tactics in procuring his identification during the photo array.see rodriguez young,cir finding that failure to move to suppress an identification was objectively unreasonable,and noting that the petitioner defense could not have been compromised or hurt by a motion to suppress as c ross examination was still available.in any case,because thomas has shown that counsel was not acting pursuant to an informed strategy,the weak presumption that counsel actions might be part of a strategy was properly rebutted.
of course,overcoming the strategic presumption does not,in itself,entitle thomas to relief.it merely gives him the opportunity to show that counsel conduct fell below objective standards o
