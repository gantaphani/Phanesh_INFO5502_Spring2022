eric johnson entered a conditional plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g and was sentenced to years imprisonment.he appeals the district court denial of his motion to suppress various statements he made to the police and evidence recovered from his home.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
on april,three members of the baltimore city police department violent crime impact section patrolled the cold spring area of baltimore,maryland,a neighborhood known for its high incidence of crime.according to one of the officers,detective jonathan mackensen,this unit often stops motorists in such areas for minor offenses in the hope that these encounters will lead them to information about more serious crimes.
that night,the officers spotted a red gmc jimmy weaving in and out of traffic and displaying a bent and illegible temporary registration tag.the officers pulled the vehicle over and approached the car.
detective damian krauss asked the driver,johnson,for his license and registration.johnson handed detective krauss the vehicle registration card and a maryland identification card,but stated that he did not have a driver license.
at that point,detective krauss detected a faint odor of marijuana and discreetly communicated his suspicion to the other officers by sniffing his nose in the air.he then asked johnson if the officers could search his vehicle.johnson consented to the search.the officers found nothing in the vehicle but detective mackensen came to suspect that johnson was hiding something in his mouth.detective mackensen told johnson to spit it out and out came two small bags of marijuana.
johnson was then arrested,handcuffed,and placed in the back of the officers unmarked car.he was not informed of his miranda rights at that time.see miranda arizona,d.the officers waited for johnson father,the registered owner of the vehicle,to come and retrieve it.they then left for the police station with johnson in the back seat.johnson was never cited for the license plate violation.
while en route to the station,however,johnson volunteered the following i can help you out,i do want to go back to jail,i got information for you.detective mackensen replied,what do you mean,and johnson responded,i can get you a gun.id.detective mackensen then gave johnson a verbal miranda warning and another officer,sergeant brian hopkins,advised johnson not to say any more until they reached the station.
upon his arrival at the station,johnson was taken to an interview room.he was read a second miranda warning and signed an explanation and waiver of rights form.after johnson signed the waiver,the officers returned to the discussion of the firearm that johnson had initiated on the way to the police station.at that point johnson told the officers that the weapon was in his home.he described the weapon and where in the house it could be found.johnson signed a consent to search form.the officers then travelled with johnson to his house and recovered the weapon from johnson bedroom closet.johnson remained in custody and was eventually charged in federal court with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.
johnson moved to suppress the weapon and other tangible evidence recovered in the search of his home,and to suppress his statements to the police.the district court held a hearing on these motions at which johnson,his wife,detective krauss,detective mackensen,and sergeant hopkins testified.
johnson and the officers testified about the state of johnson license plate the night he was stopped.johnson testified that he was in the habit of checking his license plates before getting in the car because he lived in a neighborhood in which temporary tags were often stolen.he testified that he followed his usual routine that night and noticed nothing wrong.johnson also stated that there were two plastic tabs at the bottom of the tag that were designed to keep it sturdy and straight.
the officers,on the other hand,testified that the tag was bent in such a way that it could not be read at a distance.detective krauss and sergeant hopkins testified that the tag was bent up from the bottom while detective mackensen testified that it had been folded over at the top.all three were also asked,however,to demonstrate using a piece of cardboard how the tag was bent.the district court observed that all three officers folded the cardboard so that it curved up from the bottom.all three officers testified that they stopped johnson vehicle after they noticed that the tag was bent and illegible.
the district court found that the tag had indeed been bent and rendered illegible.it concluded that the officers had probable cause to stop johnson vehicle on that ground.
the district court went on to find that detective mackensen asking johnson what do you mean in response to johnson voluntary statement was not the functional equivalent of an interrogation and,therefore,was not a miranda violation.the district court concluded that johnson was subsequently apprised of his miranda rights and waived them voluntarily by signing the waiver of rights form.it also found that he voluntarily consented to the officers search of his home.the district court consequently denied johnson motions to suppress.
johnson entered into a plea agreement with the government,preserving his right to appeal the district court decision on the motions to suppress.he conditionally pleaded guilty and was sentenced to years imprisonment.this appeal followed.
johnson argues that the district court erred in concluding that the officers had probable cause to stop his vehicle,and he argues that detective mackensen question,what do you mean,constituted an unwarned custodial interrogation in violation of miranda.we consider each in turn.
we first consider johnson contention that the officers initial traffic stop was unreasonable and,thus,an illegal seizure under the fourth amendment.he argues that the district court contrary conclusion rests on both an erroneous factual finding that johnson registration tag was bent and an error of law that the stop was reasonable even if the officers used the bent tag merely as a pretext to make the stop.
we review the district court factual finding for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states hamlin,cir.we review the court legal conclusion de novo.id.
johnson contends that the district court erred when it found that johnson tag was bent and illegible.under the standard,a factual finding by the district court may be reversed only if,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.walton johnson,cir en banc quoting united states gypsum.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson city of bessemer,d.this is all the more true when the district court finding was based upon its assessment of witnesses credibility.see united states springer,cir.
at the suppression hearing,johnson and the officers provided conflicting testimony about the state of the tag on johnson vehicle.in the face of such a conflict,the district court decision to credit the officers testimony over johnson is a paradigmatic credibility determination which we do not disturb lightly.see id.
johnson argues that the officers testimony was belied by the fact that they did not seize the tag,photograph it,or issue a citation.but we find the officers failure to take these steps much less illuminating than johnson suggests.the scent of marijuana emanating from johnson vehicle gave the officers reason to investigate a more serious violation than an illegible tag almost immediately after the officers stopped him.
johnson likewise seeks to impeach the officers credibility by pointing out the inconsistency of their testimony about how the tag was bent.but although their verbal descriptions differed,their physical demonstrations were consistent.moreover,the officers were unanimous on the general proposition that the tag was bent and illegible at a distance.
