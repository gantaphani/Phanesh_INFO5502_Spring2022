the government appeals an order of the district court granting defendant lance edgar owen a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.the government charged owen and codefendants mark baroody and paul samuels with two counts of violating title of the united states code.count one charged owen,baroody and samuels with conspiring to distribute in excess of kilograms of marijuana,in violation of.count two charged the defendants with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute approximately kilograms of marijuana in violation of,a,and b b.after a four day trial,the jury convicted all three defendants on both counts.the district court patterson,sentenced owen to the mandatory minimum sentence of sixty months imprisonment.at samuels sentencing hearing,he made statements for the first time purportedly exculpating owen.because samuels exercised his right not to testify at trial,owen claimed samuels statements were newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial.the district court agreed and granted owen a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure rule.we reverse.because samuels testimony related to his direct dealings with owen,owen certainly should have of the substance of samuels testimony prior to trial,and,thus,it was not newly discovered within the meaning of rule when it was offered by samuels at sentencing 
background 
in april of,agents of the drug enforcement agency dea were alerted by a confidential source to suspicious activity at a warehouse in the bronx,new york.the source claimed that,on numerous occasions,paul samuels entered the warehouse to retrieve large boxes of marijuana and loaded them into his or other persons cars.special agent eric baldus and his partner conducted surveillance of the warehouse during normal business hours on two or three occasions but did not see anyone enter or exit the warehouse and the doors to the warehouse remained closed.on june,agents again received information concerning activity at the warehouse,causing them to resume their surveillance the following day.
at approximately on june,agent baldus observed samuels standing outside the warehouse,directing a white box truck into the loading bay.when the truck stopped,baldus saw owen exit the driver side door and enter the warehouse with samuels.from baldus surveillance point he could not see into the box of the truck or the warehouse because the truck was flush with the loading bay.however,baldus observed that,over the next hour,the truck gently shook back and forth,as if it was being loaded or unloaded.baldus testified that,at one point,owen came out of the warehouse and entered the passenger side of the truck cab,where he retrieved a notebook,and then returned to the warehouse.a short time later,owen came out of the warehouse,put the notebook back in the cab,and returned to the warehouse.the book turned out to be a receipt book that the government introduced at trial.
at approximately,owen,baroody and samuels exited the warehouse together.after a brief conversation with samuels,owen got into the truck and drove away.baldus called for agents to follow the truck.samuels then locked the warehouse and he and baroody got into a ford sedan and drove off as well.baldus tried to follow the ford himself but was unsuccessful.
agents pulled owen over near the entrance to interstate.special agent joe doherty approached the driver side of the truck and asked owen for his license and registration.owen explained to doherty that he was a mover and was in the process of moving some items to florida for a client there.owen showed doherty a document that was purportedly a proposal and receipt for moving household items from the bronx to an address in tampa,florida,for a woman named susan thomas.the receipt stated that owen was to receive dollars for the job.the receipt also stated that owen was to drop the items off at humphrey street in tampa and it listed a contact number for susan thomas.investigators subsequently determined that the address on the receipt did not exist and the phone number was not working.
doherty took owen to the back of the vehicle where he asked owen if there were any bombs,guns or drugs in the box of the truck.owen replied that there were not.doherty requested to see for himself and owen obliged,removing a padlock and opening the door to the box.doherty and special agent chris oksala,who was also present,testified at trial that immediately upon opening the door,they smelled the strong scent of marijuana.
when doherty climbed into the box of the truck,he observed various items of furniture and appliances,including a washing machine,a refrigerator,bed boards,beds,and box springs.these items were described at trial by one witness as old stuff that was pretty much garbage.doherty found a number of boxes with items of clothing.upon moving the clothing to one side,doherty discovered bundles of marijuana wrapped in a material.doherty made his way out of the truck and promptly placed owen under arrest.
owen had rented the truck,and,although he claimed to be headed for tampa,the rental agreement stated that the truck had been rented for a trip between the bronx and philadelphia,pennsylvania.in addition,the agreement required owen to return the truck to philadelphia no later than two days after he picked it up in the bronx,and limited owen to miles of travel.if the truck was returned late,the rental agreement provided that owen would be charged for each additional day for each mile owen drove the truck in excess of the stated limit,owen would be charged.tampa is over miles from philadelphia.thus,the round trip would have cost owen in mileage alone,excluding gas and late fees.
during his safety valve hearing,owen testified that he was willing to incur these additional charges,despite the fact that he was only to receive for the moving job,because he was going to tow a used chevy caprice to atlanta and sell it for or.owen stated that he purchased the car for in the bronx with the intention of selling it in atlanta.owen conceded that he did not have a buyer for the car but confidently asserted that he could find one with little difficulty once in atlanta.owen was not towing a caprice when the police pulled him over he claims he was arrested before he could pick up the car.owen testified that another reason he was willing to embark on such an unprofitable venture was because it would allow him to pick up his children,who lived in atlanta with their mother.owen stated that his children were out of school for the summer and that he intended to bring them back to new york with him for a visit.
after owen arrest,the drugs were seized and the truck was returned to budget truck rental.the agent who had rented owen the truck contacted owen and inquired about the disposal of the furniture and appliances allegedly belonging to susan thomas.owen told the agent that he should just get rid of it.
when dea agents returned to the warehouse,they discovered it was almost bare,save for a forklift,a single wooden loading pallet,and some empty boxes.however,agents also discovered a small amount of green wrapping material that appeared to be the same as that used to wrap some of the marijuana found in owen truck,and a single bud of marijuana inside one of the boxes.
at their joint trial,all three defendants exercised their right not to testify.owen defense was that he had been duped into transporting the marijuana by either samuels or baroody,or both.counsel for baroody and samuels presented identical theories a triangle ensued.
the jury convicted owen,samuels and baroody on both counts.prior to sentencing,owen and samuels separately sought the benefit of the safety valve provision in f.that provision requires the defendant to give the government a truthful account of his participation in the crimes for which he is convicted,in exchange for a sentence in line with the united states sentencing guidelines rather than the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by and.
in his safety valve proffer,owen maintained his innocence.owen explained that he performed moving jobs for people and that he was approached by samuels,whom he had known since high school,to move some items to florida for susan thomas.owen claimed that he believed that the moving job was legitimate,and that at no point did he suspect he was engaged in unlawful activity.samuels admitted in his proffer that he smelled marijuana when the boxes were being loaded into the truck,but maintained that he had nothing to do with a conspiracy to distribute marijuana.samuels also stated that he did not mention that he smelled marijuana to either owen or baroody.the district court denied their applications.owen was sentenced to the mandatory minimum imposed by the statute.at samuels sentencing hearing,prior to receiving his sentence,samuels made the following statement 
i know owen for a long time.your honor,i hired him for a job,and that about it.he did know anything about drugs.owen has been a good friend and good brother to me,your honor.maybe i was wrong not to take the he was wrong not to take the stand,but he did have anything to do with it,your honor.i told the prosecutor that when i went in.i told him owen was innocent when i first went in,when i did my proffer agreement.i told him owen did have anything to do with it.
united states owen,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
owen moved pro se for a new trial pursuant to rule,asserting that samuels statement constituted newly discovered exculpatory evidence.in granting the motion,the district court observed,
there is no evidence that owen knew the entire contents of samuels statement before samuels made it at the sentencing hearing a t all times samuels was maintaining his innocence and had a right to exercise his fifth amendment privilege to remain silent at trial.there is no evidence that owen had knowledge that samuels was willing to relinquish that right at any time.owen could not have forced samuels to provide that testimony at or prior to trial.therefore,defense counsel could not have discovered the evidence that samuels would provide with due diligence before or during trial.
id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also found that samuels statements corroborated owen testimony at the safety valve hearing that owen did not know,nor had reason to suspect,that the truck he was driving contained marijuana.samuels statements therefore go to the heart of the circumstantial evidence against owen and may be characterized as new evidence that is material and.id.at,dist.lexis,at.finally,the district court noted that samuels voluntary and unsolicited statements were made prior to sentencing and thus were not made at a time when he had nothing to lose.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court concluded that the statements were therefore sufficiently credible as newly discovered evidence to warrant a new trial for owen,and granted owen motion.
the government appealed.
discussion 
we review the district court decision to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion.see united states robinson,cir united states ferguson,cir.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.design strategy,davis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
a new trial pursuant to rule based on newly discovered evidence may be granted only upon a showing that the evidence could not with due diligence have been discovered before or during trial,that the evidence is material,not cumulative,and that admission of the evidence would probably lead to an acquittal.united states alessi,cir see also united states canova,cir united states zagari,cir.our sister circuits are in substantial agreement on the essential elements to be considered in evaluating a defendant motion for a new trial pursuant to rule,and a majority has articulated a nearly uniform test.each essentially requires that the evidence be newly discovered after trial facts are alleged from which the court can infer due diligence on the part of the movant to obtain the evidence the evidence is material the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching and the evidence would likely result in an acquittal.see,united states jasin,cir united states metz,cir united states glover,cir united states theodosopoulos,cir united states gustafson,cir united states,cir united states dibernardo,cir.
applying this test,a decided majority of circuits have held that,when a defendant is aware that his codefendant could provide exculpatory testimony but is unable to obtain that testimony because the codefendant invokes his privilege against prior to and during trial,the codefendant postconviction statement exculpating the defendant is not newly discovered evidence within the meaning of rule.see,jasin,at third circuit metz,at fifth circuit glover,at sixth circuit theodosopoulos,at seventh circuit,at ninth circuit united states muldrow,cir dibernardo,at eleventh circuit.
the first circuit has taken a more expansive view of rule.in united states,the first circuit noted that m ost other circuits have expressed hostility to th e notion that exculpatory affidavits from codefendants who did not testify at trial because they exercised their fifth amendment privileges may qualify as newly discovered evidence within the meaning of rule,cir.the court explained that the reluctance of the other circuits to permit a new trial on the basis of such evidence was usually grounded in the fact that,even though the testimony was unavailable due to assertions of constitutional privilege,the defendant was at least aware of the possible testimony at trial,and,therefore,it was not newly discovered after trial when the codefendants,since convicted and sentenced,asserted their willingness to testify.id.at citations omitted.relying on circuit precedent,the court rejected the majority view.this circuit has,for almost twenty years,held that the newly discovered language of rule encompasses evidence that was unavailable.id.at citing vega pelegrina united states,cir.the court stated that,given the i n the interests of justice standard of rule,there seems little distinction between evidence which a defendant could not present because he did not know of it and evidence which he could not present because the witness was unavailable despite exercising due diligence.id.first alternation in original.accordingly,the first prong of the first circuit rule test is broader than that of the other circuits,requiring that the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states,cir citing united states wright,cir.
we have never before held that a new trial may be granted pursuant to rule on the basis of evidence that was known by the defendant prior to trial,but became newly available after trial,and we decline to do so here.as judge friendly observed,albeit in dicta,courts must exercise great caution in considering evidence to be newly discovered when it existed all along and was unavail a ble only because a,since convicted,had availed himself of his privilege not to testify.united states jacobs,cir.following this counsel,we now join the majority of circuits to have addressed the issue and hold that rule does not authorize district courts to grant new trials on the basis of such evidence since it is not newly discovered,but merely newly available.
it is axiomatic that where the words of a statute are clear,the words employed are to be taken as the final expression of the meaning intended.united states missouri pac.see business guides,chromatic commc ns enters,d as with a statute,our inquiry is complete if we find the text of the rule to be clear and unambiguous.pavelic leflore marvel entm t group,d in re chalasani,cir.one does not discover evidence after trial that one was aware of prior to trial.to hold otherwise stretches the meaning of the word discover beyond its common understanding.see webster third new int l dictionary defining discover as to make known something secret,hidden,unknown,or previously unnoticed.we are not inclined to expand the scope of rule beyond its textual limit
