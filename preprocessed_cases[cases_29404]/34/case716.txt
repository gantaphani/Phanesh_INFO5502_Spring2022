on february,there was a fire at a restaurant owned by franklin diaz.thereafter,diaz was charged by a federal grand jury in a indictment with malicious destruction by fire of property used in interstate commerce arson in violation of i and count i mail and wire fraud in violation of,and counts and use of fire to commit a federal felony in violation of h and counts.after a trial,a jury convicted diaz on the arson charge in count i and acquitted him on the remaining counts.the district court sentenced diaz to five years of imprisonment.
diaz now appeals his arson conviction,primarily challenging the district court admission of expert opinion testimony as to the cause of the fire.that challenge requires us to consider whether the defendant properly advised the court of the nature of his objection under daubert merrell dow,d,to expert testimony presented by the prosecution.we conclude that he did not.for that reason and others,we affirm the conviction.
we describe the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states van horn,cir.diaz was the owner and operator of franklin prestigio restaurant,located at reservoir avenue in providence,rhode island.the restaurant occupied part of a building at reservoir avenue that consisted of several adjacent storefronts.diaz leased one of these storefronts and the basement below it from the camparone family,whose estate owned the building.
the government introduced evidence at trial casting doubt on the financial viability of diaz business.for instance,in and,the restaurant operated at a loss.as of december,its balance sheet reflected assets of only.diaz had expressed interest in selling the business and had complained about having few customers.
in the summer of,the camparone family began efforts to sell reservoir avenue.because diaz had been in the building longer than the other tenants,the camparones gave him the right of first refusal to buy the building.diaz explored the possibility of buying the building.he spoke with jaime aguayo,a small business administration sba representative,about arranging financing for the purchase.the sba advises small businesses on how to obtain bank loans and if certain conditions are met guarantees up to percent of the ultimate loan.according to aguayo trial testimony,diaz expressed concern that,if the camparones sold the building to another tenant,he would be evicted.despite these initial inquiries,however,diaz never submitted a completed business plan or copies of his tax returns,a necessary step in the sba application process.
at some point in october or november of,diaz had still not succeeded in obtaining financing and rocco camparone told him that he would sell the building to someone else.the camparones then entered into an agreement to sell the building to one of the other tenants.a closing was scheduled for february.the government introduced evidence that diaz was aware of the pending sale and was upset about it.however,diaz denied any such knowledge in his deposition testimony which was admitted into evidence at trial.diaz did not testify at the trial.
in,diaz applied for business insurance through joseph mazzotta,an insurance agent who had secured other insurance coverage for diaz.prior to that time,mazzotta was unable to persuade diaz to purchase business insurance coverage.diaz had always said that he could not afford it.in december,lloyd of london issued an insurance policy that provided of coverage for the contents of the restaurant and of coverage for business interruption.in late january,about a week and a half before the fire,diaz phoned mazzotta several times to confirm that the insurance policy was in effect and visited mazzotta office to obtain a copy of the policy.
on monday,february,just before midnight,a passerby reported to a nearby fire station that the restaurant was on fire.when the firemen arrived,they found the restaurant locked with no sign of a.forcing their way into the building,they discovered that the fire was in the basement.the fire was ultimately suppressed,though not before causing significant damage to the basement.
according to diaz deposition testimony,the restaurant was closed on the day of the fire.diaz testified that he had been in the restaurant that day and he had locked it and activated the burglar alarm before departing.diaz and his wife were the only ones who possessed keys to the restaurant and only they and their daughter knew the access code for the alarm.
on the night of the fire,joseph dorsey,a fire investigator with the providence fire department,arrived to examine the scene and to investigate the cause of the fire.based on this initial investigation,dorsey surmised that the fire might have been caused by an electrical malfunction associated with the radio in the basement.
a few days later,on february,insurance investigator thomas haynes surveyed the scene of the fire at the insurance company request.his investigation in the basement revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner.based on his investigation,he concluded that the fire was deliberately set.
on february,both dorsey and haynes returned together to the scene to conduct a joint investigation.dorsey testified that what he observed on this day caused him to reevaluate his initial determination that the fire was accidentally set.according to their testimony at trial,dorsey and haynes observed on this day that the burn patterns were consistent with an accelerant being used in the fire.as part of the investigation,a rug sample from underneath a fallen ceiling tile was sent out for lab testing.that sample was found to contain some type of accelerant,such as paint thinner or gasoline.based upon these findings,haynes and dorsey opined that the fire was set intentionally.
on march,one business day before trial began,defense counsel filed a pretrial memorandum.that memorandum contained the following sentence the only anticipated legal issue potential would be the qualification of the experts,under the standards of the daubert trilogy daubert merrell dow,d general electric company,et joiner,d,and kumho tire carmichael,d.
at trial,the government called fire investigator dorsey to the witness stand.dorsey described his qualifications as an expert in determining the cause and origin of fires.he also discussed some of the methods used in reaching such determinations.dorsey then proceeded to testify as to the february investigation of the restaurant basement.he testified that,while firefighters were still busy spraying water in the basement,he surveyed the basement with another investigator who had arrived on the scene earlier.that investigator called dorsey attention to a radio and to burn damage to a nearby bed and a wall containing the wiring going to the outlet into which the radio was plugged.based on that initial examination,he concluded that the fire might have been caused by an electrical problem associated with the radio in the basement.
dorsey testified that,after his second examination,conducted jointly with haynes on february,he discovered the evidence that prompted his reevaluation of this conclusion.at this point in the direct examination,the prosecutor asked dorsey for his present opinion concerning the cause of the fire.defense counsel objection on grounds of foundation was sustained,apparently because dorsey had not yet explained what he saw during the second examination that changed his opinion.dorsey then explained that he detected the odor of something like paint thinner and he observed irregular burn patterns indicative of the use of an accelerant.he also observed that the wall where the radio had been plugged in did not burn through to the other side,causing him to eliminate the radio or some other electrical component as a possible cause of the fire.
the government then asked dorsey again for his present opinion on the cause of the fire,prompting defense counsel to object on the following grounds 
competency to render the opinion.and i did have a chance to as to the complete elements of the fire scene investigation before i have had the opportunity.he can answer at some later point.
the court overruled the objection,stating it goes to the weight and not admissibility and you can on that.dorsey then opined that the fire was deliberately set.on,defense counsel challenged dorsey credibility,questioning him at length on his qualifications as a expert,the standards and methods he employed in his analysis,and the factual basis for his opinion on the cause of the fire.
thomas haynes,the investigator retained by the insurance company to examine the restaurant premises after the fire,also testified as an expert at trial.after describing his credentials as a expert,he testified that,on february,his investigation in the basement lasted about four hours and revealed unusual burn patterns inconsistent with normal fires as well as material on the floor that smelled like paint thinner.based on these factors,he concluded that the fire was an incendiary fire,meaning that it was deliberately set.according to his testimony,he took a sample of the carpet in the basement during this visit and sent it out for testing that carpet sample ultimately tested positive for the presence of a concentration of mineral spirits.
as to the joint investigation with dorsey on february,haynes testified that he showed dorsey the irregular burn patterns in the basement area.haynes explained how he examined with dorsey the electrical components in the room,including the copper wiring and the condition of the radio itself.finding insufficient signs of electrical activity,haynes ruled out the theory that the fire was electrical.
based upon the two examinations and his burn pattern analysis,haynes testified that he had reached a settled opinion as to the cause and origin of the fire.when the prosecutor asked what that opinion was,defense counsel made the following brief objection objection.da u bert.the court overruled the objection,allowing haynes to answer.haynes then testified that he believed that the origin of the fire was within the office in the basement area,and it was the result of a deliberate,human act of arson.
on,defense counsel questioned haynes at length on his qualifications as an expert,his methodology and the basis for his ultimate opinion.on redirect,haynes testified without objection that,based upon the burn patterns he observed,his opinion on the cause and origin of the fire would have remained the same even if no evidence of mineral spirits or other accelerant had been found.
at the close of the government case,diaz moved for judgment of acquittal under.his defense counsel stated that i submit to the court that both were qualified by the court and accepted,in terms of their qualifications,by the court as experts on origin and cause he then proceeded to his rule argument that the testimony of dorsey and haynes conflicted in places,and he attacked the experts investigation into what caused the fire.based on these deficiencies in the expert witness testimony,he argued that there was insufficient evidence that the fire was deliberately set 
t here is a discrepancy between the two experts testimony and in fact,dorsey opinion specifically followed more closely the scientific method,but even that opinion significantly diverged from that which is the appropriate way and the suggested way and the followed way of the scientific method,to such an alarming degree that,in fact,the court can not allow the jury to make a decision on something in which the scientific method was not used when it was able to have been used 
he did not mention daubert at this time.
the court denied diaz motion for acquittal,observing that counsel had challenged their qualifications,which he entitled to do,and the court has found that they were both well qualified to express the opinion.the court stated that because both witnesses had testified that the fire was of incendiary origin,the jury would be well within its rights to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire was of incendiary origin.the court then explained how the evidence was sufficient with respect to other elements of the government case.
after recalling haynes for limited testimony as a defense witness the defense rested.during a chambers conference later that day,defense counsel renewed his rule motion for judgment of acquittal for the same reasons that he had previously stated.he also stated without elaboration in addition,i make a motion under rule that the opinions of the two experts be excluded under the daubert analysis as i have previously mentioned.the court denied diaz motion to exclude the testimony of the two experts and reserved judgment on the rule motion.on march,after the jury had rendered its guilty verdict on the arson charge,the court denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.
on march,ten days after the jury verdict,defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial.in that motion,diaz argued for the first time that the expert testimony of dorsey and haynes should be stricken under.not because they were unqualified to testify as experts but because the actual testimony that they gave did not satisfy rule three numbered criteria diaz specifically argued,inter alia,that the investigation was deficient under those rule criteria insofar as there was no comparative testing of rug samples and the experts did not follow standard procedures and protocols in their investigations.the court denied diaz motion.
diaz makes three related albeit procedurally distinct arguments on appeal.first,he challenges the admission of expert testimony of dorsey and haynes,attacking the validity and reliability of the methodology underlying their testimony.second,he challenges the court denial of his rule motion for judgment of acquittal.third,he claims that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for a new trial.
admission of expert testimony 
gatekeeping under daubert 
rule of the federal rules of evidence governs the admissibility of expert testimony.as recently amended,it provides that a proposed expert witness must be sufficiently qualified to assist the trier of fact,and that his or her expert testimony must be relevant to the task at hand and rest on a reliable basis 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence.the three numbered criteria were added to rule in a recent amendment codifying the supreme court decision in daubert merrell dow,d and its progeny,including kumho tire carmichael,d.see.advisory committee note to amendments.
the supreme court asserted in daubert that trial courts perform a gatekeeping role in regulating the admission of expert testimony under.at that screening function entails a preliminary evaluation of the proffered expert testimony for both reliability and relevance.see daubert,at pepsi cola of puerto rico bottling,cir citing daubert.the review for reliability encompasses an assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.daubert,at.as to the relevancy criterion,expert testimony must be relevant not only in the sense that all evidence must be relevant,but also in the incremental sense that the expert proposed opinion,if admitted,likely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue,at citation omitted citing daubert,at.
the rule inquiry is a flexible one,daubert,at,and there is no particular procedure that the trial court is required to follow in executing its gatekeeping function under daubert.in kumho tire,the supreme court stated 
the trial court must have the same kind of latitude in deciding how to test an expert reliability,and to decide whether or when special brie
