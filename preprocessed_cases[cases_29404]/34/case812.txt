following a jury trial in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mae,tayfun okatan was convicted of three counts relating to illegally bringing an alien into the united states.on appeal,okatan raises a number of arguments,most of which we reject in a separate summary order filed along with this opinion.this opinion addresses okatan challenge to the government use of evidence that okatan asked to speak to a lawyer when a border patrol agent initiated an interview prior to his arrest.we conclude that use of this evidence in the government case in chief violated okatan rights under the fifth amendment.because we further conclude that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
because okatan appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial,the following facts are drawn from the trial evidence and described in the light most favorable to the government.united states wilson,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the early hours of october,okatan,a united states citizen,attempted to enter the united states from canada at the lewiston bridge port of entry near buffalo,new york.okatan had a passenger in his car,munir uysal,a german citizen.uysal was denied entry based on records indicating that he had previously overstayed a visa to the united states.customs and border protection cbp officer nghia truong told okatan that he was free to enter the country alone,but okatan declined,explaining that he would drive uysal to the toronto airport to fly home.truong warned okatan against attempting to bring uysal back into the united states,and okatan drove back into canada.
the following morning,okatan again attempted to enter the united states,this time alone,at the champlain,new york port of entry.he was questioned by cbp officer patrick curran.okatan told curran that he had intended to visit his mother and sister in canada,and that he had hoped to give his mother some money,but that she had been in florida.okatan emptied his pockets at curran direction,producing an envelope containing over in dollars plus some euros.okatan was then interviewed by both curran and officer jason sweet.a check of okatan license plate number had alerted the officers to okatan attempt to enter the united states with uysal the preceding day.when asked,okatan told the officers that he and uysal had met in and belonged to the same congregation in virginia.uysal had flown to toronto from germany,and okatan had met him at the airport in order to drive him to virginia beach.okatan said that after uysal had been denied entry at the lewiston bridge port of entry,the two men spent the night at a hotel in ontario.the following morning,they drove into quebec,where they argued at a rest stop.according to okatan,uysal wanted him to drive into the united states with uysal in the trunk.when okatan refused,uysal walked off,and,when he did not come back,okatan returned to the united states alone.after the interview,sweet told okatan that he would have to inspect his car and asked whether there was anything in the car that did not belong to him.okatan said uysal luggage was in the trunk and agreed to leave it with border patrol.
okatan then entered the united states.at cbp request,homeland security investigations agent kevin walczak followed okatan car south from rouses point,new york,for approximately minutes and into vermont,where he decided that okatan was likely traveling home to massachusetts.later that day,however,walczak again saw okatan car in the vicinity of rouses point.he followed the car briefly until okatan abruptly pulled over to the side of the road,forcing walczak to drive past him.walczak changed cars and caught up with okatan,this time following him south until okatan had left walczak usual area of responsibility.at that point,walkczak abandoned his surveillance,but cbp officers continued to follow okatan.
meanwhile,also on october,uysal walked into a convenience store in mooers,new york another port of entry not far from the one in champlain and waited for two or three hours.noting that uysal did not have a car,and considering how long he had been waiting,the owner of the store became suspicious and called border patrol.agent jerry boucher and another agent responded to the call.they questioned uysal,searched his pockets,and arrested him,transporting him to the champlain border patrol station.
after leaving the station,boucher drove to the beekmantown rest area,the rest area closest to the convenience store at which uysal had been arrested.as boucher approached the rest area from the north on interstate,he saw okatan car,which he recognized based on descriptions that he previously had heard at the border patrol station,driving in the opposite direction.okatan passed a rest area on the northbound side of the road,directly across from the beekmantown rest area,made a,and entered the beekmantown rest area on the southbound side of the road.boucher followed okatan into the parking lot.before okatan could exit his car,boucher activated his vehicle lights and used its system to tell okatan to remain inside his car.
boucher walked over to okatan car,identified himself as a border patrol agent and asked okatan if he was a united states citizen.okatan said that he was and handed over his passport.boucher then asked why okatan had passed the rest area on the east side of the highway and made a to enter the beekmantown rest area.okatan replied that he had to use the bathroom.boucher warned okatan that lying to a federal officer is a criminal act and asked whether he was there to pick someone up.okatan said that he wanted a lawyer.at that point,boucher placed okatan under arrest and transported him to the champlain border patrol station.according to boucher,when okatan and uysal saw each other at the station,uysal face lit up and he looked like he was about to wave,but okatan looked at the ground.okatan and his car were searched,and in dollars and in euros were found.
ii.procedural history 
okatan was indicted on june,and charged with bringing and attempting to bring an alien into the united states in violation of a b iii,attempting to transport an alien within the united states in violation of a a ii,and encouraging and inducing an alien to enter the united states illegally in violation of a a iv.before trial,he moved to suppress statements he made to boucher at the beekmantown rest area.the district court granted the motion on november,but only with respect to the statements okatan made to agent boucher after he asked for a lawyer at the beekmantown rest area on the basis they were obtained in violation of miranda.
agent boucher testified during okatan jury trial and,on direct examination,described his interaction with okatan in the beekmantown rest area.boucher explained that after okatan told him he needed to use the bathroom,
i then again asked him why would you come to this rest area and he said something about the bathroom again,at which point i said to him something along the lines of,it against the law to lie to a federal agent,so do lie to me.why would you go past the northbound rest area,turn around and come back to this rest area and i may have said something like,you are not here to pick anybody up or anything and he put his hands down and said he wanted a lawyer.
at that point,okatan attorney requested a mistrial because okatan exercise of his constitutional right to remain silent is not a statement that admissible and should not have come in for the jury.the judge denied the motion,explaining that she had already ruled that any statements made after okatan requested a lawyer could not come in,and that okatan voluntary statement that he wanted a lawyer was not excluded pursuant to that ruling.
at the close of evidence,okatan attorney requested that the court structure a charge to ensure that the jury is not drawing any negative any inference from boucher testimony that the defendant asked for counsel at that point,which was his constitutional right.the court denied the request on the basis that it had explained to the jury in a preliminary charge that the defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent.
in its closing argument,the government recounted okatan interaction with boucher,highlighting okatan request for a lawyer.the government reminded the jury that,after boucher approached okatan in the beekmantown rest area,
okatan identified himself,he a naturalized citizen.what are you doing here i have to go to the bathroom.you just drove past a rest area,you have to go to the bathroom.are you here to pick somebody up have to go to the bathroom.so,crime to lie to a federal officer and then no more.no more talking.that when he asked for his lawyer.okatan,who was very chatty,was sweet and courteous,very friendly,when he was distancing himself from uysal,very friendly with officer truong,now it stage fright.you ca talk any more.
okatan attorney objected,and the court instructed the government to move on to another topic.however,the government again alluded to the interaction later in its summation,suggesting that if okatan had not been involved in illegal activity,we would have had a little different experience at the beekmantown rest area instead,there was the kind of conduct that someone who been caught engaged in.
after the closing arguments,okatan attorney again complained of the government references to okatan invocation of his rights to counsel at the rest area and the lack of a curative instruction.the court found no undue prejudice,as the government closing was factually based,and intended to highlight that okatan had been very talkative before and he was talkative at that point.the court therefore denied okatan renewed motion for a mistrial or,in the alternative,a curative instruction.
on november,the jury convicted okatan of all three counts in the indictment.okatan was sentenced on march,to time served in prison,five months of home detention and two years of supervised release a special assessment was imposed for each count.judgment was entered on april.okatan appealed on april.
discussion 
okatan argues that the government violated the fifth amendment when it used as substantive evidence of guilt his request for a lawyer and his refusal to answer questions without one.we agree.
legal standards 
the fifth amendment provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.the privilege permits a person to refuse to answer questions,in formal or informal proceedings,where the answers might be used to incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.united states ramos,cir.it also allows a person to express his desire to remain silent,or to remain silent until he has the assistance of an attorney.wainwright greenfield,d with respect to warnings silence,we point out that silence does not mean only muteness it includes the statement of a desire to remain silent,as well as of a desire to remain silent until an attorney has been consulted.
in order for the privilege to be given full effect,individuals must not be forced to choose between making potentially incriminating statements and being penalized for refusing to make them.thus,in griffin california,d,the supreme court held that a prosecutor may not tender to the jury for its consideration the failure of the accused to testify as substantive evidence of guilt.t he fifth amendment forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.id.at see also baxter palmigiano,d noting that griffin prohibits the judge and prosecutor from suggesting to the jury that it may treat the defendant silence as substantive evidence of guilt.
neither we nor the supreme court has squarely addressed whether griffin holding should be extended to protect a defendant pretrial,and more specifically prearrest,invocation of his fifth amendment privilege from prosecutorial comment as part of the government case in chief.in jenkins anderson,d,the supreme court considered the government impeachment use of testimony concerning the defendant failure to turn himself into police immediately after killing a man,which at trial he claimed to have done in.the court held that the fifth amendment is not violated when a defendant who testifies in his own defense is impeached with his prior silence.id.at jenkins holding was premised on the principle that a defendant who takes the stand in his own behalf does so as any other witness,subject to impeaching his credibility,even if that relies on evidence that might otherwise be inadmissible under the fifth amendment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the jenkins court therefore expressly left open the question of whether or under what circumstances prearrest silence may be protected by the fifth amendment,id.at,and,in turn,the extent to which the government may rely on such silence when a defendant does not waive his fifth amendment rights by testifying at trial.
as the government here has observed,at the time this appeal was briefed and argued,the federal courts of appeals were divided over whether a defendant prearrest silence could be introduced as part of the government case in chief without violating the fifth amendment protection against.compare combs coyle,cir where defendant clearly invoked the privilege against the prosecutor comment on his prearrest silence in its case in chief and the trial court instruction permitting the jury to use the defendant silence as substantive evidence of guilt violated his fifth amendment rights united states burson,cir o nce a defendant invokes his right to remain silent,it is impermissible for the prosecution to refer to any fifth amendment rights which defendant exercised.coppola powell,cir the government affirmative use of defendant prearrest invocation of fifth amendment rights was unconstitutional united states ex rel.savory lane,cir introduction of officer testimony that defendant said he did want to make any statements violated the fifth amendment with united states oplinger,cir admission of testimony regarding defendant reaction to prearrest questioning by his supervisors into potentially illegal activity did not violate the fifth amendment,overruled on other grounds by united states contreras,cir united states zanabria,cir finding constitutional prosecutor use of evidence that prior to arrest defendant did not indicate that he was under duress because t he fifth amendment protects against compelled but does not preclude the proper evidentiary use and prosecutorial comment about every communication or lack thereof by the defendant which may give rise to an incriminating inference emphasis in original united states rivera,cir the government may comment on a defendant silence if it occurred prior to the time that he is arrested and given his miranda warnings.
in identifying this circuit split,the government did not distinguish between cases involving defendants who simply failed to speak prior to arrest and those involving defendants who affirmatively invoked their right to remain silent.it is a distinction we similarly elided in united states caro,cir,in which we expressed doubt that the fifth amendment permits even evidence that a suspect remained silent before he was arrested or taken into custody to be used in the government case in chief.however,it is a distinction that has taken on new importance in light of the supreme court decision in salinas texas,d,which was rendered after briefing and oral argument in this case were completed.
in salinas,police officers investigating a shooting asked salinas during the course of a voluntary interview whether shells recovered at the crime scene would match shells used by a gun to which he had access.salinas,who until that moment had freely answered the officers questions,looked down,became tense,and stayed silent.after a few moments,the officers resumed the interview,asking different questions,which salinas answered.id.at.salinas was tried for the shooting.at trial,he did not testify,and the government relied on his silence during the interview as evidence of his guilt.the court granted certiorari to address whether the prosecution may use a def
