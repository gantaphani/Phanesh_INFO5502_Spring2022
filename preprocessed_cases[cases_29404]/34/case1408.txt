opinion of the court 
kenneth malik williams appeals from his conviction following trial for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense.williams also appeals his sentence of months in prison.regarding his conviction,williams argues that the district court erred in failing to provide adequate jury instructions as to multiple conspiracies and as to the firearm charge.williams also argues that the evidence was insufficient for conviction on the firearm charge,and that the district court should not have prohibited williams from a key prosecution witness about his statement that he had never committed murder.lastly,williams argues that his case should be remanded for resentencing in accordance with the supreme court opinion in united states booker,d.we reject williams appeal of his conviction but remand for resentencing under booker as to his conspiracy conviction.
background 
in october,williams was indicted along with for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base.williams was also charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime pursuant to c a.the firearm charge arose out of a shootout that occurred when williams and several coconspirators drove to penrose plaza,a shopping mall in south philadelphia,in search of men who had kidnapped the girlfriend and children of one of williams in an attempt to extort cash and cocaine.
the district court severed the defendants cases into several groups and conducted seven separate trials.the jury hung at williams first trial in february,and the court declared a mistrial.following a second trial in july,williams was convicted on both counts.
williams was sentenced in october,after the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d,but prior to booker.the district court interpreted blakely to bar enhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines based on facts not found by the jury.based on this view,the district court concluded that the appropriate range for the conspiracy count was to months,and rejected an upward enhancement for williams managerial role.within this range,the court sentenced williams to months.on the firearm possession count,the court found that the firearm was discharged and sentenced williams to a consecutive sentence,the mandatory minimum under c a iii.
discussion 
williams argues that the district court erred in its jury instructions by failing to give adequate guidance on the concept of multiple conspiracies and on the firearm charge there is no evidence that williams objected on this basis at trial,and we therefore review the instructions for plain error.united states guadalupe,cir.under the plain error standard,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states vazquez,cir quoting johnson united states,d.
the district court read the following instruction on multiple conspiracies to the jury 
whether there existed a single unlawful agreement,or many such agreements,or indeed no agreement at all,is a question of fact for you,the jury,to determine in accordance with the instructions i about to give you.now,when two or more people join together to further one common unlawful design or purpose,a single conspiracy exists.by way of contrast,multiple conspiracies exist when there are separate unlawful agreements to achieve distinct purposes.proof of several separate and independent conspiracies is not proof of the single overall conspiracy charged in the indictment unless one of the conspiracies proved happens to be the single overall conspiracy described in the indictment.
now,you may find that there was a single conspiracy despite the fact that there were changes in either personnel,or activities,or both,so long as you find that some of the coconspirators continued to act for the entire duration of the conspiracy for the purposes charged in the indictment.this is so even if you find that some conspiracy other than the one charged in the indictment existed,even though the purposes of both conspiracies may have been the same and even though there may have been some overlap in membership.similarly,if you find that the defendant was a member of another conspiracy and not the one charged in the indictment,then you must acquit him.
williams argues that this instruction was inadequate because the judge also should have told the jury that even though two individuals may enter into repeated arrangements to sell and buy drugs,it does not necessarily establish a single conspiracy to distribute.williams also argues that the evidence suggested two separate charged conspiracy to distribute drugs and a conspiracy to carry a weapon in response to a that the district court therefore should have repeated the instruction on multiple conspiracies in the context of its instructions on the firearm charge.
williams provides no legal support for these assertions.the district court explained the difference between a single conspiracy and multiple conspiracies in more than enough detail under this circuit case law,and provided all of the information necessary for the jury to understand the relevant concepts.see,united states price,cir finding no plain error in instruction on multiple conspiracies where the court told the jury that the government has to show the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment united states phillips,cir finding that no additional instruction on multiple conspiracies was necessary where the jury was instructed that it could find the defendant guilty only if the defendant was a member of the conspiracy charged in the indictment and not some other conspiracy.the district court instruction on multiple conspiracies was thorough,and there was no need to repeat it a second time.we conclude that there was no plain error in the district court instruction on multiple conspiracies.
williams also argues that the district court instructions on the firearm charge were inadequate.he claims that the evidence at trial suggested a lack of nexus between the drug conspiracy and williams use of a firearm,and that the district court should have stated explicitly that such a nexus was required for conviction on the firearm charge.the judge gave the jury the following instruction,among others,on the firearm charge 
now,the government must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt.one,the defendant knowingly committed a drug trafficking crime two,the defendant knowingly possessed at least one firearm three,the possession was in furtherance of the drug trafficking crime.now,the first element that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant committed a drug trafficking crime.the government alleges that the defendants possessed firearms in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged in count one 
now,the term in furtherance of,means to advance,move forward,promote,or facilitate the drug trafficking crime.for example,if you determine that based upon the evidence in this case,that the defendant possessed the firearm and that he did so at least in part to protect his drugs,his drug proceeds,or himself,from competing drug dealers or the police,or that he possessed the firearm for some other reason,which in some way moved forward,advanced,promoted or facilitated the drug trafficking crimes listed in the indictment,then the defendant possessed the firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.if,however,based upon the evidence in this case,you find that the defendant did not possess a firearm on or about the date set forth in the indictment or that the firearm was present only for some other purpose,or by mere coincidence,or that the government failed to prove this element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt,then,you must find the defendant not guilty on that count.
this language unambiguously requires the jury to find a nexus between
