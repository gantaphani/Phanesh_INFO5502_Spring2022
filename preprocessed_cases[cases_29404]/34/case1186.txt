opinion of the court 
in these consolidated antitrust conspiracy cases,two groups of plaintiffs,one a certified class of direct purchasers of chocolate products the direct purchaser class,and the other a group of individual plaintiffs the individual plaintiffs collectively,the plaintiffs,appeal the district court summary judgment in favor of defendants the hershey company hershey hershey canada,nestlé usa,and mars,and mars snackfood,llc collectively,mars all appellees are collectively referred to as the chocolate manufacturers.
according to the plaintiffs,the chocolate manufacturers conspired to raise prices on chocolate candy products in the united states three times between and.the plaintiffs assert numerous errors on appeal,but at its core,this case is about how courts should view evidence of a contemporaneous antitrust conspiracy in a foreign market when that evidence is offered to prove the existence of an antitrust conspiracy in the market.here the foreign conspiracy involved the chocolate manufacturers canadian brethren hershey canada mars canada,and nestlé canada collectively,the canadian chocolate manufacturers,as well as others.
we agree with the district court that the canadian conspiracy evidence is ambiguous and does not support an inference of a conspiracy for two simple reasons.first,the people involved in and the circumstances surrounding the canadian conspiracy are different from those involved in and surrounding the purported conspiracy,and second,the evidence that the chocolate manufacturers in the united states knew of the unlawful canadian conspiracy is weak and,in any event,relates only to hershey.because we also conclude that the plaintiffs other traditional conspiracy evidence is insufficient to create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy,we will affirm 
a.the chocolate industry 
the chocolate confectionary market is dominated by three companies hershey,mars,and nestlé usa.hershey is a publicly traded company based in hershey,pennsylvania,and sells such famous brands as hershey milk chocolate bar and reese peanut butter cups.mars is a privately held company headquartered in virginia and is the parent company of mars snackfood among mars most notable brands are m ms and milky way.nestlé usa is a company wholly owned by nestlé nestlé usa sells such popular brands as nestlé crunch and butterfinger.besides offering a variety of chocolate candy brands,the chocolate manufacturers offer a variety of sizes.some sizes,such as single and bars singles and kings,are for immediate consumption,while others,including bags containing miniature or candies,are for future consumption.this case focuses on immediate consumption candy sizes.
the chocolate market is highly concentrated.during the relevant period,these three companies controlled more than of the market,with hershey controlling approximately,mars controlling approximately,and nestlé usa controlling roughly.
the primary raw materials for the various chocolate products at issue are generally the same cocoa,sugar,dairy products,peanuts,almonds,fats,and oils.naturally,the costs of these ingredients affect the prices of the chocolate products.to hedge against cost increases for these ingredients,the chocolate manufacturers take advantage of futures exchanges.for example,in a internal report,hershey understood that through futures contracts,its coverage on cocoa costs through mid was favorable versus its principal competitors.still,between and,it is undisputed that cocoa prices increased.see acknowledging that hershey actual cocoa costs increased from to.
parallel price increases in which one company raises prices and its rivals follow are not uncommon in this industry.although the price increases have not followed a consistent playbook some have involved changes in candy weight while others have involved delays between the initial and subsequent pricing actions the chocolate manufacturers raised prices together in,and.
b.the purported conspiracy 
according to the plaintiffs,the chocolate manufacturers conspired to raise list prices on chocolate candy products three times between and.on december,following a period of stagnant prices,mars announced list price increases on singles and six packs by cents per bar effective december.on december,hershey announced an identical price increase on singles and a slightly lesser price increase on six packs in addition,hershey announced price increases on kings and ten packs all effective january.on december,nestlé usa prices moved too,effectively matching mars and hershey price increases on singles,hershey price increase on kings,and mars greater price increase on six packs.days later,mars matched hershey increase on kings and exceeded hershey increase on ten packs.
next,in november,mars initiated another price increase,this time on future consumption products.nearly one month later,hershey followed mars price increase on future consumption products and also raised prices on singles,kings,and six packs.soon after,mars matched hershey increases.nestlé usa followed with nearly identical increases several days later.finally,on march,mars initiated the final increase during the alleged conspiracy period when it increased prices on singles and kings.hershey matched the increases on april,and nestlé usa followed the next day.
the conspiracy was furthered,the plaintiffs argue,by the chocolate manufacturers exchanging information on each other planned price increases before publicly announcing those increases.for example,an internal hershey document shows that hershey had information as early as september that mars was considering a price increase due to rising cocoa costs,and in announcing the mars price increase to the hershey board of directors,hershey ceo,rick lenny,characterized the mars increase as roughly in line with expectations.
in addition,the plaintiffs highlight various opportunities the chocolate manufacturers had to conspire.for example,in,at a time when the chocolate market was not thriving,the hershey trust,hershey controlling shareholder,put hershey up for sale.hershey rivals,including nestlé and cadbury,were among the interested buyers.through the proposed sale process,nestlé and cadbury obtained information about hershey business,but the record is unclear to what extent hershey most sensitive information,such as commodities cost coverage,changed hands and who received it.the hershey trust terminated the sale process in september,shortly before the first price increase in the purported conspiracy.
the plaintiffs also point north to canada,where the canadian chocolate market was embroiled in its own antitrust conspiracy at the same time as the purported conspiracy.like the market,the canadian market is very concentrated,with the three canadian chocolate manufacturers controlling roughly of the market.hershey is the parent company of hershey canada,and mars is the parent company of mars canada.hershey canada and mars canada report to and need final approval from executives on pricing decisions,but the canadian subsidiaries are separate legal entities,operate exclusively in canada,and run their own operations.nestlé canada,on the other hand,is a subsidiary of nestlé,so it is different from hershey canada and mars canada in that it does not report to a parent company.
from to,mars canada,hershey canada,nestlé canada,and cadbury adams canada cadbury canada allegedly conspired to limit competition on trade and to raise prices.the trade spend conspiracy began in when itwal,a direct purchaser and major distributor in canada,sent notices to the canadian chocolate manufacturers asking them to reign in trade spend.itwal efforts were successful,yielding commitments from the canadian chocolate manufacturers that they would reduce trade spend.in april,itwal president sent a notice to each of the canadian chocolate manufacturers stating,i t appears your efforts to dry up this activity may be starting to work.driving home the point,itwal president sent another notice in december of that year to all the canadian chocolate manufacturers stating,i would like to extend congratulations to you all as we wind up the year with respect to your concerted and committed efforts to clean up the dysfunctional retail trade spending.emphasis added.
additionally,there is evidence suggesting a conspiracy among the canadian chocolate manufacturers,including secret meetings involving pricing discussions.in,for example,nestlé canada ceo bob leonidas told cadbury canada president david sculthorpe that nestlé canada would be increasing prices and proved it with a copy of a announcement,and sculthorpe promised that cadbury canada would follow.
the canadian scheme was ultimately the subject of a criminal investigation by the canadian competition bureau.cadbury canada cooperated with the investigation,and hershey canada did as well,with hershey pleading guilty to one count of price fixing stemming from a incident and paying a million canadian fine.in,nestlé canada,mars canada,itwal,leonidas,and itwal president were indicted in canada.the canadian case is still pending.
c.the procedural history 
the cases on appeal have a long history.they began as separate civil actions that were filed against the chocolate manufacturers as well as their canadian counterparts and several cadbury entities.in addition to various state law claims,the actions brought claims under and of the clayton act,alleging that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy in violation of of the sherman act,u.in,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the actions for pretrial proceedings in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania pursuant to a.
after the cases were consolidated,each of the defendants moved to dismiss the complaints for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,but on march,the district court denied the motions except as to certain state law claims.see in re chocolate confectionary antitrust,d,at the pleading stage,the district court decided that the plaintiffs had adequately pled a conspiracy in violation of the sherman act.in so holding,the district court relied on allegations regarding the contemporaneous canadian conspiracy and the canadian chocolate market integration with the chocolate market.id.at.in,all the cadbury defendants were dismissed after they reached a settlement with the various groups of plaintiffs.as part of the agreement with the direct purchaser class,cadbury agreed to fully cooperate with the plaintiffs during discovery.
on december,the district court certified a class of all direct purchasers of chocolate candy products for resale from the chocolate manufacturers between december,and december,which formed the direct purchaser class.the individual plaintiffs,comprising mostly grocery and drug stores,pursued their claims individually.in certifying the direct purchaser class,the district court denied challenges to the class economic experts,robert tollison and james mcclave.in re chocolate confectionary antitrust.briefly,tollison opined that the chocolate market was conducive to price fixing and that a conspiracy did occur in this case,while mcclave testified to the damages caused by the chocolate manufacturers supracompetitive prices.
in may,the district court considered another daubert motion,this time challenging the testimony of the individual plaintiffs economic expert,christopher vellturo.the district court granted the motion to exclude part of vellturo testimony and reports on the individual plaintiffs damages caused by nestlé usa alleged overcharges because vellturo based his calculations on mars profit margin data,not nestlé usa.the individual plaintiffs appeal that decision here as for the remainder of vellturo testimony,the district court denied the daubert motion,concluding that vellturo other opinions,including his opinion that the canadian conspiracy facilitated or actuated the implementation of the conspiracy,were admissible.
at the close of discovery,each of the chocolate manufacturers filed separate summary judgment motions as to the individual plaintiffs claims and the direct purchaser class claims.on february,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the chocolate manufacturers.see in re chocolate confectionary antitrust,d.the plaintiffs claims failed,the district court reasoned,because they could not show that the chocolate manufacturers acted against their and because there was no traditional conspiracy evidence.in the district court view,the plaintiffs evidence was as consistent with lawful competition as with an illegal conspiracy and therefore could not raise a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.id.at.this decision is the central issue on appeal.
the plaintiffs filed timely appeals.
the district court had jurisdiction under a and and.we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review over the district court summary judgment and apply the same standard the district court did.in re baby food antitrust,cir.
because substantive antitrust law is intertwined with our standard of review,we first discuss the underlying legal principles.the plaintiffs claims arise from of the sherman act,which prohibits e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce.u.although its language is broad,only prohibits unreasonable restraints of trade.in re flat glass antitrust,cir.therefore,in some cases,courts must apply the rule of reason,a inquiry designed to assess whether challenged conduct is an anticompetitive practice.baby food,at.
other restraints of trade,however,have such little redeeming competitive value that they are deemed per se unreasonable.in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir.horizontal price fixing among competitors what the plaintiffs claim happened here is a classic example of a restraint of trade analyzed under the per se standard texaco dagher.agreements are all banned because of their actual or potential threat to the central nervous system of the economy.united states socony vacuum oil.
in per se cases like this one,the plaintiff need only prove that the defendants conspired among each other and that this conspiracy was the proximate cause of the plaintiff injury.intervest,bloomberg,cir.without proof of concerted action,the plaintiff claim fails because the very essence of a section claim is the existence of an agreement.alvord polk,schumacher,cir.therefore,proof of a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement is required.id.internal quotation marks omitted.such proof may come in the form of direct evidence,an explicit admission from a participant that an antitrust conspiracy existed,or circumstantial evidence.intervest,at.an important corollary to the agreement requirement is that liability can not be predicated on a defendant unilateral actions,no matter its anticompetitive motivations.monsanto spray rite serv,independent action is not proscribed by.intervest,at.
returning to our standard of review,the summary judgment standard in antitrust cases is generally no different from the standard in other cases.flat glass,at.here as elsewhere,summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we also review the record as a whole and in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,drawing reasonable inferences in its favor.see flat glass,at.
there is,however,an important distinction in antitrust cases.id.a ntitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a case.matsushita indus.zenith radio.c onduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not,standing alone,support an inference of antitrust conspiracy.id.therefore,unless the plaintiff present s evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators acted independently,summary judgment is appropriate.id.quoting monsanto,at.the purpose of this standard is to avoid mistaken inferences that could impose liability for lawful conduct and,consequently,chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect.id.at accord flat glass,at.
under matsushita,the range of acceptable inferences that may be drawn from ambiguous or circumstantial evidence var ies with the plausibility of the plaintiffs theory and the dangers associated with such inferences.flat glass,at quoting petruzzi iga supermarkets,darling,cir.if the plaintiff theory makes no economic sense and if drawing inferences in its favor would deter procompetitive conduct,the plaintiff must produce more persuasive evidence to support its claim.id.internal quotation marks omitted 
importantly,even when armed with a plausible economic theory,a plaintiff relying on ambiguous evidence alone can not raise a reasonable inference of a conspiracy sufficient to survive summary judgment.matsushita,at we do not imply that,if petitioners had had a plausible reason to conspire,ambiguous conduct could suffice to create a triable issue of conspiracy.rossi standard roofing,cir.at the same time,defendants are not entitled to summary judgment merely by showing that there is a plausible explanation for their conduct rather the focus must remain on the evidence proffered by the plaintiff and whether that evidence tends to exclude the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.rossi,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted 
the plaintiffs build their case on a logical enough foundation three parallel price increases by the chocolate manufacturers between and.moreover,the plaintiffs theory that the chocolate manufacturers conspired to fix prices at supracompetitive levels makes perfect economic sense.flat glass,at.if true,the alleged conduct is also not procompetitive.id.but despite the facial plausibility of the plaintiffs theory and the circumstantial evidence supporting it,we must be cautious.the chocolate market is a textbook example of an oligopoly,and we can not infer too much from mere evidence of parallel pricing among oligopolists,flat glass,at.
our caution is based on the economic theory of interdependence,which recognizes the differences between competitive markets markets with many smaller firms and oligopolistic markets concentrated markets with only a few firms.in competitive markets,the theory goes,any one firm change in output or price would go unnoticed by its competitors because the effects of that firm increased sales would be so diffused among its numerous competitors.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in a concentrated or oligopolistic market,by contrast,a single firm change in output or price will have a noticeable impact on the market and on its rivals.id.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,the theory of interdependence posits that any rational decision by an oligopolist must take into account the anticipated reaction of the other firms.id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the upshot is oligopolists may maintain supracompetitive prices through rational,interdependent,as opposed to unlawful concerted action,if the oligopolists independently conclude that the industry as a whole would be better off by raising prices.id.
even though this practice of parallel pricing,known as conscious parallelism,produces anticompetitive outcomes,it is lawful under the sherman act for two reasons.id.at.first,conscious parallelism is not an agreement,id.at instead,it can be a necessary fact of life in oligopolies,baby food,at.second,conscious parallelism is lawful not because it is desirable it is not,but because courts have no effective remedy for the problem.clamp all cast iron soil pipe,cir breyer,accord flat glass,at.
accordingly,evidence of conscious parallelism can not alone create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.baby food,f d at.to move the ball across the goal line,a plaintiff must also show that certain plus factors are present.flat glass,at.plus factors are proxies for direct evidence because they tend to ensure that courts punish concerted action an actual agreement instead of the unilateral,independent conduct of competitors.id.internal quotation marks omitted.although we have not identified an exhaustive list of plus factors,they may include evidence that the defendant had a motive to enter into a price fixing conspiracy evidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests and evidence implying a traditional conspiracy.id.quoting petruzzi,at.
yet in cases alleging parallel price increases,as opposed to some other form of concerted action,the first two factors largely restate the phenomenon of interdependence.see also petruzzi,at acknowledging that evidence of actions against may overlap with lawful interdependence in parallel pricing cases,but concluding that the overlap concern is absent when the challenged conduct involves parallel decisions.evidence of a motive to conspire means the market is conducive to price fixing,and evidence of actions against means there is evidence of behavior inconsistent with a competitive market.see flat glass,at.by nature,oligopolistic markets are conducive to price fixing and will often exhibit behavior that would not be expected in competitive markets.id.therefore,these factors are neither necessary nor sufficient to preclude summary judgment,at least where the claim is price fixing among oligopolists.id.at.
that leaves traditional evidence of a conspiracy as the most important plus factor in cases like this one.id.at.this plus factor looks for proof that the defendants got together and exchanged assurances of common action or otherwise adopted a common plan even though no meetings,conversations,or exchanged documents are shown.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
with these principles in mind,we now turn to whether the plaintiffs have identified enough evidence to survive summary judgment.
lacking direct evidence,the plaintiffs rely on circumstantial evidence to raise a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.the district court found,and the parties do not dispute,that the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence of parallel pricing.therefore,our analysis focuses on whether there are sufficient plus factors to defeat summary judgment.
the district court found that the plaintiffs had adduced sufficient evidence of the chocolate manufacturers motive to enter into a conspiracy,and again,no one disputes this conclusion on appeal.given the market concentration and high barriers to entry,the chocolate confectionary market was ripe for collusion.but evidence of motive without more does not create a reasonable inference of concerted action because it merely restates interdependence.see flat glass,at.
actions against self interest 
the district court next held that the plaintiffs had not provided enough evidence to show that the chocolate manufacturers acted contrary to their by raising prices in,and.unlike the first plus factor,the parties vigorously dispute the correctness of the district court conclusion on this point.to the plaintiffs,the district court analysis is flawed,rife with inferences drawn against them and contradicted by their expert evidence concluding that cost increases could not explain the price increases.to the chocolate manufacturers,the district court analyzed the issue correctly by noting the plaintiffs inability to rebut the chocolate manufacturers several legitimate and procompetitive justifications for the price increases as well as their divergent tactics and strategies implementing the price increases.
part of the disagreement here appears to be based on a misconception about what this factor means as discussed above,evidence of actions against means there is evidence of behavior that is inconsistent with a competitive market.so in flat glass,we found this factor present based on the lack of evidence showing that the price increases were due to increases in costs or demand.see at.similarly here,the plaintiffs economic experts uniformly opined that cost increases could not explain the price increases.see vellturo report i find that increased costs were a minor if significant at all consideration in defendants subject price increases.tollison declaration c osts provide no rational economic explanation for price increases mcclave report my model shows that prices were elevated to levels during the class period well above those justified by changes in cost and demand.further,the plaintiffs experts rejected criticisms that their analyses did not account for cost variables beyond raw material costs.these conclusions find at least some support from evidence in the record.compare october memorandum from hershey ceo lenny to the hershey board of directors noting extremely sluggish retail environment and explaining that hershey would not raise prices in the near term in part because hershey was covered on costs,with announcing december hershey price increase.therefore,we agree with the plaintiffs and disagree with the district court and the chocolate manufacturers to this extent the aforementioned evidence shows that the chocolate market may not have been acting consistently with a competitive market.
this is not to say that the record evidence uniformly supports the plaintiffs position to the contrary,there is substantial support for the chocolate manufacturers contention that their actions were consistent with,and the result of,competition.for example,there is evidence showing that the price increases were taken in anticipation of rising costs that costs actually did go up during the conspiracy period that the chocolate manufacturers tried to catch each other by surprise with the timing of,and the products associated with,the price increases and that the prevalent practice of line by retailers made it rational and for the chocolate manufacturers to follow price increases initiated by a rival.
our conclusion is instead a recognition of the case summary judgment posture,where we must draw reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.at this stage,the admissible testimony from the plaintiffs experts,coupled with other record evidence suggesting that the price increases were not fully explained by cost increases,does the trick.although the chocolate manufacturers have marshaled considerable evidence in support of their positions,we must accept that the p laintiffs have presented some admissible evidence that higher prices during the period of the alleged conspiracy can not be fully explained by causes consistent with active competition in re high fructose corn syrup antitrust,cir posner.
but the plaintiffs victory on this point is a hollow one.as previously noted,given this factor purpose of identifying conduct inconsistent with a competitive market,it often restates interdependence.flat glass,at all the above indicates that the price increases were collusive,but not whether the collusion was merely interdependent or the result of an actual agreement.to prove a conspiracy here,the evidence must go beyond mere interdependence.parallel pricefixing must be so unusual that in the absence of an advance agreement,no reasonable firm would have engaged in it.baby food,at.
the plaintiffs have fallen well short of this standard.even if we credit the plaintiffs arguments,all they show is that costs which they acknowledge were increasing did not justify the price increases observed in,and.to the plaintiffs experts,the fact that cost increases could explain the price increases seems to be enough to show a agreement.see vellturo report claiming that pricing must result from an express or tacit agreement tollison report opining that price increases taken without cost increases should have been defeated because other firms would be better off not following.but evidence of a price increase disconnected from changes in costs or demand only raises the question was the anticompetitive price increase the result of lawful,rational interdependence or of an unlawful conspiracy see flat glass,at petruzzi,at i t is quite likely that oligopolists acting independently might sell at the same cost price as their competitors because the firms are interdependent and competitors would match any price cut.clamp all,at one does not need an agreement to bring about this kind of effect in a concentrated industry.the plaintiffs experts do not answer this question 
the individual plaintiffs acknowledge interdependence but persist by arguing that hershey,in particular,acted against its by following mars price increases rather than maintaining lower prices to increase its market share.for support,the individual plaintiffs point to hershey favorable cost positions in relative to its rivals as well as mars decision not to follow hershey price increase on packaged candy,a decision which led to mars increasing its market share.
deciding not to follow a price increase initiated by a rival is just one rational response that an oligopolist can take,a fact acknowledged by economists,including the individual plaintiffs economic expert,vellturo.recognizing the wide range of competitive results in oligopolistic markets phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed discussing how firms in an oligopolistic market may in some instances choose to follow price increases while in others choose not to follow.that hershey may have maintained a temporary cost advantage over its rivals did not make it irrational for hershey to follow a price increase if it believed it would ultimately be better off by doing so.indeed,the evidence is fully consistent with hershey recognizing its temporary cost advantage but also recognizing how a price increase may still be to its benefit as well as the benefit of the chocolate industry as a whole.see j.letter from hershey ceo lenny to the hershey board explaining why hershey would not initiate a price increase in the near term but also noting that hershey was prepared to follow any price increase initiated by a rival and adopting a wait and see strategy.this strategy is especially reasonable in the chocolate market given the prevalent practice of by retailers.therefore,even focusing on hershey and its cost advantages,the plaintiffs can not tell us whether hershey decision to follow the price increase was due to interdependence or an unlawful agreement.
moreover,focusing on hershey cost advantage over its rivals says nothing of mars and nestlé usa decisions to raise prices.even if hershey motivations for following the price increase were anticompetitive,unilateral anticompetitive conduct is not proscribed by of the sherman act.see intervest,at.
in sum,although there is some evidence that the chocolate manufacturers acted inconsistently with a competitive market,the evidence does not go beyond interdependence and therefore does not create an inference of a conspiracy.
traditional conspiracy evidence 
we now consider the most important plus factor in this case whether there is enough traditional conspiracy evidence to create a reasonable inference that the chocolate manufacturers conspired to fix prices.the plaintiffs identify several categories of traditional conspiracy evidence,but the most important is evidence of the contemporaneous canadian conspiracy.we therefore discuss the canadian conspiracy evidence first,followed by the plaintiffs other traditional conspiracy evidence.
the contemporaneous canadian conspiracy 
the individual plaintiffs and the direct purchaser class do not ascribe the same meaning to the canadian conspiracy evidence.according to the individual plaintiffs,it is reasonable to infer a domestic conspiracy from the evidence of a canadian conspiracy based on the fact that the canadian market is a similar adjacent market involving the same participants.the individual plaintiffs further contend that a jury should be permitted to weigh evidence of the canadian conspiracy in assessing the credibility of the chocolate manufacturers explanations for the price increases.finally,the individual plaintiffs argue,based on testimony from their economic expert,that the canadian conspiracy actuated or facilitated the conspiracy.according to vellturo actuation theory,the sharing of information between the chocolate manufacturers and their canadian counterparts led the chocolate manufacturers to observe the success of the canadian conspiracy and implement a tacit or express conspiracy.see.on appeal,the direct purchaser class distances itself from the actuation theory,arguing instead that the canadian conspiracy is relevant to assessing the chocolate manufacturers conduct because it enhances the plausibility of a domestic conspiracy.
we have not considered what inferences may be permissibly drawn from evidence of a foreign antitrust conspiracy about the existence of a domestic antitrust conspiracy.the areeda treatise guides our analysis,and we quote from it at length 
illegal behavior elsewhere in time or place does not generally allow the inference of an immediate conspiracy.if the immediately challenged behavior would not imply a conspiracy among firms that are similar to the defendants but that are not involved in a conspiracy elsewhere,then a distinct conspiracy in the past or in a different market has little power to explain the present behavior.but if there is other evidence of a present conspiracy,the defendants sins elsewhere may cast doubt on the truthfulness of their innocent explanations.
of course,the scope of a proved conspiracy will often be uncertain.it may be difficult to define the boundaries of a conspiracy proved to cover an adjacent time period,product,or region.competitors who were conspiring in this market yesterday may still be doing so today.parties who are conspiring in new york may be doing the same in new jersey.
if immediate parallelism is as likely to result from present interdependence as from proved conspiracy in the past,we should not lightly assume in fact or presume in law that the earlier conspiracy continues.contemporaneous conspiracies in adjacent geographic markets could reasonably be deemed sufficient to transfer to the defendants at least the burden of going forward with evidence of an explanation that performance is different in the second market,that any motivation for conspiracy in one market does not extend to the other,or that the personnel or other circumstances make it unreasonable to interpret the proved conspiracy as extending to the adjacent market.
areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.
the second and eleventh circuits have taken positions consistent with the areeda treatise.in in re elevator antitrust litigation,cir per curiam,the second circuit concluded that a claim of a domestic or worldwide conspiracy in the elevator and elevator services markets was unsupported by allegations of a conspiracy in the european elevator market given the absence of any evidence of linkage between the foreign and domestic conduct.without such a link,the plaintiffs argument was merely if it happened there,it could have happened here.id.at.similarly,in williamson oil philip morris usa,cir,the eleventh circuit held that a district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of contemporaneous foreign conspiracies involving cigarette manufacturers that were also charged with a domestic antitrust conspiracy.the court reasoned that without some palpable tie between these overseas activities and the manufacturers pricing actions in the united states,the foreign undertakings do not tend to exclude the possibility of independent action in the setting of domestic cigarette prices.id.at.
we are persuaded by the sensible approach articulated by the areeda treatise and inherent in the reasoning of the courts in elevator and williamson oil.a conspiracy elsewhere,without more,generally does not tend to prove a domestic conspiracy,especially when the conduct observed domestically is just as consistent with lawful interdependence as with an antitrust conspiracy.to hold otherwise would sanction the use of unabashed propensity reasoning the fallacy that if it happened there,it could have happened here to prove a domestic conspiracy using evidence of a foreign conspiracy.but if two markets are sufficiently similar or adjacent and the relevant activities therein are sufficiently linked or tied in some way,the people involved in the conspiracies are the same or overlapping,it may be reasonable to use evidence of a foreign conspiracy to support an inference of a domestic conspiracy 
based on our review of the record,we conclude that the plaintiffs have not adequately linked the canadian conspiracy to the purported conspiracy to justify using the former to support an inference of the latter.first,the people involved in the canadian conspiracy are different from those involved in the purported conspiracy.granted,mars canada and hershey canada are subsidiaries whose executives report to and receive final approval from executives on certain decisions,including pricing decisions.but the evidence does not show that any executives were involved in the canadian trade spend or conspiracies.the evidence instead shows that the conspiratorial conduct occurred in canada when canadian executives and itwal agreed to limit trade spend or raise prices in concert,not when they received final approval from executives on price changes.and as for nestlé usa,the case is stronger yet.nestlé canada is not a subsidiary of nestlé usa,and nestlé canada pricing decisions did not need nestlé usa approval.
second,although the canadian and markets are in a sense adjacent,they are not adjacent in the same way that the new york and new jersey markets are,to use the example from the areeda treatise.the canadian chocolate manufacturers are distinct legal entities operating in a different country,and their wrongdoing does not tend to show that the chocolate manufacturers engaged in similar wrongdoing in the united states.ins.brokerage,at a subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and is not liable for the actions of its parent or sister corporations simply by dint of the corporate relationship.
third,the circumstances surrounding the canadian conspiracy are markedly different from the purported conspiracy,and comparing the two reveals gaping holes in the plaintiffs proof in this case.in canada,itwal played a primary role in instigating,organizing,and facilitating the canadian conspiracy the plaintiffs here identify no similar player.in canada,the conspiracy involved concerted action on trade spend in addition to price fixing the purported conspiracy only involved price fixing.in canada,the canadian chocolate manufacturers most senior executives exchanged pricing information and agreed to fix prices,see,describing a november,telephone call between a nestlé canada executive and a hershey canada executive in which the hershey canada executive promised that hershey canada would follow a nestlé canada price increase sculthorpe of cadbury canada testifying to a meeting with leonidas of nestlé canada where leonidas said nestlé canada was raising prices and sculthorpe said cadbury canada would follow the plaintiffs here can point to hardly any communications,let alone pricing communications,among the chocolate manufacturers executives.and in canada,cadbury canada cooperation with the canadian competition bureau investigation yielded evidence of conspiratorial conduct in canada cadbury settlement with the plaintiffs here required cooperation as a condition of the settlement,but despite that cooperation,no similar evidence was uncovered in the united states.
as to the actuation theory,we reject its application here for the reasons stated by the district court the actuation theory posits that conspiratorial conduct and outcomes in canada facilitated an unlawful conspiracy.the theory therefore presumes a factual foundation,namely that the decision makers knew of the unlawful conduct in canada and their knowledge of that conduct gave them confidence to raise prices by a tacit or express agreement.see concluding that the price increases were the result of collusion either tacit or express that was actuated as a result of information and confidence collected by the chocolate manufacturers on the development,execution and conduct of conspiratorial action among their canadian operations 
and for good reason.unless there is direct or circumstantial evidence showing that the chocolate manufacturers knew of the unlawful canadian conspiracy,the chocolate manufacturers would have no basis to know whether the canadian parallel trade spend reductions and pricing were the result of a conspiracy or interdependence.if we inferred the existence of a conspiracy based on evidence that only shows that executives observed the parallel outcomes in canada but had no knowledge of the cause of those outcomes a conspiracy or interdependence,we would chill lawful conduct.we would essentially prohibit an oligopolist from recognizing its interdependence in a foreign market and applying those lessons in a domestic market,even though interdependence at home or abroad is lawful under the sherman act.if interdependence alone is not unlawful,we fail to see how evidence that effectively shows interdependence squared suddenly would create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.therefore,for the actuation theory to make a meaningful dent in the plaintiffs burden,they must show more than similar outcomes in canada and the united states they must instead show that the unlawful canadian conduct actuated,facilitated,or informed the conduct 
the district court correctly found factual support for the actuation theory lacking in this case,either in the form of the chocolate manufacturers direct participation in or knowledge of the canadian conspiracy.first,the theory finds no support in a email from humberto alfonso,a hershey executive,connecting eric lent,the new general manager of hershey canada,with schulthorpe,cadbury canada president.in the email,alfonso wrote,in keeping with the good advice from the godfather,keep close to your competition.because alfonso participated in the pricing decision,and perhaps also because he appears to have referenced the sinister words of michael corleone from the godfather part ii the direct purchaser class wants us to infer something more sinister from this social introduction that alfonso encouraged or facilitated the canadian conspiracy.but social contacts between competitors without more are not unlawful.see baby food,at.without anything else to suggest alfonso further involvement in the canadian conspiracy,and with alfonso sworn declaration that he sent the email only as a social introduction and lacked knowledge of the canadian conspiracy,see,we can not read this email as anything other than a social introduction.
nor does leonidas,ceo of nestlé canada,establish the necessary link between the canadian and markets.according to the plaintiffs,leonidas played a key role in the canadian conspiracy and regularly interacted with executives,including with nestlé usa team when nestlé considered buying hershey in.but this purported common player did not have pricing authority for the market and none of leonidas documented communications with executives hinted at illegal conduct in canada,leaving a significant gap in the inferences the plaintiffs ask us to draw to connect the two conspiracies.
a set of emails from hershey canada executives to hershey executives in the is also not enough.in,bruce brown,hershey canada general manager,emailed burt snyder,the interim president of hershey international,shortly after nestlé canada initiated a price increase.speaking of the canadian market,brown said he had some intelligence that mars is anxious to follow nestlé price increase but would rather have hershey or cadbury announce ahead of them.brown went on to call cadbury the wild card because he had heard rumors of cadbury taking a price increase but also of cadbury offering deep discounts to certain stores.id.snyder responded by approving the proposed price increase.in,brown emailed bilbrey,the president of hershey international,to say brown had heard rumours swirling around about a potential competitive price increase nestl é cadbury in canada and had it confirmed last week,although details are sketchy.and in october,following a meeting between hershey canada general manager lent and leonidas where leonidas told lent that nestlé canada would be increasing prices,an email circulated among hershey executives in the,noting that lent knows nestl é p ricing in canada,and hears following,and that cadbury canada and nestlé canada had floated price increases.the october emails,however,made no reference to the meeting between lent and leonidas.
even assuming the plaintiffs are correct that an inference could be drawn from these emails that some hershey executives in the united states were aware of the canadian conspiracy an inference better supported by some emails than others,that is all they show they say nothing about what mars and nestlé usa knew.indeed,the record is devoid of evidence showing that mars and nestlé usa knew of the canadian conspiracy even if the canadian conspiracy informed hershey unilateral actions,it could not have facilitated a conspiracy if two of the three purported conspirators including mars,the price leader in all three instances were unaware of the canadian conspiracy.
in sum,under any of the theories presented by the plaintiffs,there must be a sufficient factual basis for the canadian conspiracy to be relevant to or facilitative of the purported conspiracy.because such evidence is lacking,the contemporaneous canadian conspiracy does not support a reasonable inference of a conspiracy,and we move on to consider other traditional conspiracy evidence.
possession of advance pricing information 
the plaintiffs also highlight evidence that they argue shows that the chocolate manufacturers exchanged pricing information before they publicly announced the price increases.specifically,the plaintiffs point to an internal hershey document from reflecting that hershey knew as early as september that mars wa s considering a price increase due to rising cocoa costs,even though mars did not publicly announce a price increase until december.according to the direct purchaser class,only a small group of mars senior executives knew about the planned price increase in september,and hershey reacted by changing its internal pricing system in anticipation of a price increase,both of which,the direct purchaser class argues,support an inference that the information was more than rumor and came from mars executives.hershey insists that it did not obtain the information from mars,citing an internal pricing presentation from october stating that third party cocoa suppliers believe mars will soon take a price increase.that hershey had advance warning of mars price increase is further supported,the plaintiffs contend,by a memo from hershey ceo lenny to the hershey board stating that the mars price increase was roughly in line with expectations.
additionally,the direct purchaser class points to a hershey memo,again from lenny to the hershey board,stating that hershey received confirmation that both mars and nestl é have also raised their prices on loose bars.lenny statement came two days before nestlé usa publicly announced its price increase.according to the hershey vice president who passed the information about nestlé usa price increase on to lenny,the information came from a customer,not nestlé usa.see.
the mere possession of competitive memoranda is not evidence of concerted action to fix prices.baby food,at.in baby food,the plaintiffs also relied on the defendants possession of documents that contained competitor pricing information in advance of any public announcements.employees gathered some of the information,but the defendants provided no explanation as to how they obtained other information.still,we decided that this evidence did not support the plaintiffs conspiracy claim.id.for information that came from employees,we viewed it as less worrisome than if it had come from executives.id.at.we also insisted on proof that such information had an impact on pricing decisions.id.at.even for the advance information from unexplained sources,we noted that it makes common sense to obtain as much information as possible of the pricing policies and marketing strategies of one competitors.id.at.
in flat glass,we distinguished baby food and held that the evidence showing possession of advance pricing information supported an inference of conspiracy.the evidence in flat glass showed that the information exchanges occurred among the conspiring companies upper ranks and that the exchanges affected prices.see at citing example of a fax from one competitor to another revealing the sender planned price increase and noting that the fax recipient announced an identical price increase before the fax sender.we summarized the evidence 
h ere the exchanges of information are more tightly linked with concerted behavior and therefore they appear more purposive.several of the key documents emphasize that the relevant price increases were not economically justified or supportable,but required competitors to hold the line.others suggest not just foreknowledge of a single competitor pricing plans,but of the plans of multiple competitors.predictions of price behavior were followed by actual price changes.the inference of concerted rather than interdependent action is therefore stronger.
on the spectrum of advance pricing evidence,the plaintiff evidence here is much closer to the evidence in baby food than to the evidence in flat glass.the plaintiffs have no direct or strong circumstantial evidence that the information came from hershey competitors,much less their executives.the information is also limited to advance pricing information and,unlike in flat glass,does not reveal pricing plans dependent on others following.furthermore,the notice of nestlé usa price increase came after hershey had already announced its price increase,so it is hard to say it affected hershey pricing decision.finally,the record shows that the chocolate manufacturers pricing actions were intended to,and in some cases did,catch their rivals by surprise.see mars internal document explaining how mars leading a price increase could disrupt distracted competition hershey email from david west stating he was a ngry at him self that hershey did not anticipate mars price increase on packaged products mars email from gamgort praising mars price increase as brilliantly timed because it caught hershey and nestlé usa totally by surprise.
in sum,gathering the price information of competitors can be just as consistent with lawful interdependence as with a conspiracy.see baby food,at.the evidence summarized above does not support an inference of a conspiracy.
opportunity and improper communications 
the plaintiffs also contend that the chocolate manufacturers had opportunities to conspire during the proposed sale of hershey and at trade show meetings.the plaintiffs evidence is essentially that the executives from the chocolate manufacturers were in the same place at the same time,which is insufficient to support a reasonable inference of concerted activity.see petruzzi,at.even if we assume that nestlé usa learned of hershey commodities cost coverage during the sale process which is far from clear there is nothing to suggest that hershey and nestlé usa used the sale process to hatch a conspiracy,especially because mars,the price leader in,was uninvolved in the sale process.this evidence of mere opportunities to conspire stands in stark contrast to the evidence of secret meetings and communications in the canadian conspiracy and can not alone support an inference of a conspiracy.
relatedly,the direct purchaser class argues that there is evidence of improper communications among the chocolate manufacturers employees and that these communications support an inference of a conspiracy.the class cites a email between nestlé usa managers showing that a hershey employee had given a nestlé usa employee information about hershey pricing promotions on multipack products,a january email between two mars sales executives about a conversation with a hershey manager and information learned about hershey promotional activities,and a september email between mars executives relaying that one had obtained information about costs from his counterpart at hershey.these sporadic communications among individuals without pricing authority are insufficient to create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.see baby food,at.moreover,the september communication occurred after the price increase,so it could not have affected the relevant pricing decisions.accordingly,we will not infer a conspiracy from this evidence.
departure from conduct 
the plaintiffs argue further that the chocolate manufacturers departed from their conduct by deciding to follow price increases during the conspiracy period and that this is traditional conspiracy evidence.for a change in conduct to create an inference of a conspiracy,the shift in behavior must be a radical or abrupt change from the industry business practices.toys r us,ftc,cir.the plaintiffs have failed to show such a shift here.
first,the plaintiffs argument is not premised on an comparison.to show a shift in conduct,the plaintiffs rely on a failed september price increase on packaged candy initiated by hershey.instead of following the price increase,mars responded by reducing its weight on m m packaged candy and maintaining prices,but three months later,mars raised prices on miniatures packaged chocolate candy.the plaintiffs also cite a january proposed price increase by hershey on certain boxed chocolates that hershey rescinded when it received pushback from customers.by contrast,the and parallel price increases involved only singles and kings,and the parallel price increases involved singles and kings as well as packaged candy.in fact,the chocolate manufacturers did not exactly follow each other on packaged products in the price increases,lending further support to the notion that different considerations factored into the pricing decisions for immediate consumption products and future consumption products.putting aside the fact that mars actually responded to hershey price increase and did not simply stand pat,the failed price increases in and early involved different products at different times than the parallel price increases in,and.
second,the focus of the plaintiffs argument is unduly narrow.historically,parallel pricing in the chocolate market has not been at all uncommon.see detailing parallel pricing in and detailing a weight reduction on singles initiated by hershey and matched by mars a price increase on singles,kings,and six packs initiated by mars and matched by hershey a price increase on singles,kings,and six packs initiated by hershey and matched by mars and a price increase on singles,kings,and six packs initiated by hershey and matched by mars and nestlé usa.moreover,after the alleged conspiracy period,the chocolate manufacturers have raised prices in parallel three other times.the plaintiffs do not argue that all of these parallel price increases resulted from an unlawful conspiracy,so we fail to see why we should infer a conspiracy existed between and from behavior that is in fact consistent with how this industry has historically operated.
third,it is generally unremarkable for the pendulum in oligopolistic markets to swing from less to more interdependent and cooperative.see areeda hovenkamp,supra,at noting that the degree of interdependence may be either weak or strong and may vary from time to time within a given market.
accordingly,the evidence presented by the plaintiffs does not show an abrupt shift in behavior that can support a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.
pretextual explanations for price increases 
finally,we address the plaintiffs argument that the chocolate manufacturers pretextual explanations for their price increases support a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.see fragale sons beverage dill,cir recognizing that pretextual explanations for disputed conduct would disprove the likelihood of independent action.the chocolate manufacturers publicly explained their price increases by citing rising costs.the plaintiffs contend these explanations were cover for the real reason to advance a conspiracy.
the same evidence that we credited earlier as showing that cost increases did not justify the price increases does not necessarily show pretext,that the chocolate manufacturers lied when they gave their explanations for their price increases.the plaintiffs acknowledge that raw materials costs went up during this period they simply dispute whether the increases were enough to justify the price increases.see tollison report acknowledging that cocoa prices did rise during the class period same.nor do the plaintiffs dispute that other input costs,such as labor and energy costs,increased during this period.
moreover,contemporaneous internal documents show that some who worked for the chocolate manufacturers were concerned about cost increases during the conspiracy period.see,nestlé usa internal document suggesting budget revisions due to increased cocoa prices mars internal document proposing price increase in december in part because of emerging material cost pressures and because of belief that all the chocolate manufacturers will likely face significant cost pressures in september email from hershey david west noting organizational momentum around pricing behind commodity prices,but expressing disagreement with that organizational view citing march hershey annual report that expressed concern about cocoa costs going up in.but see,october report from hershey ceo lenny to the hershey board explaining cost coverage on cocoa through december email from hershey ceo lenny discussing how to publicly explain the price increase given hershey outspoken ness about hershey coverage on cocoa and to a lesser extent on all input costs.therefore,to the extent the plaintiffs pretext argument is that costs were going up but not enough to justify a price increase,their showing of pretext is weak.
but even if the evidence of pretext were stronger,it would still be insufficient to survive summary judgment because pretext alone does not create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.see miles,specialty constr.brands,cir w e hold that pretextual reasons are insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact without other evidence pointing to a agreement.delong equip.washington mills abrasive,cir citing fragale,at same moore drug exch.eli lilly,cir t he mere fact that a business reason advanced by a defendant for its action is undermined does not,by itself,justify the inference that the conduct was therefore the result of a conspiracy.
requiring something more than pretext to survive summary judgment makes particular sense in cases like this one.in their pretext argument,the plaintiffs rely on the same evidence they did in arguing that the chocolate manufacturers acted contrary to their which we have already said is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.that evidence is also insufficient here.that rising costs may not have been the full or even real reason for increasing prices does not show whether the real reason was interdependence or a conspiracy.therefore,allegations of pretext must be accompanied by other traditional conspiracy evidence or economic evidence to create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.because such other evidence is lacking here,any evidence of pretext is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.
summary of the evidence as a whole 
considering the evidence as a whole,the plaintiffs have failed to create a reasonable inference that the chocolate manufacturers more likely than not conspired to fix prices in the chocolate market.compared to other cases where we decided that summary judgment should not have been granted,the plaintiffs case here is relatively weak.flat glass,at reversing summary judgment for the defendants based in part on evidence about price increases that required cooperation of competitors and coordinated price increases suspiciously close in time to meetings and communications involving the conspirators petruzzi,at reversing summary judgment for the defendants based on witness testimony about a code among the defendants not to compete on existing accounts and about discussions of price fixing at trade association meetings taped conversations in which a conspirator told another company to play by the rules and economic evidence showing that the only rational explanation for the price data was an unlawful conspiracy.
evidence of a disconnected foreign conspiracy,limited possession of advance pricing information,mere opportunities to conspire without suspect meetings or conversations about pricing,conduct that is consistent with conduct,and a weak showing of pretext do not support a reasonable inference of a conspiracy.granted,we held that some of this evidence individually was insufficient without more,but taken together,the aforementioned evidence does not provide the necessary more to survive summary judgment.in short,all of this evidence is as consistent with interdependence as with a conspiracy,and as such,it does not tend to exclude the possibility that the chocolate manufacturers acted lawfully.
although our analysis does not exactly mirror the district court,we agree with the district court conclusion the evidence in this case calls for summary judgment in favor of the chocolate manufacturers.
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court summary judgment.
hershey canada is the only one of the canadian chocolate manufacturers that is a party to this appeal.
because we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for the chocolate manufacturers,we do not reach the secondary question of whether the district court abused its discretion by excluding a portion of the individual plaintiffs economic expert report calculating the damages caused by nestlé usa.

several defendants also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under rule b.after initially deferring ruling on these motions,the district court ultimately granted the motions as to mars canada,nestlé,and nestlé canada.see in re chocolate confectionary antitrust,d.

as explained earlier,we do not reach this issue because we will affirm the district court summary judgment.see supra note.
a horizontal agreement occurs when competitors on the same market level agree to fix or control prices for their goods or services.
we illustrated the point well in flat glass by comparing the theories involved in matsushita and petruzzi,see at,and we summarize that discussion here.in matsushita,the supreme court criticized the alleged,predatory pricing scheme as inherently speculative,so the court refused to draw an inference of a conspiracy from ambiguous evidence.see at.in petruzzi,by contrast,we drew more liberal inferences in the plaintiff favor because the plaintiff theory that the defendants conspired not to compete with each other on existing customer accounts made perfect economic sense.at.the only way for the defendants in petruzzi to increase profits in this manner was by agreement.moreover,this conduct of refusing to compete was obviously not procompetitive.id.
the strictures of matsushita d o not apply when plaintiffs use direct evidence to prove a conspiracy because no inferences are required from direct evidence to establish a fact,thus negating any concern about the reasonableness of the inferences drawn from that evidence.petruzzi,at.nor are these concerns implicated when there is strong circumstantial evidence because such evidence is sufficiently unambiguous.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
an oligopoly is a market in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output.phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at ed.
line pricing is the practice engaged in by retailers of setting the same retail price for competing candy products of the same size.given the practice of line pricing,the chocolate manufacturers contend that once one manufacturer raises list prices,it makes sense for all to follow.if a retailer raises the retail price on all competing candy products of a given size in response to one manufacturer raising list prices,the other manufacturers will suffer a decline in sales volume due to the higher retail price and lose out on any increased revenue unless they follow the list price increase.see see also mars document explaining it would follow hershey price increase on kings because the market would move to the higher price with or without us.
this case is quite different from petruzzi,where we said the economic evidence went a long way in meeting the plaintiff burden.at.there the alleged conspiracy was not price fixing but instead an agreement to compete only on new customer accounts and not to compete on existing customer accounts,competition ended once a defend
