in december,a grand jury in the district of maine charged michael berk with two counts of attempting to entice a minor to engage in sexual conduct and one count of possession of child pornography.berk pled guilty to the pornography charge,and he was convicted of the two child enticement charges after a bench trial.he was sentenced to months in prison.two claims are pressed on appeal.first,berk argues that the indictment was defective because it lacked an element of the crime charged.second,he argues that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to convict him.we affirm.
the facts,though disturbing,are not greatly disputed.regardless,because berk challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,we recount them in some detail,and in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states dwinells,cir.

soon after,dame received an email from the address mbmathy inquiring how old are the kids will you rent any of them out dame replied that his children young age was why he was looking for work,and that he did put them on here to do it.a few minutes later,mbmathy wrote,yeah,i did know how young so i thought i ask if you would consider making money that way thanks for the response.this exchange ensued 
dame am what do you mean rent them out 
mbmathy am well how old are they if they too young to do anything it does matter anyway 
dame am yeah they are too young for that u do mean like work and whatnot right if u have anything i will do it.
mbmathy am it depends how old are they boys or girls 
dame am have a yr old daughter and my sons are younger 
mbmathy am ok and you say you do want her doing anything for cash,only you 
dame am yeah i am looking for what i said odd jobs such as painting yard maint cutting and splitting wood etc maybe other things let me know what u have 
mbmathy am paid oral training is what i looking for,stuff along those lines.it pays a lot more than regular odd jobs but as you know it is for everyone.
dame am what is it that u are talking about 
mbmathy am it worth a lot of money to me to be able to train a girl how to give head,or anything along those lines i flexible and as long as it discreet.like i said most people would just turn an opportunity like this away and that is fine,but it not like i can just go up to people and ask.
so,i totally understand that it not what you posted for and it probably is something you willing to consider,but if you like to talk about it let me know.as i mentioned it worth a lot more than yard work.
dame am where are you located 
mbmathy am on the border.not too but it not across the state either.what do you think 
dame called the police at am.a police dispatcher had dame forward copies of the email exchange to her,sent an officer to dame house and notified a detective.the responding officer,noting the tenor of mbmathy messages,also contacted the department detective who investigated sex crimes.after taking dame statement and getting his agreement to assist,the officer directed dame to call the dispatcher,who instructed dame about how to continue the conversation.
at pm,roughly minutes after his last email to dame,mbmathy messaged,is that a no now following the direction of police,dame responded at pm am thinking about it can you give me a little more info on this mbmathy provided this detail at pm i looking for something that would happen on an basis,which would put hundreds of dollars in your pocket depending on what you could offer,availability,he also said that he could be more specific about money without knowing more details about what dame can offer.
the final email was sent at pm.the two men with dame being guided by police eventually agreed to meet at a dunkin donuts near the portland airport at pm.mbmathy told dame that he would be driving a white pontiac.dame said that he would arrive in a truck.in fact,the truck was one that was used by the maine state police for undercover work.sergeant dale york was assigned to impersonate dame,wear a recording device and drive the truck to meet mbmathy.other officers maintained visual surveillance and monitored the recording device.
shortly after york arrived at the meeting place,a black volkswagen arrived in the parking lot.although york was expecting a white pontiac,he became suspicious when the driver later determined to be berk walked by york truck several times.finally,the man approached the truck and asked york if he was waiting for a white pontiac after an exchange of introductions,berk,satisfied that he was meeting with dame,cut to the chase.he expressed his interest in having oral sex with the year old daughter,assured york that he would not hurt the girl,and said that he would cover any travel expenses.when york pressed berk for a price,berk offered per night for oral sex up to per week and added if there any more that can happen then it will be more.berk also asked how york thought his daughter is going to react to this and whether york was going to help this out.
they agreed that future contact would be by email york said that it would take about a week to lay the ground work.berk agreed with york that it was a strange position for the latter to be in,but pointed out that this is not something that i could go up and just talk to someone about.york said that he would see what she thinks.you know,if she agrees to it,if you want me to email you this weekend or if you rather have it later on.berk concluded by saying,just keep in touch.as far as i concerned the sooner the better.because,i do,i do want this to just go linger out in the middle of nowhere.i do want to be paranoid or anything.
moments later,other officers approached the truck and took berk into custody.he was taken to a local police station where he waived his miranda rights before agreeing to a videotaped interview.asked what he thought was the reason for his arrest,berk responded that it was related to his two interests paying for sex and girls under the age of.he also said that in his communication with dame,he saw somebody who needed some money i said,hey,do you have any females and as a matter of fact he had a certain female i might be interested in so i said alright,well,maybe we should talk about it he said she was twelve.a search of berk residence yielded child pornography stored on computers and external storage devices.
