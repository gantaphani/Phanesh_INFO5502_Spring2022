this is the government appeal from a district court suppression order.
the district court suppressed evidence,seized pursuant to a state court warrant,based on the defendant allegations that the affidavit by a state trooper in support of the warrant application contained material misrepresentations.in essence,defendant argued,the affidavit referred to a confidential informant who did not exist.
over the government objections that the defendant had not made the substantial preliminary showing required for a hearing under franks delaware,d,the district court convened a hearing.the court appeared to accept the defendant representations,and it rejected the government request that it consider contrary information,which the government had sought to present ex parte and in camera based on its representation that doing otherwise would endanger the informant life.without making specific findings under franks,the district court granted the motion to suppress.we reverse and remand with instructions to deny the motion to suppress.
a.the state search warrant affidavit 
on august,massachusetts state trooper pasquale russolillo submitted an application for a search warrant to a magistrate in a state district court in east boston,massachusetts.russolillo included a affidavit in support of the application.the affidavit made the following assertions 
russolillo and another state trooper knew gregory tzannos to be involved in the bookmaking business from information from past investigations coupled with intelligence from other informants as well as from the confidential informant central to this case.in early july of,russolillo and another state trooper spoke to the confidential informant.agreed to provide information to the troopers only if his identity was not revealed.
told the troopers that he was placing illegal bets on sporting events with gregory tzannos via telephone.the informant said he had placed the bets by calling the line and by speaking to tzannos directly.the officers subpoenaed the telephone company and discovered that that number belonged to tzannos and that it was unpublished.
they also discovered via subpoena that calls to the line had been forwarded to a separate number,on several days in august.this was significant because bookmakers often used call forwarding to disguise the location of their operations.the officers discovered that the second phone number,was registered to a corporation,dba american eagle purchasing agents,at winthrop street,winthrop,massachusetts.the person listed in state records as the corporation treasurer and registered agent was tzannos,who was also listed on the telephone bill.
russolillo spoke to on august and was told that had placed several wagers with tzannos over the line on august and.on august,another officer spoke to and was told that had placed another bet with tzannos that day,again on the line.troopers subsequently conducted surveillance at winthrop street and,on several separate days,observed vehicles registered to a linda wagner this was significant because had told police that tzannos had a girlfriend named linda.
the affidavit recounted that on august,and russolillo placed a controlled call to tzannos on the line.this allegation is key to tzannos later franks motion.the affidavit explained that in a controlled call,the police officer dials the number,waits until the target of the investigation answers,hands the phone to the informant,and then watches as the informant speaks to the target.told russolillo that tzannos was the person who answered the phone during the controlled call,and that tzannos proceeded to give a rundown of the day betting lines for baseball.
russolillo affidavit stated that had provided information to russolillo and other troopers in the past,and the information has proven to be reliable and true.it said the troopers had known for more than two years and that they knew his identity and address.the affidavit also gave extensive details on past cooperation,stating,for example,that had identified various bookmakers and their identities and telephone numbers,that all of the information had been corroborated by subsequent investigation,and that past information from had led to the arrest,prosecution,and conviction of three men for gaming violations.the affidavit stated that had also provided general intelligence information regarding other criminal matters,but that the affiant could not detail the particulars of these cases,because doing so would compromise the anonymity of the informant,making him susceptible to physical harm retribution.it explained that russolillo had learned that traditional organized crime families such as la cosa nostra or the mafia and other organized crime groups such as the winter hill gang in the boston area have been heavily involved in illegal gaming and bookmaking and have maintained a significant degree of control over organized bookmaking operations.
b.the state search warrant,the search,and the federal indictment 
the affidavit asserted that information,combined with the officers investigation,sufficed to create probable cause to believe that tzannos was violating state laws forbidding certain gaming activities,see.laws ch,and was doing so from the building at winthrop street.it sought a warrant to search that address.the magistrate agreed and issued the warrant.massachusetts state police executed the warrant on august,and found a fully equipped gaming office.officers seized gaming records,in cash,and tape recorders and tapes that had been used to record conversations with customers.in addition,police found and seized a loaded pistol,two loaded revolvers,a shotgun,various types of ammunition,three switchblade knives,a pair of brass knuckles,and a blowgun with needles.
on june,a federal grand jury indicted tzannos on charges of violating g,which prohibits possession of firearms by convicted felons.the indictment stated that the offense involved three to seven firearms and that tzannos possessed at least one of the firearms and at least one piece of ammunition in connection with another felony offense,to wit occupying a place for registering bets in violation of.laws ch,a massachusetts offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.
c.the franks hearing and the suppression order 
on february,tzannos asked the district court to conduct a franks hearing so that he could challenge the accuracy and truthfulness of the affidavit.in his motion papers,tzannos argued that the affidavit had to be untruthful because russolillo swore that the informant placed calls to the line on four particular days,august,and,and spoke to tzannos on each of those days,the defense identified each and every caller to that number on those days and ha d documentation to back it up,and each and every one of those callers had signed a statement denying under oath that he or she was the informant.tzannos argued that t he only logical conclusion that one could possibly reach is that there was no informant,or at least that no informant did the things described in the russolillo affidavit.thus,tzannos argued,if it were not true that the informant made calls to tzannos over the line on the four days,then it was necessarily true that no informant existed and that russolillo had lied.
tzannos motion was accompanied by an affidavit of defense counsel,which in turn was supported by several exhibits.those exhibits included some handwritten ledger sheets,which were seized during the execution of the search warrant at issue,a transcript of one of four audiocassette tapes that were also seized during the search,and signed statements from individuals that tzannos identified,from the ledger sheets,as having called to place bets with him on the four days in question.
tzannos focused his challenge on russolillo allegation that had made a controlled call to tzannos on august,on the line.defense counsel represented that the ledger sheets show that on august,only two individuals,jerry and norton,called to place bets on the line.counsel further represented that the tape is a recording of telephone calls made to the line on august,and that a transcript of that tape shows that only three people,paulie,jerry,and norton,made calls that day to the line.counsel then attached signed statements from paulie,jerry,and norton,swearing that a t no time did i cooperate with the police,nor was i a confidential informant.
in response to tzannos motion,the government argued that he had failed to meet the substantial preliminary showing that is a prerequisite to obtaining an evidentiary hearing under franks.specifically,the government argued in its reply papers that there was no evidence that the police had obtained all the tapes and written records of tzannos illegal gambling activities on the days in question that even if the police had seized every tape and record,that would not guarantee nor does tzannos clearly assert that those records reflected every transaction and phone call that occurred on those dates that there was no evidence that the tape on which tzannos heavily had no external markings other than a bates number added by the government was actually a recording of all the calls made to him on august,and on the line and that even if were mistaken about the date or phone line,that would be an error on part and not any indication of perjury by trooper russolillo.
the government also challenged the reliability of the signed statements from the bettors tzannos identified,arguing,inter alia,that the statements do not reveal the true names of the purported affiants whose names and signatures were redacted and do not indicate that those affiants were sworn before anyone authorized by law to administer oaths.even if the affidavits were genuine,the government argued,it would hardly have been surprising if had denied to tzannos that he or she had provided information to the state police.finally,the government argued that tzannos provided no reason why russolillo would have reason to lie and no explanation for how russolillo could have divined the detailed information set forth in his tzannos conceded,and the evidence uncovered during the execution of the search warrant confirmed,was did not,in fact,exist.
in reply,tzannos essentially reiterated his claim that he had identified each and every person who could possibly be and that each and every one of these people has signed an affidavit denying that is russolillo informant.he offered in further support of this claim his own conclusory affidavit,which simply asserted that the police seized every single paper and record from the third floor of my home and also seized each and every audio cassette from august,as well as all of the tape recorders i had.his affidavit also stated that he did not draft any of the papers that were submitted to the c ourt on his behalf.his reply papers were also accompanied by a second affidavit of defense counsel,which stated 
i personally drafted each and every one of those affidavits.
i listened to the tapes produced by the prosecution.the vast majority of the tapes are blank.as for the tapes that do contain recordings,i,with assistance from tzannos,was able to determine the dates of each tape by comparing the conversations on the tapes to the documents that were seized.
i was able to determine which tapes recorded incoming calls on particular telephone numbers because the affidavits state which people called each number.for example,i know from the affidavits which people called 
neither tzannos affidavit nor that of his counsel stated that the records and tapes that were seized reflected every transaction and phone call that occurred on the four days in question.
after discussion with the parties at a status conference on july,the district court granted tzannos motion for a franks hearing.the court did not articulate its reasons for granting the hearing and did not make any specific findings of fact at this time 
in a memorandum filed on september,the government renewed its objection to the franks hearing.it reiterated its earlier argument that there was no evidence that russolillo had lied.it also explained that it could not divulge the identity of publicly because doing so would endanger the informant life.it represented that it was not authorized to disclose the informant name without permission from the department of justice or the state attorney general.the government offered instead to prove the veracity of russolillo affidavit and the existence of in an ex parte,in camera proceeding,in which it would offer,inter alia,testimony of russolillo revealing the identity of.
in reply,tzannos agreed to an in camera proceeding,but objected to the court allowing such a proceeding to take place ex parte.tzannos also requested that the franks hearing be structured as a full evidentiary hearing,in which defense counsel would have the opportunity to cross examine the very affiant whose allegations are at issue.finally,tzannos stated that it was his intention to show at the hearing,inter alia,that as a matter of practice,he recorded each and every incoming call,and that a fter a week books were settled,he would erase the tapes and record over them.
the district court convened the franks hearing on september.at the start of the hearing,the district court announced a procedure that neither party had proposed 
a ccording to the defendant proffer of evidence,there are three people who spoke to tzannos on august,paulie,jerry,and norton.so paulie,jerry,and norton at the worst come in and testify that they are not the confidential informant.and i do have to hear from anybody claiming to be the confidential informant.
and if it turns out that i think that the controlled call was not made to the line on august,i can determine that there is no basis for whatever exists and allow a motion to suppress,without violating the identity of the confidential informant.
tzannos made no objections to the procedure indeed,he indicated that the three individuals had already been summoned and that they were outside the courtroom at that moment and ready to testify.the government,however,was far less enthusiastic.it raised two main objections to the procedure.first,it argued that the procedure placed it in a double bind if one of the three individuals were,in fact,but testified on the stand to the contrary,the government would be placed in a position where it would be forced either to knowingly elicit and condone perjurious testimony or to out an informant and expose him or her to mortal danger.as a corollary of that argument,the government also noted that if one of the three is the informant and tells the truth,then the court is eliciting a statement that may get the person killed,which is not a procedure that the government is prepared to participate in.second,the government argued that there was a fundamental flaw in the procedure,which it could not explain in open court without providing information that would necessarily divulge identity,but which it could explain in one sentence ex parte and in camera.the government stressed that the court would not come out with the truthful and just result if the court follow ed the procedure that the court outlined.
the court refused to hear the government explanation ex parte and in camera.it also refused the government original proposal,which was to provide to the court evidence of the existence and identity of the informant ex parte and in camera.the court stated that t here are two things i do want one,i do want to do an ex parte hearing,and two,i do want to know who the confidential informant is.it also explained 
there is nothing absolute about the confidential informant and confidentiality.i mean,it has to be weighed under all the circumstances.
i think my suggest ed procedure is a good one.i do even want to know who the confidential informant is.
i just want to know are these three people going to take the stand and say they are not.and if they take the stand and say they are not,then that is the end of it.i am not going to say who is it.
the court went further.it stated 
i f it turns out that the defendant puts three people on the stand and the tapes verify that only these three people made phone calls and that it,and none of the three is the confidential informant,that is it as far as i am concerned.i do have to hear any more.i will allow the motion to suppress.
to the government argument that t he issue here is not whether the confidential informant gave somewhat incorrect or incomplete or any other degree of defective evidence but whether trooper russolillo lied under oath,the court stated i do think i have to find that he lied.i can find that none of those three people is the confidential informant and that no other calls were made that day and that,therefore,there is no basis for whatever it was and then i am going to suppress it.
unwilling to go along with the court proposed procedure,the government submitted a written request that the court reconsider its rejection of the government request to proceed ex parte and in camera.in the alternative,the government requested that the court enter an order suppressing the fruits of the search so that the procedure could be appealed.
tzannos objected and sought to question the three individuals,whom he identified as jerry ahearn,paulie destefano,and joseph mcparland.in the ensuing colloquy,the court said that it was willing to allow the three individuals to testify,in part so that a record could be created for the appeal.the government again objected,stating that it could not the three individuals.it then agreed to stipulate that if the three individuals were called to testify,they would each testify that he had called tzannos on august,and that he had never been a confidential informant or made a controlled call for russolillo.the government emphasized,however,that it was making this stipulation with the understanding that for the reasons previously explained the government can not these individuals to bring out the truth,and that the government is not conceding the truth.the court then suppressed the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant.
we bypass the question of whether tzannos made the substantial preliminary showing necessary to invoke a franks hearing.franks,at.instead,we review de novo the district court ultimate decision to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant at issue united states dessesaure,cir.we also evaluate,for abuse of discretion,the procedure the district court used at the franks hearing and the district court refusal to hear,ex parte and in camera,the government explanation of why that procedure was flawed.united states valerio,cir noting that it is entirely within the discretion of the judge presented with the request to decide whether the disclosure of a confidential informant identity is necessary in order to determine the believability of the testifying officer,and reviewing for abuse of discretion the trial judge refusal to allow an in camera hearing to probe the identity of the informant.as always,factual findings made by a district court in connection with a franks hearing are reviewed for clear error.id.
a.the suppression order 
there is a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant.franks,at.for this reason,a defendant must meet a high bar even to get a franks hearing in the first place.in order for a warrant to be voided and the fruits of the search excluded,the defendant must meet an even more exacting standard he must show that the affiant in fact made a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,make this showing by a preponderance of the evidence,and show in addition that with the affidavit false material set to one side,the affidavit remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.id.at.
our analysis turns on the first two factors we do not reach the third.
the alleged falsehood in the affidavit is that trooper russolillo fabricated the existence of a confidential informant.that russolillo made the false statement knowingly and intelligently is shown,defendant says,by his having stated that he was present at the controlled call made by to tzannos on august,to the line.
the district court decision to suppress the fruits of the search would be proper only if it found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that tzannos proved three assertions.first,tzannos must show that only paulie,jerry,and norton made calls to tzannos on the line on august,and that therefore had to be one of the three.to do so,he must show that the audiocassette tape on which he relied was a recording of calls made to him on the line,that the recording was of calls made on august,that all calls made to the line on august were in fact recorded on that tape,and that the transcript entered into evidence was accurate and complete.second,even if each of these assertions were proven,it does not follow that does not exist tzannos still must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that each of the three individuals is telling the truth in denying being and,further,that the real did not provide misinformation,whether inadvertently or purposefully,to russolillo.third and ultimately,tzannos must show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that trooper russolillo made a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth.
we begin with the first of the three assertions tzannos must prove.tzannos did not show that the tape on which he relied was actually of calls made to the line on august.the tape itself was unmarked,and nothing in the transcript supplied by tzannos identifies what number the callers dialed or on what date they called.the only proffer tzannos made relating the three conversations he transcribed off of that tape to the particular line and date of the controlled call were his own affidavit,two affidavits of counsel,and their accompanying exhibits.counsel second affidavit stated that,with tzannos help,counsel determined the date of the tape by comparing the recorded conversations to the ledgers that were seized,and determined the line on which those conversations had taken place by looking to the signed statements she solicited from the bettors.nothing in the record establishes that the bettors statements were truthful or accurate,or that the seized documents completely and accurately recorded all transactions.indeed,what tzannos asserted is the ledger from august stated only that jerry and norton called to place bets it made no reference to paulie or to individuals who called to discuss betting lines without placing a bet.
further,tzannos has failed to show that he recorded every call,on every line,and on every date as a matter of course,that the four tapes identified in his counsel affidavit contained every call to the line that tzannos recorded on august,and that the one transcript tzannos provided of calls allegedly made on august to the line was complete and accurate.indeed,while tzannos stated in his memorandum that he would prove at the franks hearing that he routinely taped every incoming call,he never made that showing.
tzannos largely disproved his own argument.he admitted in that same memorandum that after a week books were settled,it was his practice to erase the tapes and to record over them.he did not say on which day of the week he did so,or whether the practice was irregular.most of the tapes seized during the search were blank or unintelligible,tending to disprove his assertion that the tapes are accurate evidence of the calls he received he did not show that the tapes contained each and every call made to him on the four dates in question,let alone on august.in fact,defense counsel affidavit made reference to three other tapes,allegedly of incoming calls made by a number of other callers on several days,including august.tzannos did not provide transcripts of any of these other tapes.
nor did he prove the accuracy of the one transcript he did provide.the transcript itself appears to end,thus suggesting that either the transcript was incomplete or that the tape stopped recording in the middle of a call.these inconsistencies substantially undercut tzannos showing.
the district court did not make any explicit findings of fact at the franks hearing.nonetheless,it must implicitly have found that tzannos evidence was sufficient to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that only paulie,jerry,and norton made calls to tzannos on the line on august.given the s
