a jury convicted serge bayard of use of an unauthorized access device,a,and aggravated identity theft.on appeal he presses a litany of challenges,some counseled and others pro se,for the purpose of obtaining a new trial.we affirm his conviction.
background 
a friendship blossomed between bayard and dorothy shovan,an elderly widow more than thirty years his senior,shortly after the death of her husband.a few years later,bayard moved into shovan home in exchange for room and board,bayard helped her around the house.bayard responsibilities increased over time.by,he was shovan driver,repairman,grocery shopper and,as her health waned,caretaker.some of these tasks required monetary outlays and,although the precise nature of their financial arrangement is unclear,it appears that bayard used her credit cards.one of those credit cards a bank of america visa card the bofa card is at the center of this case.
on july,after several months of hospitalization and severe dementia,shovan died.at some point in august,bank of america unaware of shovan demise the bofa card,which was scheduled to expire around that time.bayard,who was still living in shovan home,intercepted the bofa card and used it to make several purchases at a wal mart store totaling about.that same day,he used the account number on the bofa card to book a trip to a resort in new zealand.in correspondence,bayard told a resort representative that he wanted to using a credit card that belonged to his cousin,who bayard identified in a subsequent as shovan.the representative agreed and charged shovan account nearly.two weeks later,bayard left for new zealand.an attorney for shovan estate later discovered the curious account activity,cancelled the bofa card,and notified authorities.
in early,shortly after he returned from abroad,bayard was arrested in connection with charges that do not pertain to this appeal.on april,while bayard was detained and awaiting trial in state court,the government filed a criminal complaint against him in federal court.a indictment,handed up on april,charged him with use of an unauthorized access device,a and aggravated identity theft,on august,bayard was released from state custody.the next day he was arraigned in federal court,pled not guilty,and waived his right to counsel.
a jury trial began in october.bayard represented himself for most of it,but midway through the second day his counsel stepped in at bayard request.the focal point of trial was bayard authorization vel non to use the bofa card after shovan death.the government elicited testimony that shovan was the only authorized user on the account bayard had no power of attorney over shovan financial affairs and even if she had informally authorized bayard to use the bofa card,that authorization was only for her benefit and expired upon her death.bayard testified that shovan specifically authorized him to use the bofa card as well as her other credit cards,not only for her benefit but also for his.he further testified that shovan had bequeathed to him,and that the transactions at issue were,in his view,advances on money owed.after an afternoon of deliberation,the jury convicted bayard on both counts in the indictment.the court sentenced him to three years in prison this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we address each of bayard seven arguments in turn,adding background as necessary.
a.the morgan chase card 
before trial,the government moved in limine to admit evidence in its concerning a morgan chase credit card the chase card.bayard applied for the chase card in shovan name on june,when she was incapacitated,and as with the bofa card used it after her death.according to the government,that evidence was probative of bayard intent and absence of mistake concerning his use of the bofa card.the district court denied the government motion on the grounds that bayard conduct in connection with the chase card was propensity evidence,see.b,and that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice,see.the court,however,left open the possibility that such evidence might be admissible later on for some other purpose.
during trial,bayard took the stand and testified that shovan specifically authorized him to use her credit cards.on,the government began to question bayard about the chase card.that prompted bayard counsel,who by this time had stepped in,to request a sidebar conference.there he objected on rule b grounds.the government responded that,although the court previously had denied its motion in limine on that basis,a limited line of questioning on was permissible under federal rule of evidence b,because it sought only to impeach bayard credibility.the court agreed with the government,adding that in this context the value of the government proposed inquiry outweighed any possible prejudice that might result.bayard declined a limiting instruction and the sidebar concluded.the government then continued with.
on appeal,bayard repeats his objection that any testimony about the chase card violated rule b.his refrain is misguided.by its very terms,rule b prohibits the admission of a prior bad act to prove the character of a person in order to show conformity therewith.see,united states landry,cir rule b prohibits the admission of prior bad acts to establish an individual character or propensity to commit a crime.but here the government sought to bayard for the limited purpose of attacking his character for truthfulness.that is a different purpose that invokes a different rule.compare.b,with.b.see generally united states simonelli,cir discussing interplay between rules and explaining that the latter is centrally concerned with character for veracity,a mode of accrediting or discrediting the witness that is based on the same propensity reasoning of rule but is subject to quite different rules.quoting united states cudlitz,cir internal brackets omitted.
whether bayard actions in connection with the chase card were fair game under rule b is a separate question.the government says that such questions are left to the discretion of the trial court a proposition that may be correct but not necessarily dispositive here.bayard says nothing at all.although the applicability of rule b to this line of questioning is less than clear,bayard failure to brief the issue waives it.united states zannino,cir.
that leaves us with rule balancing test,which bayard does make some attempt to address in his brief.rule states that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of issues,or misleading the jury.we have characterized rule judgments as battlefield determinations subject to great deference.united states shinderman,cir.only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.id.quoting freeman package mach,cir.
we discern no abuse of discretion here.bayard does not adequately explain why his conduct surrounding the chase card was not probative of his credibility,so we assume without deciding that it was.he does argue that the risk of unfair prejudice was high,but we disagree.our review of the government reveals that it was far from inflammatory.it was also quite short and limited in scope to what the government had proposed at the sidebar.and,as noted,bayard declined the district court offer to give a limiting instruction.see shinderman,at furthermore,the court offered to give a limiting instruction that the defendant eschewed this course does not minimize the value of the court offer.given these circumstances,we are reluctant to the district court judgment in allowing to proceed.
b.the citibank mastercard 
during its,the government called jeffrey ramos,a custodian of records for bank of america.among other things,ramos authenticated account statements provided by bank of america that reflected charges to the bofa card.two of those charges,in addition to those described earlier,were balance transfers from a citibank mastercard the citibank card,which was yet another of shovan credit cards that bayard apparently used after her death.on direct examination,the government asked ramos a series of questions concerning those transfers.based on certain questions bayard posed on cross,the government sought on to clarify ramos testimony by referencing a corresponding set of account statements provided by citibank.
bayard objected on the basis that he never received copies of the citibank records.the government explained that bayard had received copies and that they had been marked as an exhibit,although the exhibit was not yet in evidence.the trial judge voiced his concern over questioning ramos about an exhibit that was not in evidence and that he could not authenticate.the government ultimately proposed to introduce the citibank records by means of a certification,and then conduct its examination of ramos.the court then admitted the citibank records over bayard relevancy objection.
on appeal,bayard argues that the prosecutor questions on concerning the citibank card amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.according to bayard,the prosecutor testified through his questions that there was another card which was allegedly obtained through improper means.bayard did not object on that ground at trial,so our review is for plain error.united states.sánchez berríos,cir.
we see no error,plain or otherwise.bayard does not identify in his brief the specific questions that he challenges,but our independent review of the trial transcript satisfies us that his hypothesis is unfounded.none of the prosecutor questions on gives us pause,let alone rises to the level where,in rare cases,we have ordered a new trial.see,united states hardy,cir vacating conviction where the prosecutor drew an analogy between the defendant running and hiding from police on the night of the crime,and running and hiding again at trial by invoking fifth amendment right not to testify united states manning,cir vacating conviction where the prosecutor suggested that government witnesses can not lie and urged jury to t ake responsibility for your community by convicting the defendant united states arrieta agressot,cir vacating convictions where the prosecutor urged the jury to consider case as a battle in war against drugs,and the defendants as enemy soldiers corrupting our society.
separately,bayard hints in his brief that the prosecutor questions provided an improper shortcut for the admission of the citibank records.if that cryptic remark is meant to challenge the admission of the citibank records,presumably on rule b grounds,the argument is woefully underdeveloped,and thus waived.zannino,at.even if it were not waived,bayard failure to object on that ground below would subject the argument to plain error review,and under that standard it would certainly fail.see sánchez berríos,at u nder plain error review,we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors.
c.the jury instructions 
during the charge conference,there was considerable debate as to the identity of the access device in this case.the government,pointing to the broad statutory definition of access device,said that it was the plastic bofa card itself either the expired or version,the account number embossed on the plastic,and the bank of america account to which the card was linked.see e bayard counsel took a much narrower view.he argued that the government must show that bayard used an unauthorized access device,id.a emphasis supplied,which is an access device that was lost,stolen,expired,revoked,cancelled,or obtained with intent to defraud,id.e.according to him,evidence adduced at trial established that shovan authorized bayard to use the by then expired bofa card,along with its number and associated account,both of which remained unchanged since the time bayard was authorized to use them.thus,he posited that the only access device that the government could argue was unauthorized was the plastic bofa card,on the theory that it was stolen or fraudulently obtained when bayard intercepted it in august 
the court agreed with bayard that,under the rather unique circumstances of this case,only the plastic bofa card and not its account or account number was arguably unauthorized.based on that understanding,the court delivered the following instruction over the government objection 
the term access device means any card,plate,code,account number,or other means of account access that can be used alone or in conjunction with another access device to obtain money,goods,services or any other thing of value,or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds other than a transfer originated solely by paper instrument.in this case,the access device alleged to be unauthorized is the credit card issued in august of ending in account number supplied.
the term unauthorized access device includes any credit card that was either stolen or obtained with the intent to defraud.in this case the government claims that the defendant stole obtained with the intent to defraud the bank of america visa card,last four digits supplied,that had been issued to dorothy shovan.accordingly,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that the defendant stole that credit card or that he obtained it with the intent to defraud 
having gotten what he requested,bayard now assails the court instruction as confusing.in particular,he argues that listing account number as among the possible access devices created a serious risk that the jury would be confused as to whether an account number satisfied the statute.because bayard failed to object to the instruction as delivered,we review for plain error,ji bose,cir,and quickly dispatch his plaint.we see no likelihood of juror confusion,given the court clear and repeated statements that the access device here was the plastic bofa card.the phrase account number appears only in a list of what access devices could be in general.the court was free to include that list,which closely tracked the statute,for context.united states alicea,cir.
remaining arguments 
we briefly address bayard four remaining claims raised in his supplemental pro se brief,and reject the lot.
bayard argues that the district court should have dismissed the case on speedy trial grounds,because days elapsed between the return date of the indictment and when he moved for dismissal.but the critical date,for purposes of the speedy trial act,was august,the day after he was arraigned in federal court see c t rial shall commence within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment,or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge in pending,whichever date last occurs.emphasis supplied see also united states muñoz amado,cir rejecting argument in similar circumstances.the period between that date and the start of bayard trial in october was well under seventy days.
next,he asserts that the court denied his requests to subpoena four individuals,in violation of the sixth amendment.see.b.not true.the transcript from the ex parte hearing in which bayard sought subpoenas reveals that he withdrew his requests for three of those four individuals the judge took under advisement bayard request for the remaining individual tania booth,the new zealand resort representative although it appears that the court never ruled on that particular request.but at no point thereafter did bayard ask the trial judge for an ruling,so the issue has been waived.desrosiers moran,cir.in any event,because bayard correspondence with booth was admitted into the record,her testimony likely would have been cumulative.
third,bayard critiques the timing of the district court ruling that precluded the government from using a prior conviction.according to bayard,by waiting until the last day of trial to issue its ruling the court interfered with his tactical decisions,including his decision to proceed pro se.if the court had ruled earlier,bayard contends,he would have retained counsel for the entire trial.we think not.bayard never indicated below,in extensive discussions on the matter,that his decision to proceed pro se hinged on an evidentiary rulin
