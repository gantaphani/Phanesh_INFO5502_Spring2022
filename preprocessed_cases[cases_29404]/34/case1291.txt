opinion of the court 
frederick schiff and richard lane were corporate executives at the pharmaceutical giant squibb bristol.they were criminally indicted for allegedly orchestrating a massive securities fraud scheme related to bristol wholesale pharmaceutical distribution channels in the early,in violation of,inter alia,b and securities and exchange commission sec rule.the government filed this interlocutory appeal in response to the district court march,opinion that addressed several contested theories of liability as well as expert witness issues under daubert merrell dow,d on appeal are two issues whether the district court properly dismissed the government theories of omission liability under rule that attempted to hold schiff accountable for omissions in quarterly sec filings based on his and lane alleged misstatements in bristol quarterly conference calls and whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding the government expert,following a daubert hearing,who would have testified to bristol stock price drop as evidence of rule materiality element.because we agree that the government omission liability theories are not viable,we affirm the district court dismissal of these theories.as to the expert testimony,we conclude that the district court ruling excluding the government materiality expert was not an abuse of discretion.
background 
the criminal charges against the defendants stem from the government allegations that schiff and lane statements to the investing public,in,among other things,public analyst conference calls and alleged omissions in sec filings were misleading.bristol is a public corporation and leading manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and health care products.schiff was promoted to bristol chief financial officer cfo from controller in april.he left the company in.as cfo,he had primary responsibility for bristol sec filings and signed those filings.lane was president of bristol worldwide medicines group,and left the company in.both schiff and lane represented bristol on quarterly public conference calls with wall street analysts.
bristol primary sales and distribution channel for its pharmaceutical products is through wholesalers,who,in turn,supply pharmacies,hospitals,and other health care providers.the wholesalers buy and maintain an inventory,typically based on projected prescription demand,customers demand for the products.they generally try to target their purchases to this demand projection,and not in excess of it,because more inventory results in higher carrying costs.if wholesalers purchase in excess of demand,it also affects bristol by reducing the company later sales while its wholesalers work down excess inventory to normal demand levels before purchasing more product.
from through,bristol implemented a sales strategy that underlays this case.the company gave its wholesalers financial incentives,amounting to tens of millions of dollars each quarter,purportedly to spur them to buy its products in excess of prescription demand projections.for example,in august schiff and lane approved million in sales incentives for the third quarter,and in november lane approved million in sales incentives for the fourth quarter.these incentives allegedly covered the wholesalers carrying costs and guaranteed return on their investment until they sold the products.the government characterizes this as a deceptive strategy to increase sales and earnings in the short term to meet bristol aggressive sales and earnings targets and,in turn,artificially inflate the stock price 
to conceal these practices from bristol shareholders and potential investors,schiff and lane allegedly made materially false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact in analyst conference calls,press releases,and meetings with investors.gov t br.at.the analyst calls are pertinent to the government omission liability theories that are a part of this appeal.the first analyst call schiff participated in was on april,after he was promoted to cfo whereas lane was involved in analyst calls dating back to.a sampling of the actionable statements made by schiff and lane in analyst calls include

schiff we do see any significant changes in the prior call statements that inventory levels are slightly higher and would be reduced by the end of the year app.outside of quarterly call cycle,schiff and lane on call.
on april,bristol issued its for the fiscal year.the report discussed,among other things,excess inventory levels held by wholesalers 
t he company believes average wholesaler inventories of products in the increased during by approximately four weeks of additional sales.the company believes current inventories of its products held by wholesalers in the significantly exceed levels the company considers desirable on a basis.the company is in the process of developing a plan to reduce these wholesaler inventory levels.the company expects this reduction in wholesaler inventories to lower levels will negatively impact its financial results in future periods.the company will make further disclosure later in april about the plans it is developing to reduce wholesaler inventory levels and the company expectations with respect to the likely impact on its financial results.
app.on the next trading day,the stock price dropped,from to.
on april,at the close of the trading day,bristol made an additional announcement in an analyst outside of the quarterly cycle and a press release.bristol ceo peter dolan announced 
rick lane will be leaving the company.
we estimated that current wholesaler inventory levels significantly exceed the level that we consider desirable.as a result of my review,we moving as aggressively as possible to reduce shipments to wholesalers,so that wholesaler inventory levels will be more consistent with demand.we estimate that this action will reduce earnings per share by approximately to cents over the full time period of the reduction process.
now,let me move to the full year.before the impact of reductions in wholesaler inventories and any items,we estimate the full year earnings per share to be down between and.we expect sales to decline in the low range.that a primary driver,as our previous guidance expected sales to increase in the mid to upper range.
w e identified several products in primary care that will not meet our sales estimates.our original guidance to you for the glucophage franchise,for example,was to billion for the year.our analysis launch shows the franchise will not meet those estimates.and in particular,sales for glucophage ir will decline more than of sales.
additionally,based on our modeling,sales for avandia,serzone,and tequin will not meet our original estimates and likely decline in as compared to sales in.
o n timing of inventory,our intention is to work it down as aggressively as we possibly can over as rapid a timetable as feasible.as you know,we do own that wholesaler inventory.
schiff on excess inventory numbers t hat around million to billion we will work,as we say,as aggressively as possible to reduce the inventory.and in order to do that,we have to slow down our shipments to the wholesalers.
schiff glucophage,avandia,serzone,the key products that are lower that really make up that revenue reduction.that revenue that we seeing is causing the result to get to to lower.
app.dolan also indicated that the prior sales estimates were dramatically off track.on the next trading day,april,bristol stock price dropped,from to.
on april,bristol had its first quarter analyst call.it discussed,among other things,the inventory issue and loss of exclusivity on certain products from generic competition.on april,the stock price dropped,from to.
procedural history 
the pretrial history in this case is long and complex,but it is important to wade through it because of waiver issues raised by schiff on appeal in june,a grand jury returned a indictment against schiff and lane,charging them with conspiracy to commit securities fraud,in violation of,contrary to b section b of the securities exchange act of ff penalties and sec rule a c and securities fraud,principally in violation of rule,and aiding and abetting in violation of.
the first indictment was dismissed because of a grand jury leak.a second indictment was returned in may.thereafter,in april the current indictment,labeled third superseding indictment,was returned on the same two counts.this indictment omitted all allegations concerning accounting improprieties in bristol sec filings,the government removed references to alleged corporate reserve manipulations and violations of generally accepted accounting principles in sec filings.in november,the district court severed schiff and lane trials.schiff agreed to be tried first,and is the appellee before us.
through multiple letters,briefs,amendments,stipulations,hearings,and court opinions during pretrial proceedings,the indictment and predicate legal theories were narrowed and sharpened.see united states schiff,d,explaining that because of the constraints in the stipulation,the government could not premise omission liability on the falsity of reported sales and earnings,nor could it rest on the mere recitation of the sec filings numbers on the analyst calls,because that is essentially the same as the sec figures themselves.for example,the government filed a bill of particulars on november,listing the statements it intended to identify as false and attribute to schiff and lane.these were statements made in analyst calls,and none was from sec filings.the bill of particulars expressly stated that the sec filings contain ed omissions of material fact and not affirmative misleading statements.additionally,in a january conference call with the court and the defendants,the government confirmed that it was not relying on a statutory duty as a theory of omission liability under rule.
schiff and lane filed motions to dismiss portions of the indictment on february,the district court held a hearing on several pending motions,including the motions to dismiss.at the hearing,the court ruled that it was denying the theory of fiduciary duty as a basis for omission liability on march,it conducted a daubert hearing on expert issues.
the district court march,opinion the opinion covered much ground.schiff,d.pertinent to this appeal,it dealt with the government omission theories of liability and the daubert expert issue on the rule element of materiality which we will address separately in the daubert section below.the court explained that,despite its ruling dismissing several theories of liability,the case will still go forward on legal theories related to alleged conspiracy,misstatements and omissions on analyst calls and misstatements listed under the heading other in the bill of particulars,practice liability under rule a and c,and aiding and abetting violations of section b.id.at.
it examined whether schiff had a duty to speak in the sec filings under rule b.see id.absent a duty to speak,there is no omission to speak liability.it dismissed theories of omission and criticized the government for shifting and adding to its theories of the charges the court will permit no further legal theory morphs in this case,which has been awaiting trial for several years.id.at.
the government last theory of omission liability for schiff own statements was raised for the first time at the february,hearing,approximately one month before schiff trial was to begin.id.under this new theory,schiff liability for omissions to state in the sec filings stemmed from prior misleading statements of both schiff and lane on analyst calls,linking alleged misstatements on analyst calls to alleged omissions to state in the sec filings as all of a piece.id.the court reiterated that the government can not premise omissions in sec filing s upon any misstatement s in the sec filing s because it has not alleged any misstatement s in those filings id.at emphasis in original.thus,omission liability must be predicated on other prior statements.id.in this context,the court also remarked that the government was not alleging a theory based on a duty to correct.id.at.
ii.standard of review 
we exercise a plenary review standard over legal questions,and review factual findings for clear error.united states scott,cir see also united states delaurentis,cir.we review a district court decision to exclude expert testimony under an standard.pineda ford motor,cir.an abuse of discretion arises when the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact,but to the extent that the district court decision involved a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,our review is plenary.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
iii.omission liability theories under rule 
a district court may grant a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment,or a portion thereof,if the indictment allegations do not suffice to charge an offense.united states panarella,cir.in this case,we treat the dismissal of legal theories proffered by the government,and the district court subsequent preclusion from presenting those theories at trial,as dismissal of part of the indictment.rule b is the relevant legal grounding in this appeal.it states in pertinent part it is unlawful b t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
throughout the pretrial proceedings,and even in this appeal,the government has engaged in a game of musical chairs with their pursuit of changing legal theories under rule.the district court initially afforded the government substantial leeway in developing and settling on its legal theories of liability.however,in the court opinion it put an end to these shifting bases.it stated that it would permit no further legal theory morphs by the government.see schiff,d at internal quotations omitted.
early on,the government amended the indictment and entered into a stipulation,eliminating all allegations related to misstatements in bristol sec filings.since then,its introduction of new legal theories appears designed to find creative ways to hold schiff and lane liable for those sec filings.because the government has stipulated that there are no affirmative misstatements in the four corners of the sec documents,it has attempted to bring these filings back into the case against the defendants through theories of omission liability.as noted below,we conclude that the omission liability theories being appealed are either waived or not legally viable as federal crimes.
despite this,the government is not flying blind into schiff trial.as the district court stated,and the government acknowledged at oral argument,it can pursue directly the alleged misstatements and omissions on analyst calls under rule,as well as conspiracy,scheme,and aiding and abetting legal theories,against schiff and later lane at trial.see id.at.
statements of others 
the first issue we address is the viability of the government legal theory that schiff had a fiduciary duty to rectify lane allegedly material misstatements on analyst calls in subsequent sec filings if such a duty exists,then the resulting omissions in sec filings would be actionable.at oral argument,the government characterized this as a theory if schiff contends at trial that lane did not have the proper mens rea for aiding and abetting liability.the district court concluded that this is not a viable theory,and we agree.
absent a duty to disclose,silence is not fraudulent or misleading under rule.basic levinson,d see also in re burlington coat factory sec,cir except for specific periodic reporting requirements,there is no general duty on the part of a company to provide the public with all material information.when you speak,however,and it is material,you are bound to speak truthfully.shapiro ujb fin,cir.we explained in oran that a duty to disclose under rule may arise in three circumstances when there is insider trading,a statute requiring disclosure,or an inaccurate,incomplete or misleading prior disclosure.at citations omitted.to support this proposition,the oran court cited to i a first circuit court of appeals en banc opinion,backman polaroid,cir en banc,explaining that a duty to disclose arises in the same three circumstances listed in oran,ii a second circuit court of appeals opinion,glazer formica,cir,noting that,absent the same three circumstances,there is no duty to speak,and iii a district of delaware court opinion,in re general motors class e stock buyout sec.oran,at.
the government argues that schiff duty to disclose in the sec filings derives from a general fiduciary obligation of high corporate executives to the company shareholders,which it concedes is not one of the three circumstances described in oran.it contends that oran did not create an exhaustive list of duties in the securities context,and that this fiduciary duty qualifies as a fourth circumstance.
this argument reaches too far.it is not supported by the language of b and rule,and potentially has broad implications that call into question whether the result the government advocates for advances the ball in this complicated area.
moreover,in winer family trust queen,we explained that the list describing the derivation of a duty to disclose in oran is exclusive,cir an affirmative duty arises only when one of oran three prongs are triggered emphasis added see also city of monroe bridgestone,cir noting a duty to affirmatively disclose may arise in these same three circumstances internal quotations omitted.the government cites to the language in winer directly preceding the list,which states that,a s a general matter,an affirmative duty arises only when there is insider trading,a statute requiring disclosure,or an inaccurate,incomplete,or misleading disclosure.at.this infers,its argument continues,that the court did not intend exclusivity.we disagree,as we do not interpret winer prefatory language to signal a lack of exclusivity,particularly with the court use of the word only.rather,the court used the general matter phrase as an introduction to its discussion of why the defendants had no disclosure duty under any of those circumstances.
the government legal support for its fiduciary duty theory is also weak.it cites to a fifth circuit court of appeals case,barrie,cir,modifying opinion on denial of rhr g in cir,and a district court case on which barrie relied,in re smartalk teleservices,d.the barrie court stated 
where it is pled that one defendant knowingly uttered a false statement and the other defendant knowingly failed to correct it,the fraud is sufficiently pleaded as to each defendant,which accords with common sense and the policy considerations underlying the heightened pleading requirements accordingly,both defendants hammond and graham are on fair notice of the claims against them.
at citing smartalk,d at.barrie dealt only with the heightened notice pleading standard for fraud in a civil case under the private securities litigation reform act pslra,stat.codified in scattered sections of,concluding that sufficient facts were pled with particularity in the complaint to put the alleged speakers on notice of the statements attributed to them.smartalk,d at.it did not address or discuss the actual viability of the legal theory.it never mentioned how or when such a duty to disclose based on statements of another arises,or whether rule contemplates a duty to speak in such a circumstance based on fiduciary obligations and the government conceded as much at oral argument.the same is true of smartalk,d at in fact,we could find no case that discussed or validated the legal viability of such a theory on fiduciary grounds 
moreover,such a generalized corporate fiduciary duty has few logical boundaries.what would the limiting principle be if we imposed this duty on corporations and its employees the government attempts to cabin this duty to an extent by characterizing it as only requiring high corporate officers to rectify misstatements but what company employees qualify as high corporate officers certainly there is a grey area involving the corporate structures of individual companies.apparently this would require a court to engage in a review on a basis,but in the criminal context and the potential exposure to civil liability this uncertainty about who would qualify as a high corporate officer subject to this duty seems to undermine the requirement of fair notice.
even more troubling is the question of how broadly this duty would apply.schiff elaborates on this question in his brief 
a fiduciary presumably would owe shareholders a duty to rectify public misstatements of others whenever they are made on a conference call or,say,in a written report or on the internet,whoever makes them a fellow employee or,say,a securities analyst,and however the fiduciary learns about them by hearing them on a joint call or,say,by reading them in a newspaper.
schiff br.at.moreover,for how long would this duty attach such that rectification would be required for an officer to absolve himself of this fiduciary liability would it be limited to the same day,a week,a month,or even one year would this duty potentially rope in all corporate officers based on a single misstatement by another individual,such that a case could be brought against all executives in a particular company under this theory 
these questions put into focus the vagueness of when such a duty would apply.hence we are reticent to create this type of fiduciary obligation to rectify statements of others when to do so simply gilds the lily.there are other plausible theories of liability that could make these individuals criminally liable for their own statements and omissions and those of others.if congress wants to add another prosecutorial enforcement tool by criminalizing the types of omissions the government argues for under this proposed theory and also set the parameters for such violations,it can,but we will not do so in this case.
furthermore,importing this type of fiduciary obligation into the federal securities laws also appears to encroach into conduct traditionally left to state corporation law.see santa fe,green,d rule should not bring within the rule a wide variety of corporate conduct traditionally left to state regulation,and a bsent a clear indication of congressional intent,we are reluctant to federalize the substantial portion of the law of corporations that deals with transactions in securities,particularly where established state policies of corporate regulation would be overridden.there may well be a need for uniform federal fiduciary standards to govern mergers such as that challenged in this complaint.but those standards should not be supplied by judicial extension of section b and rule to cover the corporate universe.citations omitted craftmatic sec.litig.kraftsow,cir holding that claims essentially grounded on corporate mismanagement are not cognizable under federal law field trump,cir affirming dismissal of rule claims on the ground that they were attempts to bootstrap claims into a federal action.
the government cites to a supreme court case,chiarella united states,d,to demonstrate that fiduciary obligations can be federalized in the securities law context.chiarella involved insider trading charges against a printing company hired by a corporation to print corporate takeover bids.while the court discussed fiduciary obligations,it did so in the context of insider trading,an entirely different situation than the one before us.see deutschman beneficial,cir explaining that chiarella dealt not with injury caused by affirmative misrepresentations which affected the market price of securities,but with the analytically distinct problem of trading on undisclosed information.insider trading raises a duty to disclose under prong one of oran.the court explained that corporate insiders must abstain from trading in the shares of the corporation until the disclosure of material information because of the unfairness of allowing a corporate insider to take advantage of that information by trading without disclosure.chiarella,at.the insider relationship gives rise to a duty to disclose because of the necessity of preventing a corporate insider from tak ing unfair advantage of the uninformed minority stockholders.id.at.citation omitted alteration in original discussing insider trading when corporate insiders used undisclosed information for their own benefit.
to the extent the government argues an alternative theory that this duty to disclose based on statements of another rests not on fiduciary grounds,but instead based on prong three of oran misstatements,waiver is an issue during pretrial proceedings,the government premised its duty to rectify statements of another theory solely on fiduciary duty,which is outside oran.and the government acknowledged as much at oral argument.for example at a hearing on june,the district court pointedly asked the government what the source of the duty was for another misstatements other than aiding and abetting.the government responded the fiduciary duty not to mislead the public on those calls.app.a written submission by the government on august,regarding the legal basis for a duty to disclose based on statements of another,discusses only a fiduciary basis.id.at.at a hearing on october,the court summarized the government argument as the oran list of three factors is,and that lane duty to disclose arises from a fourth factor beyond oran,to wit,his fiduciary duty to shareholders,and the government answered yes.amicus supp l app.at that same hearing,the government stated that the third prong of oran,in fact all the prongs of it,deal with the duty to disclose,duties to disclose regarding one own statements,and that is the basis on which it was cited in our brief.app.emphasis added.the court clarified that in the section of the brief on lane actual statements,something he uttered,you cite id.at.brief dealing with his omissions to state when schiff said something,there is only this fiduciary duty there.id.emphasis added.the government again responded that right.id.
based on this record,we conclude that an argument grounded in oran was waived and precluded by the district court case management ruling in the opinion united states dell aquilla,cir explaining that appellants contended that they raised specific arguments before the district court,but the appeals panel could find no support in the record for those assertions and determined the issues were waived,noting that absent exceptional circumstances,an issue not raised in district court will not be heard on appeal.
despite this waiver,the plain language of b and corresponding rule do not contemplate the general failure to rectify misstatements of others.see,sec tambone,cir en banc reading make to include the use of a false statement by one other than the maker would extend primary liability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by the text of rule b.wright ernst young llp,cir a secondary actor can not incur primary liability under b for a statement not attributed to that actor at the time of its dissemination.shapiro,at a defendant must actually make a false or misleading statement in order to be held liable under section b.anything short of such conduct is merely aiding and abetting,and no matter how substantial that aid may be,it is not enough to trigger liability under section b.see also in re sec,d,relying on the text of rule b to conclude that a defendant that was not the maker of the statements can not be responsible for omissions in statements that it itself did not make wafra leasing prime capital,d,explaining that b text demonstrates that a defendant is liable only for those omissions that make his own statements misleading emphasis in original.moreover,in central bank,the supreme court determined that the scope of b does not encompass aiding and abetting liability because the statute prohibits only the making of a material misstatement or omission or the commission of a manipulative act.central bank of denver,first interstate bank of denver,d.consequently,incorporating into the statute an obligation to rectify others misstatements though lacking even the aiding and abetting mens rea requirement of the initial statement made would be illogical in light of the supreme court holding.
the rule plain language presents two bases for liability t o make any untrue statement or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading.b see also burlington,at stating that a section b plaintiff ordinarily is required to identify a specific statement made by the company and then explain either how the statement was materially misleading or how it omitted a fact that made the statement materially misleading goldwater alston bird,indicating two distinct bases for liability under rule b misrepresentations and misleading statements.
schiff argues that the government contention that he actually made the omissions by not rectifying lane purported misstatements conflates the two independent grounds.we agree.schiff did not make those statements,lane did and vice versa.the government responds that we should interpret the securities laws broadly.however,generalized references to the remedial purposes of the securities laws will not justify reading a provision more broadly than its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit.aaron sec,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
schiff own statements 
turning from schiff liability for statements of another to his own statements,we must address three of the government omission liability theories all of a piece duty to update and duty to correct.like the omission theories premised on statements of another,these theories similarly fail.generally,the government alleges that schiff made material misstatements in the quarterly analyst calls and failed thereafter to update or correct these statements in the management disclosure and analysis section of bristol sec filings filed quarterly,approximately one month after each call or annual report.gov t br.at.we note preliminarily,however,that schiff direct liability under rule b for his alleged misstatements and omissions on analyst calls is not premised on an omission liability theory pinned to the sec filings,and thus remains in the case.this issue is not contested on appeal and falls under prong three of oran as an inaccurate,incomplete or misleading prior disclosure.oran,at.
all of a piece 
the district court dismissed the all of a piece theory in its opinion.it stated that the first time this theory was raised was at the february,hearing.at that hearing,the government argued that the quarterly analyst calls and sec filings were tied together as essentially one event,such that the intentional misstatements on analyst calls created a duty of disclosure in the sec filings under rule b to make the statements in the prior analyst calls not misleading.schiff,d at,noting that t his theory attempts to fit omission liability into oran third prong.however,because the government has stipulated that schiff is not charged with affirmative misstatements in the sec filings,the alleged omissions are not tied to any purported misleading statements in those filings,as is required by rule b.b to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading emphasis added.thus,we agree with and incorporate the district court analysis dismissing this theory.see schiff,d at.
the court characterized the issue as the fair breadth of context between a prior misleading statement in one context analyst conference call and the alleged omission necessary to make that earlier statement not misleading.id.at.it indicated that it is not logical to charge as a crime that an utterance in an analyst conference call must have other words written in a later sec filing in order to make the utterance in the prior phone call not misleading because under rule the duty to disclose arises when each statement was made.id.at.the breadth of context between the alleged false statement on an analyst call and alleged omission in the sec filings is too broad.id.determining there was not a sufficient nexus to tie the analyst calls and the sec filings together under rule b language.thus,there are no actionable omissions in the sec filings on which to base this theory.
duties to update correct 
the threshold question here is whether the duty to update and correct theories were waived or precluded by the district court case management ruling in the opinion regarding new legal theories.id.at.the court also explicitly stated in the opinion that the government is not alleging here a duty to correct that theory is inapposite here because the government has alleged that schiff statements on the analyst calls were misleading at the time made.see id.at emphasis added.moreover,based on our review of the record,the government only allegations against schiff are for intentional misstatements or omissions charged in the indictment,alleged in the government bill of particulars,and maintained by the government throughout the pretrial proceedings by attempting to shoehorn these new theories into the case which the government characterizes as defensive theories,it appears to be trying to amend constructively the indictment at the eleventh hour.see united states henry,cir indicating theories that were not advanced in the indictment can not save it on appeal see also united states alkaabi,d,rejecting the government attempt to usurp the role of the grand jury by advancing new,unalleged theories in its briefs in an effort to save the indictments t he government did not include its three alternative property theories in the indictments presented to the grand jury,and it can not do so now.
the government counters by pointing to an august,letter brief to the district court that briefly referenced the duty to correct concerning lane though it did not refer to omissions in sec filings,and argues that it adopted the arguments for schiff.but we do not see confirmation of this in the record moreover,the d istrict c ourt was in the best position to determine whether or not the issue was raised.farfaras citizens bank trust of chicago,cir.thus,we agree with schiff that these theories were waived or precluded by the district court case management ruling in the opinion.
in burlington,at,we discussed the duties to update and correct.in the civil context,which applies here to understand when these duties arise,we stated that the duties to update and correct are two other avenues of finding a duty to disclose that have been kicked around by courts,litigants and academics alike.id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.see generally robert rosenblum,an issuer duty under rule to correct and update materially misleading statements,cath.these disclosure duties fit within prong three of oran.oran,at.
even if the duty to update were not waived by the government,this new theory would not survive a motion to dismiss in this case.a duty to update arises when statements that,although reasonable at the time made,become misleading when viewed in the context of subsequent events.burlington,at citing greenfield heublein,cir explaining that updating might be required if a prior disclosure had become materially misleading in light of subsequent events.the initial statement that was reasonable at the time made must contain an implicit factual representation that remained alive in the minds of investors as a continuing representation.id.at citations omitted.this is a narrow duty because of the potential to create a sweeping continuing obligation for corporations when they disclose information.id.at explaining the benefits of encouraging voluntary maximal disclosure of corporate information useful to investors,such as internal company forecasts,and disincentivizing corporations from remaining silent and releasing less information in the hope of avoiding the attachment of a continuing obligation to monitor and update all released information.importantly,the burlington court noted that the duty has only been plausible in cases where the initial statement concerns fundamental change s in the nature of the as a merger,liquidation,or takeover when subsequent events produce an extreme or radical change in the continuing validity of that initial statement.id.at refusing to find a duty to update an earnings forecast that,although reasonable when made,may turn out to have been wrong in hindsight,and reemphasiz ing that the two cases in which we recognized that a duty to update might exist were vastly different and the update claims eventually were rejected id.at comparing eisenstadt centel,cir suggesting that even such a narrow duty might not exist.the circumstances in this case,concerning bristol ongoing sales volume of pharmaceutical products to wholesalers in its distribution chain,do not come close to fitting within the narrow range of this duty.
the duty to correct is similarly unsuccessful,but it is at least less far afield than the duty to update.the duty to correct arises when a company makes a historical statement that,at the time made,the company believed to be true,but as revealed by subsequently discovered information actually was not.burlington,at internal citations and quotations omitted noting that the duty can also apply to a certain narrow set of statements.the key for this duty to exist is a triggering factual event after the statement is made.we ask what the event would be that gives rise to the duty to correct.here,nearly three years have passed since the government presented the current indictment to the grand jury,and it has failed to make any allegation or suggestion including in its appellate arguments as to what the subsequent event would be to trigger this duty.see id.at.we also can not imagine what that event would be the defendants need to have some notice of this fundamental factual predicate to be able to prepare an adequate defense to the criminal charges.
iii.daubert materiality ruling 
at schiff trial,the government must prove materiality as an element of a rule b violation basic levinson,d.material information is information that would be important to a reasonable investor in making his or her investment decision.oran,at quoting burlington,at.this is a mixed question of law and fact,and the delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts are peculiarly for the trier of fact.shapiro ujb fin,cir citing tsc,northway,d.
the government sought to introduce the drop in bristol stock price in the days following the company three pertinent announcements on april,and corresponding with the company stock drops on april,and,respectively as evidence of materiality of the alleged misstatements and omissions involving the concealment of wholesaler inventory levels.though this is not the only method of proving materiality it is widely used as evidence if the market is efficient and there is no question here about whether the market is efficient.see oran,at quoting burlington,at explaining that an efficient market immediately incorporate s information important to reasonable investors and the third circuit is committed to the efficient market hypothesis.we have explained that the creation of the rule was explicitly to determine whether information was material.in re merck.sec,cir citing burlington,at.to use stock price drops as evidence of materiality,the government must demonstrate that public disclosure of the misstatements charged in the indictment had an appreciable negative effect on the stock price.schiff,d at quoting oran,at noting that the materiality of disclosed information may be measured post hoc by looking to the movement,in the period immediately following disclose,of the price of the firm stock.
before the district court there was a question of whether the government needed an expert to present the stock drop evidence,and it was determined that the introduction of this evidence would proceed through expert testimony see app.the district court noted that c ourts often turn to economic experts to determine whether a particular announcement had
