petitioners dong gao and xiang zhen gao,a married couple,are natives and citizens of the people republic of china.they challenge the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia that affirmed the oral ruling of an immigration judge ij,denying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and naturalization act,and directed their removal to china.in re dong gao xiang zhen gao,nos,july,aff g nos,immig.city.xiang zhen gao asylum claim is based primarily on her forced sterilization after the couple violated china family planning laws.dong gao has applied for asylum derivatively.see zhou yun zhang ins,cir discussing availability of political asylum for husband based on wife forced abortion or sterilization.
the ij denied the gaos petitions for asylum based solely on his determination that the couple lacked credibility.that adverse credibility determination was grounded exclusively on three purported inconsistencies in their testimony.none of those three subsidiary factual findings was supported by substantial evidence.rather,the ij relied on misstatements of the facts in the record and speculation concerning purported testimony of gao from a previous asylum that he did not admit to having given and of which there is no record.in a short opinion,the bia affirmed the ij decision for the reasons he set forth but corrected one of the ij erroneous statements of fact.accordingly,the petition for review is granted,the agency decision is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
both and gao were born in the village of longmen in changle county,fujian province,china.they were married in a traditional marriage ceremony on march,and registered their marriage on november.the gaos have two children.
gao was pregnant with her first child in.during that pregnancy,she went into hiding in order to prevent the government from learning that she was pregnant.she testified that she gave birth to that child,a daughter,at her aunt house in hoshan,a neighboring village,on july.a midwife delivered the baby.after giving birth,gao left her daughter at her aunt house in order to prevent the government from learning that she had a child.
the gaos testified that gao again went into hiding at her aunt house when she was pregnant for a second time in may of.gao explained that she was afraid that the government officials would discover her pregnancy and force her to undergo an abortion because she already had one child.
in july or august,while she was in hiding,the village family planning cadre came to the gaos house in search of gao because they suspected that she already had given birth to one child and was pregnant again.
gao testified that she feared she would be forced to undergo an abortion if discovered by the government officials.she explained that she went to the county hospital where a cousin worked,pretended to be more than ten days past her due date,and requested a caesarian section.gao had a,and the gaos son was born at the changle county hospital on november.gao testified that she remained at the hospital for one week following her son birth.
two weeks after the birth,gao tried to register their son with local authorities.before they were permitted to register the birth,the village cadre required the gaos to pay a fine for violating family planning policies,that is,for having two children without the mandated spacing.the gaos paid that fine on february.
after their payment of the fine,in april,the village cadre notified the gaos that one of them would have to be sterilized.initially,the gaos successfully bribed a friend of gao father,who worked in the village government,in order to avoid an involuntary sterilization.in october of,however,more than ten government officials surrounded the gaos house in order to take one of them to be sterilized.eventually,they took away gao,detained her overnight,and took her the following day to the county hospital.she underwent a compelled bilateral tubal ligation without being fully anaesthetized 
in,government officials demanded that gao pay another fine for violating the family planning policies.they threatened her with arrest if she did not pay the additional fine.she refused to pay,then left her home,and came to the united states because she feared arrest and imprisonment.
in the meantime,in august,gao entered the united states and thereafter applied for asylum based on china coercive family planning policy,including the forced sterilization of his wife.he testified at an asylum hearing on november,that day,the ij issued an order denying gao application for asylum and denying his application for withholding of removal.on january,while gao appeal of that decision was pending before the bia,gao entered the united states.she also applied for asylum based on china family planning policy and her forced sterilization.
on appeal,the tape recordings and transcript containing the testimony of gao hearing and the ij oral decision,necessary for the bia review,were missing.in re dong gao,no.may.on may,the bia returned the case to the ij for further action,ordering the ij to take such steps as are necessary and appropriate to enable preparation of a complete transcript of the proceedings and a decision of the immigration judge including a new hearing,if necessary.
on remand,the gaos cases were consolidated,and they both testified at a removal hearing on september.in an oral decision issued that same day,the ij ruled against them in reliance on three identified inconsistencies in their testimony,involving the birthplace of their first child,problems encountered during gao second pregnancy,and the duration of gao hospitalization following her forced sterilization.in his oral ruling,the ij referenced gao testimony from the first hearing although the tape recording and transcript had not surfaced,and there was no record of that testimony in evidence.
on july,in a per curiam decision,the bia affirmed the ij decision for the reasons stated therein with one exception.the bia noted that,with respect to the third identified inconsistency,the discrepancy between the gaos testimony did not relate to hospitalization after a sterilization procedure,but to hospitalization after the birth of the couple second child.
discussion 
scope of review 
when the bia issues an opinion,that decision becomes the focus of our review.see yan chen gonzales,cir.when the bia adopts,modifies,or supplements the decision of an ij,the scope of the court review will vary.the extent to which we review the ij decision directly depends on the approach employed by the bia in affirming the ij.see ming xia chen board of immigration appeals,cir discussing bia various techniques and the corresponding scope of appellate review.
for example,when the bia issues an opinion and does not adopt the ij decision to any extent,we review only the bia decision.see yan chen,at.at the other extreme,when the bia expressly adopts the findings and reasoning of the ij,we review only the ij decision,as if it were the bia.see chun gao gonzales,cir.
on occasion,the bia will reference certain portions of the ij decision,sometimes rejecting one or more aspects of the ij reasoning.for instance,when the bia affirms the ij decision in all respects except one,the court reviews the ij decision minus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the bia.xue hong yang dep t of justice,cir.likewise,when the bia issues a short opinion affirming the ij decision in part and modifying it in part,we will review the ij decision as modified by the bia.ming xia chen,at.that review will be confined to the rationale of the ij on which the bia relied.see zerrei gonzales,cir.
other times,the bia will adopt the ij reasoning and supplement it,affirming the result on additional grounds.in those instances,the court reviews the ij decision as supplemented by the bia.see yu yin yang gonzales,cir.similarly,when the bia adopts the entirety of an ij decision,then adds alternative grounds,this court may review the underlying ij decision.see ming xia chen,at noting that the court was not confined to reviewing the bia two alternative grounds for denying relief when bia had also adopted ij determinative adverse credibility finding.
when the bia agrees with an ij ultimate credibility determination but emphasizes particular aspects of the ij reasoning,the court reviews both the bia and the ij opinions,including those portions of the ij decision that the bia did not explicitly discuss.see guan gonzales,cir.
in the instant case,the ij denied relief based solely on an adverse credibility determination that in turn relied on three subsidiary factual findings based on purportedly inconsistent testimony.the bia affirmed the ij decision for the reasons stated therein,with the following exception,then noted that the petitioners had not testified inconsistently concerning gao hospitalization following the the ij had had testified inconsistently with respect to the duration of her hospital stay after giving birth to their son.
in other words,the bia corrected one subsidiary factual finding of the ij,but upheld his ultimate adverse credibility finding.it is unclear whether the bia intended to extract the third inconsistency from the ij reasoning,concluding that the remaining two subsidiary grounds were legally sufficient,or whether it instead substituted the actual inconsistency it identified in the record for the profound inconsistency that the ij had erroneously identified and relied upon.because the bia did not rule independently on the credibility of the indeed it could not but held that the ij adverse credibility finding was not clearly erroneous,it must have employed the former approach.in other words,we read the bia decision as extracting the one erroneous ground on which the ij relied,noting that the record did contain a somewhat similar discrepancy,but not relying on that newly articulated inconsistency.
in these circumstances,most akin to cases when the bia affirms an ij in all respects but one,the court must review the ij decision as modified by the bia,that is,without the erroneous subsidiary fact that the ij found and upon which he relied in concluding that the gaos lacked credibility.
ii.standard of review 
in the immigration context,the court reviews administrative factual findings,including credibility determinations and the subsidiary findings underpinning them,under the substantial evidence standard.see wu biao chen ins,cir per curiam.following the supreme court,this court has defined substantial evidence to mean more than a mere scintilla it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.li zu guan ins,cir quoting consolidated edison nlrb.under the substantial evidence standard,the court treats factual findings as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.relatedly,this court grants particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard to credibility findings based on demeanor.karaj gonzales,cir see also jin chen dep t of justice,cir we give particular deference to credibility determinations that are based on the adjudicator observation of the applicant demeanor,in recognition of the fact that the ij ability to observe the witness demeanor places her in the best position to evaluate credibility.the court is mindful that the law must entrust some official with responsibility to hear an applicant asylum claim,and the ij has the unique advantage among all officials involved in the process of having heard directly from the applicant.zhou yun zhang,at.
nevertheless,the fact that the bia has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.to the contrary,an ij adverse credibility finding constitutes the beginning not the end of our inquiry.ins,cir.although the court does not review the petitioners credibility de novo,our exceedingly narrow inquiry must ensure that the ij determinations were not arbitrary or capricious.zhou yun zhang,at.in other words,our review ensures that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.id.
notably,when the outcome of an asylum application rises and falls purely on an ij credibility finding,courts have been particularly concerned that the carefully detail the reasoning leading to the adverse finding,at.when rejecting an applicant testimony,for example,an ij must provide specific,cogent reasons for doing so.id accord ahmad ins,cir senathirajah ins,cir.those reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the credibility finding and must be valid grounds for disregarding an applicant testimony,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
although the substantial evidence standard leaves to the agency,it does not permit an appellate court to defer to unreasoned rulings,or those based on legal error,faulty analysis,or misreadings of the record.li zu guan,at.specifically,a dverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible,at citing chen yun gao ashcroft,cir accord salaam ins,cir.moreover,if an ij credibility determination analyzing testimony is based on flawed reasoning,it likewise will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard,at.
credibility determinations that are based on the ij analysis of testimony,as opposed to demeanor,are granted less deference.see jin chen,at,at distinguishing ij credibility determinations that are based on analysis of testimony from those based on witness demeanor,which merit greater deference.the court reviews such credibility determinations only with the high degree of deference that is normally given to an ij factual determinations.lin zhong dep t of justice,cir.
finally,the court will confine its review to the reasons given by the agency and will not search the record for alternative reasons to affirm.see karaj,at.
iii.the decision under review 
we vacate the agency rejection of the gaos petitions for asylum and withholding of removal based on china coercive family planning policies because that rejection rested exclusively on an adverse credibility finding that was not supported by substantial evidence.the ij analysis of the petitioners testimony and his reliance on purported inconsistencies in that testimony were clearly erroneous.
in concluding that the gaos lacked credibility,the ij relied solely on three purported inconsistencies in the petitioners testimony.those inconsistencies related to the birthplace of the gaos first child and whether gao had any problems during her second pregnancy.neither of those factual findings is supported by substantial evidence in the record.
the ij also relied on what he characterized as a profound inconsistency concerning the duration of gao hospitalization following her forced sterilization.although the bia noted that the third inconsistency identified by the ij was in error,the bia remarks concerning a different actual inconsistency,relating to gao hospitalization following the birth of her son,do not provide additional support for the ij credibility determination.
a.the three purported inconsistencies 
birthplace of the first child 
first,the ij found that gao was internally inconsistent concerning the birthplace of her first child.relatedly,with respect to the first child place of birth,he found that gao was unable to reconcile his purported testimony from the hearing with his testimony in.
when explaining gao internal inconsistency regarding the first child,the ij mistakenly discussed the birth of the gaos son,who is their second child 
the respondent was internally inconsistent with regards to the place of her first child birth.respondent testified that her son was born at her aunt house.she then recanted that testimony and indicated that her son was born in the hospital.
that description mischaracterizes gao testimony,and the ij finding that gao was internally inconsistent is not based on substantial evidence.
during direct examination,gao testified that she gave birth to her first her aunt house and that she delivered her second child,a son,at the county hospital.on cross,she was first asked,now you indicated that your first child was born at your aunt home,correct gao replied affirmatively.she was then asked,and are you aware that previously your husband testified at his hearing that your first child was born in the changles hospital 
at that point,there was confusion with the interpretation of gao testimony.the response was initially recorded i did know but my daughter was born at my aunt house.after her attorney objected to the translation,the tape recording was played and the interpreter stated that he had not accurately interpreted her response.he stated no,actually,the applicant said my son,my son was born at my aunt house.her attorney again objected to the interpretation,stating that he believed she had said,t he first,the first child,then that he believed she had said daughter.
the tape recording was played a second time there was additional confusion,but the interpreter stood by his second interpretation the correct translation should be my son was born at my aunt house.upon further questioning,gao,however,repeated her direct testimony my daughter was born at my aunt house.my son was born at changles county hospital.
the government lawyer then repeated to gao that her husband had testified at his initial asylum hearing in that their child,their daughter,was born in a hospital.in response,gao stated again,consistently,that her daughter was born at her aunt house.when asked why her husband would have stated otherwise,she replied maybe he was nervous at the time.
in short,it is not accurate to say that gao testified that her son was born at her aunt house and then recanted that testimony and indicated that her son was born in the hospital.on both direct and,gao testified that her daughter was born at her aunt house and her son was born at the hospital.there was one instance,in response to a question concerning the birth of her first child,when the listening to the tape recording of her testimony that gao response was my son was born at my aunt house.still,when the question was repeated,gao testified consistently with her direct testimony and earlier testimony on 
moreover,the ij analysis of that her first child but then discussing the testimony surrounding the birth of the gaos clearly erroneous.
with respect to her husband testimony on the issue,the ij commented that gao had testified at the hearing that the first child was born at a hospital,although at the later hearing he testified the first child was born at the aunt house.
the respondent husband testified at a previous hearing that the first child was born at a hospital,although he testified today that the first child was born at the aunt home.when confronted with this significant variance,respondent husband simply stated that that was due to the fact that he was nervous.
again,the ij finding is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.at the hearing,gao testified his first child was born at the aunt house.when the government lawyer asked why he had previously testified that she had been born at the hospital,he replied first at that time,i did,i did remember.he later replied because i was very nervous when i was in front of the judge.maybe i made a mistake.
the ij never set forth any basis for the finding that gao testified at a previous hearing that the first child was born at a hospital,and there is no evidence in the record to support that finding.the ij appears simply to have adopted the assumption implicit in the question an assumption underlying a question,however,is not evidence.moreover,gao two comments,notably,maybe i made a mistake,do not amount to an admission that he testified inconsistently at the hearing with respect to the first child place of birth.lin zhong dep t of justice,at reviewing credibility determination based in part on household registry not admitted into an ij can not rely on evidence in making ultimate credibility determination in re,bia stating that any evidence relied upon by the immigration judge must be included in the record so that the board can meaningfully review any challenge to the immigration judge decision on appeal.
strict evidentiary rules do not govern immigration proceedings.see felzcerek ins,cir.nevertheless,it is black letter law that questions asked by counsel are not evidence.washington schriver,cir.thus,absent other evidence,an ij can not rely on facts set forth only in a lawyer question.united states defillipo,cir noting the traditional evidentiary rule that a question which assumes a fact may become improper on,because it may by implication put into the mouth of an unwilling witness,a statement which he never intended to make,and thus incorrectly attribute to him testimony which is not his internal quotation marks and citation omitted 
accordingly,we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the ij finding of an inconsistency between the purported testimony and gao testimony at the hearing.
problems during second pregnancy 
the second claimed inconsistency on which the ij relied related to what transpired when gao was pregnant for the second time.both and gao testified consistently on this subject at the hearing.the two described the family planning cadre who came to their home in search of a pregnant gao,suspecting the couple already had a child.the ij,however,again relied on the supposed testimony of gao at his first hearing.
here,the ij based his credibility determination on the gaos inability to reconcile gao earlier purported testimony with their testimony in.the ij relied on the fact that gao could not explain her husband supposed testimony from the hearing,which she did not attend,and that gao when confronted with his previous testimony that they had no problems or difficulties with chinese officials during the second pregnancy,explained that he said it because he did want to elaborate and the events were too upsetting to explain.
the ij asserted that gao had previously testified that they had no difficulties during her second pregnancy,had no confrontations with anyone,and had no problems with the chinese government.again,there was no record of any such testimony in evidence.rather,during the hearing,the government attorney and the ij repeatedly stated simply that gao had indicated in that the couple had no problems during the second pregnancy 
q can you explain why,sir,at your asylum hearing before the court,you indicated that you and your wife had no problems during your wife second pregnancy 
a the second pregnancy,do you mind to repeat again 
q you indicated at your hearing that you and your wife had no problems during your wife second pregnancy.can you explain why your testimony is different today 
a you say i did have any problem when i was at my first asylum hearing 
judge no,sir.no.no.you said at your last hearing that you and your wife had no problems during her second pregnancy.why would you say that 
a at that time the cadre had come.they wanted my wife to come out.i remember that point very clearly.both my,both we were hiding,both 
interpreter your honor 
judge are you getting any of this 
interpreter no.
judge to gao sir,do you want to repeat this or do you want to stop for a second here 
a at that time they have notified my mother they wanted my wife to come out.i would,i would go back home.i was so scared i would go back home to sleep.
q schroeck sir,that does explain why at your first hearing you indicated you had no problems during your wife second pregnancy and now you saying you were contacted by the family planning or they came looking for your wife during your wife second pregnancy.can you explain why the testimony is different 
a at that time i remembered 
a no audible response.
judge do you understand the question,sir.let me rephrase it.today you visibly upset in recalling that chinese officials were looking for your wife during her pregnancy.you were so scared,you could even sleep at your own home.at the last hearing when you were testifying you said you had no problems during the second pregnancy.that very different than what you saying today.can you reconcile this or can you explain why that so 
a no audible response.
judge why would you say you had no problems at th
