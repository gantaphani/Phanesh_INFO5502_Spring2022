opinion of the court 
in,a jury found wali palmer guilty of multiple crimes related to a shooting death in an atlantic city bar.after he unsuccessfully appealed his conviction,palmer sought relief in the new jersey state courts,asserting that his attorney had been constitutionally ineffective.the new jersey courts denied palmer petition for relief,and palmer thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the new jersey district court pursuant to.the district court did not convene an evidentiary hearing and dismissed palmer petition.
we granted palmer application for a certificate of appealability as to three issues whether palmer trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to advise palmer of his right to testify at trial and at a suppression hearing,whether his attorney was ineffective in failing to inform palmer that the choice of whether to testify was ultimately palmer to make,and whether the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to resolve these claims.we conclude that palmer failed to make a prima facie showing of the prejudice element of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to convene an evidentiary hearing to resolve palmer claims.
in march,palmer was attacked by a group of young men at a bar in atlantic city,new jersey.during the scuffle,palmer pulled out a automatic handgun and fired two wild shots.one shot hit the leg of one of his attackers,shawn brantley the other shot hit and killed palmer cousin,junior jerry cooper,who had been trying to help palmer.palmer attempted to assist his cousin,but when he realized that his cousin was not moving,palmer fled the scene on a bicycle.police responded to the shooting,gathered a description of palmer from the wounded brantley,and arrested palmer a few blocks from the bar.
after his arrest,palmer gave several incriminating statements to the police.he later moved,pursuant to miranda arizona,to exclude some of the statements.palmer did not testify during the suppression hearing,and the record is silent as to whether he wanted to testify,what the contents of his testimony would have been,and whether his attorney discussed with him the possibility or propriety of testifying.the trial court eventually admitted most,but not all,of the statements.
trial was conducted between june and june.after the state rested,palmer and his attorney,williams harris,engaged in two colloquies on the record,which became relevant during the state proceedings.first,once the state had rested,the court and counsel discussed whether all of the state exhibits had been admitted into evidence,after which the following colloquy took place 
court if there an oversight you suddenly discover,we can deal with that.we take a recess to afford harris to consult with his client.
harris thank you judge.
after recess 
whereupon the following took place out of the presence of the jury 
harris we going to rest,judge.
court okay.
the next day,before the court charged the jury,the following exchange between the court,defense counsel,and palmer took place 
harris can i have a moment off the record 
court sure.
off record 
harris your honor,i like to have you read the defendant election not to testify charge to my client so that we can make a decision on that.
court i be glad to do that.
harris thank you.
court palmer,this is the charge that i give to the jury,if you wish,and it reads as follows.it the constitutional right of a defendant to remain silent.i charge you that you are not to consider for any purpose or any manner in arriving at your verdict the fact that the defendant did not testify,nor should that fact enter into your deliberations or discussions in any manner or at anytime.the defendant is entitled to have the jury consider all the evidence,and he is entitled to the presumption of innocence even if he does not testify as a witness.
harris could i have one second,judge 
discussion off the record.counsel conferring with defendant.
harris we going to ask that you do read it to the jury.
court palmer,you wish that given 
palmer yes.
court thank you,i will.
the jury was charged and,after deliberating,it found palmer guilty of aggravated manslaughter,aggravated assault,possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose,and unlawful possession of a weapon.palmer was subsequently given a sentence of years for the manslaughter conviction,a consecutive sentence of eight years for the assault conviction,and a concurrent sentence of five years for the weapons convictions.palmer appealed the convictions and sentence,challenging,among other things,the admissibility of the statements and the severity of his sentence.the new jersey appellate division affirmed.
after his direct appeal failed,palmer filed a petition for relief.in his petition,palmer argued that harris had been constitutionally ineffective for,among other things,failing to advise him of his right to testify on his own behalf.palmer submitted with his petition a sworn affidavit that stated 
that,my former trial attorney williams harris had never informed me about my right to testify prior to trial,or that the decision not to testify was my decision to make and not harris.
that,prior to going into the courtroom,harris had c o me down to the bullpen or holding cell area in the courthouse,and i had asked harris when he was going to put me on the stand to tell my side of what happened,and harris had told me that he was not going to put me on the stand or testify or call me as a witness.
that,during my trial,the judge began reading something about me choosing not to testify,and saying that i chose not to testify,at which point i attempted to respond by telling harris that he making it sound like i do want to tell my side,and harris tapped me to hold up,and asked the judge for a second to speak to me.
that,harris then told me that,because he was not using me as a witness that the judge has to read those things to the jury so that they ca hold anything against me or bring up anything about me not taking the stand,and that harris at that point still did not explain to me that i had a right to testify or that the choice of whether to testify was solely mine to make and not his.
that,prior to harris telling me that he was not going to put me on the stand,i was under the impression that i would get to tell my side of what happened.
that,i would have taken the stand to testify on my own behalf to explain my side of what really happened if i was allowed to do so.
in sum,palmer argued that his trial counsel never took the time to explain to him that the choice of whether or not he would testify was for palmer,not harris,to make.palmer also argued that the trial record was inconclusive as to whether harris ever conveyed this information and that the jury charge colloquy revealed little about whether palmer understood his right to testify.accordingly,palmer requested an evidentiary hearing to subpoena harris and develop the factual record.notably,palmer did not set forth the facts to which he would have testified had he taken the stand at his trial.
the relief pcr court rejected palmer petition without granting an evidentiary hearing.emphasizing the colloquy between the court and defense counsel at the close of the state case,the pcr court found that palmer and his attorney had been afforded the opportunity for harris to counsel palmer as to whether or not to testify.additionally,relying upon the colloquy between the court,defense counsel,and palmer just prior to the jury charge,the pcr court found that palmer understood that he had a choice regarding whether to testify 
then we get to what transpires with respect to the charge.and harris says,your honor,i like to have you read the defendant election not to testify charge to my client so that we can make a decision on that.so we talking about defendant election not to testify,the defendant right not to testify.implicit in that is a right to testify.and the charge that was read to him was this the defendant in this case chose not to be a witness.first line in the charge.if you choose not to be a witness,you can also choose to be a witness.so by the charge itself,which was read to the defendant,the defendant was told by me with respect to his choices.he chose not to be implicit in that is a choosing to be.and the last sentence of the charge reads that,the defendant is entitled to have the jury consider all of the evidence and he is entitled to the presumption of innocence even if he does not testify as a witness.implicit in that as well is the fact that he can testify as a witness.to say that he was never told that he could be a witness,i think is belied by the transcript in this particular case.
the appellate division upheld this decision for substantially the same reasons,but also took note of the pauses in the proceedings for discussions between trial counsel and defendant,which belie defendant contentions that he was unaware of his right to testify and that he had no discussions with his attorney about that right.app.the new jersey supreme court denied certification.
having exhausted his state court remedies,palmer filed a habeas petition pursuant to in the district court.in his petition,palmer claimed that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective he likewise asserted a host of additional issues not relevant to this appeal.the district court denied the entirety of his petition.with regard to the issue of palmer right to testify,the district court quoted the language of the pcr court,endorsing the portion of that opinion that found that palmer understood his right to testify,and rejected the petition on the grounds that the new jersey courts adjudication of the claims did not result in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of strickland or other supreme court holdings.app.the court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.
finally,palmer appealed to this court.we granted a certificate of appealability with respect to palmer claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to advise appellant of his right to testify at trial and at his suppression hearing and failing to inform appellant that the choice whether to testify was ultimately his to make.app.we also stated that the parties shall address whether the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to resolve these claims.app.
the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over palmer appeal under and.
the and effective death penalty act of aedpa requires federal courts collaterally reviewing state proceedings to afford considerable deference to state courts legal and factual determinations.lambert blackwell,f d,cir.factual determinations made by the state court are presumed to be correct,but may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see simmons beard,cir citing e.our standard of review is the same as that of the district court because the district court relied exclusively on the state court record and did not hold an evidentiary hearing,our review is plenary.see id.citing jacobs horn,cir.
by its own terms,d only applies to claims already adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.thus,if a properly preserved claim was not addressed by the state court on the merits,the deferential standards of aedpa do not apply.see appel horn,cir.in such instances,the federal habeas court must conduct a de novo review over pure legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact,as a court would have done prior to the enactment of aedpa.id.citing mccandless vaughn,cir.however,e still mandates that the state court factual determinations are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.simmons,at citing appel,at.
we address at the outset whether the district court abused its discretion when it denied palmer habeas petition without first convening an evidentiary hearing.we conclude that because palmer petition does not contain sufficient factual allegations,which,if true,would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining palmer request for an evidentiary hearing.schriro landrigan.
the decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing is subject to the discretion of the district court 
prior to aedpa,new evidentiary hearings in habeas cases were required in several circumstances.campbell vaughn,cir citing townsend sain,emphasis in original.we have been clear that aedpa,in contrast,permits evidentiary hearings on habeas review,but only in a limited number of circumstances.id.citing e emphasis in original.in particular,a district court is permitted to hold an evidentiary hearing on a claim asserted in a petition so long as such a hearing is not barred by e.under that section,a habeas court is barred from holding an evidentiary hearing unless the petitioner was diligent in his attempt to develop a factual basis for his claim in the state court proceedings,see williams taylor,wilson beard,cir,or the petitioner satisfies the criteria set forth in e a and b 
in cases where an applicant for federal habeas relief is not barred from obtaining an evidentiary hearing by e,the decision to grant such a hearing rests in the discretion of the district court.schriro,at see also campbell,at aedpa,unlike townsend and keeney,does not require that such a hearing be held.instead,federal courts have discretion to grant a hearing or not.although such a decision is discretionary,it is not unconstrained,and schriro identifies two related considerations that guide the habeas court exercise of discretion 
first,in determining whether or not to hold an evidentiary hearing,courts should consider whether such a hearing could enable an applicant to prove the petition factual allegations,which,if true,would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief.schriro,at.in other words,courts considering the appropriateness of an evidentiary hearing should determine whether the petition presents a prima facie showing which,if proven,would enable the petitioner to prevail on the merits of the asserted claim.see,campbell burris,cir wells petsock,cir smith freeman,cir.the reasons underlying such a consideration are aedpa acknowledged purpose of reducing delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences,schriro,at quotation marks,citations,and brackets omitted,a court should be reluctant to convene an evidentiary hearing to explore the claims of a petitioner whose pleadings are factually insufficient to suggest any entitlement to habeas relief.see,campbell,at bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not afford a sufficient ground for an evidentiary hearing quoting mayberry petsock,cir anderson att y of kansas,cir to warrant an evidentiary hearing,a habeas petitioner factual allegations must be specific and particularized,not general or conclusory quotation marks and citation omitted.
second,if the record refutes the applicant factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief,a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.schriro,at.that is,even if the factual allegations in the habeas petition are sufficient to make out a prima facie claim for habeas relief,a district court may decline to convene an evidentiary hearing if the factual allegations are contravened by the existing record.id.citation omitted see also campbell,at.as the supreme court has explained,i f district courts were required to allow federal habeas applicants to develop even the most insubstantial factual allegations in evidentiary hearings,district courts would be forced to reopen factual disputes that were conclusively resolved in the state courts.schriro,at.
with these twin considerations in mind,we turn to palmer petition to determine whether the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed the petition without first convening an evidentiary hearing.
palmer inadequate allegations of prejudice 
because we find that the factual allegations underlying palmer contention that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective are insufficient to show that he is entitle d to federal habeas relief,id.at,we conclude that the district court decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing was not an abuse of discretion 
the strickland washington,standard is applicable when a petitioner claims his attorney was ineffective by denying him his constitutional right to testify.matylinsky budge,cir citation omitted.the strickland test has two prongs the petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.the first prong requires a petitioner to demonstrate that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.see also taylor horn,cir.strickland second prong requires a petitioner to show that the errors were sufficiently serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland,at.the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
palmer petition comes up short because it fails to make an adequate showing of prejudice.see id.at a court need not determine whether counsel performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.as we have noted,palmer claim for ineffective assistance of counsel turns on his contention that his attorney failed to advise him of his right to testify in his defense and failed to inform him that such a decision was palmer to make.palmer contentions concerning his attorney allegedly deficient conduct are fleshed out in the affidavit palmer submitted in support of his habeas petition.what is not fleshed out in the petition,however,is a factual basis suggesting that palmer was prejudiced by his attorney alleged conduct.palmer affidavit states merely that he would have taken the stand to testify on his own behalf to explain his side of what really happened if he had been allowed to do so.app the brief he submitted in support of his application for relief adds precious little to this statement.in a conclusory fashion,palmer asserts that because he was contending,it was crucial for him to explain his version of the events,especially since the requisite determination that the jury had to make was did the petitioner use force in the reasonable belief that such force was necessary to prevent his death or serious injury,and there is nobody who could explain what his mental state was better than the petitioner app in sum,we know that palmer wished to testify,and we know the legal theory toward which his testimony would have been directed,but we know nothing about the facts to which palmer would have testified.
palmer stated desire to tell his side of the story and his conclusory invocation of the words are not sufficient to show that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.strickland,at.we have repeatedly emphasized that bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not afford a sufficient ground for an evidentiary hearing on a habeas petition.campbell,at citation omitted zettlemoyer fulcomer,cir.other circuits have likewise recognized that a habeas petitioner nonspecific or conclusory allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel do not compel district courts to convene evidentiary hearings in order to delve into the unelaborated factual basis of a habeas petition.see,anderson,at barry united states,cir.palmer petition contains no factual matter regarding strickland prejudice prong,and his reference to the legal theory of is precisely the sort of unadorned legal conclusion that,without supporting factual allegations,we have consistently found insufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing.see campbell,at zettlemoyer,at bell atl.twombly,in the civil pleading context,courts are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation quotations and citations omitted.
zettlemoyer is on point.in that case,the petitioner contended that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to develop the facts of his ineffective assistance claim,in which he asserted that his attorney had failed to call witnesses who would have provided unspecified testimony related to his defense.see zettlemoyer,at.as in this case,the petitioner in zettlemoyer identified a witness whose testimony his attorney failed to present and a legal theory toward which the witness testimony would have been directed,but the petitioner gave no indication of what the contents of the testimony would have been.see id.we explained that the petitioner had failed to set forth facts to support his contention and held that an evidentiary hearing was not called for.id.at,see also campbell,at where petitioner fails to allege what this witness would have been able to say that would have been of help to him,an evidentiary hearing is not mandated wells,at.the same conclusion is compelled here.by stating merely that he would have taken the stand to testify on his own behalf to explain his side of what really happened,app b,and that this testimony would have addressed the subject of,palmer failed to present factual allegations,which,if true,would entitle the applicant to federal habeas relief under strickland prejudice prong schriro,at.
in owens united states,cir,the court recognized that an attorney failure to inform his client of his right to testify could be prejudicial.the court explained that a defendant testimony could be crucial in any trial,and it could be difficult for us to determine whether or not a jury would have found his testimony credible.id.citations omitted.this is particularly true when the only witness the defendant proffers is himself.the supreme court has recognized that the most important witness for the defense in many criminal cases is the defendant himself.rock arkansas.after all,if there were no other witnesses,who would be in a better position to advise the factfinder as to the relevant facts in support of a claimed defense 
on the other hand,the mere assertion of is not sufficient to raise a plausible showing of prejudice sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing.if so,every defendant charged with homicide would make such an assertion.in owens,the court particularized the needed showing when it stated that a defendant who was not informed by counsel or the court of his right to testify and who would have offered genuinely exculpatory testimony would have been prejudiced by the failure to have been informed of his right to testify.owens,at emphasis added.although the showing that a defendant must make need not be onerous,it must be sufficiently detailed to be genuinely exculpatory.id.
in new jersey,the assertion of requires a jury to discern whether the defendant had a subjective belief at the time that deadly force was necessary and then to determine whether that subjective belief was objectively reasonable.state jenewicz,see stat.ann.there are several further caveats to this rule,such as a duty to retreat.see stat.ann.b.in this case,it is undisputed that defendant was the only person who drew and fired a gun.app.in order to have been entitled to an evidentiary hearing,palmer had the obligation to show his testimony would have been genuinely exculpatory as long as it was not refuted by the existing record.see schriro,at.palmer did not make any such showing,and it follows that the court did not err in denying palmer a hearing.
there is no presumption of prejudice in cases 
conceding that the record is silent about the nature of palmer probable testimony,appellant br,palmer contends that he should be relieved from making any showing as to strickland prejudice criterion.although his argument on this point is somewhat muddled,palmer appears to suggest that when counsel fails to properly advise a client concerning the right to testify,such defective performance by counsel is not susceptible to analysis under strickland standard,but is instead a structural defect in the entire trial process that requires automatic reversal,irrespective of prejudice.see neder united states,see also,united states
