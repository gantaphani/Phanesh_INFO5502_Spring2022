background 
the evidence at trial established that between and,rodriguez and thompson ran a crack cocaine and marijuana distribution organization that operated in the bronx and vermont.rodriguez and thompson were the organizers and leaders of the organization,which sold its crack and marijuana on the streets and from inside various stash houses.rose,fisher,robinson,and todd helped manage the operation and sold its crack cocaine and marijuana.members of the conspiracy used,carried,and possessed firearms in furtherance of the crack cocaine and marijuana conspiracy.
the government proof included the testimony of cooperating witnesses who worked for or with rodriguez and thompson between and in the bronx and vermont,as well as an independent and at times competing drug dealer who witnessed the operation of the drug organization in the bronx.these witnesses described how and where the crack cocaine and marijuana distribution organization operated the quantities of crack cocaine its members distributed and the weapons its members used,carried,and possessed to protect the organization from rivals.
the testimony of the cooperating witnesses was corroborated by quantities of narcotics,cash,weapons,and narcotics paraphernalia seized from the organization stash houses in the bronx,as well as from the street and automobiles in the bronx and vermont.the government also offered the testimony of officers from the new york city police department nypd gang squad,who observed the defendants over a period of approximately five months selling,mostly in combination,crack cocaine and marijuana on east street in the bronx.
discussion 
after jury selection the government alleged,pursuant to batson kentucky,d,that defense counsel use of peremptory challenges during voir dire was racially motivated.in batson,the supreme court prohibited prosecutors from exercising peremptory challenges to prospective jurors based on race.id.at.b y denying a person participation in jury service on account of his race,the state unconstitutionally discriminate s against the excluded juror.the supreme court later extended batson,prohibiting defense counsel from exercising racially motivated peremptory challenges.see georgia mccollum,d.an accusation by the government that defense counsel has engaged in such discriminatory conduct has come be known as a challenge.
here,the district court granted the government challenge and juror two.in assessing a party claim that its opponent has exercised its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner,a trial court engages in a analysis,under which the court must determine whether the moving party has made a prima facie showing that the other party has exercised a peremptory strike on the basis of race if so,decide whether the party exercising the challenged strike has satisfied the burden of offering a explanation for the strike and if so,make a determination whether the challenging party has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.see batson,at.we have held that the third step of the batson inquiry requires a trial judge to make an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and circumstances.united states alvarado,cir.we have also held that the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact that will be set aside only if clearly erroneous.united states taylor,cir.
during jury selection,the defense exercised fourteen peremptory challenges,twelve of which were against white jurors and two of which were against latino jurors.percent of the original members of the panel were white.in response to the government challenge,the district court determined that there was a prima facie case of discrimination because over of the challenges exercised by defense counsel were against white jurors while no challenges were exercised against african american jurors.after a hearing at which the defense was given an opportunity to offer reasons for its peremptory challenges,the district court juror two.defense counsel offered the following reasons for exercising the challenge against juror two the brother of juror two fiance was a police officer she was a resident of westchester county yonkers she lives with her parents and presumably was sheltered and she taught second grade at a school in the bronx.the district court doubted the defense theory that juror two would be influenced by the fact that her future was a police officer in a small town.moreover,the district court doubted the relevance of juror two position as a teacher in the bronx because an african american juror who also had been a teacher in the bronx,juror thirty,was seated with no challenge from the defense.the district court stated other than race,i really do see a legitimate difference between juror thirty,who spent a career teaching kids in the bronx,who m you chose to keep,and juror two that is why i think juror two is the weakest of the challenges.
the defendants argue that their proffered reasons for the strike were legitimate and sufficient to allow the peremptory challenge of juror two to stand.while it is true that the district court generally considered certain of the proffered reasons as applied to other defense strikes to be sufficiently,the court rejected those reasons as pretext for actual discrimination in the challenge of juror two.this court gives deference to a district court determination as to whether proffered reasons for a peremptory strike are pretextual,and in this case nothing in the record suggests that the district court findings were clearly erroneous.
with regard to the fact that juror two fiance brother is a police officer,the court noted that juror two herself did not emphasize that had only mentioned it in response to the court question about contacts with law enforcement.the district court called juror two back into the box to question her further,and juror two explained that she did not think her future line of work would affect her,in part because she never talked about his work with him.moreover,the district court observed that the defense had seated a latino juror whose brother was a retired undercover police officer.the court noted d efense has to be cautious.if they start saying somebody has a lot of friends in the nypd,well,if seated jurors have a lot of friends in the nypd,it kind of drops away as a reason for the strike.
with regard to juror two county of residence,the district court found that,although it had accepted residence in westchester county as a legitimate basis for challenges,juror two residence in yonkers was not equally legitimate because,as defense counsel had conceded,yonkers is more like the bronx than westchester.moreover,the defense had seated two latino jurors from westchester.the court also did not find,based on its observation of her,that juror two seemed sheltered.finally,the district court did not find credible the defense concerns with juror two occupation as a school teacher in the bronx,primarily because the defense seated an african american juror who also had been a school teacher in the bronx for many years before retiring.
the district court made an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and circumstances,alvarado,at,and we find no error in the district court determination.see snyder louisiana,d finding that prosecutor facially implausible explanation for challenging an african american juror based on juror conflicting obligations was reinforced by the prosecutor acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least as serious as that of the challenged juror.
the defendants also claim that the district court failed to make an explicit determination that the defense had exercised the peremptory challenge in an intentionally discriminatory manner.the purpose of this court requirement that a district court make explicit findings with respect to each of the three steps prescribed in batson is to avoid an incomplete record that will prevent a meaningful determination on the question whether the challenges demonstrated discriminatory intent.jordan lefevre,cir.in this case,the district court elicited the defendants explanations for the peremptory challenge of juror two,examined those explanations through questioning and colloquy,and stated on the record that it found the explanations not credible and weak.accordingly,the district court finding of purposeful discrimination and the record supporting that finding are sufficient to allow this court review of the issue.
the defendants further claim that because they exercised their peremptory challenges as a group,the district court could not properly discern whether an individual defendant had acted with discriminatory intent.in raising this claim,however,the defendants overlook the fact that after the government raised its challenge,each defense counsel was permitted to offer reasons for the strike.the record demonstrates that more than one defense counsel offered an explanation for the strike,and there is no evidence that any attorney was prohibited from participating in the district court examination of the strike.batson was designed to serve multiple ends,only one of which was to protect individual defendants from discrimination in the selection of jurors batson is designed to remedy the harm done to the dignity of persons and to the integrity of the courts.mccollum,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has recognized that denying a person participation in jury service on account of his race unconstitutionally discriminates against the excluded juror.id.in this case,the district court properly evaluated the reasons given by each defendant who argued in support of the peremptory challenge before arriving at its finding of discriminatory intent.
finally,the defendants argue that a black criminal defendant should not be subject to a batson challenge for exercising his peremptory strikes with respect to white jurors because the potential social harms identified in cases involving racial minorities are not implicated where an african american defendant seeks to strike white jurors from the jury panel.this argument must be rejected in light of mccollum,which held that a defendant discriminatory use of a peremptory challenge violates the equal protection right of the challenged juror.see at.regardless of who invokes the discriminatory challenge,there can be no doubt that the harm is the all cases,the juror is subjected to open and public racial discrimination.see also powers ohio,d a member of the community may not be excluded from jury service on account of his or her race.accordingly,the defendants argument that batson does not apply where an african american defendant seeks to eliminate white jurors is entirely without merit.
each of the defendants challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction.this court has noted that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden.united states concepcion,cir.in considering a defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction,this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draws every inference in the government favor.see united states salameh,cir per curiam.the jury verdict must be sustained if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the evidence presented at trial when viewed in the light most favorable to the government was sufficient to support the convictions of each of the defendants.
todd,rose,and fisher argue that the government presented insufficient evidence that they participated in the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.the analysis of this issue is.first,this court asks whether the government proved the defendant intent to engage in the charged scheme.see united states reyes,cir.second,we ask whether the government proved that the defendant had some knowledge of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy.id.in this case,the record is replete with evidence that would have permitted the jury to determine that todd,rose,and fisher each intended to engage in the conspiracy and were also fully aware of its unlawful aims.with respect to todd,two cooperating witnesses testified that he frequently sold crack cocaine in the vicinity of east street in the bronx.one witness testified that todd performed sales after receiving packages of crack cocaine from thompson and rodriguez.another witness testified that he had observed todd selling crack cocaine with thompson and rodriguez.law enforcement officers testified that todd functioned as a look out during at least one narcotics sale by members of the conspiracy,that in january he was arrested with rose and rodriguez after selling crack cocaine to an undercover officer,and that todd cell phone directory contained the telephone numbers of the other members of the conspiracy.
rose argues that the government failed to demonstrate that his conduct amounted to anything more than isolated sales of narcotics unrelated to the conspiracy alleged in the indictment.the evidence at trial,however,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,permitted the jury to conclude that rose sold narcotics with the other members of the conspiracy.police officers testified that in september rose and robinson sold crack to an undercover officer and that in january rose was arrested with todd and rodriguez after selling crack to an nypd detective.officers also testified that rose was observed with rodriguez and robinson in front of one of the conspirators stash houses on east street in the bronx and that rose was seen exchanging small objects for money on east street shortly after speaking with rodriguez.
the evidence at trial was also sufficient to demonstrate that fisher participated in the conspiracy.a police witness testified that fisher was arrested in april for selling crack to an undercover officer on east street.a cooperating witnesses testified that fisher gave money to and received drugs from rodriguez and thompson on a daily basis.another cooperating witness testified that fisher,along with other members of the conspiracy,moved the operation from the bronx to her home in vermont.on appeal,fisher challenges the credibility of the cooperating witnesses.however,in assessing whether there was sufficient evidence to support a defendant conviction,this court will not attempt to a jury credibility determination.united states florez,cir.accordingly,fisher challenge to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses presents no basis to disturb the district court judgment in this case.
