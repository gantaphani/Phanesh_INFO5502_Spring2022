in january,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against laurence greenburg and six other defendants stemming from allegations that these individuals participated in an illegal scheme operating from woolf international woolf in billerica,massachusetts.greenburg subsequently moved to suppress evidence seized from woolf premises during a warrant search conducted by the united states department of agriculture usda.after a hearing,the district court granted the motion on the ground that the warrant application did not establish probable cause for the search.the government appealed.see.the relevant facts are as follows.
in april,federal agents executed a warrant to search woolf premises.the warrant application was supported by an affidavit from bernard walter,a special agent for the office of inspector general of the usda with fourteen years of experience investigating waste,fraud,and abuse perpetrated by usda regulated entities.walter affidavit provided the magistrate issuing the warrant with the following information.
greenburg was an owner of woolf,which makes and packages sandwiches containing meat products for sale to supermarkets,canteens,and convenience stores.woolf is regulated by the usda food safety and inspection service fsis and therefore must operate and maintain records according to usda regulations.as a usda regulated entity,woolf was assigned an fsis inspector who had complete access to woolf premises at all times.fsis records indicated that woolf had engaged in misconduct during the late.
on march,walter met with a woolf employee who provided a confidential tip about an illegal operation that had been operating at woolf for several years.according to the informant,the operation typically took place two days per week at approximately,after woolf lawful activities had concluded,the fsis inspector had left the premises,and most woolf employees had gone home.
as described by the informant,a tractor trailer would arrive after hours at the loading dock,which was used during normal hours to load the woolf delivery truck.the trailer usually contained between and pallets,each containing to boxes of meat.the boxes came in sixty and pound sizes.
the repackaging procedure involved unloading the trailer and moving the boxes into the room used for repackaging.the room,which was not used for meat packaging during woolf normal hours,was not monitored by the fsis inspector,was partially under construction,and had a dirty floor and debris falling from the ceiling.when the repackaging process was underway,the doors to this room were closed and all the windows were covered.
for each delivery,a woolf employee opened the original boxes and exposed frozen,raw meat.the original boxes were and marked with the usda emblem.after the boxes were opened,different procedures were employed depending on the size of the box.with the sixty pound boxes,the top of the box was removed,a new top was placed on the box and,and the box was resealed.this was called a lid job.
with the pound boxes which had no lids,the meat was completely removed and placed into a new box,which was then sealed and.this was called a box job.sometimes during a box job,the meat fell onto the floor but was nevertheless repackaged.
the trailer would depart the woolf premises after being unloaded.a second trailer was typically waiting at the towne plaza in billerica.after the repackaging was complete,the boxes were reloaded onto the pallets,and someone at woolf called the driver of the second trailer.the second trailer arrived at the loading dock,was loaded with the repackaged pallets,and drove away.the original lids and boxes were placed onto a woolf truck and taken offsite for disposal.
the informant reported that approximately ten people worked on the repackaging operation,including greenburg,who was often in charge.the informant was paid approximately an hour for the repackaging work instead of the approximately an hour he earned in regular employment for woolf.greenburg and others told the informant that the repackaging operation was secret and constantly looked out of the windows during the process to make sure that no one was watching.
the informant told walter that the next repackaging operation was scheduled on march,for sometime after based on the informant tip,walter conducted a surveillance of the woolf premises.at on march,walter observed a blue trailer at the woolf loading dock.approximately minutes later,this trailer left the loading dock.at,another trailer was observed parked at the towne plaza.less than an hour later,this trailer arrived at the loading dock,and,after thirty minutes,drove away.
after this surveillance,walter met with the informant and discussed what had just taken place.according to the informant,a trailer containing approximately pallets holding sixty pound boxes of meat had arrived at woolf at all the pallets were unloaded and moved to the repackaging room.woolf employees removed the lids which were printed with the label chicago packers and replaced them with lids displaying the words department of agriculture.the employees stamped the new lids with various dates in march.the boxes were then reloaded onto the pallets.at approximately,another trailer arrived at the loading dock,was loaded with the repackaged meat,and departed.after this trailer left,the woolf delivery truck was loaded with the old lids.
the informant told walter that another repackaging operation was scheduled to begin at on march,and that the boxes for this operation were hidden in an unmarked office across from the woolf business offices.in light of this information,walter conducted a second surveillance on march.at approximately,a trailer arrived at the loading dock.at around,this trailer departed.
after concluding the surveillance,walter met again with the informant,who stated that a trailer had arrived at the loading dock at approximately containing pallets of pound boxes of meat.woolf employees unloaded the boxes and moved them into the repackaging room.the boxes were opened,and the meat was lifted out and put into new boxes.during the process,some of the meat fell onto the floor but was nevertheless repackaged.after the repackaging,the new boxes were sealed,date stamped,and reloaded onto the trailer.the trailer then left,and the old boxes were stored in a locked room for disposal at a later time.according to the informant,the old boxes appeared aged,dirty,and dried out.there were approximately nine hundred more boxes to be used in future repackaging operations concealed in the unmarked office across from the business office.
on april,a magistrate issued a warrant to search woolf premises based on walter affidavit.several days later,federal agents executed the warrant and seized business records,boxes,and several thousand pounds of meat.based in part on the seized materials,greenburg eventually was indicted on counts of tax fraud,mail fraud,money laundering,and conspiring to engage in an illegal scheme.
greenburg subsequently challenged the warrant on the ground that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause for the search because the affidavit did not provide a basis for the magistrate to assess the informant credibility.the district court agreed and ordered the seized evidence suppressed.in making its ruling,the court focused primarily on walter failure to present the magistrate with information about woolf normal business operations.the court reasoned that,without such information,the magistrate could not assess whether the information that walter learned during his surveillance was indicative of criminal activity or merely an observation of woolf normal activities.the district court also ruled that,because the corroboration for the search was inadequate,the leon good faith exception did not apply.see united states leon.
the standard of review applicable to the government appeal is 
we review de novo the district court ultimate determination of whether a given set of facts constituted probable cause.any factual findings are reviewed for clear error.in determining the sufficiency of an affidavit,we consider whether the totality of the circumstances stated in the affidav
