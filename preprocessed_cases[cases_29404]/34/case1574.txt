a jury convicted phillip hamilton of federal program bribery and extortion under color of official right.the convictions arose from charges that,while a state legislator,hamilton secured state funding for a public university in exchange for employment by the university.hamilton appeals,challenging his convictions and sentence.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
from to,hamilton served as a member of the virginia house of delegates.ultimately he became vice chairman of the appropriations committee,which is responsible for the state budget.while serving as a legislator,he also worked as an administrator and then as a consultant for the newport news public schools system.
in august,hamilton arranged to meet with officials from old dominion university,a public university located in norfolk,virginia,to discuss state funding for a new center for teacher quality and educational leadership that old dominion wanted to establish.immediately prior to the meeting,hamilton and his wife exchanged emails discussing their financial difficulties,and hope that the new center would employ hamilton.in their email exchange,hamilton told his wife that he would shoot for a salary of per month.those emails,like all subsequent emails at issue in this case,were sent to or from hamilton public school workplace computer,through his work email account.
the dean of the college of education at old dominion,william graves,testified that,after the initial meeting with hamilton,old dominion president roseann runte directed the dean to hire hamilton,saying,t hat man wants a job,make him director or something.hamilton emailed his wife that the meeting went well and that he had reinforced the idea that if and when an employment opportunity became available,he would like to be compensated in the area of per month.hamilton also emailed dean graves and,after advising the dean to keep this under the radar,explained how best to obtain state funding for the center.in this email,hamilton further stated that,if funding for the center was not included in the governor budget,on my own,i will initiate legislation a budget amendment to create such a center.
four months later,on december,hamilton emailed president runte,reminding her of his interest in employment with the center.the same day,hamilton emailed david blackburn,director of old dominion program for research and evaluation in public schools,explaining that,because the governor budget did not include money for the center,hamilton had proposed a budget amendment to secure million for the center.hamilton added my city retirement is reduced in may.i will need to supplement my current public school income by at least an equal amount director blackburn replied thanks for passing on budget request and specific salary need.i believe ga general assembly will fund and you will be on board.
soon thereafter,hamilton introduced legislation for the first of two appropriations for the center,both of which ultimately passed.director blackburn emailed hamilton are congratulations in order are you our new director in response,hamilton reiterated his salary needs,noting o f course,more than that is always appreciated.director blackburn then posted an announcement for the center director position,but did not interview any of the three applicants for the position.instead,hamilton was selected as center director,at a salary of per year,even though he had not filed an application for the position.dean graves testified that,but for hamilton legislative assistance,the center would not have offered hamilton the position.hamilton later suggested flowing the money for his center employment through the school system payroll and generally concealing his position as director of the center.hamilton explained at one point in an email to blackburn,looks like they are digging.
on the basis of the above evidence,the government charged hamilton with bribery concerning federal program funds in violation of a b,and extortion under color of official right in violation of.the jury convicted him of both crimes.the district court then sentenced him to months imprisonment.hamilton noted a timely appeal.
hamilton most substantial appellate argument challenges the district court admission into evidence of emails he sent to and received from his wife.he maintains that the admission of these emails violated the marital communications privilege.we review evidentiary rulings,including rulings on privilege,for abuse of discretion,see nlrb interbake foods,llc,cir,factual findings as to whether a privilege applies for clear error,and the application of legal principles de novo.in re grand jury subpoena,cir.
communications between spouses,privately made,are generally assumed to have been intended to be confidential,and hence they are privileged.wolfle united states.see also united states parker,cir powell.this is so because marital confidences are regarded as so essential to the preservation of the marriage relationship as to outweigh the disadvantages to the administration of justice which the privilege entails.wolfle,at.but,of course,to be covered by the privilege,a communication between spouses must be confidential voluntary disclosure of a communication waives the privilege.id.at.the government maintains that hamilton waived the marital communications privilege by communicating with his wife on his workplace computer,through his work email account,and subsequently failing to safeguard the emails.
wolfle,the leading marital communications privilege case to have reached the supreme court,provides an analogy useful in resolving hamilton privilege claim.in wolfle,the court held that a defendant communication with his wife did not come within the privilege because of his voluntary disclosure of the communication to a third person,his stenographer.at.the court explained that,n ormally husband and wife may conveniently communicate without stenographic aid,and the privilege of holding their confidences immune from proof in court may be reasonably enjoyed and preserved without embracing within it the testimony of third persons to whom such communications have been voluntarily revealed.id.at.because t he privilege suppresses relevant testimony,it should be allowed only when it is plain that marital confidence can not otherwise reasonably be preserved,and n othing in this case suggests any such necessity.id.at.
in hamilton case,email has become the modern stenographer.like the communications to the stenographer in wolfle time,emails today,in common experience,are confidential.see id.at see also aba comm.on ethics prof l responsibility,formal noting that email pose s no greater risk of interception or disclosure than other modes of communication commonly relied upon as having a reasonable expectation of privacy and so there is generally a reasonable expectation of privacy in its use.
but just as spouses can conveniently communicate without use of a stenographer,they can also conveniently communicate without using a work email account on an office computer.see wolfle,at.therefore,as in wolfle,it is hardly plain that marital confidence can not reasonably be preserved without according the privilege to the spousal communications at issue here.see id.at.accordingly,that one may generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy in email,at least before a policy is in place indicating otherwise,does not end our inquiry.
hamilton ignores this guidance from wolfle and focuses solely on the fact that,in,when he used his workplace email system to send the emails for which he claims privilege,his public school employer had no computer usage policy.this is true,but the school system adopted a computer policy well prior to the investigation of,and charges against,hamilton.the computer policy,as revised in,expressly provides that users have no expectation of privacy in their use of the computer system and a ll information created,sent,received,accessed,or stored in the computer system is subject to inspection and monitoring at any time.moreover,it is undisputed that forms accepting this policy were electronically signed in hamilton name,and that hamilton had to acknowledge the policy by pressing
