background facts and procedural history 
on february,carlos vega was arrested when he picked up over two pounds of heroin from a woman named lydia miranda in a sting operation arranged by the government.miranda had been caught smuggling approximately one gram of heroin into the united states from aruba on february.she was apprehended at newark international airport in newark,new jersey by united states customs officials and arrested.she then agreed to cooperate with the government by placing recorded telephone calls to a person in columbia named jairo,whom she claimed had hired her to transport the drugs.during one of these calls on february,jairo instructed miranda to call a telephone number and tell the person who answered that she was calling on jairo behalf.
when miranda made the call to the number provided by jairo,a man answered and instructed her to call him again at a second number.when miranda called the second number,the speaker identified himself as carlos and told her that he had spoken to jairo the night before.he arranged to meet miranda at a mcdonald restaurant in queens,new york the next day and described himself so that miranda would be able to identify him.he also stated that he would meet her on jairo behalf.the next day,miranda went to the mcdonald and paged the the man at a number he had provided her.when the defendant,carlos vega,arrived,he called miranda and told her he was outside mcdonald.miranda then met vega outside.he asked her to get into his car and,when she began to comply,they were both arrested.
at the time of arrest,vega had on him a piece of paper that stated jairo de parte de,which means on behalf of jairo.the paper also referenced miranda pager number and the number of pellets of heroin that she carried.officers found money remittance forms in vega car with the name harold carbajal on them.vega told the officers that his nickname was nacho,and that he had come to meet miranda because a mutual friend named alejandro had told him that miranda needed plumbing work done in her apartment which he could provide.
after vega was arrested,he gave law enforcement officers permission to answer his cellular phone.special agent velez intercepted five telephone calls.he later testified before the jury that the same caller,a male,made the first four calls.each time the caller asked to speak with vega,and velez answered that vega was unavailable because he was fixing his car.velez further testified that the fifth call he intercepted was made by a different man,whom velez recognized as jairo based on voice identification from previously recorded calls between miranda and jairo.in that call,jairo threatened vega and stated,it best if he turned over what he had.
vega was charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin in violation of a and.at trial,the court was informed that juror had felt uncomfortable because someone in the back of the courtroom was staring at him.judge cooper then conducted a voir dire of juror in order to determine whether he would be able to continue as an impartial witness and whether he had communicated his concerns to any other jurors.this voir dire occurred while the jury was out of the courtroom on a lunch break.
during the voir dire,juror stated that he had noticed that a man in the gallery was watching him very intently when he was watching vega during a playback of one of the recorded tapes.he explained that when he had leaned forward to avoid the man gaze,the man in the gallery had moved to keep eye contact with him.he told judge cooper my impression was i was uncomfortable and that someone was paying attention to me specifically.judge cooper instructed juror that the particular individual who had been staring at him would be asked to leave the courtroom thereafter,and that all family members of vega would be told that they were not to engage in any eye contact with any juror.
during the voir dire,judge cooper also permitted defense counsel to question juror about his ability to continue as an impartial juror.in response,juror stated that the reason he had raised the issue to the court was that he had heard stories of retaliation in drug cases and he felt uncomfortable as a result of the staring.however,he declined an offer to be escorted to his car from the courthouse for the remainder of the trial.he also responded that he would be able to continue as a fair and impartial juror because he knew the court was aware of the situation.
juror was permitted to continue as a juror.upon returning to the courtroom,the other jurors were informed that juror had been in the courtroom without them for reasons unrelated to the evidence in vega case.as it turns out,the spectator who had been staring at juror was vega brother,but the court did not inform juror of this fact.
later during the trial,the government sought to admit evidence of vega participation in a drug conspiracy in.the evidence consisted of documents handed over to law enforcement officers by one of the in the conspiracy.it also included the testimony of three lee,a customs official,domingo garcia,a postal inspector,and detective david kosloske of the police the circumstances under which these documents were in the government hands.
lee testified that a packaged computer monitor containing heroin had been intercepted at the foreign mail facility in miami,florida in september.garcia testified that he obtained a warrant permitting him to install a beeper into the package and that he called detective kosloske at the dade county detective office to make plans to attempt a controlled delivery of the package in order to determine the participants in the sending and receiving of the package.garcia and kosloske set up surveillance to apprehend any individual who accepted delivery of the package.they witnessed a young woman,named maria arocha,pick up the package and get into a green honda driven by vega.they followed the vehicle to the apartment complex where arocha and vega were detained and questioned.
kosloske testified that arocha gave him spiral notebooks that reflected expenses related to the narcotic organization she was working for.these notebooks contained frequent references to the name harol alfredo carbajal,whom the government alleges is the same person referred to as jairo in this case.they also mentioned vega,and his nickname,nacho.finally,among the documents handed over by arocha was a bill of sale for a green honda that was signed by vega and made out to a person named jose hernandez,whose name also appeared in the spiral notebooks.
vega was never charged with participation in the conspiracy in part because he told officers that he was unaware of the contents of the package picked up by arocha.nevertheless,the above testimony regarding vega participation in the drug conspiracy,photocopies of pages from the spiral notebooks provided by arocha,and the bill of sale for the green honda were admitted into evidence against vega to demonstrate his knowledge of a drug conspiracy,and his relationship with one of its members,when he was apprehended receiving heroin from miranda on february.
the jury found vega guilty of the drug conspiracy charge.vega,in anticipation of his sentencing,met with the government for a proffer in the effort to comply with,which for offenses provides in certain instances an exception or safety valve to a mandatory minimum sentence.based on the belief that vega truthfully provided all information he had concerning the offense charged as part of a common scheme,he received a two level downward adjustment.vega also received a two level downward adjustment pursuant to b for his minor role in the offense.his final offense level was,criminal history category i,which resulted in a sentencing range of to months.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,five years supervised release,a fine and a special assessment of.thereafter,vega filed a timely appeal.
vega challenges his conviction on three grounds.first,he alleges that the district court improperly admitted evidence from the drug conspiracy that should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence b.second,he challenges the district court decision to admit the spiral notebooks received from arocha apartment,and the cellular phone conversations intercepted by special agent velez,as evidence in furtherance of conspiracy under federal rule of evidence d e.finally,vega maintains that the district court erred by failing to dismiss juror after he admitted that he felt threatened by a spectator at the trial.
ii.exclusion under rule b 
vega argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence from the drug conspiracy that should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence b.the evidence that vega complains of includes testimony by the government witnesses regarding his participation in the drug conspiracy,photocopies of pages from the spiral notebooks provided by arocha,and the bill of sale for the green honda taken from arocha apartment.
four guidelines given by the supreme court govern the admission of prior bad acts the evidence must have a proper purpose under rule b it must be relevant under rule its probative value must outweigh its potential for unfair prejudicial effect under rule and the court must charge the jury to consider the evidence only for the limited purpose for which it is admitted.huddleston united states,d united states console,cir government of virgin islands edwards,cir.vega argues that the government evidence from the conspiracy was not introduced for a proper purpose under rule b and was irrelevant under rule.he also contends that this evidence should have been excluded under rule because its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value.we disagree.
the district court determined that the evidence was proffered for two permissible purposes to demonstrate vega knowledge of the drug conspiracy,and to show his relationship with a member of the drug conspiracy named jairo.evidence of prior bad acts may be admitted for the purpose of demonstrating the defendant knowledge in the later offense with which he is charged.see console,at evidence that the defendants had previously received and submitted fraudulent bills from other doctors was admissible for the purpose of demonstrating the defendants knowing receipt of fraudulent bills.an additional unenumerated yet permissible purpose for admitting evidence under rule b is to demonstrate a continuing relationship between an unindicted and the defendant united states scarfo,cir see also united states,cir evidence properly admitted to show,inter alia,the parties familiarity with one another,and their coordinated action.thus prior bad act evidence may be admitted for the purpose of demonstrating vega knowledge of a conspiracy and relationship with one of its members 
vega contends that the evidence should have been excluded nonetheless because it is not relevant to demonstrate his knowledge and relationship with a member of the conspiracy.he directs our attention to the fact that he never opened the package containing drugs in and was never arrested nor charged with any crime related to the drug transaction.
however,rule b applies to evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts,not just charged crimes or convictions.it does not require that a defendant participation in the prior bad act be proven by conviction.indeed,we have previously found prior bad acts of defendants relevant without any indication that they had been charged with or convicted of crimes stemming from those acts.see,console,at evidence that defendants received and submitted fraudulent bills from other doctors was relevant toward demonstrating that the defendants knew the bills were fraudulent see also united states atwell,cir testimony that various suppliers had previously paid the defendant kickbacks was admissible for purposes of demonstrating that the defendant had intended and planned a later kickback scheme.
moreover,the supreme court has explained that evidence of a similar prior bad act is relevant if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.huddleston,at.it expressly opted for this lower standard of proof instead of the more rigid preponderance of evidence or clearly convincing evidence standards.see id.at.
in this case,arocha admitted there was a drug conspiracy in and turned over documents including spiral notebooks that she claimed contained expenses related to the narcotic organization she was working for.it also referred to vega and his nickname,nacho.among the documents provided by arocha was a bill of sale for the green honda that connected vega to jose hernandez,who was also mentioned in the spiral notebooks.finally,the government witnesses testified that they observed arocha get into a green honda driven by vega after picking up the heroin package at the foreign mail facility in miami.vega was thus connected to the green honda described in the bill of sale and to jose hernandez,who was listed in the spiral notebooks allegedly documenting transactions in the drug conspiracy.based on this evidence,a jury could reasonably conclude that the alleged drug conspiracy occurred,and that vega was a participant in it.see huddleston,at.moreover,the jury could infer from vega involvement in the prior drug conspiracy that he did not unwittingly participate in the drug transaction with arocha in,and that he had a relationship with jairo,who participated in both conspiracies.the government evidence was therefore relevant to show vega knowledge of,and relationship with a member of,the conspiracy.
united states,cir,does not persuade us otherwise.in that case,the ninth circuit reviewed whether evidence of the defendant prior arrest for possession with intent to distribute heroin was relevant to show that he later knowingly imported pounds of marijuana into the united states from mexico.id.at.the court believed that the evidence was not logically relevant to demonstrate knowledge because it was unreasonable to expect that the incident would have put on notice that every car in which he rode thereafter could contain drugs.id.
however,the government case against vega does not rely on the inference that a defendant who has been once burned is twice shy,as it did in put differently,it does not attempt to demonstrate the defendant knowing possession by referring back to an earlier possession offense.rather,the government argues,and we agree,that evidence of vega participation in a prior drug conspiracy is probative of his knowledge of,and relationship with a member of,a later drug conspiracy.
we also find no error in the district court finding that the probative value of this evidence outweighed its potential for unfair prejudicial effect.see,united states,cir,rev on other grounds by,d united states echeverri,cir.we have previously cautioned that i f judicial is ever desirable,it is when a rule analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.scarfo,at quoting united states long,cir.
in this case,the government evidence of vega participation in the drug conspiracy was of critical importance because vega had denied knowledge of the conspiracy and alleged that he met miranda merely to provide plumbing services.the evidence was highly probative in demonstrating that vega knew he was receiving a
