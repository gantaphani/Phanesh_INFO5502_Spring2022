in united states sparks,cir,we held that the warrantless installation of a global positioning system gps device on a defendant automobile and the use of that device to monitor his and a movements for eleven days fell within the exception to the exclusionary rule,because the monitoring had occurred before the supreme court decided that the installation and use of a gps tracker on a car constitutes a fourth amendment search.see united states jones,d.today,we are faced with another instance of warrantless gps tracking,but of a significantly longer duration.we nonetheless conclude that this case falls within the rule laid out in sparks,and we therefore affirm.
facts background 
jose baez was charged with,and ultimately pled guilty to,four counts of arson.he challenges the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence that the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf obtained by monitoring his black chevrolet caprice using a gps device.the gps tracking began in august and continued for days the atf decided to track baez car as a result of two fires that occurred earlier that year the first on april,at jamaica plain auto body in jamaica plain,massachusetts,and the second on july,in a brownstone building in boston that housed both condominium units and a dentist office known as back bay dental.
at the scenes of both fires,surveillance cameras captured and recorded the image of an,chevrolet caprice with silver trim,a steering wheel cover,and a silver emblem located on the driver side of the car.using the surveillance footage,atf agents concluded that the car had been manufactured sometime between and.they then obtained,from the massachusetts registry of motor vehicles rmv,a list of all of the chevrolet caprices manufactured during that time period and registered to addresses in the boston area.the agents located and observed each of the vehicles on that list and,according to the district court,determined that a chevrolet caprice belonging to baez,unlike most of the other vehicles reviewed,matched the distinguishing characteristics of the vehicle in the surveillance tapes.united states baez,d.
the atf also discovered that baez was the only owner of a chevrolet caprice on the rmv list who had been a patient at back bay dental.the office manager at back bay dental reported that baez had become angry in june when he had to have his veneers and had threatened not to pay for the procedure.in addition,the atf investigation revealed that baez had been a customer at jamaica plain auto body,had been dissatisfied with the shop work on a chevrolet impala in the summer of,and had filed an unsuccessful claim against the shop in small claims court.
thus,on august,acting without a warrant,atf agent brian oppedisano attached a gps device to baez caprice while it was parked on a public road in front of baez home.the atf set up a virtual perimeter around baez residence and programmed the gps device to send a text message to agent oppedisano whenever the caprice traveled outside that perimeter agent oppedisano would then determine whether physical surveillance of the caprice was necessary.agent oppedisano testified that he looked at the gps location logs once every day or two,and that agents conducted periodic physical surveillance of the caprice even when it did not travel outside the perimeter to ensure that it was actually located where the gps device said it was.
as it turned out,baez drove the caprice relatively infrequently he appears to have used another car an acura mdx as his primary vehicle during the nearly monitoring period,the caprice traveled outside the perimeter on just days,six of which were during the week before the final fire that led to baez arrest.
that fire occurred on august,at firth road in roslindale,massachusetts.at that day,agent oppedisano received a text message alerting him that the caprice had left the perimeter.from a website available to him,agent oppedisano determined that the car was stopped near bexley road in roslindale,which runs parallel to firth road.because this was an unusual travel pattern for baez,and given that the april and july fires had occurred at a similar time of day,agent oppedisano alerted law enforcement and directed officers to the area.at around the same time,a fire was reported at firth road,a home.after being shown a photo array,two of the residents of firth road identified baez as a man who had sold them dominican lottery tickets.
shortly after the fire was reported,an officer from the boston police department located baez in his vehicle in front of his residence and arrested him.footage from surveillance cameras near baez home confirmed his travel in the direction of firth road that night,and searches of his person,his car,his residence,and two garages that he had rented revealed various materials associated with arson.the searches of baez residence and one of the garages also tied him to a december fire at a whole foods grocery store in cambridge,massachusetts.
in september,following his indictment,baez moved to suppress all of the evidence obtained as a result of the gps monitoring of his vehicle.with the consent of both parties,the district court decided to hold the motion until the supreme court reached its decision in jones.in january,the court announced that the government installation of a gps device on a target vehicle,and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle movements,constitutes a search for fourth amendment purposes.jones.at footnote omitted.the district court convened a motion hearing and ordered supplemental briefing.in july,the district court denied baez motion to suppress,concluding that,under davis united states,d,suppression would not serve the purposes of the exclusionary rule,because,when he installed the gps device and engaged in the monitoring,agent oppedisano had a good faith basis to rely upon a substantial consensus among precedential courts.baez,d at.
after baez filed his notice of appeal but before the parties briefed the case,we decided sparks,in which federal agents had tracked a defendant car for eleven days using a gps device,without a warrant and before jones was decided.at.we concluded that the exception to the exclusionary rule applied because,at the time that the gps surveillance occurred,settled,binding precedent in the form of united states knotts,d,and united states moore,cir,authorized the agents conduct.sparks,at.the question before us today is whether those same cases authorized the use of the gps device on baez car.
ii.analysis 
because baez challenges the district court legal conclusion that suppression was not warranted under the exclusionary rule,our review is de novo.see united states ryan,cir.we begin by briefly sketching the relevant legal landscape for a more detailed exposition of the case law,we refer the reader to sparks.see at.
the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future fourth amendment violations.id.at quoting davis.at see also united states thomas,cir noting that,under herring united states,d,the exclusionary rule is only available where the benefits of deterring the police misconduct that produced the fourth amendment violation outweigh the costs of excluding relevant evidence.when the police engage in conduct that complies with existing precedent,and the law later changes,there is nothing to deter the police can not modify their conduct to accord with cases not yet decided.sparks,at.thus,in davis,the supreme court held that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.at.
in sparks,we interpreted that language as requiring precedent that is clear and.at quoting united states davis,cir,aff,d.we went on to examine whether clear and precedent authorized the gps monitoring at issue in sparks.that monitoring occurred a little over two years before the supreme court decided,in jones,that installing a gps device on a vehicle and using that device to track the vehicle constitutes a fourth amendment search.we concluded that,before jones was decided,two cases governed the installation and use of a gps device on a vehicle in this circu
