opinion of the court 
this appeal by marshall rountree,from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of new jersey denying his habeas corpus petition,requires us to decide if the new jersey superior court,appellate division,was unreasonable in concluding that alleged violations of rountree sixth amendment right to counsel did not undermine the reliability of the sentence he received for an armed robbery he committed in camden county,new jersey.applying provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we conclude that the new jersey appellate court decision in this case was not contrary to and did not unreasonably apply federal law,nor was it based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.d.we will therefore affirm the district court.
within the span of two weeks in july of marshall rountree,who also uses the name mark hawkins,perpetrated two unrelated firearm incidents in new jersey an armed robbery in camden county,and a shooting in essex county.the essex county shooting occurred on a street,after rountree and two companions encountered the boyfriend of one of the men sisters.the men exchanged words,then blows.at some point,rountree drew a revolver and shot the boyfriend,rendering him paraplegic.the camden county robbery occurred two weeks later when rountree covered his face with a white towel,approached a woman from behind a dumpster in her apartment building parking lot and said,i have a gun.give me your purse or i shoot you.she surrendered the purse,and called the police after he fled the scene.minutes later,rountree,carrying a white towel,was spotted near a shopping mall.officers arrested him and recovered various items that had been inside the woman purse,but did not recover a pistol.rountree waived his miranda rights and provided a taped confession in which he claimed he robbed the woman with a toy pistol and then discarded it into a nearby wooded area.later,during plea bargaining,he swore under oath that the pistol was real.
both crimes were subject to new jersey graves act,which sets forth mandatory penalties if a person used or was in possession of a firearm during or in flight from a violent offense.see stat.ann.c,d,g,h,d.of particular importance to this appeal is a graves act provision,which substantially enhances sentences if a person who possesses or uses a firearm during a crime has been previously convicted of an offense involving the use or possession of a firearm.c.
in,a grand jury in camden county indicted rountree for armed robbery and hindering justice.the same year,he was also indicted in essex county for conspiracy to commit murder,attempted murder,aggravated assault,unlawful possession of a weapon,and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.plea negotiations occurred separately in each county.soon after they began,rountree camden county attorney obtained judicial and prosecutorial permission to consolidate the camden county and essex county negotiations into one plea bargaining session,pursuant to rule a of the new jersey rules of court,which provides in pertinent part 
w hen a defendant has charges pending in more than one county at any stage prior to sentencing,either the defendant,or the prosecutor in any such county with the consent of the defendant,may move before the presiding judge of the criminal part in the county in which consolidation is sought,or before any judge designated to hear such motion,for consolidation for purposes of entering a plea or for sentencing.
although there was every indication that a rule a motion would have been granted,rountree camden county attorney failed to file one and,as a result,the negotiations continued separately.
as early as march of,prosecutors offered rountree a choice regarding his camden county charges he could plead guilty to act offenses in return for a year sentence,or he could plead guilty to a graves act offense in return for a year sentence.if accepted,either offer would have resolved rountree camden county charges,but not his essex county charges.rountree attorney wrote him a letter explaining the enhancement effect that a graves act conviction would have on any sentence that might be imposed for the shooting in essex county,and recommended the year act offer.nonetheless,rountree chose the year offer.under the plea agreement,rountree sentence was to run concurrently with any sentence imposed for the charges related to the shooting he had committed in essex county.
in the fall of,after entering his plea in camden county but before the court accepted the plea and sentenced him,rountree was transferred to essex county to address the charges there.prosecutors and rountree were unable to reach a plea agreement,and the case went to trial.in october of,a jury convicted rountree of attempted murder,aggravated assault,and two separate firearm crimes.he received a year graves act sentence.soon after he was sentenced,however,and under threat of appeal,prosecutors agreed that faulty jury instructions required a new trial.before retrial,and after much negotiation,rountree pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose both of which are graves act offenses.the essex county court accepted rountree plea and sentenced him to two concurrent year prison terms,during the first half of which he would be ineligible for parole.at this time rountree stood convicted of his first graves act offense.
rountree then returned to camden county in july of to complete sentencing on his plea to the offenses still pending there.somewhat unexpectedly,the camden county court rejected the plea agreement.it explained that the year sentence rountree had accepted before his transfer to essex county was either too lenient for the crimes he had committed or,alternatively,was illegal.the court reasoned thusly even if rountree had used a toy pistol as he initially claimed the year sentence the government had offered was too lenient under new jersey law alternatively,if the pistol was real,then the sentence was illegal under the graves act which requires extended prison time for repeat firearm offenders given rountree recent graves act conviction in essex county.rountree responded by withdrawing his guilty plea.
the camden county case was set for trial in april of,and plea negotiations continued.on the day of trial,the camden county prosecutor offered rountree a year sentence with a year term of parole ineligibility,to run concurrently with the year sentence he had received in essex county hereinafter,the april offer.rountree rejected it.he explained to the court that he was not interested in the prosecutor offer because he believed that the time he had already served in essex county was dead time,that it would not count toward either of his sentences.the trial court explained that regardless of whether he accepted the plea,his time served would indeed count toward his essex county sentence,but would not count toward his camden county sentence.rountree reiterated his rejection of the plea,the trial proceeded,and a jury convicted him of armed robbery a graves act crime and of hindering justice.
the camden county sentencing judge determined that,given rountree prior essex county graves act conviction,rountree was a person who had been previously convicted of a graves act crime.see stat.ann.c.the court then applied the graves act provision and imposed a year sentence,with parole eligibility after years and months,to run consecutively with his year essex county sentence.
rountree challenged his conviction and his sentence on direct appeal,and the new jersey superior court,appellate division,affirmed.state hawkins.the supreme court of new jersey denied rountree petition for certiorari.state hawkins.
rountree then sought relief on several grounds,including that his camden county attorney failure to consolidate his camden county and essex county plea bargaining into one,negotiation violated his sixth amendment right to counsel.see state rountree.the state court agreed that the camden county attorney failure to file a motion to consolidate fell below what is expected of counsel within the meaning of the sixth amendment,but held that the failure to consolidate was not prejudicial to rountree case because the record indicated that he would not have accepted any offer likely to emerge from a consolidated negotiation.id.at.the supreme court of new jersey denied review.state rountree.this exhausted rountree state court remedies.
rountree then filed in the district court an habeas corpus petition.see rountree balicki,wl.his petition challenged the state court ruling as to his camden county but not his essex county sentence,alleging that deficient performance by his camden county counsel undermined the reliability of his camden county sentence.on november,the district court applied the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa and denied rountree petition on the merits.id.at.
less than days later,on december,rountree filed in the district court a pro se motion for extension of time to file for a certificate of appealability.on february,he filed a motion for a certificate of appealability with this court.one year later,on february,we certified the appealability of three issues whether his untimely notice of appeal deprived this court of jurisdiction whether his trial counsel was ineffective,and,if so whether his trial counsel conduct was prejudicial to his case.
five months later,on july,rountree filed a motion to expand his certificate of appealability to include certification of whether the state court acted contrary to,or unreasonably applied,clearly established federal law when it held that the supreme court decisions in apprendi new jersey,and blakely washington,did not retroactively invalidate rountree camden county sentence any relevant sentencing implications from his not having been indicted for possession of a firearm in camden county whether the camden county trial judge made improper responses to jury questions and whether other crimes evidence and unindicted juvenile acts were improperly admitted during his camden county trial.we granted the motion.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to because rountree habeas petition alleged that he was incarcerated in violation of the united states constitution,see rountree balicki,wl,at,and because rountree exhausted his state court avenues for relief,see state rountree.we have jurisdiction under a because rountree met the requirements for a timely pro se notice of appeal,and because he obtained a certificate of appealability.see id.c.
the government contends that rountree notice of appeal was untimely,thus depriving us of jurisdiction over his appeal from the district court.we disagree.this case falls within rule a,federal rules of appellate procedure,because this is a civil case to which the united states is not a party.rule a a provides that a notice of appeal must be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.our local appellate rules relax certain formalities for pro se habeas petitioners,including rountree 
the court will deem a document filed by a pro se litigant after the decision of the district court in a civil,criminal,or habeas corpus case to be a notice of appeal despite informality in its form or title,if it evidences an intention to appeal.
cir.notice of appeal in pro se cases.this rule is designed to emphasize that the jurisdictional requirement of a notice of appeal is met in a pro se case by the filing of an informal document.committee comments.
in this case,the district court entered its denial of habeas corpus relief on november.rountree,wl,at.days later,on december,rountree filed a pro se motion for extension of time to file for a certificate of appealability.see rountree balicki,wl,at,petitioner motion for an extension of time is dated december,and was docketed by the clerk on december.by indicating he would file for a certificate of appealability,his pro se motion evidence d an intention to appeal,which means it constituted a notice of appeal pursuant to local appellate rule.because rountree filed that motion within the day timeline proscribed by rule a a,his notice of appeal was timely.and,because he obtained a certificate of appealability,we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
the state court denied rountree strickland washington claim on the merits,which means our review of his petition is subject to aedpa.see a,d.under aedpa,our task is to determine only whether the state court adjudication of rountree strickland claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.consistent with supreme court precedent,we read d to require three distinct legal inquiries.see,harrington richter.the first is whether the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the second is whether the state court decision involved an unreasonable application of such law.d.and the third is whether the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state court.d.
the test for d unreasonable application of clause is as follows a n unreasonable application occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of petitioner case.rompilla beard,quoting wiggins smith.for purposes of d,i t is not enough that a federal habeas court,in its independent review of the legal question,is left with a firm conviction that the state court was erroneous.lockyer andrade,internal quotations omitted.under d unreasonable application clause a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.id.at quoting williams taylor.rather,t he state court application of clearly established law must be objectively unreasonable before a federal court may grant the writ.andrade,at.
the test for d contrary to clause is whether the state court decision applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or if it confronts a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court but reaches a different result.brown payton,citing williams,at,and woodford visciotti.of course,a state court resolution of a question that the supreme court has not resolved can be neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,the court precedent.see kane garcia espitia.
the test for d unreasonable determination of facts clause is whether the petitioner has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence,e,that the state court determination of the facts was unreasonable in light of the record.see rice collins,factual findings,moreover,are presumed correct the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.quoting e citing miller el dretke,see also simmons beard,cir under the standard,a district court is bound to presume that the state court factual findings are correct,with the burden on the petitioner to rebut those findings by clear and convincing evidence.importantly,the evidence against which a federal court measures the reasonableness of the state court factual findings is the record evidence at the time of the state court adjudication.cullen pinholster,wl,at.
we will grant relief only if rountree shows that the new jersey state court decision satisfied one of the three tests set forth above.
rountree petitioned the new jersey courts for relief on the basis of an alleged violation of strickland washington,during the proceedings that led to his camden county sentence.a strickland violation occurs when defense counsel conduct falls below an objective standard of reasonableness,and there is a reasonable probability which is more than a mere possibility that but for the counsel failure,the proceeding would have come out differently.id.at.the new jersey court rejected that claim,determining that although rountree counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,that failing did not cause prejudice to rountree.see state rountree.
in this habeas petition,rountree contends that the new jersey court rejection of his strickland claim was unreasonable.we recognize that aedpa precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.richter.at quoting yarborough alvarado.accordingly,we will not surmise whether the state court reached the best or even the correct result in rountree case rather the question we must answer is whether the state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable a standard that is at once objective and deferential.id.at.
applying aedpa,we conclude that the new jersey court decision in this case survives review under.although certain portions of the record can be argued to support rountree petition,it is precisely because fairminded jurists could disagree with each other that we must affirm the state court holding.alvarado,at.we will therefore affirm the district court.
we begin with the new jersey state court interpretation and application of strickland washington ineffectiveness prong.see at.under strickland,rountree first burden in the state court was to demonstrate that his trial counsel conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.the test,which is whether,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,is applied to the facts of the particular case,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct.id.at.
to evaluate properly the decisions the state court made when faced with rountree strickland claim,we must first examine the contentions rountree made there.rountree contended in the state court that his camden county trial counsel failed to render professionally competent assistance,because the counsel did not file a motion under rule a of the new jersey rules of court to consolidate into one negotiation the plea bargaining over all charges pending in both camden and essex counties.he pointed out that his counsel and the camden county judge had discussions about the possibility of such consolidation,and that the transcript of his guilty plea from camden county gave every indication that the judge would have agreed to consolidate,if a motion had been filed.noting that consolidation generally redounds to the benefit of criminal defendants,rountree contended that his counsel failure to file the motion notwithstanding the strong indication that it would have been granted amounted to conduct that fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.at.
the state court agreed with rountree.rountree,at.it applied the new jersey supreme court decision in state pillot,construing rule a to enable a defendant to request consolidation of charges pending in multiple counties for purposes of offering pleas and for sentencing,and concluded that consolidation was legally permissible in rountree case.because consolidation was legally permissible,and given the record strong indication that it would have occurred had a motion been filed,the state court held that rountree counsel had a professional obligation to file a rule a motion.
the district court,which was bound to accept the state court conclusions of state law in applying new jersey rule a,affirmed the state court.see bradshaw richey,we have repeatedly held that a state court interpretation of state law,including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction,binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.citing estelle mcguire,and mullaney wilbur.after accepting that consolidation was possible in rountree case,the district court concluded that the state court did not apply strickland in an unreasonable fashion when it held that any competent new jersey attorney would have filed a rule a motion in these circumstances.
we will affirm the district court for substantially the same reasons we too are bound to accept the state court announcement that the pillot decision obliges new jersey defense attorneys to move to consolidate plea negotiations when the facts indicate the motion will be granted,see richey,at,and we agree that the state court interpretation of the facts in this case,its conclusion that a rule a motion to consolidate would have been granted was not objectively unreasonable.we also agree that,in holding that rountree counsel conduct fell short of what an objectively reasonable new jersey attorney would do,the new jersey court correctly applied federal law as stated by the supreme court of the united states.we will therefore affirm the state court conclusion that rountree carried his first burden under strickland washington.
we turn now to the prejudice prong of rountree strickland claim.rountree second strickland burden in the state court was to show that his counsel unprofessional conduct prejudiced his case.at.but his burden before us is greater under aedpa,the question is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination under the strickland standard was incorrect,but whether that determination was unreasonable a substantially higher threshold.knowles mirzayance,quoting schriro landrigan.our task is to determine only whether the state court adjudication of rountree claim warrants relief under d or d.to prevail under those subsections,he must persuade us that the new jersey court holding suffered from one of the following failings it was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of federal law then clearly established in the holdings of the supreme court of the united states or it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before the state court.richter.at quoting d and williams,at.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the state court determination of the prejudice prong of rountree strickland claim was not unreasonable within the meaning of d,and therefore we will affirm.
intelligent evaluation of the state court application of federal law to rountree case requires at least some evaluation of the facts to which the state court applied that law.we therefore pause to set forth the legal rules that applied in,and the arguments rountree made before,the new jersey state court.
rountree strickland burden in the state court required him to demonstrate that the unprofessional errors of his counsel caused him prejudice.at.this is because a n error by counsel,even if professionally unreasonable,does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.id.at citing united states morrison.it is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.id.at.rather,to meet this standard,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at emphasis added.
to meet this standard in the new jersey court,rountree contended that his camden county counsel failure to file a rule a consolidation motion increased his sentence.glover united states.in his view,the failure to consolidate the camden county and essex county charges into one proceeding caused him to be convicted of graves act crimes on two separate occasions,rather than all at once as might have happened after a single,plea.that is,he argued that because he was first convicted of a graves act offense in essex county,he arrived at sentencing in camden county as a previously convicted graves act offender.because the graves act imposes heightened penalties for persons previously convicted of graves act offenses,see stat.ann.c,rountree position in the new jersey court was that the sentencing enhancement applied to him was caused by his counsel ineffective failure to consolidate.essential to rountree position was the implied premise that,if offered a single plea at a consolidated negotiation,he would have acce
