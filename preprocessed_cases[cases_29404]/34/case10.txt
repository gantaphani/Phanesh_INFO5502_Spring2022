per curiam.
in this case,the court of appeals held that respondent,who was convicted of rape and other serious crimes,is entitled to relief under the federal habeas statute because the supreme court of nevada unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court precedent regarding a criminal defendant constitutional right to present a defense.at his trial,respondent unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence for the purpose of showing that the rape victim previously reported that he had assaulted her but that the police had been unable to substantiate those allegations.the state supreme court held that this evidence was properly excluded,and no prior decision of this court clearly establishes that the exclusion of this evidence violated respondent federal constitutional rights.the decision of the court of appeals is therefore reversed.
respondent calvin jackson had a tumultuous romantic relationship with annette heathmon.in,after several previous attempts to end the relationship,heathmon relocated to a new apartment in north las vegas without telling respondent where she was moving.respondent learned of heathmon whereabouts,and on the night of october,he visited her apartment.what happened next was the focus of respondent trial.
heathmon told police and later testified that respondent forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him.after raping heathmon,respondent hit her,stole a ring from her bedroom,and dragged her out of the apartment and toward his car by the neck and hair.a witness confronted the couple,and respondent fled.police observed injuries to heathmon neck and scalp that were with her account of events,and respondent was eventually arrested.
although respondent did not testify at trial,he discussed heathmon allegations with police shortly after his arrest,and his statements were admitted into evidence at trial.respondent acknowledged that heathmon might have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and she was scared that he might do something,tr,but he claimed that the sex was consensual.respondent also admitted striking heathmon inside the apartment but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair.
shortly before trial,heathmon sent the judge a letter recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would not testify.she went into hiding,but police eventually found her and took her into custody as a material witness.once in custody,heathmon disavowed the letter and agreed to testify.when asked about the letter at trial,she stated that three of respondent associates had forced her to write it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared in court.
at trial,the theory of the defense was that heathmon had fabricated the sexual assault and had reported it to police in an effort to control respondent.to support that theory,the defense sought to introduce testimony and police reports showing that heathmon had called the police on several prior occasions claiming that respondent had raped or otherwise assaulted her.police were unable to corroborate many of these prior allegations,and in several cases they were skeptical of her claims.although the trial court gave the defense wide latitude to heathmon about those prior incidents,it refused to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as witnesses the officers involved.the jury found respondent guilty,and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
respondent appealed his conviction to the nevada supreme court,arguing,among other things,that the trial court refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right to present a complete defense,but the nevada supreme court rejected that argument.
after exhausting his remedies in state court,respondent filed a federal habeas petition,again arguing that the trial court ruling had violated his right to present a defense.applying aedpa deferential standard of review,the district court denied relief,but a divided panel of the ninth circuit reversed.the majority held that extrinsic evidence of heathmon prior allegations was critical to respondent defense,that the exclusion of that evidence violated respondent constitutional right to present a defense,and that the nevada supreme court decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this court precedents,at.although it acknowledged that the state court had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of state law,the ninth circuit concluded that the impact of the state rules of evidence on the defense was disproportionate to the state interest in exclusion.at.finding that the trial court erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless,at,the ninth circuit ordered the state either to retry or to release respondent.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa authorizes a federal habeas court to grant relief to a prisoner whose state court conviction involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.it is settled that a federal habeas court may overturn a state court application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that there is no possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court decision conflicts with this court precedents.harrington richter,slip,at.applying that deferential standard,we conclude that the nevada supreme court decision was reasonable.

as the ninth circuit conceded,t he nevada supreme court recognized and applied the correct legal principle.at.but contrary to the ninth circuit conclusion,the state supreme court application of our clearly established precedents was reasonable.the starting point in the state court analysis was a state statute that generally precludes the admission of extrinsic evidence of s pecific instances of the conduct of a witness,for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness credibility,other than conviction of crime.app.to pet.for cert.see.stat.the purpose of that rule,the nevada supreme court has explained,is to focus the on the most important facts and conserve judicial resources by avoiding on collateral issues.abbott state,quoting state long.these are good reason s for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence,clark arizona,and the nevada statute is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that generally precludes the admission of evidence of specific instances of a witness conduct to prove the witness character for untruthfulness.see fed.rule evid.b mueller kirkpatrick,evidence,ed.the constitutional propriety of this rule can not be seriously disputed.
as an exception to the prohibition contained in.stat,the nevada supreme court held in miller state,that in a sexual assault case defense counsel may a complaining witness about previous fabricated sexual assault accusations and,if the witness denies making the allegations,may introduce extrinsic evidence to prove that fabricated charges were made by that witness in the past.app.to pet.for cert.but in order to introduce evidence showing that the witness previously made false allegations,the defendant must file written notice,and the trial court must hold a hearing.miller,supra,at,at.respondent did not file the requisite notice,and the state supreme court upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual assault complaints on this basis.
