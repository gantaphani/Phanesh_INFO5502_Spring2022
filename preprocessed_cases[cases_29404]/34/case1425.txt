opinion of the court 
defendant michael lacy was charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base,or crack cocaine,in violation of a and b.a jury acquitted him of the charged offense,but convicted him of two lesser included offenses,simple possession of more than five grams of cocaine base,in violation of,and possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine base,in violation of a.
on appeal,lacy asks us to vacate his simple possession conviction,raising several claims to the effect that his conviction on more than one lesser included offense arising out of the same charge was improper.we conclude that none of lacy claims provides a proper basis for reversal.accordingly,we will affirm.
michael lacy was arrested by the wilmington,delaware police on june,in a wilmington apartment.the police recovered from his pocket a small plastic bag that contained several individually wrapped small chunks,weighing grams,of a white substance that was later determined to be a mixture containing cocaine base,or crack cocaine.they seized two more plastic bags from the bathroom of the apartment.one contained a large chunk of the substance,weighing grams,and the other contained several more individually wrapped smaller chunks,weighing a total of grams.thus,the police recovered a total of grams of crack cocaine on lacy person and in the bathroom.
lacy was charged,in an indictment,with possessing with intent to distribute five grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base in violation of a and b.before trial,the government asked the district court to include three lesser included offenses in the jury charge and on the verdict form.lacy objected,contending that drug type and quantity are not elements of the offense,but are,instead,sentencing factors under.the district court disagreed with lacy,and,accordingly,instructed the jury orally,and in a written verdict form,that if the jury found that lacy was not guilty of the indicted offense,it could consider whether he was guilty of possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine base in violation of a,and simple possession of more than five grams of cocaine base,in violation of.if the jury found lacy not guilty of both of these offenses,it was instructed to consider whether he was guilty of a third alternative offense,simple possession of an unspecified amount of cocaine base.the jury found lacy not guilty of possession with intent to distribute five grams of cocaine base,but found him guilty of both possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine base and simple possession of more than five grams of cocaine base.
after trial,lacy moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c,arguing that the evidence did not support verdicts on both lesser included offenses,that the jury verdict violated double jeopardy principles and that simple possession of cocaine base is not a lesser included offense of a section a charge for possession with intent to distribute.the district court denied the motion.lacy now appeals.
our jurisdiction to consider lacy appeal from the district court final order of conviction arises under.we exercise plenary review over an appeal from the grant or denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal,applying the same standard as the district court to the individual claims.united states brodie,cir.thus,
we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,and must presume that the jury has properly carried out its functions of evaluating credibility of witnesses,finding the facts,and drawing justifiable inferences.a verdict will be overruled only if no reasonable juror could accept the evidence as sufficient to support the conclusion of the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
united states coleman,cir quoting united states campbell.
lacy urges us to overturn his simple possession conviction,arguing that the federal rules of criminal procedure do not permit conviction for more than one lesser included offense arising out of a single charged offense,that simple possession is not a lesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute,that his convictions violate the double jeopardy clause of the constitution and that the evidence presented was insufficient to support his conviction of both the simple possession and the possession with intent to distribute offenses.we address these claims in turn.
federal rule of criminal procedure c 
federal rule of criminal procedure c provides a defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged.lacy argues that,because the rule is phrased in the singular,it prohibits conviction on more than one lesser included offense for each offense charged.if congress and the supreme court had intended to allow multiple convictions for lesser included offenses under the rule,he contends,they would have said that a defendant may be found guilty of offenses,not an offense,necessarily included in the offense charged.
we disagree that the rule is so limited,for several reasons.first,the advisory committee notes to rule c indicate that the rule is a restatement of existing law.specifically,the rule replaced the provision in the act of june,that stated that in all criminal cases the defendant may be found guilty of any offence the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the indictment.schmuck united states,d quoting act of june,ch,stat.emphasis added.the word any suggests that a defendant may be found guilty of several offenses other than that charged in the indictment,so long as all such offenses are necessarily included in the charged offense.thus,the idea that a defendant may be convicted of multiple lesser included offenses arising out of a single charge in an indictment is rooted in the history of the rule the change in the text from any offence to an offense does not appear to reflect a change in its meaning.
second,lacy has not advanced,and we can not fathom,any principle that would prevent us from applying the rule according to this tradition.we are satisfied that defendants rights are adequately protected by existing limitations on the application of the rule.the supreme court has adopted a test for determining when an offense is necessarily included in the offense charged under rule c 
o ne offense is not necessarily included in another unless the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the charged offense.where the lesser offense requires an element not required for the greater offense,no instruction is to be given under rule c.
id.at.this test protects defendants rights by ensuring that they have constitutionally sufficient notice that they face conviction on all lesser included offenses.see id.at.further,the common law rule bar ring conviction for both an offense and a lesser included offense arising from the same conduct,paul robinson et,crim.defs.d supp,neutralizes any potential prejudice to the defendant by prohibiting multiple lesser included offense convictions for the same acts.as long as these rules are satisfied,as they are here,see section below,we see no reason not to allow multiple convictions for lesser included offenses on the same charged offense under rule c.
third,a finding that rule c supports only a single lesser included offense conviction would require us,in cases where more than one lesser included offense satisfies the schmuck elements test,to develop some mechanism for selecting which offense should be charged.lacy has not explained what criteria should guide this choice,and,because this issue has not been addressed in the case law,we would be arbitrarily creating such a test.we think the sounder practice is to conclude,consistent with the history of rule c,that all lesser included offenses that satisfy the test established by the supreme court may be charged simultaneously,and may support separate convictions,as long as the various lesser included offenses relate to different conduct,are not lesser included offenses of one another.
lacy lesser included offense claim 
lacy argues that simple possession of five or more grams of cocaine base,in violation of,is not necessarily included in the offense with which he was charged,possession with intent to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base,in violation of a and b.we do not agree and,in fact,find that his convictions of both lesser included offenses fit well within the parameters described above.
as noted above,an offense necessarily included in the offense charged under federal rule of criminal procedure c is one that does not require proof of any additional element beyond those required by the greater offense.gov t of the virgin islands joseph,cir emphasis omitted.to resolve lacy claim,then,we must compare the elements of the charged offense with those of the convicted offense.
we have addressed this question once before.in,we noted,without further explanation,that t he crime of simple possession under is a lesser offense included within the offense of possession with intent to distribute under a.united states frorup,cir citing united states,cir however,changes in the law regarding what constitutes an element of an offense,as a result of the supreme court opinion in apprendi new jersey,d,require that we examine this issue anew.
after apprendi,o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.such facts are the functional equivalent s of elements of an aggravated offense that carries a higher statutory maximum penalty.id.at.see also united states barbosa,cir explaining apprendi.thus,we held,in united states barbosa,at,and united states vazquez,cir en banc,that drug identity and quantity must be treated as elements of a section possession with intent to distribute offense when taking either factor into account increases the applicable statutory maximum.although we have not previously discussed this issue in the context of a section simple possession offense,we conclude that applying apprendi to that statute yields the same result that we reached with respect to section drug identity and quantity should be considered the functional equivalents of elements of a simple possession offense when they increase a defendant maximum statutory sentence exposure.
lacy was charged with knowingly possess ing with intent to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base,a schedule ii narcotic controlled substance,in violation of title,united states code,sections a and b.the statutory provision under which lacy was charged in the indictment,a,provides it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance.thus,the elements of the base offense are knowing or intentional possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.
lacy indictment did not just charge the base offense,however it specified a particular drug type and amount.we apply the tests from barbosa and vazquez to determine whether those facts act as elements,or their equivalents,of the charged offense.subsection b,which is labeled penalties,sets forth statutory sentencing ranges based on the type and amount of drug involved.the default or catchall sentence for a violation of a is a term of imprisonment of not more than one year,as set forth in b.see barbosa,at.by contrast,the maximum penalty for possession with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base is years,see b c and the maximum penalty for possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of a mixture or substance that contains cocaine base is years,b b iii.thus,in this case,both the drug type and amount serve to increase the maximum statutory penalty,and must be treated as elements of the offense.effectively,then,the elements of the charged offense are knowing or intentional possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base.
lacy was convicted of possession of more than five grams of cocaine base.the basic elements of a simple possession offense are knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance.see it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance.like section,however,section provides a schedule of escalating penalties that depend on the drug type and amount.the basic penalty,as under section,is a term of imprisonment of not more than one year.id.the penalty for conviction of possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance that contains cocaine base,however,is imprisonment for up to years.as under section,the drug amount and quantity increase the statutory maximum penalty applicable to a simple possession conviction.thus,the functional elements of the simple possession offense for which lacy was convicted are knowing or intentional possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base.
comparing the elements of the two offenses,it is clear that the simple possession offense of which lacy was convicted is a lesser included offense of the charged possession with intent to distribute offense.the only difference between the two offenses is that the section offense requires proof of intent to distribute the drugs.the district court therefore properly charged simple possession of more than five grams of cocaine base as a lesser included offense of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base.
it is also clear that the second offense of which lacy was he does not challenge on a lesser included offense of the charged offense.possession with intent to distribute an unspecified quantity of cocaine base requires proof of a subset of the facts that must be proved to sustain a conviction for possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine except for the drug amount.
finally,although lacy has not raised this as an issue,we note that the two offenses of which he was convicted are not lesser included offenses of each other,because each requires proof of a fact that the other does not.the simple possession conviction requires proof of the specific drug amount,while the possession with intent conviction requires proof of intent to distribute.lacy was not convicted twice for the same conduct.
thus,the district court properly charged lacy with,and the jury properly convicted him of,two separate lesser included offenses.
double jeopardy 
the double jeopardy clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v.the supreme court,in north carolina pearce,d explained that the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy consists of three separate constitutional protections 
it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.
the district court analyzed and rejected lacy challenge under the third category of protections,concluding that he was not being punished twice for the same offense.on appeal,lacy repeatedly stresses that he is not pursuing a separate offense or multiplicity challenge because he does not assert that the two convictions returned by the jury establish one violation,appellant br.at appellant reply br.at.furthermore,he acknowledges that possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance under a and possession of five grams or more of cocaine base under constitute wholly separate proscriptions.appellant br.at.
instead,lacy appears to be raising two separate but related double jeopardy challenges.first,he argues that his convictions were improper because the jury effectively convicted him of the two lesser included offenses after it had acquitted him of the charged offense.second,he claims that,by requesting the district court to charge the jury on the two lesser included offenses,th
