appellant frank jiménez was charged in a multiple count indictment with possession of a firearm on july,and,counts three,six,and eight in violation of g,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime on july,count five in violation of c.after a jury trial in the district court for massachusetts,a jury returned guilty verdicts on all of these charges.
jiménez appeals on various grounds he claims error in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of the residence where he was staying he alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing his request for an evidentiary hearing for his second motion to suppress he claims that the trial court erred by failing to admit into evidence the written statement of rafael pérez,an unavailable witness he objects to the admission of that same witness statements contained in a written confession he claims that the trial court should have given a proffered missing witness instruction to the jury he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction,and in the event all else fails,he claims that united states booker,d,requires remand of this case for resentencing.for the reasons stated herein,we reject appellant contentions and affirm his conviction.
essentially,the dispute concerns not the facts heard by the jury,but rather the application of the law to them.
sometime in may,atf special agent patrick burns learned from david steward,the owner of triple a guns,a gun store in west springfield,massachusetts,that a rafael pérez had purchased an unusually large number of firearms during the spring of.burns reviewed steward records and confirmed this fact.thereafter,burns met with michael veilleux,the owner of another gun dealership called guns gun parts,and learned that pérez had also purchased an unusually large number of firearms from veilleux during that same period.burns concluded that pérez was possibly engaged in some kind of illegal activity and asked veilleux to contact him if pérez returned.
on july,burns received a call from veilleux,alerting him to the presence of pérez at his store.pérez was in the process of purchasing another firearm.burns proceeded to the store and set up surveillance,whereupon he observed pérez coming out of the store carrying a bag and accompanied by a child and a man,whom burns was later able to identify as appellant jiménez.pérez had just purchased a model ruger pistol.pérez,the child,and jiménez got into a car that was registered to pérez wife at an address in springfield,and drove away,with agent burns attempting to follow them.
burns lost pérez in traffic and decided to proceed to the springfield address to set up surveillance there.at some point pérez drove up,got out with the child and went into the house at that address.pérez was.
burns returned to veilleux store and learned that the man who had accompanied pérez had two tattoos on his arm one said freaky and the other la familia.burns then checked with the springfield police department,where he received information connecting appellant jiménez with those tattoos,obtained a photograph of jiménez,and learned that his street alias was freaky or.
on july,veilleux called burns again to indicate that pérez was back at his store with the same man as before,to purchase another firearm.burns proceeded to the store and was able to observe the pérez jiménez duo coming out of the store together.they got into a different car than the day before and drove away,again with burns tailing them,but with no better results,losing them in traffic.
on july,burns and springfield police detective ricardo ortiz interviewed pérez regarding his numerous firearms purchases.pérez told the agents that a friend of his named frank was holding some of the firearms he recently had purchased.pérez stated that he did not know frank full name,but would show them where frank lived.he then took burns and ortiz to the place where frank was staying in springfield,located at jefferson street.
upon arrival,the lessee of the premises,elsa rodríguez,authorized the agents to search the residence.when they reached the second floor they were able to detect the odor of burning marihuana emanating from the front bedroom,the door to which was closed and locked,and which rodríguez indicated was being used by appellant jiménez.rodríguez used a butter knife to force the lock open,and the agents proceeded to enter jiménez room.inside they found a hand gun case,ammunition,cash,marihuana,and a digital scale.jiménez was not in the room.next,they proceeded to the rear bedroom,which belonged to rodríguez,where they found jiménez hiding on the floor next to a bed.ortiz drew his weapon and called for jiménez to show himself.when he stood up,ortiz recognized him as being freaky,put him under arrest and placed handcuffs on him.at this point,another man emerged from the closet where he had been hiding and indicated that jiménez had put a gun inside a pillowcase that was on the bed.ortiz looked inside the pillowcase and found a millimeter ruger,model,pistol,bearing serial number.
jiménez was transported to the springfield police station whereupon the agents returned to the bedroom that jiménez had been using and seized the evidence they had found previously.
burns and ortiz returned to the police station to talk to jiménez,whom they advised of his miranda rights.jiménez agreed to waive these and provided the agents with a written statement.in his statement,jiménez told the agents that pérez came to him looking for heroin t his past monday,meaning july,but that pérez did not have any money with which to pay for the drugs.pérez offered to give jiménez one gun instead of cash and when he got cash he would pay with cash and get the gun back.jiménez then went with pérez to guns gun parts,where pérez purchased a gun,and jiménez then gave pérez some heroin.pérez gave him a mm.i think it was a ruger.jiménez further stated that pérez returned with cash,which he said he earned by finding a buyer for the gun.i gave him the gun and he said he sold it.the records at guns gun parts showed that pérez purchased a millimeter ruger,model,pistol,with serial number.this gun was not recovered.
jiménez further stated that he and pérez went again to the same gun store the following day,july,where pérez purchased another firearm.the store records show that pérez purchase on that day was a millimeter ruger,model,pistol,with serial number.this was the same firearm seized from the pillowcase at the time of jiménez arrest,and jiménez admitted to hiding the gun there.
jiménez also stated that pérez gave him two more guns on or about july,one of which was a caliber firearm,which he in turn gave to an individual called jinxx.jiménez did not know jinxx real name or exact address,but was able to provide his physical description,and agreed to take the agents to where he lived.on july,jiménez showed springfield police detective misael rodríguez where jinxx resided at main street in springfield.later that day,detective rodríguez returned to that address and knocked on the door of the apartment described by jiménez as belonging to jinxx,whereupon a man fitting the physical description of jinxx supplied by jiménez open the door.jinxx consented to a search of his apartment,during the course of which detective rodríguez found and seized a caliber bersa,model,pistol,bearing serial number,which had been hidden above the tiles of a drop ceiling in the bathroom.the records of triple a guns showed that pérez had purchased this gun on july.
at trial,it was stipulated that the two firearms millimeter ruger,model,pistol and the caliber bersa manufactured outside of the commonwealth of massachusetts,and that on july,prior to the commission of the charged offenses in this case,jiménez had been convicted of assault in the springfield district court,an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.
a.the evidence seized from jiménez room 
we review a district court decision regarding suppression of evidence under a bifurcated standard of review,united states charles,cir,whereby factual findings are examined for clear error,united states lee,cir,cert.denied,d,while questions of law receive de novo scrutiny,id.
jiménez challenges the seizure of the evidence found in his bedroom at jefferson street on the basis that rodríguez did not have the authority to consent to the warrantless search of his bedroom.the government contends that the evidence seized from jiménez room was properly admissible as evidence discovered pursuant to a consent search,or a protective sweep.upon careful examination of the record,we agree that rodríguez did not have authority to consent to the search of that particular room,and we question whether the agents were permitted to conduct a protective sweep of the room under the circumstances of this case.regardless,we can not but conclude that any error which might exist in admitting evidence from the search of jiménez room is harmless.
the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is grounded on the individual expectation of privacy.see united states thornley,cir whether the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures has been violated depends on whether the person asserting a fourth amendment violation had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.jiménez was entitled to some expectation of privacy as to the bedroom he was using in rodríguez home.see minnesota olson,d holding that an overnight guest has an expectation of privacy in the home in which he is staying.
rodríguez had the authority to consent to the search of the common spaces of the house.see united states matlock,d permission to search may be obtained from a third party who possesses common authority over the premises.she clearly had common authority to consent to the search of her own bedroom,where jiménez was found and arrested.rodríguez did not,however,have the common authority over jiménez bedroom in order to give the police consent to search it.the authority which justifies consent to search rests upon 
mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes,so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.
united states hyson,cir quoting matlock,at.in her testimony,rodríguez characterized jiménez bedroom as his space.she did not enter the room as a regular matter,and she told police before they entered that she was not supposed to enter the room.rodríguez did not even have a key to go into the room and instead had to use a butter knife to pry the door open.we find,therefore,that rodríguez consent to the search of the house could not extend to the search of the room jiménez was using.
the fact that the agents smelled the scent of burning marihuana emanating from the room when they reached the second floor does not cure the problem.o dors alone do not authorize a search without a warrant.united states sharpe,d quoting johnson united states.where the odor of a forbidden substance is identified by someone found qualified to know the odor,there may well be probable cause to justify issuance of a search warrant,johnson,at,but it is not sufficient to justify a warrantless search.horton california,d collecting cases on the rule that no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent exigent circumstances.the government does not argue otherwise.
the government also contends that jiménez room was properly searched by the agents as they were conducting a protective sweep.the government argues that the search of jiménez bedroom was justified because the agents had a reasonable basis for believing that jiménez was present in the home,was using marihuana,was likely armed with a gun he received from pérez,and therefore posed a potential danger to them as they conducted their search.
the supreme court has defined a protective sweep as a quick and limited search of premises,incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety of police officers or others.maryland buie,d.this is set within the context of the longstanding view that t he touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness,and the reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing,on the one hand,the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual privacy and,on the other,the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.united states knights,d quoting wyoming houghton,d.hence,the searching officer must possess a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which,taken together with the rational inferences from those facts,reasonably warrant the officer in believing that the area swept harbored an individual posing a danger to the officer or others.buie,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
this case presents the difficult issue of determining whether or not a protective sweep was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.
although buie concerns protective sweeps incident to arrest,this court has extended this doctrine to include protective sweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants,drohan vaughn,cir united states daoust,cir,and recently to include protective sweeps where the existence of exigent circumstances prompts the entry of police,united states martins,cir.
in this case,rodríguez denied that jiménez was home,but gave the agents permission to enter the house and search for jiménez and firearms.the agents did not have a warrant for jiménez arrest or a search warrant.no one was under arrest at the time the agents searched the room jiménez was using,and no exigent circumstances allowed for their entry into the home.the government contends that the smell of smoke emanating from the front room escalated the threat the agents were facing during their search because it was reasonable for them to suspect that jiménez was in the house,smoking marihuana,likely in possession of a firearm,and possibly lying in wait for them.
given that the agents were in the home for the purpose of searching for jiménez,they must have already had some suspicion that he was there.the fact that rodríguez opened the room for them with a butter knife suggests that she was not afraid of what might have been on the other side of the door and the agents were not particularly concerned for her safety.under the circumstances,and based on the limited recitation of the facts we are presented with and the lack of reasonableness determination made by the district court below,we are not at all certain whether a protective sweep,to include jiménez locked bedroom,was appropriate under these circumstances.
in the instant case,however,the question of whether the protective sweep justifies the warrantless search of jiménez bedroom is of no moment,because the error of admitting the evidence seized from the room,if any,is harmless.where,as here,the objection is preserved,erroneous admission of improperly seized evidence at trial is reviewed for harmless error.united states barone,cir.under harmless error review,the burden is on the government to show that the supposed error did not affect the outcome of trial.united states castellini,cir considering factors such as considering,among other things,the centrality of the tainted material,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the uses to which it was put during the trial,the relative strengths of the parties cases.
the physical evidence seized from jiménez bedroom pales in light of the other evidence introduced at trial,including jiménez undoubtedly voluntary and fully corroborated confession,in which he admitted that he and pérez entered into a agreement,they consummated that agreement on july,when pérez purchased what was later determined to be a millimeter ruger model pistol,which he used as a deposit with jiménez in exchange for heroin,pending later substitution for cash,pérez later returned to pay cash in exchange for the ruger,and he possessed other firearms obtained from pérez,including the ruger model pistol that was seized from the pillowcase and the bersa pistol that was later recovered from jinxx at his home.further evidence against jiménez,both testimonial and documentary,corroborated jiménez and pérez presence at guns gun parts on july and,and the purchase of the guns which he confessed to possessing.this,together with copious other documentary,physical and testimonial evidence,was more than sufficient to convict jiménez,irrespective of the evidence seized from his bedroom.
b.the district court refusal to hold a second suppression hearing regarding jiménez inculpatory statements to detective rodríguez 
on june,jiménez filed a motion to suppress his statements,challenging his waiver of his miranda rights and the voluntariness of the written confession he made shortly after his arrest.on july,the district court held an evidentiary hearing and denied jiménez motion,ruling that jiménez waiver and subsequent confession were voluntary.we see no valid reason for disagreeing with these rulings.
shortly before trial,jiménez sought to suppress an additional statement he made to detective rodríguez regarding his heroin sources and his cooperation with the police in the recovery of the bersa pistol,which were not part of his earlier confession.he sought suppression again on the basis of alleged involuntariness,as well as the alleged failure to waive miranda rights.on january,the district court held a hearing,and relying in part on the evidence heard at the original suppression hearing,concluded that the brief lapse of to six the original miranda warnings and confession,and the later statements to detective rodríguez,did not vitiate the voluntariness of the statements.
we review the district court decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.united states calderón,cir.a hearing is required only if the movant makes a sufficient threshold showing that material facts are in doubt or dispute,and that such facts can not reliably be resolved on a paper record.united states staula,cir.the purpose of a voluntariness hearing is to ensure that unreliable,coerced confessions are not used to secure a defendant conviction.jackson denno,d.nothing in jackson,or sims georgia,d,another case jiménez relies on,makes the holding of a voluntariness hearing mandatory where the facts are not disputed and the district court can therefore reach a determination about voluntariness without the need for additional evidence.such are the present circumstances.
the district court had already heard evidence at the previous evidentiary hearing about the circumstances surrounding jiménez written confession and his waiver of his miranda rights.the court was also on notice about jiménez use of alcohol and liquor,and of the lapse of time between his written confession and his oral statements to detective rodríguez.in denying jiménez request,the district judge made specific reference to these matters.the court then concluded that the lapse of time between the miranda waiver and the written confession,and the statements to detective rodríguez,was insufficient to nullify the miranda warning or render the later statements involuntary.
given these circumstances,there was no abuse of discretion in the court refusal to hold a second evidentiary hearing.
c.the refusal to admit pérez confession 
on july,pérez made a written confession to law enforcement officials in which he spelled out his relationship to jiménez,and in which he stated that he did not provide guns to jiménez in exchange for heroin.at trial,jiménez attempted to introduce into evidence this part of pérez statement,alleging that the statement was admissible under federal rule of evidence b,as a statement against penal interest the court denied admission,ruling that said portion of pérez statement was not against penal interest,and that in any event,corroboration was lacking.
the standard of review for an evidentiary ruling is abuse of discretion.united states,cir.abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.united states gilbert,cir quoting united states roberts,cir.
for a statement to be against penal interest it must tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability to such an extent that a reasonable person would not make the statement unless it were true.williamson united states,d.
there was clearly no abuse of discretion in the district court evidentiary ruling.pérez statement that he never exchanged guns for heroin with jiménez did not inculpate pérez of any crime,but rather exculpated him of criminal liability under c.the fact that it also exculpated jiménez of that crime is immaterial to its admission under rule b.if pérez wanted to exculpate jiménez on the information contained in his statement,he had to testify in court,under oath,and subject to.this he refused to do,as was within his rights.
having so decided,we need not discuss the issue of whether the statement was also inadmissible for lack of corroboration.
d.the admission of jiménez confession on the basis of alleged violations to the confrontation clause 
the confession of jiménez that was admitted into evidence recounts conversations that he had with pérez about the sale of heroin,the use of firearms as collateral for these transactions,and the various specific firearms that pérez provided.although jiménez sought suppression of these statements as part of his allegation of involuntariness of the confession,a matter we have previously discussed,he now raises,for the first time,an objection to the statements made by pérez that are repeated by jiménez in that confession,claiming that by admitting the same,the district court deprived him of his right to confront that witness.jiménez also objects to the testimony of detective ortiz and agent burns,previously detailed,in which they testified to statements by pérez during the course of their investigation of jiménez activities.since no objection was made to any of this evidence during trial,we review this matter for plain error.barone,at.
jiménez reliance on crawford washington,d,is misguided.the confrontation clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.id.at.the challenged statements were properly admissible,not for their truth,but to provide context to jiménez admissions in his written confession,and the investigatory steps pursued by burns and ortiz.united states mcdowell,cir a defendant,having made admissions,can not keep from the jury other segments of the discussion reasonably required to place those admissions into context.
such is the present situation.not only is there no plain error,there is no error at all.
furthermore,it can be fairly said that jiménez adopted all of pérez statements in his confession.therefore,even were pérez statements therein admitted for the truth of what pérez said,the confrontation clause is not implicated when there is adoption of such statements by the defendant,who thus becomes the declarant or witness himself.united states allen,cir.
e.the missing witness instruction 
jiménez sought to call pérez as a witness at trial,but pérez invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify.at the conclusion of the trial,jiménez asked that the jury be given a missing witness instruction under the theory that pérez was peculiarly available to the government since it could have immunized pérez.the district judge rejected the request,a decision which we review under an abuse of discretion standard.united states,cir.
again,there has been no abuse of discretion but rather,the district court followed the circuit precedent established in united states michael credit union,cir,in which the identical issue raised by jiménez was decided in the identical manner as was decided by the district court in this case.in michael,we held that the government power to grant immunity f
