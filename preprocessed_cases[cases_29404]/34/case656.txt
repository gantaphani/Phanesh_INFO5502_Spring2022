joel epstein and john handel were convicted after a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts for offenses related to a scheme to defraud the owners of timeshare units.they now appeal,challenging both their convictions and their sentences.we affirm.
background 
the scheme that led to the appellants convictions involved companies located in various parts of the country.resort investment trust rit and swiss american bank,called buyers,were telemarketing companies that solicited timeshare owners to sell their units and buy appraisals.employees for these companies called timeshare owners with offers to buy their units,provided that the owners submitted certain documents related to their timeshares,including a recent appraisal.the owners were led to believe that their units would be purchased once they provided an appraisal,and that they would be reimbursed for the costs of the appraisal.the telemarketer then informed the owner that the appraisal must be performed by an independent company,and offered to refer the owner to multiple listing service mls an employee from mls then contacted the owner,provided the names and prices of four different appraisal companies,and asked the owner to choose one.the appraisal companies included resort condominiums international rci,based in hyannis,massachusetts,and international appraisals ia,based in rhode island.the mls employee stressed that the appraisal companies were highly experienced and had personnel in the area of the timeshares who would perform inspections of the properties.in fact,all of the recommended companies were part of the scheme,and there was no relation between the location of the companies and that of the timeshare.the telemarketers merely rotated the names of these companies and the prices they charged,typically.mls employees repeated that the buying company would reimburse the owner for the cost of the appraisal.
owners were then contacted by an employee of an appraisal referral center arc,called a closer,who introduced himself as an employee of the appraisal company that the victim had previously selected.the arc telemarketer took the owner credit card number and told the owner that an appraiser would be assigned to the property,that the buying company would be notified of the appraisal,which would trigger a letter of intent to buy the timeshare,and that the letter would not commit the owner,but would commit the buying company.the arc telemarketer then faxed the owner information to the appraisal company that the owner had previously selected,which charged to the owner credit card and sent information about the unit to comparative research an unaffiliated firm,which prepared a market analysis report for.comparative research sent the report back to the appraisal company,where a licensed real estate appraiser signed it.the appraisal company then sent the purported appraisal to the owner.
at this point,the fraud was complete.the companies neither reimbursed the appraisal fee nor bought the timeshares.owners who complained had to call repeatedly,found that numbers had been disconnected,and were told to resubmit paperwork.in the event that an offer was actually made,it was for considerably less than what was promised.
the appraisal companies sent some of the collected funds to american investment monitoring services aims,which was a operation that took in and disbursed funds to the other companies.at some point,aims stopped operating and consolidating consortium international cci took over.the appraisal companies also sent per appraisal to mls,and transferred funds to an account in the bahamas held by donald gonzcy,the mastermind of the scheme.during the course of the scheme,approximately appraisals were sold at a cost of each,for a total of over million.although epstein started as a buyer for rit in,he quickly assumed a significant role in the overall operation.working under the alias joe kelley,he ran another buying company based in texas called global referral service.epstein was also the president of arc,the vice president of aims,and the president of cci.his duties in these various capacities included hiring and supervising telemarketers,providing them scripts for the calls,devising responses to common customer complaints,and tracking financial transactions and data related to the companies.
handel began working for rci,run by gonzcy future michael upton,in.handel came to the office every seven to ten days to sign the purported appraisals,usually signing between and appraisals at a time.these reports,generated by comparative research,contained the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a unit,the amenities on the property,the unit condition,and a comparison to three other properties in the area.they also provided an estimate of the market value of the unit,and a blank that purported to be the date of the inspection and of the report.handel spent a few seconds per report and inserted the date that he signed as the date of inspection.rci paid him five dollars for each appraisal that he signed.at some point during his employment,handel allegedly became concerned with the volume of appraisals rci dealt with and asked upton about the legitimacy of the operation and whether any timeshares were being bought.upton assured him that gonzcy was buying many of the timeshares.at some point handel asked rci to begin issuing his checks in his wife name.
as part of his duties at rci,handel was responsible for responding to customer complaints.these complaints were placed in a file folder and contained phone messages and letters from owners,often dissatisfied with mistakes in the appraisal or because no inspection had been done 
handel performed similar work for ia,which was based in rhode island and owned by gonzcy son scott.handel,who was not a licensed real estate agent in rhode island,met scott in a burger king parking lot and signed the ia appraisals with the name james rose.
on february,a grand jury issued a indictment charging epstein,handel,gonzcy,and several others with various counts.on july,a grand jury issued a superseding count indictment.on june,a jury trial commenced against epstein,handel,and gonzcy in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.on july,gonzcy pleaded guilty to the charges against him,and trial proceeded against epstein and handel.on july,the district court dismissed nineteen of the counts in the superseding indictment pursuant to a motion by the government.
on july,the jury convicted epstein of one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,in violation of seven counts of mail fraud,in violation of five counts of wire fraud,in violation of and five counts of money laundering,in violation of a a i.the jury convicted handel of five counts of mail fraud.the district court sentenced epstein to months of imprisonment,months of supervised release,and a special assessment of.the district court sentenced handel to months of imprisonment,months of supervised release,a fine of,and a special assessment of.both defendants appealed,arguing that their convictions should be overturned or that they should be.
ii.discussion 
evidentiary issues 
epstein and handel argue that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence during trial.in order to preserve a claim of evidentiary error for appeal,a timely objection,stating the specific ground of objection,must appear in the record.a.we review the district court decisions on the admissibility of evidence as to preserved claims for abuse of discretion.see united states mercado irizarry,cir.if we find an error,i t is settled that a evidentiary error is harmless and,therefore,does not require a new trial so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.united states flemmi,cir internal quotations and modifications omitted.
for unpreserved errors,the standard of review is that of plain error.united states barone,cir.the plain error standard requires the appellate court to find that there is error that is plain and that affects substantial rights.when these three elements are satisfied,an appellate court may exercise its discretion to correct the error only if the forfeited error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.citing united states olano,d internal quotations and citation omitted.for the third prong,the defendant has the burden of showing prejudice or that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states,cir.
during trial,peter train,an employee for one of the buying companies involved in the conspiracy,testified about a cartoon he had given to a,linda alongi.the cartoon depicted a laughing hyena saying i want to buy your timeshare,with the words head buyer appearing directly beneath the hyena.train testified that alongi hung the cartoon on the wall above her desk,and that epstein spoke with alongi at her desk while the cartoon was on the wall.there was no testimony that epstein actually saw or ever discussed the cartoon,and on cross examination,train admitted that he had no personal knowledge that epstein ever saw the cartoon.
the district court admitted the cartoon into evidence on the ground that if epstein saw the cartoon,and the operation was on the up and up,epstein would have been shocked by the cartoon and would have taken corrective action.epstein counsel objected,arguing that the cartoon was unduly prejudicial under.and that there was no evidence that epstein had ever seen the cartoon.
epstein now claims that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the cartoon,arguing that there was insufficient foundation to conclude that epstein manifested an adoption or belief in the truth of the cartoon.for our present purposes we will assume,without deciding,that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the cartoon into evidence.however,after carefully reviewing the record,we believe that any error that may have occurred was harmless,as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict against epstein.see flemmi,at.
epstein argues that the cartoon was especially prejudicial against him because it was pictorial in form,whereas most of the other documents admitted were printed materials,ledgers,or contracts,and it was presented in the hope of establishing that the people involved in the conspiracy were callous and heartless.we disagree.first,the cartoon was one of over documents admitted in the case against epstein,and the testimony regarding the cartoon was extremely brief in relation to the rest of the trial.second,other evidence regarding epstein knowledge of and involvement in the scheme was overwhelming.see united states tejeda,cir finding harmless error because of overwhelming evidence of guilt.besides the documents,there was testimony from many witnesses regarding epstein involvement in the conspiracy.together,the testimony and documents established that epstein worked as an executive for at least four of the companies involved in the conspiracy,handled and tracked the financial data for the companies,produced scripts for the telemarketers,and was well aware of the numerous complaints against the companies.in light of the numerous documents and witness testimony against epstein,we believe that it is virtually certain that the admission of the cartoon did not influence the verdict against him.we therefore conclude that any error was harmless.
during the government case in chief,it introduced handel tax return into evidence.on the return,handel indicated that he earned in business income and that his business was appraisals.however,the return did not indicate approximately that handel received in the name of his wife.handel did not immediately object to the tax return admission into evidence,but subsequently filed a motion to strike,arguing that the tax return admission violated.b because it could constitute evidence of other crimes or bad acts,namely,that handel filed a false tax return.in denying the motion to strike,the district court stated that the return was part and parcel of handel conduct relative to this case,and also assured handel that it would not permit the government to argue propensity from the filing of the income tax return.
during the defense case,handel testified that he had acted in good faith when signing the appraisals.on,the government questioned handel about the misstatement on the return.the government also questioned handel about a business deduction he had claimed on the return for mileage expenses.handel objected,arguing that the government questioning violated.b.the district court stated that it was not admitting the evidence under rule b,but rather under rule b as permissible impeachment with previously admitted extrinsic evidence.handel did not object to the under rule b,and continued to argue his objection under rule b,which the judge denied.on the stand,handel ultimately admitted that the business deduction on the tax form was a mistake.
handel does not now argue that the admission of the tax form was improper.instead,handel reiterates his argument that the use of the tax return for was improper under rule b because it was evidence of a prior bad act.we disagree.rule b,by its very terms,excludes only extrinsic of other crimes,wrongs,or acts whose probative value exclusively depends upon a forbidden inference of criminal propensity.evidence intrinsic to the crime for which the defendant is on trial,accordingly,is not governed by rule b.united states manning,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the judge found that the tax return was part and parcel of handel conduct relative to this case.handel tax return was intertwined with the crime because the tax return reports the income that he received from the fraudulent scheme.further,the fact that handel did not include all of his income suggests that he had knowledge of the fraudulent scheme.the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding the tax return to be part and parcel of the crime and properly allowed the evidence as intrinsic to the crime and not governed by rule b.
handel now argues for the first time that the violated rule b because handel did not specify at trial that he objected to the under rule b,he has not preserved the claim,and this court will review only for plain error.to show plain error,handel must show that he was prejudiced.any prejudice that handel would have suffered from a violation of rule b is that the jury would think negatively of handel credibility.however,handel can not claim this prejudice in light of other evidence at trial more damaging to his credibility.handel admitted that on three separate occasions he submitted documents to the massachusetts real estate board,under pains and penalties of perjury,where he was required to state his previous criminal convictions and did not do so.handel was convicted twice for operating a motor vehicle to endanger and once for attaching the wrong plates to a motor vehicle.handel claimed that he honestly believed that the convictions related to motor vehicles were excluded,but handel also claimed that the mileage deduction on his tax return was a mistake.in addition,the three convictions were admitted into evidence at trial,and the judge gave a limiting instruction,stating that the prior convictions were relevant only for evaluating handel credibility.thus,handel has not borne the burden of showing plain error.
willful blindness instruction 
epstein and handel both argue that the district court erred in giving the jury a willful blindness instruction in the course of its instructions on mail fraud a willful blindness instruction is appropriate if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge,the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance,and the instruction,taken as a whole,can not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.united states coviello,cir quoting united states richardson,cir.in determining whether the facts suggest the type of deliberate avoidance warranting an instruction,we must consider whether the record evidence reveals flags of suspicion that,uninvestigated,suggest willful blindness.id.
epstein argues that the district court erred because he was led to believe that gonzcy was an experienced and successful businessman and that the timeshares we
