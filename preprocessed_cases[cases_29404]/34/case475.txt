andre page and michael green appeal from their judgments of conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,a,and conspiracy,id.we affirm.
background 
in,the federal bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice began an investigation of raymond austin,a resident of guyana.the ice learned that austin was smuggling cocaine into the united states,and that his nephew wallstein dwayne allen had been picking up these cocaine deliveries in new york for austin.to infiltrate the drug operation,undercover ice agent michael hedrick agent hedrick posed as a boat captain offering to transport the cocaine into the united states for austin.on march,agent hedrick met with allen and a companion at a boston restaurant,where allen gave agent hedrick to cover the expenses of an upcoming boat trip to guyana to pick up cocaine from austin.agent hedrick and allen agreed that allen would take delivery of the cocaine in boston upon his return.
in may,agent hedrick picked up kilos of cocaine off the coast of south america,and the ice shipped the cocaine back to an east boston warehouse in preparation for the controlled delivery to allen.agent hedrick phoned allen in new york to arrange a meeting on june at the same boston restaurant where they previously had met in march,and told allen that they would proceed from the restaurant to the warehouse where allen would take delivery of the smuggled cocaine.
in late may,appellant andre page,a drug dealer to whom allen regularly had supplied cocaine for resale,asked allen if he had any work which in drug parlance means cocaine for him,and allen invited page to travel with him from new york to boston on june to obtain some work.page recommended that allen also take along appellant michael green.allen apparently believed that he needed page and green for protection both men were over six feet tall and weighed in excess of two hundred pounds.
on june,allen,page,and green left new york in two vehicles to travel to boston,carrying in cash to pay agent hedrick for the smuggled cocaine.before leaving,however,page asked allen what was in the bag,and allen answered the money.meanwhile,agent hedrick and a female undercover agent posing as his girlfriend went to the boston restaurant for the rendezvous,which was being videotaped by the ice.when allen,page and green arrived at the mall where the restaurant was located,they shopped briefly while waiting for agent hedrick to contact them on their cell phone.when the trio finally arrived at the restaurant,agent hedrick greeted allen,but allen introduced neither page or green,who went to sit at another table nearby.agent hedrick,his sham girlfriend,and allen discussed the cocaine delivery,and agreed that allen and appellants page and green were to follow in agent hedrick car to the warehouse where the cocaine was stashed.allen left the restaurant with page and green,then rendezvoused in their two vehicles with agent hedrick car outside the mall.
when they arrived at the warehouse,page remained outside in a vehicle with agent hedrick girlfriend,while hedrick,allen and green went inside to consummate the delivery.agent hedrick opened one of the bags containing the cocaine and showed it to allen and green,noting that it was six or seven packs each one for a total of kilos.agent hedrick told allen and green that he was going outside to check on his girlfriend,and allen and green began to pack the cocaine into their vehicles.the ice placed allen,page and green under arrest.
in august,allen,page,and green were indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,a,and for conspiring to do the same,id.the district court denied the page motion to sever his trial from that of his.at trial,page and green presented a defense theory that they unwittingly accompanied allen to boston on june,thinking that it was merely a shopping trip,and that they knew nothing about the cocaine delivery previously arranged between agent hedrick and allen.the jury rejected their theory,then found page and green guilty on both the substantive and conspiracy counts.on appeal,page and green challenge their respective convictions 
discussiona.the page.the evidentiary rulingsa.admissibility of agent hedrick testimony 
page first contends that the district court abused its discretion in permitting agent hedrick to testify that,in his prior experience as a drug enforcement officer,drug dealers typical modus operandi is to have burly individuals,like page and green,accompany them during drug transactions to provide protective countersurveillance against police drug stings,because this testimony purported to be an expert opinion which the government failed to disclose to the defense prior to trial as required by federal rule of criminal procedure.
we normally review district court evidentiary rulings to which an appellant has raised a contemporaneous objection for an abuse of discretion only,but to the extent the ruling turns purely on a legal issue,we employ plenary review.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.the district court did not err in this instance.police testimony concerning criminals typical modi operandi during a drug transaction does not automatically constitute expert testimony,but depending on the content and circumstances can be and here is testimony admissible under federal rule of evidence without necessity for pretrial disclosure to the defense.does not,contrary to page argument,establish a rule that all police officer testimony is per se admissible under rule see united states,cir 
page further contends that the district court abused its discretion by permitting agent hedrick to testify,in conjunction with his lay testimony regarding drug dealers countersurveillance practices,that he did not know at that time what page and green were doing during the time periods in which they were out of his on june,since the jury speculatively may have inferred from this wording that agent hedrick later had obtained evidence which the government did not adduce at trial,and which definitively demonstrated that page and green had been engaged in countersurveillance during the time periods when they were out of agent hedrick sight.
since page did not object contemporaneously to the hedrick statement,we review for plain error,which requires that he demonstrate an obvious error which affected his substantial rights,and seriously compromised the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duval,cir.although the government reliance on matters not in evidence certainly would be improper,see united states auch,cir,agent hedrick statement i do know what page and green were doing at that time.may invite,but hardly compels,the attenuated inference that he later learned of additional evidence of the appellants countersurveillance activities.the more likely inference is that agent hedrick merely made the unremarkable concession that he could not have been aware of appellants actions while they were out of his line of sight.defense counsel,who lodged no objection to the testimony,seemingly drew this more innocuous inference.further,the government at no time argued to the jury that agent hedrick had testified that he subsequently learned of undisclosed evidence which confirmed his belief that page and green were engaged in countersurveillance on june.thus,page falls well short of hurdling the plain error standard of review.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not err in admitting agent hedrick challenged testimony in evidence.
b.the admissibility of the may audiotape 
page next contends that the district court erred in permitting the government to play an audiotape of a may,phone conversation between allen and kareem,one of allen other associates,about an ongoing drug transaction in which page can be heard in the background on kareem end of the line,and during which allen instructs kareem to give page a share of allen drug proceeds.page asserts that the audiotape constitutes inadmissible hearsay,which can not come within the hearsay exception as a statement of a coconspirator,because the government did not allege that kareem was page coconspirator in the jun
