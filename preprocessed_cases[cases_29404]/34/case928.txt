defendant jose torres appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a jury trial before paul gardephe,judge,convicting him of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine,in violation of,and sentencing him principally to months imprisonment.on appeal,torres contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted knowingly and with the specific intent to further a conspiracy for the distribution of narcotics.finding merit in his contention,we reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal in an order filed on may,indicating that this opinion would follow.
background 
the government evidence at trial consisted principally of bags containing cocaine and the testimony of law enforcement agents and employees of united parcel service ups with respect to the efforts of torres on april,to take delivery of the boxes in which the cocaine had been shipped.the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the government,showed the following.
events on the morning of april 
on april,ups deliveryman francisco bautista had in his truck three items to be delivered to locust hill avenue in yonkers,new york locust hill,a house.one was a air envelope for apartment.the other two were bulky packages the packages weighing and pounds,respectively,each designated high value by the shipper in puerto rico,and each bearing an address label reading as follows

government exhibits gx.
bautista testified that he went to locust hill at approximately that morning.when he arrived,he was approached by two hispanic men,one of whom asked whether bautista had a package for jose or something.trial transcript tr.when bautista responded affirmatively,the man stated that the packages were for him.as the packages were designated high value,bautista requested identification.when the man produced a new york state identification card id card on which,bautista noted,the name matched but the address did id,in that the id card showed an address in brooklyn rather than yonkers see id.at,bautista said he could not release the packages to the man because the address does match id.at.the man tried to convince bautista to release the packages by saying that he was moving and had not yet changed his id card bautista was unpersuaded.
bautista proceeded to deliver the air envelope for apartment to the building superintendent.bautista inquired about the two men who had approached him and who remained alongside the building the superintendent said he did not know them.see id.at.
bautista departed.when he reached his next destination less than a minute away,and was exiting his truck,the two men he had encountered at locust hill approached him again,asking about the packages.bautista said he would call his supervisor and if he were given authorization to release the packages despite the id discrepancy,he would return to locust hill to deliver them.see tr.after entering the building at this location,bautista telephoned his supervisor,who told him not to release the packages and said that a security agent the lp would be sent to meet him.when bautista emerged from the building,the two men were still there and again urged him to release the packages they also asked bautista to speak on their telephone to a cousin who had sent the packages.bautista told them he could not do anything without authorization from his supervisor.see id.at.
about a later,the lp met bautista and they returned to the vicinity of locust hill bautista parked some feet from the building,and the lp parked behind him.when they arrived there,four men emerged from behind the building and stared at bautista and the lp.see id.at.after the lp made a quick telephone call,he and bautista promptly departed.bautista turned the packages over to the lp.see id.
the lp took the packages to a ups facility in mount vernon,new york,where they were opened in a secure,room by alex gamboa,a ups security specialist.see,tr.the packages contained kitchen into evidence at of which had a secret compartment one on the back,the other at the bottom see,id.at.inside each cabinet secret compartment,gamboa found five objects wrapped in black bags inside those bags were white bags containing white material.see id.at.the compartments also contained newspaper,sprayed foam insulation,and other material to prevent the bags from moving around,shaking,or breaking apart.see,id.at.gamboa telephoned detective mark carey of the westchester county police narcotics unit,who arrived shortly and took custody of the packages.see id.at.
the bags secreted in the packages were later determined to contain cocaine.the bags total weight was approximately kilograms.the cocaine had a street value of between and million.see,id.at.
b.the controlled delivery in the afternoon of april 
westchester police officers rewrapped the packages and,working with the yonkers police,arranged for a controlled delivery to take place at a ups store in a yonkers strip mall.see tr.some law enforcement agents participated.coordinating with the store at trial only as stan detective carey,dressed in plainclothes,was stationed in the ups store behind a wall of mailboxes westchester county police officer isai moreira was in the ups store dressed as a ups employee.see,id.at.other law enforcement agents were deployed in various vehicles in the mall parking lot.see,id.at.
at approximately,detective carey called,the number provided for the addressee on the packages labels,and asked the man who answered whether he was jose torrez.when the man said he was,carey identified himself as a ups employee and said the packages could either be picked up at the yonkers ups store that day or be delivered the next day.the man,in broken english,expressed frustration at ups failure to deliver the packages earlier that day,stating that he had just moved to yonkers and that was why the address on his id card did not match the address on the packages he said he would come to the ups store to pick up the packages.see id.at.
an hour later,torres arrived in a green minivan driven by another man and entered the ups store.see tr.torres said i here to pick up the boxes for jose torres,and stan asked to see his identification.id.at.torres handed stan a new york state id card bearing the name torres,jose,a and a brooklyn address gx see tr.and stated that he was upset at ups earlier refusal to deliver,explaining in broken english that he had moved and had not had time to change the address on his identification tr.stan photocopied the id card,showed the copy gx to undercover officer dressed as a ups returned the id card to torres.torres promptly started to load one of the packages onto a nearby hand truck and took it out to the curb stan asked moreira to assist torres,and moreira tried to assist with the second package,but torres shooed him away and took the second package to the curb as well.tr.
in the meantime,unbeknownst to torres,the driver of the green minivan,after torres entered the ups store,had peered through the windshield of a police surveillance van that was parked curbside just north of the ups store and,with a startled look on his face had quickly pulled away id.at and left the parking lot see id.at.one of the other surveillance vehicles followed the minivan only to the end of the parking lot the surveillance team leader told the team to stand by and stay where we were,to let the van gogh sic id.at.
when torres had both packages at the curb,moreira,who had accompanied him out of the store with the second package,asked him where his vehicle was torres said he had a ride.torres peered all around for the minivan and searched the nearby aisles of the parking lot he spent some to minutes looking around and exploring deeper and deeper into the lot,but returning frequently to the packages at the curb.see,tr.moreira,part of whose surveillance assignment was to keep an eye on the cocaine see,id.at,remained at the curb with the packages see,id.at.torres,conversing with moreira in spanish see,id.at,told moreira that the driver had needed to use a bathroom and perhaps had gone into a nearby mcdonald see id.at.torres did not look for the driver in any stores,however he explored only the parking lot.see,id.at.
moreira eventually asked whether torres had a cell phone number for the driver,and when torres said he did not,moreira suggested that torres call a taxi.torres,after looking around once more,reentered the ups store to call a cab.see tr.as torres entered,detective carey exited because he did want to make torres any more suspicious or nervous than he already appeared id.at torres then used the store telephone while repeatedly looking over his shoulder at carey id.at.carey,mindful that the store had a rear exit see id.at,reentered the store after some minutes see,id.at he identified himself as a police officer and he and another officer escorted torres out of the store and placed him under arrest see id.at.
while the officers awaited a transport vehicle,with torres in custody,torres attempted to speak to them in his broken english,and carey summoned moreira.see tr.moreira,while walking over to them,took out his police shield and held it out in front of him to identify himself as a police officer see id.at,and torres immediately started talking to him in spanish see id.at.torres said that this is what happens when you do favors for somebody,and that a man in a yonkers bodega had paid him to pick up the packages.see id.at.later that day,when moreira was taking pedigree information from torres,torres said he worked at the bodega,cleaning up,and that he was homeless.see id.at.
c.the present prosecution 
in a superseding indictment,torres was charged with knowingly and intentionally possessing five kilograms and more of substances containing cocaine,in violation of a count two,and conspiring to do so,in violation of count one.no other persons were apprehended or charged.
at torres trial,in addition to the evidence described in parts and above,the government introduced records of several telephone calls.a ups record,indicating that the ups call center in yonkers had received a call at on april,reads in part as follows 
fl locust hill ave 
gx.the record shows the tracking number for one of the packages and the hour at which the driver had departed ups with the packages,and states as follows with our bracketed assumed completions of words partially lopped off in the reproduction of the ups record see id.
cust states that driver would not l et him accept the pkg when he came he just moved in and he hasnt change his add yet but pkg i s add to this person and driver still never let him take it 
id.gamboa explained that cust meant customer,pkg meant package,and add meant address.see tr.
the government also introduced telephone company records for the number see gx,which was registered to an antonio gonzales see gx.the records showed all telephone calls and direct connect activity between and various numbers from march to may.for april,the records showed dozens of calls between the number and see gx is an area code for puerto rico see gx.the records also showed six calls to from other numbers in puerto rico between and on april,the day of the failed delivery,as well as direct connect activity after torres arrived at the ups store.see gx.
at the close of the government evidence,torres moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to.the district judge reserved decision.torres rested without presenting evidence.
the jury found torres guilty on the conspiracy count,count one.the jury had been instructed that i f,and only if it found torres guilty on count one verdict form at emphasis in original,it was to answer the following question relat ing to quantity tr.see id.at did the defendant either have personal involvement with,or was it reasonably foreseeable to him that the conspiracy involved,and was it within the scope of his agreement to distribute or possess with intent to distribute,five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine verdict form at emphases in original see also tr,the jury answered that question no tr.the jury found torres not guilty on the possession count,count two.
at sentencing,the district court denied torres rule motion.after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that,inter alia,torres was directly and personally involved with the ten kilograms of cocaine sentencing transcript at,the court sentenced torres principally to months imprisonment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,torres contends that the trial evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge that the purpose of the conspiracy of which he was found to be a member was the distribution of narcotics.we agree.
elements of conspiracy 
the essence of conspiracy is agreement.in order to convict a defendant of the crime of conspiracy,the government must show that two or more persons entered into a joint enterprise for an unlawful purpose,with awareness of its general nature and extent.see,united states huezo,cir huezo,cert.denied.united states jones,cir jones united states rodriguez,cir rodriguez united states morgan,cir morgan united states friedman,f d,cir friedman,cert.denied.although t he government need not show that the defendant knew all of the details of the conspiracy,so long as he knew its general nature and extent,huezo,at quoting united states rosa,cir,cert.denied,the government must prove at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself,united states feola.t he knowledge of the parties is relevant to a conspiracy charge to the same extent as it may be for conviction of the substantive offense.id.at.
title of the united states code provides,inter alia,that it is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance,a emphasis added,or to conspire to commit such an offense,id.to prove intent,of course,the government must show knowledge,for knowledge is the foundation of intent,direct sales united states.thus,since the government can not establish the substantive a offenses of distribution or possession with intent to distribute without proving that the defendant knew he was dealing with a controlled substance,it likewise can not establish a conspiracy to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute without proving,inter alia,that the defendant knew that the conspiracy involved a controlled substance.see,rodriguez,at the conspiracy and substantive charges,both of which are specific intent crimes,required the government to establish that rodriguez knowingly and intentionally participated in the drug deal united states lorenzo,cir lorenzo friedman,at,a charge of conspiracy to commit extortion in violation of a require s the government to prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the defendant knew that the specific nature of the conspiracy included extortion united states samaria,cir samaria a charge of conspiracy to receive and possess stolen goods in violation of requires the government to prove that the defendant knew the goods were stolen,abrogated on other grounds by huezo,at.proof that the defendant engaged in suspicious behavior,without proof that he had knowledge that his conduct involved narcotics,is not enough to support his conviction for conspiracy to traffic in narcotics.see,lorenzo,at.proof that the defendant knew that some crime would be committed is not enough.rodriguez,f d at quoting morgan,at quoting friedman,at emphasis in friedman.
b oth the existence of a conspiracy and a given defendant participation in it with the requisite knowledge and criminal intent may be established through circumstantial evidence.huezo,at quoting united states stewart,cir see,friedman,at morgan,at properly instructed jury is entitled to infer the requisite knowledge on the basis of evidence that the defendant consciously avoided learning the nature of the conspiracy.nevertheless,where the government seeks to prove a fact that is also an element of the offense by circumstantial evidence,w e must be satisfied that the inferences are sufficiently supported to permit a rational juror to find that the element,like all elements,is established beyond a reasonable doubt.friedman,at internal quotation marks omitted see,rodriguez,at.
b.our standard of review 
for a defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction,our standard of review poses high obstacles.in reviewing such a challenge we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor.united states chavez,cir chavez.we defer to the jury determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,and to the jury choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.united states morrison,cir see,samaria,at.the government proof need not eliminate every possible theory of innocence,united states rosenthal,cir and in assessing whether the government has met its burden,we view pieces of evidence not in isolation but in conjunction,united states,cir,cert.denied.the conviction must be upheld if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.chavez,at quoting jackson virginia,emphasis in jackson see,samaria,at.
these principles apply whether the evidence being reviewed is direct or circumstantial.see glasser united states.where direct evidence is absent,however,c ircumstantial evidence of knowledge and specific intent sufficient to sustain a conviction must include some indicia of the specific elements of the underlying crime.samaria,at.and while we defer to a jury assessments with respect to credibility and conflicting testimony,and to its choice between the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence,the jury inferences must be reasonably based on evidence presented at trial,not on speculation,united states ceballos,cir internal quotation marks omitted specious inferences are not indulged,lorenzo,at quoting jones,at.
in lorenzo,for example,while mindful that conspiracies are undertakings in secret and often can not be proven except through the use of circumstantial evidence,see at,we found the evidence of knowledge on the part of julio lorenzo insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy to import and conspiracy to distribute narcotics,given the absence of evidence as to what was said in any of the conversations in which he participated and the lack of evidence that he knew the contents of a suitcase a conspirator was carrying.thus,although there wa s ample evidence demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy,and that julio was present at and participated in events that furthered the conspiracy,there wa s insufficient evidence to show that he did so knowingly and with the specific intent to further a cocaine smuggling and distribution conspiracy.id.at.we noted that the fact that julio lorenzo transferred to one of the conspirators was 
suspicious and,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,indicative of participation in illegal behavior.but such a transfer is consistent with participation in a wide variety of offenses,and in light of the other evidence,wa s insufficient to prove julio intent to participate in the conspiracy charged in the indictment.
in friedman,we reversed the conviction of the defendant rodriguez,who furnished others with guns,for conspiracy to commit extortion.evidence of,inter alia,a lengthy telephone call between the homes of a conspirator and rodriguez did not provide any basis for inferring that rodriguez knew that there was a conspiracy to use the guns to commit extortion,given that there was no evidence as to the content of the telephone conversation.we pointed out that evidence showing merely that a defendant associated with conspirators under suspicious circumstances,and that he suspected or should have suspected that a crime might occur,is not sufficient to show specific knowledge of the purposes of the underlying conspiracy.at internal quotation marks omitted.
c ircumstantial evidence of knowledge and specific intent sufficient to sustain a conviction must include some indicia of the specific elements of the underlying crime,such as proof of a defendant knowledge or intent through evidence that the defendant participated in conversations to the substance of the conspiracy,possess ion of or mention in documents important to the conspiracy,proof that a defendant exercised authority within the conspiracy itself,recei pt of a share of the profits from the conspiracy,or a defendant statements explicitly confirm ing the nature of the activity in which the were engaged.
id.quoting samaria,at.
in rodriguez,we noted that the evidence was ample to show that the defendant had served coconspirators as a lookout but we overturned his narcotics conspiracy conviction because there was no evidence that he knew the transaction for which he was serving as a lookout was one involving drugs.see at.the fact that the defendant may have sat beside a package containing narcotics was,in the circumstances,not probative 
t he government would have us conclude that the heroin was in plain view or could somehow be identified if one were sitting next to it,such that rodriguez would have been aware of the nature of the transaction.we can not so hold t he heroin was hidden inside a telephone box and also wrapped in two bags accordingly,even were we to assume that rodriguez sat near the heroin,this fact may not serve as circumstantial evidence adequate to prove rodriguez knowledge and intent.
id.at emphases added.
we reached a similar conclusion in samaria,which involved conspiracy conspiracy to receive or possess stolen goods and conspiracy to commit credit card the defendant eliaho,a gypsy cab driver whose passengers,glover and samaria,loaded into his cab boxes of merchandise that had been purchased with stolen credit information.we reversed elaiho convictions because the government evidence was insufficient to prove that elaiho knew that the boxes in question contained stolen goods,or further that he knew these goods had been stolen of credit card fraud.at.despite elaiho presence in the car with boxes containing the goods,the exterior appearance of the boxes was equally consistent with any number of different criminal offenses including the receipt and possession of drugs,illegal weapons,counterfeit currency,or the receipt of legal goods such as drug paraphernalia that would later be employed in a criminal endeavor.id.at.further,the requisite proof of knowledge was not supplied by evidence that elaiho was present on both occasions when law enforcement officers observed conspirators picking up purloined merchandise and that elaiho rode in the passenger seat of his car on one such occasion.we stated that 
t hese facts may help establish that elaiho had a closer association with glover and samaria than that of a taxi driver,and may,in conjunction with the evidence of elaiho false exculpatory statements,observation of the goods,and service as a lookout,support an inference that elaiho knew that glover and samaria were engaged in some sort of criminal enterprise.together,this evidence offers us no indicia,however,that elaiho was aware of the specific crimes charged and that elaiho had the specific intent to participate in those crimes.
id.at emphasis added.
c.the record in the present case 
the evidence in the present case,taken in the light most favorable to the government,was sufficient to permit the jury to find one element of the conspiracy offense beyond a reasonable doubt,that there existed a conspiracy for the distribution of cocaine.such an inference could be drawn from the facts that,inter alia,kilograms of cocaine were secreted in a shipment sent from puerto rico to new york that the shipment was immediately preceded by dozens of calls between puerto rico and,the telephone number that the shipper listed for the packages addressee,plainly allowing the inference that more than one person was involved with the shipment that the telephone contact number given for torres,as the addressee of the packages,was registered to a person named gonzales,was used to call ups by a person calling himself padilla,and was used th
