in these interlocutory appeals in two unrelated criminal cases,the government challenges the district court orders excluding cooperating witnesses from testifying at trial.in each case,the district court excluded a key prosecution witness after concluding that the government had failed to meet its disclosure obligations under brady maryland.under brady,the government has a duty to disclose evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.id.at.we address the two appeals below.
joseph prochilo 
a sting operation set up by agents of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf resulted in the indictment of joseph prochilo for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.the case against prochilo relies almost solely on the expected testimony of a government cooperator.the cooperator had played a central role in the sting,both arranging and consummating the purchase of the firearm.prochilo seasonably sought from the government exculpatory and impeachment information and materials relating to the cooperator.the discovery request focused on evidence that prochilo might use to impeach the witness,and cited eighteen different categories of evidence.essentially,prochilo requested all evidence in the government possession,including all cooperation agreements between the witness and government agencies copies of reports or documents relating to the witness contacts with those agencies and the complete files that any government agency had on the witness.
at a hearing on the discovery motion,the government maintained that it had reviewed the files and had turned over any brady material in its possession.among other things,the government had disclosed to prochilo 
all payments the government had made to the cooperating witness cw the cw cooperation agreement and confidential informant authorization request with the atf the cw criminal record that the cw was in the witness protection program and had violated a rule of that program by making an unauthorized trip to a prohibited area that the cw worked for,and was paid by,the dea for information,services,and security that the cw wrote a movie script that discussed his use of oxycontin and criminal activities an account of the cw illicit drug use and involvement in illegal drug sales that the atf had notified certain law enforcement authorities of the cw relationship with the atf,which had led to the dismissal of state criminal charges against him and that the cw had worked as an informant for and received promises,rewards,and inducements from the united states secret service,the essex county massachusetts sheriff department,the dea drug enforcement agency,and the fbi federal bureau of investigation 
the district court initially denied prochilo motion for production as moot,with the explicit provision that he could renew his motion after reviewing the materials disclosed by the government.
not long after the hearing,prochilo filed a renewed motion for production of exculpatory and impeachment information and materials.in this motion,prochilo asked the district court to order the government to disclose the witness entire relationship with the government.prochilo requested details regarding the witness work with the united states secret service,the essex county sheriff department,the dea,and the fbi information regarding the other atf cases on which the cooperator worked the witness cooperation agreements with government agencies other than the atf a description of other firearms seized by the government as a result of the witness cooperation information about the cooperator contacts with other government agencies as they related to other matters or other investigations and a list of all benefits the witness received as a result of these contacts.the district court granted prochilo motion.
the government continued to resist additional disclosure,and in response prochilo argued that the requested materials would support his claim that the witness had set him up,and they would enable him to explore bias arising from the cooperator relationship to the government.the district court reaffirmed its earlier ruling,ordering the government to produce all files related to the witness relationship with the government,including the cw relationship with the government in all other cases.
in motions for reconsideration,the government maintained that prochilo had failed to provide any plausible indication that the materials he sought contained evidence that was both favorable to him and material.the government did,however,provide additional information about the cooperator work with various federal law enforcement agencies,noting that the witness had provided assistance in twelve cases or investigations by the atf two of which also involved the dea,four cases or investigations by the dea alone,and two investigations by the fbi.the government explained that the cooperator had assisted these agencies by either providing information or playing a direct role in arranged transactions.the government continued to maintain,however,that it had already turned over all brady material relating to the witness.it also asked the court to exclude the witness from testifying at trial in the event that the court denied reconsideration.the district court reaffirmed its order and excluded the witness.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
w e review brady determinations for abuse of discretion.united states decologero,cir.under brady,the government has a duty to disclose evidence in its possession that is favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.at strickler greene,u.evidence is favorable to the accused if it is either exculpatory or impeaching in nature and material if there is a reasonable probability that,had it been disclosed,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickler,at kyles whitley,evidence is material if it could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.
the government is primarily responsible for deciding what evidence it must disclose to the defendant under brady.pennsylvania ritchie.and at least where a defendant has made only a general request for brady material,the government decision about disclosure is ordinarily it emerges later that exculpatory evidence was not disclosed.id.at.
when the defendant seeks access to specific materials that the government maintains are not discoverable under brady,however,a trial court may in some instances conduct an in camera review of the disputed materials.see ritchie,at united states,cir wayne lafave et,criminal procedure b ed.to justify such a review,the defendant must make some showing that the materials in question could contain favorable,material evidence.ritchie,at explaining that the defendant must establish a basis for his claim that what he seeks contains material evidence united states brandon,cir lafave,supra,b.this showing can not consist of mere speculation.united states navarro,cir see also brandon,at.rather,the defendant should be able to articulate with some specificity what evidence he hopes to find in the requested materials,why he thinks the materials contain this evidence,and finally,why this evidence would be both favorable to him and material.united states,cir illustrating the kind of showing required,at similar.
the district court order that the government disclose all material in its possession directly to prochilo was not faithful to these principles.prochilo motions were general and speculative in nature.to be sure,many of the materials he requested could,depending on the facts of a particular case,contain material impeachment evidence.the government,however,maintained that it had already disclosed all such evidence in prochilo case.at this juncture,it was up to prochilo to put that representation into question by identifying specific materials he wanted the court to inspect in camera and by showing them to be favorable and material.he failed to do so.accordingly,there was no basis for the court to conduct an in camera inspection,much less order disclosure directly to prochilo.
