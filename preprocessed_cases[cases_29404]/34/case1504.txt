on october,richmond city police officers ryan taylor and jason mcclendon were patrolling a neighborhood in richmond in their police cruiser the officers saw a vehicle the car travelling at an estimated speed slightly exceeding the posted speed limit,and observed the car cross a yellow,line marker in the center of the roadway.after officer taylor activated the cruiser emergency lights and siren,the car turned into a driveway of a residence.the officers parked their cruiser at the end of the driveway behind the car,and initiated a traffic stop about 
the driver of the car,jeremy taylor the driver,immediately stepped out of the car.the officers thought that the driver might be attempting to abscond from the scene but the driver complied when ordered by officer mcclendon to return to the car.
as the officers approached the car,officer taylor recognized both occupants of the vehicle.officer taylor testified that he knew the driver as someone who had been hanging with individuals connected with robberies.officer taylor also recognized hill,the passenger in the vehicle,from a prior traffic stop,and was aware that hill had been a victim in a prior stabbing incident.
at officer taylor request,the driver produced identification but hill was unable to do so.officer taylor returned to the police cruiser,and entered the names of both the driver and hill into computer databases operated by the department of motor vehicles dmv and the national crime information center ncic.officer taylor took this action to confirm the men identities,to ascertain whether there were any warrants outstanding for their arrest,and to determine whether the driver had a valid operator license.
after about three minutes had passed,the ncic database returned an alert notifying officer taylor that both men had been associated with drug trafficking and were likely armed.officer taylor also learned that the driver had a suspended operator license.accordingly,about,officer taylor began writing two summonses for the driver,one for reckless driving and one for driving with a suspended operator license.officer taylor also requested that a unit be sent to the scene.
officer taylor interrupted writing the summonses in order to enter the men names into an additional computer database known as pistol,which tracks every person who has had prior contacts with the police in richmond officer taylor testified that using pistol can be a lengthy process because after an officer enters an individual name into the system,pistol produces a list of all individuals with the same name.in this case,after pistol produced a list of eight or nine individuals with the same name as the driver,officer taylor spent between three and five minutes reviewing that information.once officer taylor had located both the driver and hill in the pistol system,officer taylor resumed writing the two summonses.both officers testified that it typically takes about four or five minutes to write a single summons.
while officer taylor searched the databases and continued to write the summonses in the police cruiser,officer mcclendon remained standing next to the passenger side of the car m aking small talk with the driver and hill.during their conversation,officer mcclendon asked the men a total of three times whether there were any drugs or firearms in the car.following the third inquiry,hill responded that he had a firearm on his person.officer mcclendon immediately shouted gun,prompting officer taylor to return to the car to assist in securing hill and recovering the firearm.
meanwhile,the unit had arrived at the scene.however,at the time officer mcclendon yelled gun,the unit dog was still in the unit vehicle and had not begun its anticipated sniff of the area around the car.the district court found that a total of about minutes had elapsed from the time the officers initiated the stop to the moment that officer mcclendon shouted gun.
hill was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.he filed a motion to suppress both the firearm and the statements he made during the traffic stop.after a suppression hearing,the district court found that the officers had testified credibly,and accepted as true the officers description of the events.the court also found that the stop was not extended for any reason,including officer taylor request for a unit.the court accordingly concluded that the officers had acted lawfully,and denied hill motion to suppress.
hill later entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to challenge on appeal the denial of his suppression motion.hill now appeals from the district court denial of that motion.
hill argues that officers taylor and mcclendon unlawfully extended the duration and scope of the traffic stop,in violation of hill rights under the fourth amendment.in particular,hill challenges officer mcclendon decision to talk with him and the driver,rather than to assist officer taylor with searching the databases and writing the summonses.hill also challenges officer taylor decisions to request a unit and to search the pistol database.hill asserts that as a cumulative effect of these decisions,the officers improperly extended the stop beyond the time necessary to complete the purpose of the stop in violation of the supreme court decision in rodriguez.we disagree with hill arguments.
