in the early morning hours of april,on the high seas between somalia and the seychelles in the indian ocean off the east coast of africa,the defendants abdi wali dire,gabul abdullahi ali,abdi mohammed umar,abdi mohammed gurewardher,and mohammed modin hasan imprudently launched an attack on the uss nicholas,having confused that mighty navy frigate for a vulnerable merchant ship.the defendants,all somalis,were swiftly apprehended and then transported to the eastern district of virginia,where they were convicted of the crime of piracy,as proscribed by,plus myriad other criminal offenses.in this appeal,the defendants challenge their convictions and sentences on several grounds,including that their fleeting and fruitless strike on the nicholas did not,as a matter of law,amount to a piracy offense.as explained below,we reject their contentions and affirm.
according to the trial evidence,the uss nicholas was on a mission in the indian ocean when,lit to disguise itself as a merchant vessel,it encountered the defendants shortly after midnight on april,the nicholas was approached by an attack skiff operated by defendant hasan and also carrying defendants dire and ali,while defendants umar and gurewardher remained with a larger some distance away.from their posts on the nicholas,crew members could see by way of devices that hasan was armed with a loaded grenade launcher commonly referred to as an rpg,and that dire and ali carried ak assault rifles.
the captain of the uss nicholas,commander mark kesselring,directed his gunners to man their stations and prepare to fire,and ordered his unarmed personnel inside the skin of the ship for safety.when the defendants attack skiff was within sixty feet of the nicholas fantail its lowest and thus most accessible point,dire and ali discharged the first shots bursts of rapid,automatic fire from their ak aimed at the nicholas and meant to attain its surrender.the nicholas crew responded in kind,resulting in an exchange of fire that lasted less than thirty seconds.bullets from dire and ali ak struck the nicholas near two of its crew members,but the defendants brief attack was thankfully.dire,ali,and hasan then turned their skiff and fled,with the nicholas in pursuit.
during the chase,sailors on the uss nicholas observed a flashing light on the horizon a beacon from umar and gurewardher to lead the attack skiff back to the mothership.commander kesselring,however,managed to keep the nicholas between the defendants two vessels to thwart the attempted reunion.meanwhile,dire,ali,and hasan threw various items from the skiff overboard into the indian ocean,discarding the rpg,the ak,and a ladder that would have enabled them to board the nicholas.about thirty minutes into the pursuit,the nicholas captured the three defendants in the skiff.thereafter,the nicholas chased and captured the two defendants in the mothership.a suspected second attack skiff,which had appeared on radar but did not close on the nicholas,was never found.
the defendants strike on the uss nicholas was consistent with an accustomed pattern of somali pirate attacks,designed to seize a merchant ship and then return with the vessel and its crew to somalia,where a ransom would be negotiated and secured.indeed,on april,during questioning aboard the nicholas,the defendants separately confessed to participating willingly in a scheme to hijack a merchant vessel,and they provided details about their operation.
the grand jury in the eastern district of virginia returned a indictment against the defendants on april,and a superseding indictment the operative indictment on july.the indictment,which alleged facts consistent with the subsequent trial evidence,contained the following charges 
count one piracy as defined by the law of nations 
count two attack to plunder a vessel 
count three act of violence against persons on a vessel a and a 
count four conspiracy to perform an act of violence against persons on a vessel a and a 
counts five and six assault with a dangerous weapon within a special maritime jurisdiction a 
counts seven and eight assault with a dangerous weapon on federal officers and employees a and b 
count nine conspiracy involving a firearm and a crime of violence o 
counts ten and eleven using,carrying,and possessing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence c a iii 
count twelve using,carrying,and possessing a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence c a and c b ii 
count thirteen carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony h and 
count fourteen conspiracy to carry an explosive during the commission of a felony m 
the indictment identified the eastern district of virginia as the proper venue under,which provides that t he trial of all offenses begun or committed upon the high seas shall be in the district in which the offender,or any one of two or more joint offenders,is arrested or is first brought.
at the conclusion of an trial,conducted between november and,the jury returned separate verdicts of guilty against all defendants on all counts.the sentencing hearing took place on march,and final judgments were entered on march.the district court dismissed count thirteen for being multiplicitous with count twelve,and sentenced each of the defendants to life plus eighty years months on the remaining convictions.specifically,the court imposed mandatory life sentences for the count one piracy offense concurrent sentences of months each on counts two,five,and six,and of months each on counts three,four,seven,eight,nine,and fourteen plus consecutive sentences of months each on counts ten and eleven,and of months on count twelve.the defendants have timely noted their appeals,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
in these consolidated appeals,the defendants first contend that their attack on the uss nicholas did not constitute piracy under,which provides in full 
whoever,on the high seas,commits the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations,and is afterwards brought into or found in the united states,shall be imprisoned for life.
according to the defendants,the crime of piracy has been narrowly defined for purposes of as robbery at sea,seizing or otherwise robbing a vessel.because they boarded the nicholas only as captives and indisputably took no property,the defendants contest their convictions on count one,as well as the affixed life sentences.
the defendants piracy contention is one that they unsuccessfully presented at multiple stages of the district court proceedings.prior to their trial,the defendants moved to dismiss count one under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.by its published opinion of october,the district court denied relief,premised on its determination that the indictment set forth facts that are sufficient,if proven true,to constitute the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations,in violation of.united states hasan,d,hasan i in so ruling,the court concluded contrary to the defendants posited robbery requirement that piracy as defined by incorporated law of nations encompasses,inter alia,acts of violence committed on the high seas for private ends.see id.at.
during the trial,at the close of the government,hasan renewed his motion to dismiss count one,which the district court denied from the bench.the court also rejected the defendants proposed jury instruction delineating the elements of the count one piracy offense,in favor of an instruction consistent with its hasan i opinion.finally,following the trial,four of the defendants moved under federal rule of criminal procedure for judgments of acquittal on count one the court denied those motions by its unpublished opinion of march.see united states hasan,cr,slip op.at,hasan ii 
the hasan i opinion was issued on the heels of the august,published opinion in united states said,d jackson,wherein a different judge of the eastern district of virginia essentially took these defendants view of the piracy offense by recognizing a robbery element.like these defendants,the said defendants have been charged with piracy under for attacking but not seizing or otherwise robbing a united states navy ship.see said,d at describing indictment allegations that,around on april,said defendants fired at least one shot on uss ashland from skiff in gulf of aden.the said court granted the defendants pretrial motion,pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,to dismiss the piracy count from the indictment because no taking of property was alleged.id.at 
as the said court recognized,article i of the constitution accords congress the power t o define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offences against the law of nations.const.art.i,cl.the define and punish clause.in its present form,the language of can be traced to an act of congress,which similarly provided,in pertinent part 
that if any person or persons whatsoever,shall,on the high seas,commit the crime of piracy,as defined by the law of nations,and such offender or offenders,shall afterwards be brought into or found in the united states,every such offender or offenders shall,upon conviction thereof,be punished 
see act of,ch,stat,the act of.whereas today mandatory penalty for piracy is life imprisonment,however,the act of commanded punishment with death.id.at.examining the act of in its united states smith decision of,the supreme court recognized 
there is scarcely a writer on the law of nations,who does not allude to piracy,as a crime of a settled and determinate nature and whatever may be the diversity of definitions,in other respects,all writers concur,in holding,that robbery,or forcible depredations upon the sea,animo furandi is piracy.
wheat.accordingly,the smith court,through justice story,articulated no hesitation in declaring,that piracy,by the law of nations,is robbery upon the sea.id.at.
invoking the principle that a court must interpret a statute by its ordinary meaning at the time of its enactment,the said court deemed smith to be the definitive authority on the meaning of piracy under.see said,d at citing,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,for the proposition that courts interpret congress use of a term in light of its history,and presume congress intended the phrase to have the meaning generally accepted in the legal community at the time of enactment.the said court noted that it was the first court since the to be tasked with interpreting the piracy statute as it applies to alleged conduct in international waters.id.at.looking to courts that have addressed the piracy statute in other contexts,the said court concluded that the discernible definition of piracy as robbery or forcible depredations committed on the high seas under has remained consistent and has reached a level of concrete consensus in united s t ates law.id.at 
the said court also reviewed the legislative history of and detected no congressional modifications to smith definition of piracy.see said,d at.for example,the court observed that,in,congress comprehensively revised all of title of the united s t ates criminal code,but was not substantively updated.id.indeed,the court noted,the only substantive change to since its enactment has been the removal of the death penalty for the offense as opposed to the current penalty of life imprisonment.id.
additionally,the said court discerned support for a static definition of piracy under from the existence of the statute criminalizing an attack to plunder a vessel,which provides 
whoever,upon the high seas or other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states,by surprise or open force,maliciously attacks or sets upon any vessel belonging to another,with an intent unlawfully to plunder the same,or to despoil any owner thereof of any moneys,goods,or merchandise laden on board thereof,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
the court perceived that,because targets exactly the conduct charged against the said defendants of shooting at the uss ashland with an ak rifle,it would be rendered redundant by extending the meaning of piracy under to include that same violent conduct.see said,d at observing,inter alia,that two sections in the same chapter of the criminal code should not be construed such that one is made completely superfluous.the court was also troubled by the consequence of interpreting and to reach the same conduct,which could include an act as minor as a assault,a bow and arrow,or even throwing a rock at a vessel.id.at.the court deemed it illogical,in light of the ten year imprisonment penalty congress promulgated for a violation of,that a defendant who committed such a minor act was meant to be exposed to the penalty of life in prison for piracy under.id.
finally,although the said court acknowledged contemporary international law sources defining piracy to encompass the said defendants violent conduct,the court deemed such sources to be too unsettled to be authoritative.see said,d at.the court further determined that relying on those international law sources would violate due process,explaining that,if the definition of piracy were adopted from the debatable international sources whose promulgations evolve over time,defendants in united states courts would be required to constantly guess whether their conduct is proscribed by,render ing the statute unconstitutionally vague.id.at.thereby undeterred from employing the clear and authoritative definition in smith of piracy as sea robbery,the court dismissed the piracy count from the said indictment.id.at.
here,the district court took a different tack,as laid out in its sweeping hasan i opinion denying these defendants pretrial motion to dismiss the count one piracy charge from their indictment.that is,the court focused on piracy unusual status as a crime defined by the law of nations and subject to universal jurisdiction.
the district court began by recognizing that,f or centuries,pirates have been universally condemned as hostis humani generis enemies of all mankind because they attack vessels on the high seas,and thus outside of any nation territorial jurisdiction,with devastating effect to global commerce and navigation.hasan i,d at.the court then turned its attention to the define and punish clause,and specifically the potential double redundancy presented by pairing piracies with felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the law of nations,the latter two categories being broader groupings of offenses within which piracy was already included.id.at quoting const.art.i,cl.
the district court perceived that,by nonetheless including piracies in the define and punish clause,the framers distinguished that crime from felonies committed on the high seas and offences against the law of nations a sensible distinction to make in light of what would have been known to the framers that piracy on the high seas was a unique offense because it permitted nations to invoke universal jurisdiction,such that any country could arrest and prosecute pirates in its domestic courts,irrespective of the existence of a jurisdictional nexus.hasan i,d at citing william blackstone,commentaries describing piracy,in the mid,as an offence against the universal law of society,so that every community hath a right,by the rule of,to punish pirates eugene kontorovich,the define and punish clause and the limits of universal jurisdiction,nw.indeed,by the eighteenth century,as the district court observed,the international crime of piracy was well established as the only universal jurisdiction crime.see the chapman,cas,quoting the celebrated argument by afterward chief justice marshall,in the robbins case,that piracy,under the law of nations,which alone is punishable by all nations,can only consist in an act which is an offense against all.
with that history in mind,the district court recognized that the define and punish clause accords to congress the special power of criminalizing piracy in a manner consistent with the exercise of universal jurisdiction.hasan i,d at.the court further recognized,however,that congress encountered early difficulties in criminalizing general piracy that is,piracy in contravention of the law of nations,rather than solely municipal piracy,piracy in violation of united states law.see id.at.on the one hand,w hile municipal piracy is flexible enough to cover virtually any overt act congress chooses to dub piracy,it is necessarily restricted to those acts that have a jurisdictional nexus with the united states.id.citing dole new eng.mut.marine ins,cas.explaining that,although many artificial offences have been created which are to be deemed to amount to piracy,piracy created by municipal statute can only be tried by that state within whose territorial jurisdiction,on board of whose vessels,the offence thus created was committed.on the other hand,general piracy can be prosecuted by any nation,irrespective of the presence of a jurisdictional nexus.id.citing sosa alvarez machain,breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment i n the century,nations reached consensus not only on the substantive principle that acts of piracy were universally wrong but also on the jurisdictional principle that any nation that found a pirate could prosecute him.importantly,though,because it is created by international consensus,general piracy is restricted in substance to those offenses that the international community agrees constitute piracy.id.
the district court elucidated that,in the absence of federal common law power to apply the law of nations,congress had to enact a municipal law that adequately embodied the international crime of piracy,requiring legislation that was broad enough to incorporate the definition of piracy under the law of nations and,in so doing,invoke universal jurisdiction but narrow enough to exclude conduct that was beyond the scope of that definition.hasan i,d at.congress first effort in that regard,a act,proved unsuccessful.see id.at discussing act of,ch,stat.the act of.by chief justice marshall decision in united states palmer,the supreme court ruled that because the wording of the act of evidenced an intent to criminalize offences against the united states,not offences against the human race the act did not authorize the courts of the union to inflict its penalties on persons who are not citizens of the united states,nor sailing under their flag,nor offending particularly against them.wheat.the palmer decision thus announced the act of failure to define piracy as a universal jurisdiction crime.
within a year of palmer,as the district court recounted,congress passed the act of to make clear that it wished to proscribe not only piratical acts that had a nexus to the united states,but also piracy as an international offense subject to universal jurisdiction.hasan i,d at.of course,the act of is nearly identical to the current piracy statute.see id.at the only significant difference between and of the act of is the penalty prescribed the former substitutes mandatory life imprisonment for death,the mandatory penalty prescribed by the latter.in key part,both and the act of proscribe piracy simply as defined by the law of nations.
the district court observed that chapter of title,entitled piracy and privateering,contains not only,but also other provisions condemning acts of piracy.see hasan i,d at.the court specifically cited the statute criminalizing an attack to plunder a vessel,as well as deeming a pirate to be a citizen of the united states who commits any murder or robbery,or any act of hostility against the united states,or against any citizen thereof,on the high seas,under color of any commission from any foreign prince,or state,or on pretense of authority from any person and defining a pirate as a citizen or subject of any foreign state who is found and taken on the sea making war upon the united states,or cruising against the vessels and property thereof,or of the citizens of the same,contrary to the provisions of any treaty existing between the united states and the state of which the offender is a citizen or subject,when by such treaty such acts are declared to be piracy.nevertheless,the court emphasized that those other statutes unlike simply proscribe piracy in the municipal sense by dubbing various acts as piracy even though they may not necessarily fall within the definition of general piracy recognized by the international community.hasan i,d at.
the district court in hasan i astutely traced the meaning of piracy under the law of nations,from the time of the act of to the modern era and the crime codification at.the court commenced with the supreme court decision in united states smith,relating that justice story easily concluded that the act of sufficiently and constitutionally defined piracy by expressly incorporating the definition of piracy under the law of nations.see hasan i,d at quoting smith,wheat.at.the district court also recounted that,t o ascertain how the law of nations defined piracy,the smith court consulted the works of jurists,writing professedly on public law s,the general usage and practice of nations,and judicial decisions recognising and enforcing the law of nations on piracy.id.fifth alteration in original quoting smith,wheat.at.the smith court thereupon announced that whatever may be the diversity of definitions,in other respects,all writers concur,in holding,that robbery,or forcible depredations upon the sea,animo furandi,is piracy.wheat.at see also id.at expressing no hesitation in declaring,that piracy,by the law of nations,is robbery upon the sea.further,because the smith prisoner and his associates were,at the time they allegedly plundered and robbed a spanish vessel,freebooters,upon the sea,the court deemed the case to be one of piracy punishable under the act of.id.at.
having noted that n o other supreme court decision since smith has directly addressed the definition of general piracy,and recognizing the necessity of looking to foreign sources to determine the law of nations,the district court then focused on case law from other countries.see hasan i,d at.the court deemed the privy council of england decision in in re piracy jure gentium,to be t he most significant foreign case dealing with the question of how piracy is defined under international law.hasan i,d at there,the defendants were a number of armed chinese nationals who,while cruising in two chinese junks on the high seas,had chased a chinese cargo vessel for over half an hour,during which shots were fired by the attacking party.see in re piracy jure gentium,at.similar to the present case,however,those defendants were captured before accomplishing any robbery.id.the defendants were transported to hong kong for trial and found guilty of piracy,but only subject to the question of the hour whether an accused person may be convicted of piracy in circumstances where no robbery has occurred.id.at.premised on the full court of hong kong subsequent determination that a robbery was required,the defendants were ultimately acquitted.id.at.
though with no intent to disturb that judgment,the privy council revisited the issue upon referral from his majesty in council.see in re piracy jure gentium,at the decision of the hong kong court was final and the present proceedings are in no sense an appeal from that court,whose judgment stands.the precise question before the privy council was whether actual robbery is an essential element of the crime of piracy jure gentium,or whether a frustrated attempt to commit a piratical robbery is not equally piracy jure gentium.id.significantly,the privy council answered actual robbery is not an essential element in the crime of piracy jure gentium.a frustrated attempt to commit a piratical robbery is equally piracy jure gentium.id.
in so ruling,the privy council consulted a multitude of domestic and foreign authorities,including our supreme court decision in smith.see in re piracy jure gentium,at.rather than construing smith to provide an exhaustive definition of piracy by equating it with robbery at sea,the privy council declared smith piracy definition unimpeachable as far as it goes,but confined to the facts under consideration.id.at he would be a bold lawyer to dispute the authority of justice story,but the criticism upon smith delineation of piracy is that the learned judge was considering a case where t here was no doubt about the robbery.moreover,the privy council recognized that,while smith is typical of authorities suggesting that robbery is an essential ingredient of piracy,more recent cases compel the opposite conclusion.id.at.for example,the privy council cited the ambrose light,concluding that vessel was properly seized for engaging in piratical expedition rather than lawful warfare,as the american case where it was decided that an armed ship must have the authority of a state behind it,and if it has not got such an authority,it is a pirate even though no act of robbery has been committed by it.in re piracy jure gentium,at.the privy council also explained that the respective timing of the competing authorities is of great consequence,in that international law has not become a crystallized code at any time,but is a living and expanding branch of the law.id.at.to substantiate its view that piracy under the law of nations had expanded beyond sea robbery if it ever was so narrow,the privy council pointed to a league of nations subcommittee report stating that,according to international law,piracy consists in sailing the seas for private ends without authorization from the government of any state with the object of committing depredations upon property or acts of violence against persons.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition to the privy council in re piracy jure gentium decision,the district court in hasan i examined kenya republic ahmed prosecution of ten somali suspects captured by the united states navy on the high seas t he most recent case on general piracy outside the united states of which the district court was aware.see hasan i,d at.the high court of kenya affirmed the ahmed defendants convictions for piracy jure gentium,culling from international treaties a modern definition of piracy that encompasses acts of violence and detention.see hasan i,d at citing ahmed republic,of may,azangalala,see also james thuo gathii,agora piracy prosecution kenya piracy prosecutions,am.int l,describing allegations that ahmed defendants hijacked indian vessel and held its crew captive for two days.
as detailed in hasan i,there are two prominent international agreements that have directly addressed,and defined,the crime of general piracy.see d at.the first of those treaties is the geneva convention on the high seas the high seas convention,which was adopted in and ratified by the united states in,rendering the united states one of today parties to that agreement.the starting point for the high seas convention was the harvard research in international law draft convention on piracy,am.int l,which sought to catalogue all judicial opinions on piracy and codify the international law of piracy.hasan i,d at.under the high seas convention,
p iracy consists of any of the following acts 
any illegal acts of violence,detention or any act of depredation,committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft,and directed 
a on the high seas,against another ship or aircraft,or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft 
b against a ship,aircraft,persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any state 
any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft 
any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in or subparagraph of this article.
geneva convention on the high seas,opened for signature,entered into force.
the second pertinent treaty is the united nations convention on the law of the sea the unclos,which has amassed parties since albeit not the united states,which has not ratified the unclos but has recognized that its baseline provisions reflect customary international law.see united states alaska,internal quotation marks omitted see also hasan i,d at explaining that united states has not ratified unclos due to disagreement with deep seabed mining provisions unrelated to piracy citing thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law ed.relevant here,the unclos provides that 
p iracy consists of any of the following acts 
a any illegal acts of violence or detention,or any act of depredation,committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft,and directed 
i on the high seas,against another ship or aircraft,or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft 
ii against a ship,aircraft,persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any state 
b any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a or aircraft 
c any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph a or b.
convention on the law of the sea,opened for signature,entered into force.upon comparing the high seas convention with the unclos,the district court in hasan i recognized that the latter treaty defines piracy in exactly the same terms as the former agreement,with only negligible stylistic changes.see d at.the court also observed that the unclos represents the most recent international statement regarding the definition of piracy.id.
turning to the contentions of the parties herein,the district court related the defendants position that the authoritative definition of piracy under the law of nations,and thus within the meaning of,is provided by the supreme court decision in smith.hasan i,d at.according to the defendants,because their indictment did not allege that they committed any actual robbery on the high seas,the count one piracy charge had to be dismissed.id.at.for its part,however,the government defended count one on the premise that smith neither foreclosed the possibility that piracy included conduct other than robbery nor precluded the possibility that the definition of piracy under the law of nations might later come to include conduct other than robbery.id.in response,the district court recognized that if the definition of piracy under the law of nations can evolve over time,such that the modern law of nations must be applied,rather than any recitation of the state of the law in the early nineteenth century,the court need not determine w hether smith was limited to its facts and not intended to be exhaustive,or whether its description of piracy was exhaustive but only represented the definition of piracy accepted at that time by the international community.id.at.the court then embarked on the relevant analysis.
first,the district court interpreted as an unequivocal demonstration of congressional intent to incorporate any subsequent developments in the definition of general piracy under the law of nations.hasan i,d at.the court rationalized 
the plain language of reveals that,in choosing to define the international crime of piracy by reference to the law of nations,congress made a conscious decision to adopt a flexible but at all times sufficiently precise definition of general piracy that would automatically incorporate developing international norms regarding piracy.accordingly,congress necessarily left it to the federal courts to determine the definition of piracy under the law of nations based on the international consensus at the time of the alleged offense.
id.citing ex parte quirin,where the supreme court reiterated its ruling in smith that a n act of congress punishing the crime of piracy,as defined by the law of nations is an appropriate exercise of its constitutional authority to define and punish the offense,since it has adopted by reference the sufficiently precise definition of international law citations omitted.the district court further gleaned that congress intended to adopt a flexible definition for general piracy from the history of especially the passage of its forerunner act of in the wake of the supreme court palmer decision quelling any notion that general piracy had been,up to that time,sufficiently defined and proscribed by domestic statutory law.see hasan i,d at.the court noted that palmer highlighted congress powerlessness to control the contours of general piracy,in that developing international norms may alter the offense accepted definition,albeit at a glacial pace.id.at.thus,according to the court,the act of simple incorporation of the law of nations made sense,because it relieved congress of having to revise the general piracy statute continually to mirror the international consensus definition.id.as written,the act of,and now,automatically incorporate advancements in the definition of general piracy under the law of nations.id 
having concluded that congress proscription of piracy as defined by the law of nations in necessarily incorporates modern developments in international law,the district court next endeavored to discern the definition of piracy under the law of nations at the time of the alleged offense in april.hasan i,d at.in so doing,the court observed that the law of nations is ascertained today via the same path followed in by the supreme court in smith consultation of the works of jurists,writing professedly on public law s consideration of the general usage and practice of nations and contemplation of judicial decisions recognising and enforcing that law.see hasan i,d at quoting smith,wheat.at.engaging in that analysis,the court concluded 
as of april,the law of nations,also known as customary international law,defined piracy to include acts of violence committed on the high seas for private ends without an actual taking.more specifically,the definition of general piracy under modern customary international law is,at the very least,reflected in article of the high seas convention and article of the unclos.
id.at see also id.at today,the law of nations has become synonymous with the term customary international law,which describes the body of rules that nations in the international community universally abide by,or accede to,out of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern.quoting vietnam ass for victims of agent orange dow chem,cir.narrowing customary international law to one of those two treaties,the court chose the unclos,which in addition to contain ing a definition of general piracy that is,for all practical purposes,identical to that of the high seas convention has many more states parties than the high seas convention and has been much more widely accepted by the international community than the high seas convention.id.at footnote omitted.
in the course of its discussion of the high seas convention and the unclos,the district court recognized that t reaties are proper evidence of customary international law because,and insofar as,they create legal obligations akin to contractual obligations on the states parties to them.hasan i,d at quoting kiobel royal dutch petroleum,cir.according to the court,w hile all treaties shed some light on the customs and practices of a state,a treaty will only constitute sufficient proof of a norm of customary international law if an overwhelming majority of states have ratified the treaty,and those states uniformly and consistently act in accordance with its principles.id.emphasis omitted quoting kiobel,at.in this regard,the court emphasized,it is also important to understand that a treaty can either embod y or create a rule of customary international law,and such a rule applies beyond the limited subject matter of the treaty and to nations that have not ratified it.id.alterations in original quoting kiobel,at.with those principles in mind,the court recognized 
there were states parties to the high seas convention as of june,including the united states,and there were states parties to unclos including the european union as of october,including somalia.the states parties to unclos represent the overwhelming majority of the member states of the united nations,and the countries recognized by the united states department of state.unclos definition of piracy therefore represents a widely accepted norm,followed out of a sense of agreement or,in the case of the states parties,treaty obligation,that has been recognized by an overwhelming majority of the world.
the status of unclos as representing customary international law is enhanced by the fact that the states parties to it include all of the nations bordering the indian ocean on the east coast of africa,where the incident in the instant case is alleged to have taken place south africa,mozambique,tanzania,kenya,and somalia.see kiobel,at noting that a treaty evidentiary value for assessing customary international law depends on the number of parties and the parties relative influence on the international issue.also significant in determining whether unclos constitutes sufficient proof of a norm of customary international law is the fact that both the united states and somalia,two countries that clearly have an influence on the piracy issue,have each ratified,and thus accepted,a treaty containing the exact same definition of general piracy.
moreover,although the definition of general piracy provided by the high seas convention and unclos is not nearly as succinct as robbery on the sea,the definitions are not merely general aspirational statements,but rather specific enumerations of the elements of piracy reflecting the modern consensus view of international law.accordingly,unclos definition of general piracy has a character and reflects an existing norm of customary international law that is binding on even those nations that are not a party to the convention,including the united states.
hasan i,d at footnote and citations omitted 
the district court further observed that unclos does not represent the first time that acts of violence have been included in the definition of general piracy.hasan i,d at.rather,even accepting that actual robbery on the high seas was once an essential element of general piracy,the view that general piracy does not require an actual robbery on the sea has certainly gained traction since the nineteenth century,as evidenced by intervening case law,the harvard draft convention on piracy,the high seas convention,and unclos.id.the court took especial note of kenya recent reliance on the unclos to define general piracy in the republic ahmed case,concluding 
this actual state practice by kenya,the country currently most involved in prosecuting piracy,as well as the active support of such practice by other nations,which continue to bring other alleged pirates to kenya for prosecution,is indicative of the fact that the definition of piracy contained in the high seas convention and unclos have attained the status of a binding rule of customary international law.
hasan i,d at.additionally,the court recognized that c ontemporary scholarly sources appear to agree that the definition of piracy in unclos represents customary international law.id.at citing pertinent works of scholars.while writers on the issue do present disagreements regarding the definition of general piracy,the court acknowledged,such disagreements do not implicate the core definition provided in unclos.id.at explaining that writers instead disagree about the outer boundaries of the definition of general piracy,such as whether unclos requirement of private ends prohibits its application to terrorist activities,or whether piracy can arise in situations involving just one ship rather than two.
significantly,the district court rejected the defendants contention endorsed by the said court that the piracy statute,can not be read to include mere acts of violence committed in an effort to rob another vessel on the high seas,because doing so would render superfluous the statute.see hasan i,d at.the court in hasan i articulated that,although the defendants were correct in their assertion that reading to include acts of violence without an actual taking would render punishable as general piracy acts that also fall within,the defendants defectively ignored the distinct jurisdictional scopes provided by and.id.that is,w hile applies only to acts by united states citizens or foreign nationals set ting upon citizens or ships,provides for the prosecution of general piracy as opposed to municipal piracy with the ability to invoke universal jurisdiction.therefore,is not superfluous.id.second alteration in original.
the hasan i opinion further rejected the theory that applying the contemporary customary international law definition of general piracy violates fundamental due process protections.see hasan i,d at in short,defendants contend that construing to demand a flexible definition of general piracy reflecting developing international norms would necessarily subject them to punishment for crimes that are unconstitutionally vague.according to hasan i,express incorporation of the definition of piracy provided by the law of nations,which is today synonymous with customary international law,provides fair warning of what conduct is proscribed by the statute.id.at.in support of that conclusion,the district court in hasan i recapped the supreme court holding in smith that,by incorporating the definition of piracy under the law of nations,congress had proscribed general piracy as clearly as if it had enumerated the elements of the offense in the legislation itself.hasan i,d at citing smith,wheat.at.the district court also determined that the reasoning in smith applies equally to the application of today,explaining 
i n order for a definition of piracy to fall within the scope of,the definition must be sufficiently established to become customary international law.importantly,the high hurdle for establishing customary international law,namely the recognition of a general and consistent practice among the overwhelming majority of the international community,necessarily imputes to defendants fair warning of what conduct is forbidden under.such general and consistent practice is certainly reflected by the fact that an overwhelming majority of countries have ratified unclos,which reflects the modern definition of general piracy.just as the supreme court found in smith that the definition of piracy was readily ascertainable,it is apparent today that unclos to which somalia acceded in,over twenty years ago reflects the definitive modern definition of general piracy under customary international law.in fact,while the court recognizes the difference between imputed and actual notice for due process purposes,it is far more likely that the defendants,who claim to be somali nationals,would be aware of the piracy provisions contained in unclos,to which somalia is a party,than of smith,a nearly two hundred case written by a court in another country literally half a world away.
hasan i,d at.summarizing t hat is certain which is,by necessary reference,made certain,the district court reiterated that definition of general piracy was rendered certain by the statute incorporation of the law of nations.id.alteration in original quoting smith,wheat.at.
for its final hasan i undertaking,the district court measured the count one piracy charge in the defendants indictment against the statutory requirements set forth in,including the necessarily incorporated elements of general piracy established by customary international law.hasan i,d at.the court recognized that the defendants motion to dismiss count one turned on first condition that the defendants committed the act of piracy as defined by the law of nations,and not its second and third requirements respectively,that the piracy was committed on the high seas and that the defendants thereafter were brought into or found in the united states.id.
the district court then reaffirmed that,as of the alleged offense date of april,the definition of piracy under the law of nations was found in the substantively identical high seas convention and unclos,the latter having been accepted by the overwhelming majority of the world as reflecting customary international law.hasan i,d at.mirroring those treaties,the court pronounced that piracy within the meaning of consists of any of the following acts and their elements 
a any illegal act of violence or detention,or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship,or against persons or property on board such ship or 
b any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of the facts making it a pirate ship or 
c any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph a or b.

the district court concluded that defendants ali and dire were adequately charged in count one under subparagraph a,in that the indictment alleged that,while on the high seas,they boarded an assault boat,cruised towards the uss nicholas,and opened fire upon the navy frigate with ak.hasan i,d at.as for defendant hasan,the court suggested that subparagraphs a,b,and c authorized the piracy charge against him,because he allegedly boarded the assault boat with an rpg,with coconspirators ali and dire carrying ak,and cruised towards the uss nicholas,where ali and dire opened fire on the uss nicholas with their ak.id.ruling that the indictment adequately charges hasan with general piracy as a voluntary and knowing participant in ali and dire assault.finally,the court sustained count one against defendants gurewardher and umar under subparagraphs b and c,premised on the allegation that they maintained the seagoing vessel from which the assault boat carrying hasan,ali,and dire was launched,while their coconspirators set out to attack the uss nicholas.id.the matter then proceeded to trial,where the government adduced evidence consistent with the facts alleged in the indictment.
faithful to its hasan i opinion,the district court instructed the jury on count one,over the defendants objection,
that the law of nations defines the crime of piracy to include any of the three following actions 
a any illegal acts of violence or detention or any act of depredation committed for private ends on the high seas or a place outside the jurisdiction of any state by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship or 
b any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or 
c any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in a or b above.

rebuffing the entreaties for judgments of acquittal on count one,the district court observed in its hasan ii opinion of march,that it was being asked to reconsider its decision regarding the definition of piracy,as used in,in light of a congressional research service crs report entitled piracy a legal definition.see hasan ii,slip op.at.the crs report was issued on october,just ten days prior to the filing of hasan i and had not been considered by the district court in rendering that earlier decision.see id.at attributing its of the crs report to the fact that such reports,though public domain materials,are generally not made directly available to the public or to the federal courts,but instead only become public when released by a member of congress.in any event,the court deemed the crs report unhelpful to the defendants,explaining 
t he report does not appear to contain discussion of any relevant historical precedent that was not also discussed by the court in its hasan i opinion.neither does the report appear to contain any original substantive legal analysis regarding the proper definition of piracy under the law of nations.instead,the report merely discusses the fact that a recent development in a piracy trial in federal court in norfolk,va namely,the decision in united states said,d has highlighted a potential limitation in the definition of piracy under the united states code.
id.at quoting chuck mason,cong.research,piracy a legal definition summ.because the court was,of course,well aware of the decision in said when it issued its hasan i opinion,it concluded that the crs report provide d no basis for reconsideration of the definition of piracy under the law of nations as used in.id.at having found no meritorious premise for relief,the court validated the defendants count one piracy convictions.see id.at.
on appeal,the defendants maintain that the district court erred with respect to count one both by misinstructing the jury on the elements of the piracy offense,and in refusing to award judgments of acquittal.each aspect of the defendants position obliges us to assess whether the court took a mistaken view of and the incorporated law of nations.see united states kellam,cir observing that we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal united states singh,cir recognizing that we review a trial court jury instructions for abuse of discretion,and that a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law internal quotation marks omitted.
simply put,we agree with the conception of the law outlined by the court below.indeed,we have carefully considered the defendants appellate contentions endorsed by the amicus curiae brief submitted on their behalf,see supra note yet remain convinced of the correctness of the trial court analysis.
the crux of the defendants position is now,as it was in the district court,that the definition of general piracy was fixed in the early nineteenth century,when congress passed the act of first authorizing the exercise of universal jurisdiction by united states courts to adjudicate charges of piracy as defined by the law of nations.most notably,the defendants assert that the law of nations,as understood in,is not conterminous with the customary international law of today.the defendants rely on chief justice marshall observation that t he law of nations is a law founded on the great and immutable principles of equity and natural justice,the venus,cranch,marshall,dissenting,to support their theory that t he congress that enacted the act of did not view the universal law of nations as an evolving body of law.br.of appellants see also br.of amicus curiae arguing that,in,the law of nations was well understood to refer to an immutable set of obligations not evolving practices of nations or future pronouncements of international organizations that did not yet exist.
the defendants view is thoroughly refuted,however,by a bevy of precedent,including the supreme court decision in sosa alvarez machain.see supra note.the sosa court was called upon to determine whether alvarez could recover under the alien tort statute,the ats,for the drug enforcement administration instigation of his abduction from mexico for criminal trial in the united states.see at.the ats provides,in full,that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.significantly,the ats predates the criminalization of general piracy,in that it was passed by t he first congress as part of the judiciary act of.see sosa,at citing act of,ch,stat.authorizing federal district court jurisdiction over all causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.yet the sosa court did not regard the ats as incorporating some stagnant notion of the law of nations.rather,the court concluded that,while the first congress probably understood the ats to confer jurisdiction over only the three paradigmatic torts of the time including piracy the door was open to ats jurisdiction over additional claim s based on the law of nations,albeit in narrow circumstances.see id.at.those circumstances were lacking in the case of alvarez,whose ats claim could not withstand being gauged against the current state of international law.see id.at.
although,as the defendants point out,the ats involves civil claims and the general piracy statute entails criminal prosecutions,there is no reason to believe that the law of nations evolves in the civil context but stands immobile in the criminal context.moreover,if the congress of had believed either the law of nations generally or its piracy definition specifically to be inflexible,the act of could easily have been drafted to specify that piracy consisted of piracy as defined on march,the date of enactment,by the law of nations,or solely of,as the defendants would have it,robbery upon the sea.the government helpfully identifies numerous criminal statutes that incorporate a definition of an offense supplied by some other body of law that may change or develop over time,see br.of appellee citing,inter alia,a a the lacey act,prohibiting commercial activities involving any fish or wildlife taken,possessed,transported,or sold in violation of any law or any regulation of any state or in violation of any foreign law that use the term as defined by or its equivalent to incorporate definitions that are subject to change after statutory enactment,see id.at citing,b b prescribing punishment for illegal entry into white house or other restricted buildings or grounds where the offense results in significant bodily injury as defined by e and that explicitly tie the statutory definition to a particular time period,see id.at citing exempting from statutory limitations on the export of war materials trade which might have been lawfully carried on before the passage of this title enacted june,under the law of nations,or under the treaties or conventions entered into by the united states,or under the laws thereof.additionally,the government underscores that congress has explicitly equated piracy with robbery in other legislation,including the act of that failed to define piracy as a universal jurisdiction crime.
for their part,the defendants highlight the assimilated crimes act the aca as a statute that expressly incorporates state law in force at the time of the prohibited act or omission.see a.that reference was added to the aca,however,only after the supreme court ruled that a prior version was limited to the laws of the several states in force at the time of its enactment,united states paul,pet,a limitation that the court has not found in various other statutes incorporating outside laws and that we do not perceive in proscription of piracy as defined by the law of nations.
additional theories posited by the defendants of a static piracy definition are no more persuasive.for example,the defendants contend that giving piracy an evolving definition would violate the principle that there are no federal common law crimes.see br.of appellants citing united states hudson,cranch,for the proposition that federal courts have no power to exercise criminal jurisdiction in cases.the piracy offense can not be considered a common law crime,however,because congress properly ma de an act a crime,affix ed a punishment to it,and declare d the court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.see hudson,cranch at.moreover,in its smith decision,the supreme court unhesitatingly approved of the piracy statute incorporation of the law of nations,looking to various sources to ascertain how piracy was defined under the law of nations.see smith,wheat.at.
the defendants would have us believe that,since the smith era,the united states proscription of general piracy has been limited to robbery upon the sea.but that interpretation of our law would render it incongruous with the modern law of nations and prevent us from exercising universal jurisdiction in piracy cases.see sosa,at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment explaining that universal jurisdiction requires,inter alia,substantive uniformity among the laws of the exercising nations.at bottom,then,the defendants position is irreconcilable with the noncontroversial notion that congress intended in to define piracy as a universal jurisdiction crime.in these circumstances,we are constrained to agree with the district court that incorporates a definition of piracy that changes with advancements in the law of nations.
we also agree with the district court that the definition of piracy under the law of nations,at the time of the defendants attack on the uss nicholas and continuing today,had for decades encompassed their violent conduct.that definition,spelled out in the unclos,as well as the high seas convention before it,has only been reaffirmed in recent years as nations around the world have banded together to combat the escalating scourge of piracy.for example,in november,the united nations security council adopted resolution,recalling a series of prior resolutions approved between and concerning the situation in somalia expressing grave concern about the ongoing threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels pose and emphasizing the need for a comprehensive response by the international community to repress piracy and armed robbery at sea and tackle its underlying causes.of the utmost significance,resolution reaffirmed that international law,as reflected in the unclos,sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea.because the district court correctly applied the unclos definition of piracy as customary international law,we reject the defendants challenge to their count one piracy convictions,as well as their mandatory life sentences.
the defendants raise several additional appellate contentions,which we are also content to reject.
first,the defendants contend that the district court erroneously denied their individual motions to suppress statements they made on april,when questioned aboard the uss nicholas three days after their capture.they assert that the interviews contravened the fifth amendment,because the investigators failed to adequately advise them of their right to counsel,and did not obtain knowing and intelligent waivers of their rights to counsel and to remain silent before soliciting their statements.of course,under miranda arizona,a suspect in custody 
must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent,that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law,that he has the right to the presence of an attorney,and that if he can not afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.
once the proper warnings have been given,the suspect may knowingly and intelligently waive his rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement.id.
the district court conducted a pretrial evidentiary hearing concerning the defendants suppression motions on september,and denied the motions by its published opinion of october.see united states hasan,d.hasan iii material to the suppression issue,the court hasan iii opinion enumerated the following facts.
on april,naval criminal investigative service ncis special agent michael knox,accompanied by ncis special agent theodore mordecai and interpreter aziz ismail,questioned the five defendants dire,ali,umar,gurewardher,and hasan aboard the uss nicholas.see hasan iii,d at.two days earlier,on april,special agent knox had participated in onboard interviews with three of the defendants,during which ismail then posted with special agent mordecai on another navy vessel,the uss farragut provided translation services via satellite telephone.see id.at.ismail,a naturalized united states citizen,was born,reared,and educated in somalia and speaks the same dialect of somali that defendants speak.id.during the april interviews,hasan and dire both represented that they were fishermen who had been kidnapped by the other defendants and forced to engage in piracy,but gurewardher immediately confessed to being a pirate and engaging in piratical operations.id.at.ismail and mordecai were thereafter taken by helicopter from the farragut to the nicholas to assist knox in person with the april questioning of all five defendants.id.at 
the defendants were brought on april,to the centerline passageway of the uss nicholas,where they were interviewed first individually and then as a group.see hasan iii,d at.neither special agents knox and mordecai nor interpreter ismail was visibly armed,and other armed personnel were several feet away,and only in the vicinity when the defendants came and went meanwhile,the defendants were handcuffed but not blindfolded.id.at the outset of each interview,knox,speaking through ismail,recited from memory a number of warnings.id.knox was an experienced ncis agent who convincingly testified that he has given miranda warnings approximately times and can recite them from memory.id.at.
according to special agent knox,he advised each defendant that they have the right to remain silent that at any time they could request to be taken back to their holding area and that if they wanted a lawyer,we would give them one.hasan iii,d at quoting.knox had intentionally modified his articulation of the defendants right to attorneys because he knew getting a lawyer on the ship was impossible,id.quoting in any event,none of the defendants requested a lawyer.following the warnings,knox read each defendant a cleansing statement that he had received earlier that day by email and also slightly modified to fit the situation.id.quoting.the cleansing statement advised,inter alia,that the interview with me today is a new interview that j ust because you talked to me or someone else before does not mean you have to do so today and that,i f you choose to talk to me today,anything you say can be used against you in court.id.at quoting.
other government witnesses,including special agent mordecai and interpreter ismail,all corroborated the fact that special agent knox administered warnings to defendants,although their recollections of the warnings varied slightly.hasan iii,d at.ismail recall ed translating both an explanation by special agent knox that defendants had the right not to say anything and the written cleansing statement as read by knox,but also indicat ed that the warnings were not delivered as they are on television.id.additionally,ismail acknowledg ed that he may have translated warnings relating to the use of statements in court and the availability of an attorney for defendants,but simply did not recall.id.ismail was more clear that he asked each defendant at the conclusion of knox warnings if that defendant understood,and each defendant said yes in somali.id.at.other testimony indicated that the defendants instead nodded their heads,but no witness perceived anything indicating that any of the defendants had not understood the warnings,and at no point did any of the defendants show any sign of reluctance or confusion.id.at.although ali and dire initially claimed that they had been forced to participate in the attack on the uss nicholas,eventually,upon a few minutes of individual questioning,each defendant admitted to being a pirate,and hasan,ali,and dire each admitted to specific roles in the nicholas attack information that was reconfirmed during the subsequent group interview.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
evaluating the evidence before it,the district court found that special agent knox did,in fact,administer the warnings he recalled to each of the defendants at the beginning of each of their interviews on april.hasan iii,d at.the court also determined that no deficiency appears to exist in special agent knox modified warning with respect to defendants right to an attorney.id.relying on united states frankson,cir,for the proposition that knox warning was adequate even though he only advised defendants that counsel would be provided to them if they wanted one,and therefore did not specify that defendants had the right to the presence of an attorney prior to questioning.
the district court deemed it a closer question whether the defendants being speaking and illiterate somali nationals,without any connection to the united states could have knowingly and intelligently waived their fifth amendment rights against.see hasan iii,d at expressing sympathy to the defendants portrait of conditions in somalia,including a barely functional government,a dearth of lawyers,and the absence of individual freedoms protecting persons who wish to refuse to answer questions from authorities.for guidance,the district court looked to berghuis thompkins,in which the supreme court recently clarified that waivers can be established by formal or express statements of waiver,but also can be implied from all the circumstances.see.cognizant of the principle that no waiver express or implied can be established absent the prosecution showing that the accused understood his rights,see,the district court confronted the defendants assertion that they did not understand special agent knox miranda warnings.see hasan iii,d at.the court rejected that assertion,explaining 
t he evidence before the court indicates that special agent knox did,in fact,ask each defendant if he understood the rights that had just been given to him.although the testimony diverges as to the precise nature of defendants response special agents knox and mordecai recalled only nodding the lack of any indication of not understanding,whereas interpreter ismail recalls each defendant verbally saying yes in somali the testimony is uniform in suggesting understanding,as opposed to lack thereof,on the part of defendants.ultimately,defendants were adequately warned of their rights against under the fifth amendment in accordance with the requirements of miranda.the miranda rights were recited to defendants,through ismail,in their native language.at no point did defendants claim that they did not understand the words being recited by ismail,or that ismail was not speaking their native language or dialect.moreover,during the entire interview process,defendants were awake,alert,and engaged.
of course,whether defendants actually understood their fifth amendment rights against remains a somewhat close question.defendants argue that their upbringing in a country that has become increasingly lawless in recent decades rendered them incapable of understanding the miranda rights recited 
nevertheless,it appears that the inquiry as to whether a defendant understood the recitation of the fifth amendment rights focuses not on the defendant understanding of the criminal justice system,the democratic form of government,the concept of individual rights,but rather on whether the defendant could,merely as a linguistic matter,comprehend the words spoken to him.
although defendants have asserted through counsel that they are illiterate,there is no evidence showing them to be of intelligence or to suffer from any mental disabilities.accordingly,although defendants may have a hard time understanding the notion of individual rights such as those guaranteed by the fifth amendment,that does not mean that they could not have or did not understand their options upon special agent knox recitation of the miranda warnings and the cleansing statement.even assuming that defendants may not have grasped the nature and processes of the united states judicial system which would admittedly appear to be a rather fair assumption in this case,based on the limited record before the court they nevertheless must have understood,from the translated words uttered by special agent knox alone,that they did not have to speak with him,and that they could request counsel.needless to say,despite current conditions in somalia,the concept of an attorney is not a foreign one there.
hasan iii,d at citations omitted.premised on that analysis,the court concluded that each of the defendants knowingly and intelligently waived his fifth amendment rights against.id.at 
on appeal,the defendants contend that the district court erred in finding that special agent knox warnings adequately advised them of their fifth amendment rights in accordance with miranda.more specifically,they assert that the court could not determine the exact content of the warnings based on knox testimony.the defendants further posit that the warnings were constitutionally deficient because knox did not convey to them that they had a right to a lawyer rather he stated that if they wanted a lawyer,we would give them one.even if the warnings comported with the miranda requirements,however,the defendants insist that the district court was wrong in concluding that they could have knowingly and intelligently waived their rights 
in assessing the district court denial of the defendants suppression motions,we review the court factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.see united states holmes,cir.and we are obliged to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,as the prevailing party below.see united states montieth,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we perceive no clear error in the district court findings concerning the content of the miranda warnings,in that the court reasonably accepted the testimony of special agent knox.although the court acknowledged that there were slight variations in the recollections of the various witnesses,it deemed the testimony offered by the government to be substantially consistent and credible.hasan iii,d at.as we have emphasized,w hen findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses,we give even greater deference to the trial court findings.united states hall,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we are further satisfied that the district court committed no legal error in concluding that special agent knox warnings sufficiently advised the defendants of their right to counsel.again,the court found that knox advised the defendants that if they wanted a lawyer,we would give them one.hasan iii,d at quoting.to be sure,there is,as the defendants point out,an obvious distinction between wanting a lawyer and having a right to a lawyer.but knox did not ask the defendants simply do you want a lawyer rather,he declared that if they wanted a lawyer,we would give them one.emphasis added.knox unqualified offer to give the defendants a lawyer upon their request conveyed to the defendants that they had an entitlement a right to a lawyer.frankson,at given the common sense understanding that an unqualified statement lacks qualifications,all that police officers need do is convey the general rights enumerated in miranda.
put succinctly,special agent knox was not obligated to actually verbalize the phrase right to a lawyer when his warning effectively convey ed the same meaning.see united states sanchez,cir concluding that defendants were adequately advised of right to counsel with warnings that they need make no statements without the presence of an attorney and if you could afford an attorney,an attorney will be provided for you.indeed,no precise formulation of the warnings or talismanic incantation is required to satisfy miranda strictures.california prysock.the relevant inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably convey to a suspect his rights as required by miranda.florida powell,alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with the district court that knox warnings did just that.
the defendants persist that their statements should have been suppressed regardless of the adequacy of the miranda warnings,because they could not have validly waived their fifth amendment rights against.that is,the defendants maintain that any waiver of their rights was not knowing and intelligent because of the language barrier,their unfamiliarity with the american legal system,the social and political conditions in their native somalia,and their illiteracy and overall lack of education.
for a waiver to be knowing and intelligent,it must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.moran burbine.as we have explained,t he determination of whether a waiver was knowing and intelligent requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,including the suspect intelligence and education,age and familiarity with the criminal justice system,and the proximity of the waiver to the giving of the miranda warnings.correll thompson,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court found that there was no evidence showing the defendants to be of intelligence or to suffer from any mental disabilities.hasan iii,d at.yet even i n cases involving defendants with low intellectual ability,the knowingness of the waiver often turns on whether the defendant expressed an inability to understand the rights as they were recited.united states robinson,f d,cir concluding that defendant below average does not make him per se incapable of intelligently waiving his rights.here,the court determined that the testimony is uniform in suggesting the defendants understanding of their fifth amendment rights.hasan iii,d at.that the defendants were speakers does not necessarily thwart an effective waiver of those rights,united states guay,cir,particularly since the court ascertained that special agent knox warnings were recited to the defendants,through ismail,the interpreter,in their native language.hasan iii,d at.
we think the district court made a fair assumption that the defendants may not have grasped the nature and processes of the united states judicial system.hasan iii,d at.nevertheless,there is no indication that the defendants did not understand the concept of an attorney,which,as the district court found,is not a foreign concept in somalia.id.moreover,it is not necessary that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege.colorado spring.rather,the main purpose of miranda is to ensure that an accused is advised of and understands the right to remain silent and the right to counsel.berghuis.at.based on the totality of the circumstances,we discern no error in the court conclusion that the defendants must have understood,from the translated words uttered by special agent knox alone,that they did not have to speak with him,and that they could request counsel.hasan iii,d at.we therefore affirm the court denial of the defendants suppression motions 
next,defendant hasan maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment charges against him pursuant to the juvenile delinquency act,the jda,on the ground that the government failed to establish that he was at least eighteen years of age at the time of his alleged offenses the court rejected hasan jda contention by the pretrial hasan iii opinion of october.see d at.
in doing so,the district court placed on the government the initial burden of proving hasan age,thereby requiring the government to offer prima facie evidence of his adult status.see hasan iii,d at quoting united states juvenile male,cir.the court recognized that a previous statement from hasan that he is an adult can constitute such prima facie evidence,and that,i f the government adequately presents such prima facie evidence,t he burden then shifts to the defense to come forward with evidence of hasan juvenile status.id.second alteration in original quoting juvenile male,at.in that circumstance,the government would then have an opportunity to rebut such evidence with any additional information available.id.alteration in original quoting juvenile male,at.
resolving conflicting testimony,the district court found that hasan told special agents knox and mordecai during the april,interview that he was or believed himself to be between and years old.hasan iii,d at.accordingly,the court concluded that the government satisfied its burden of making a prima facie showing of hasan adult status,and shifted the burden to hasan to produce credible evidence that he was,in fact,a minor,notwithstanding his statements to the contrary.id.explaining why hasan testimony at the evidentiary hearing simply did not meet that burden,the court observed 
the credibility of hasan testimony that he did not know the day or year of his birth but had been told by unnamed neighbors that he was eighteen years old was questionable,and he testified that he could produce no corroborating documentary evidence or testimony from others.although hasan lack of knowledge about his own birth date or birth year is rendered less surprising suspect by the testimony of interpreter ismail that most somalis do not know their exact birth date,but generally know their birth year,hasan testimony nevertheless contradicted itself as much as it did the testimony of special agents knox and mordecai.
id.at footnote omitted.in the end,the court found b ased on its observation of hasan during his testimony,as well as on the content of that testimony that hasan testimony that he is currently only years old was not credible and deserved little weight.id.at.
without contesting the district court use of the scheme to establish his age,hasan asserts on appeal that the court erroneously accepted the contradictory and vague testimony of special agents knox and mordecai in satisfaction of the government prima facie showing.see br.of appellants.we disagree.the court reasonably observed that,a lthough the agents notes and testimony varied slightly from each other,the variance was effectively explained and nowhere in their notes or testimony is there any suggestion whatsoever that hasan told them he was under the age of.hasan iii,d at.moreover,the court found knox and mordecai to be credible witnesses,and their testimony to be credible and substantially consistent in all material respects.id.given the highly deferential standard of review,we are not in a position to disturb the court credibility finding.see united states nicholson,cir.because hasan does not challenge the court ruling that his testimony failed to rebut the government prima facie evidence of his adult status,the conclusion that the protections of the jda did not apply and the denial of hasan motion to dismiss must be affirmed.
lastly,the defendants fault the district court for declining to merge,for sentencing purposes,their three convictions under.c counts ten through twelve into a single c offense.the defendants were convicted for their use of the two ak in counts ten and eleven under c a iii,which provides in pertinent part that any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,uses or carries a firearm shall if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.count twelve was aimed at the defendants use of the rpg and charged under c a and c b ii,mandating a sentence of not less than years for use of a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence.
significantly,the district court considered count twelve to be the first conviction under c,and counts ten and eleven to be second or subsequent c convictions,thus subjecting the defendants to minimum sentences on counts ten and eleven under c c i in the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection,the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.and,following the directive of c d ii,the court ordered consecutive sentences for the c convictions years months each on counts ten and eleven,plus thirty years months on count twelve.
notwithstanding the defendants contentions to the contrary,we conclude that the district court imposed proper sentences.our precedent dictates the conclusion that multiple,consecutive sentences under c are appropriate whenever there have been multiple,separate acts of firearm use or carriage,even when all of those acts relate to a single predicate offense.united states lighty,cir emphasis added citing united states camps,cir.moreover,as the district court observed in its hasan ii opinion,the attack on the uss nicholas actually involved eight distinct counts in the superseding indictment charging crimes of violence.hasan ii,slip op.at.that the defendants used their weapons contemporaneously during the same attack does not diminish the number of predicate offenses.see united states higgs,cir affirming three consecutive c sentences where uses related to a triple murder citing deal united states.thus,the separate uses of the firearms need not be tallied because there were multiple predicate crimes of violence.see united states khan,cir concluding that court was not required to count the uses of firearms where defendant four convictions constitute separate predicate offenses,such that each may support a consecutive c sentence.
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the convictions and sentences of each of the defendants.
