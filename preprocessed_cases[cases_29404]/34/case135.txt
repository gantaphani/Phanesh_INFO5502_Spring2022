in a to this case,a felon and his confederates attended a backyard barbecue at which firearms were openly displayed.they subsequently reconvened at the scene of a planned robbery.although the robbery was never consummated,the police arrested the convicted felon,kareem williams,on firearms charges.during his ensuing trial,the district court admitted evidence of his statements to the police about events occurring at the cookout.the jury convicted,and the defendant now challenges both the sufficiency of the government proof and the admissibility of the statements.we affirm.
we start with the travel of the case.a federal grand jury indicted the defendant on charges of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon count and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number count.see g,k.at the close of all the evidence,the defendant moved unsuccessfully for judgment of acquittal.see.the jury found the defendant guilty,and the court sentenced him,as an armed career criminal,to a year prison term.see e.this timely appeal ensued.
the defendant principal claim of error is that the district court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence did not allow a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly possessed the guns charged in the indictment.in determining whether the evidence suffices to sustain a conviction,we draw the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most agreeable to the jury verdict.see united states walker,cir united states troy,cir.to uphold a conviction,the court need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached,but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.united states echeverri,cir quoting united states ortiz,cir.this is the same indulgent standard that the district court was duty bound to employ in passing upon the defendant rule motion,and we review the district court denial of that motion de novo.see united states dwinells,cir.
the evidence,scrutinized favorably to the verdict,reveals the following.at on june,a police officer,daniel dempsey,responded to a dispatch call about suspicious activity on paine avenue,cranston,rhode island.when dempsey arrived at the scene,he saw two stopped vehicles an acura in front and a nissan maxima behind.dempsey drove toward the acura until he was with it.using the spotlight on his cruiser,dempsey saw four men inside the acura.he stepped into the street and ordered the driver of the acura to shut off the engine.instead of heeding this command,the driver began traveling in reverse.so did the driver of the maxima.
the acura spun around and sped away,and the maxima continued traveling backwards.dempsey returned to his vehicle,pursued the maxima,and ultimately collided with it.
dempsey stepped out into the street and drew his weapon,ordering the occupants of the maxima to raise their hands.the driver indya rivers and the passenger helluva brown complied immediately.the defendant,who was sitting in the back seat,did not comply dempsey observed him moving around towards the center area of the seat.dempsey could see the back of the defendant right shoulder but could not see what he was doing with his hands.it was only after dempsey reiterated his command several times that the defendant finally raised his hands.
once arrived,dempsey ordered rivers,brown,and the defendant out of the maxima.the defendant initially failed to comply and exited the vehicle only after dempsey repeated his command.
officer james mcquinn searched the maxima.he noticed that the armrest in the center of the back seat was ajar and was sticking out.it was flush with the back seat.mcquinn pulled the armrest all the way down,exposing a that is,an opening that led to the trunk of the car.inside the trunk a few inches away from the were two fully loaded guns a revolver with black tape wrapped around the handle and a caliber pistol with an obliterated serial number.
the defendant was taken to cranston police headquarters and,later that same day,two detectives interrogated him.the defendant waived his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,and agreed to speak with them.
during this recorded interview,the defendant disclosed that he and the other occupants of the two cars had been planning to rob a marijuana trafficker he knew that guns would be involved in the heist and stated that they had been placed in the maxima before he entered the car.he later changed his tune and said that he thought that the guns were in the acura.
the defendant further explained that he and his confederates had attended a family cookout shortly before sojourning to paine avenue.the cookout took place on the evening of june,and dempsey encountered the maxima and the acura shortly after midnight on june.
the defendant stated that the pistol belonged to alexander collins one of the occupants of the acura and that he had seen it tucked into collins waistband at the cookout.the defendant accurately described the revolver as the one with tape on it,even though the police had made no mention of the presence of tape.he claimed that this firearm,too,belonged to an occupant of the acura.
the defendant went on to say that,at the cookout,he noticed collins passing the revolver to a family member who just got out of prison on a gun charge.the defendant says that he took the revolver from this person and hid it behind a little rock.
against this evidentiary backdrop,we turn to the defendant principal plaint.to support a conviction under g,the offense charged in count,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a convicted felon who knowingly possessed a firearm in circumstances that implicated interstate commerce.see united states staula,cir.to support a conviction under.k,the offense charged in count,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce and had the importer or manufacturer serial number removed,obliterated,or altered.see united states betancourt,cir.
the defendant concedes that he has at least one prior felony conviction,that both the revolver and the pistol traveled in interstate commerce,and that the latter had an obliterated serial number.as to both counts,then,his sufficiency challenge focuses with intensity on whether the government proof was sufficient to establish the common element of knowing possession.
knowing possession of a firearm may be proved through either actual or constructive possession.see united states liranzo,cir.actual possession is the state of immediate,physical possession.united states zavala maldonado,cir.constructive possession occurs when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object,either directly or through others.united states ocampo guarin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
where,as here,the evidence is largely circumstantial,the relevant inquiry asks whether the evidence as a whole,along with plausible inferences favorable to the government,warrants a rational jury in concluding that the government has proved the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states tierney,cir dirring united states,cir.in conducting this inquiry,we are not required to examine each sliver of evidence in splendid isolation.rather,we must appraise the totality of the evidence,mindful that individual pieces of evidence,insufficient in themselves to prove a point,may in cumulation prove it.bourjaily united states,d.this approach recognizes the verity that t he sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.id.at ortiz,at.
viewed through this prism,the defendant argument withers.drawing plausible inferences,a rational jury could find as this jury did that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed both firearms.the jurors heard testimony that the guns were stored in the trunk of the maxima near the opening of a that connected the trunk with the center of the back seat.this was in close proximity to the defendant and within easy reach of where he had been moving around.the defendant ignored dempsey repeated orders to come out of the car,instead moving toward the armrest.he initially refused to raise his hands,keeping them out of dempsey line of vision.this was especially significant because the police later discovered that the armrest,which normally covered the,was ajar.moreover,the defendant had planned to take part in a robbery and knew that guns would be involved indeed,he had handled the revolver only hours before his apprehension.last but far from least the defendant admitted to the police that he knew the guns were in the maxima the totality of this evidence easily supports an inference that the defendant was in constructive possession of the guns.
to say more about this claim of error would be supererogatory.jurors have the right indeed,the obligation to use their common sense in evaluating and drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence.viewing the record as a whole and using their common sense,the jurors in this case rationally could have inferred that when dempsey stopped the maxima the defendant had knowing and intentional dominion and control over the firearms and,thus,constructively possessed them.see,united states robinson,cir finding evidence of constructive possession sufficient where defendant had access and opportunity to store guns in engine compartment liranzo,at holding evidence sufficient to establish constructive possession of gun by passenger where gun was found beneath seat see also united states chapdelaine,cir.it follows inexorably that the district court did not err in denying the defendant rule motion for judgment of acquittal.
the defendant remaining claims of error relate to the admission of evidence.when objections have been preserved,we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.walker,at united states rodríguez vélez,cir.
the defendant insists that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of his statements about the robbery scheme and his handling of the revolver at the cookout.in the defendant view,this evidence was both irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.we deal sequentially with these preserved objections.
evidence is relevant if a it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and b the fact is of consequence in determining the action.trial courts are afforded wide latitude in determining whether evidence crosses this low threshold,and we will not disturb an exercise of that discretion unless an abuse looms.united states saccoccia,cir.
in the case at hand,the district court did not abuse its discretion in deeming the defendant statements relevant to the issue of whether he knowingly possessed the guns found in the maxima.these statements had a discernable tendency to make clear the chain of events and to shed light upon the defendant knowledge of the guns and his motive and opportunity to possess them because the case turned on the issue of knowing possession,their relevance is apparent.see,united states gonzález,cir united states ladd,cir.
the defendant second objection implicates federal rule of evidence.rule provides that t he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue delay,wasting time,or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.the delicate balance between probative value and prejudicial effect is and,within broad limits,is best struck by the trial court.walker,at.only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states pires,cir quoting freeman package mach,cir.
in this instance,the probative force of the challenged evidence is manifest.to be sure,that evidence was,as the defendant laments,inimical to his cause.but the defendant has not shown that any unfair prejudice outweighed its probative value.most evidence is is why one side or the other seeks to introduce it and the mere fact that evidence hurts a party case does not make its admission problematic.it is only unfair prejudice that weighs in the rule balance,see united states raymond,cir united states rodríguez estrada,cir,and we see no unfair prejudice here.
we note,moreover,that the district court gave a limiting instruction specifically designed to minimize any risk of unfair prejudice 
now,you heard evidence that at a cookout on the evening before the date charged in the indictment the defendant previously possessed the firearm,the caliber with the tape on it.the indictment does not charge the defendant with possessing a firearm at that cookout,but rather charges him with possessing at least one firearm at the time of the automobile stop by the cranston police.
you may not use this evidence to infer that because of his character the defendant carried out the acts charged in this case.you may consider this evidence only for limited purposes,and those are as follows the limited purpose of deciding,one,whether the defendant had a state of mind or intent necessary to commit the crime that is charged in the indictment or two,whether the defendant had a motive or opportunity to commit the acts charged in the indictment or three,whether the defendant acted in accordance or according to a plan or in preparation for the commission of a crime or four,whether the defendant committed the acts that he is on trial for by accident or by mistake.so remember,these are the only purposes for which you may consider evidence of the defendant prior similar acts.even if you find the defendant may have committed a similar act in the past,this is not to be considered as evidence of character to support an inference that the defendant committed the acts charged in the indictment.
before us,the defendant suggests that this limiting instruction was not adequate to address the risk of unfair prejudice.
there is,however,a conspicuously large fly in the ointment the defendant neither asked for any limiting instruction nor objected at trial to the one given by the district court.when a defendant does not interpose a contemporaneous objection to a limiting instruction,we will review an afterthought complaint about the instruction only for plain error.see united states gómez,cir united states paniagua ramos,cir.
plain error review is rarely.to establish plain error,an appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.this is a daunting standard and,not surprisingly,i t is the rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made in the trial court.see henderson kibbe,d.
the defendant in this case does not come close to making the requisite showing.while the instruction may not have been ideal,it did make clear that the jury could not use the defendant earlier handling of a firearm as a proxy for the elements of the charged crimes.we discern no plain error.
in an effort to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat,the defendant notes that the district court limiting instruction drew heavily on federal rule of evidence b.he asserts that application of the rule b criteria employed in the limiting instruction to the gun statement demonstrates that this statement has no special relevance independent of its tendency to show criminal propensity.we do not agree.
the defendant statements regarding his prior handling of the revolver were introduced as circumstantial evidence of at least one of the charged crimes knowing possession of the revolver.as we already have explained,this evidence was relevant to establish the defendant knowledge of the revolver and his motive and opportunity to possess it.under the circumstances,the district court use of the rule b framework in its limiting instruction was an a
