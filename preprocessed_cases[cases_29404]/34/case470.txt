on june,a jury found rashaun smoke jones guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine base.before trial the district court,on recommendation of the magistrate judge,denied jones motion to suppress certain evidence seized from his hotel suite.jones claims error in this denial.on october,the sentencing court sentenced jones to months imprisonment.jones argues that the sentencing court erred in calculating the drug quantity that went into his guidelines sentence calculation,and in finding him eligible for a upward adjustment to his base offense level for his role as an organizer or manager of other criminal actors.upon thorough examination of the record and the parties arguments,we affirm jones conviction and sentence.
background 
on december,john of the scarborough,maine,police department learned from the manager of the towneplace suites hotel that an individual named rashaun jones had checked into room room was a suite with two bedrooms,a living room,a kitchenette,and a bathroom.after running a database check on jones,discovered that there was a warrant out for his arrest on drug charges,and that the marshals service usms was responsible for the warrant.the database indicated that jones should be considered armed and dangerous.
contacted the usms,which informed him that an arrest team would be assembled.also contacted drug enforcement administration dea agents steven thibodeau and paul wolf.agent wolf had been part of the investigation that led to jones arrest warrant,and he asked to meet him at the hotel.wolf and obtained passkeys to rooms and.positioned himself in room,while wolf waited in his car in a nearby parking lot for the team of marshals and dea agents to arrive.had a view of room door through the peephole in the door of room.
at a certain point,observed a man and a woman leave room and drive away in a car.radioed agent wolf,who followed the car and observed it circle around a parking lot,without stopping,before returning to the hotel.saw the man emerge from the car and reenter room shortly thereafter,he heard an exuberant male voice through the wall,counting from one to eight.agent wolf and concluded that a drug transaction had likely taken place during the short car ride.
agent wolf then joined in room.again observed a man and woman exit the room and drive away in a car.officers stopped the car in a nearby parking lot and questioned its occupants.the man said he had been sent on a short trip to the supermarket to buy cigarettes he admitted that jones was indeed one of the persons in room,and that jones and the other occupants were waiting for him to return.the man cell phone began to ring and rang every few minutes thereafter the officers did not allow the man to answer the cell phone.
in the meantime,several officers had assembled in a parking lot adjacent to the hotel.this group of officers included,among others,agents gregory boucher,stephen welsh,and greg bunch,and chief deputy marshal john cooper.concerned that the man failure to answer his cell phone or return to the hotel promptly would raise jones suspicions,agent wolf and marshal cooper decided to enter room.using the passkey provided by the hotel manager,a team opened room door without knocking,entered with weapons drawn,and shouted,police a number of additional officers followed closely behind.
the officers found four men inside and handcuffed them.several of the officers also saw marijuana in plain view on a living room table,and smelled marijuana smoke in the air.agent welsh detained and handcuffed a man sitting on the living room couch who identified himself as jones.jones was then placed into one of the bedrooms with agents boucher and bunch.boucher read jones his miranda rights from a standard dea rights card,pausing periodically to ask jones if he understood.jones responded in the affirmative.jones did not appear nervous or intoxicated.agent boucher asked jones if the officers could search the suite,but did not tell him he had the right to refuse consent jones responded that they could perform the search.
during this period,marshal cooper took one of the other individuals from the bathroom,where he had been temporarily detained on the floor,to the kitchenette.marshal cooper testified that,before placing the detainee in the kitchenette,he conducted what he termed a security sweep to make sure there were no weapons within the detainee reach.while looking inside a kitchen cabinet,marshal cooper discovered a rice box without a lid.he looked inside and saw what appeared to be packages containing drugs of some kind.marshal cooper also saw pills in a baggie on a shelf in the cabinet,but did not seize these or the drugs in the rice box.marshal cooper then decided it would not be a good idea to leave the detainee there,and instead seated him on the closed toilet lid in the bathroom.sometime later,agent welsh,who had left room briefly and taken one of the other detainees into room for questioning,returned to room and conducted a search of the kitchenette.agent welsh found and seized the rice box and the baggie the baggie contained ecstacy and the rice box contained heroin.
a grand jury indicted jones on one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing heroin,and a mixture or substance containing cocaine base,in violation of a and.jones moved to suppress the fruits of the search of room,claiming it was illegal because the officers entered the room without knocking and announcing their presence,because any consent to search given by him was not knowing and voluntary,and because marshal cooper search of the kitchen cabinet was not incident to a lawful arrest or part of a protective sweep.after a hearing at which several of the officers testified,the magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the motion to suppress be denied.he reasoned that exigent circumstances justified the entry into room jones freely and voluntarily consented to the search of room and marshal cooper discovery of the heroin and ecstacy occurred after jones had given his consent,and was lawful in any event as part of a protective sweep.over jones objection,the district court adopted the recommendation.jones again objected at trial when the items seized from room were introduced into evidence.
at trial,the government called a number of witnesses.according to the testimony presented,jones would acquire heroin,cocaine,and cocaine base crack from a supplier in new york.evidence was also presented showing that jones coordinated the distribution of these drugs to consumers in southern maine through a number of sellers,including most importantly nick foster and john thomas.on june,the jury convicted jones as charged in the indictment.
in the presentence report psr,the probation officer calculated jones guidelines sentencing range gsr to be to months.the psr took into account the quantum of different drugs seized during the search of room and from jones coconspirators and customers,and that which coconspirators admitted to having distributed on behalf of the conspiracy.ultimately,the psr attributed to jones grams of heroin,grams of crack cocaine,and grams of powder cocaine,for a total of kilograms of marijuana equivalent.this put jones base offense level at.see c.the psr also determined that jones had supervised two of the and accordingly recommended a upward adjustment.see id.c.over jones objection,the sentencing court adopted the psr recommendations after explaining its reasoning,the court sentenced jones at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range to months imprisonment.jones appealed.
ii.discussion 
a.the motion to suppress 
jones argues that the district court should have suppressed the fruits of the search of room,raising the same three challenges he raised before the magistrate judge.after noting the standard of review,we address these challenges in turn.
standard of review 
when considering challenges to a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we ordinarily review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.united states meada,cir.under clear error review,we may reverse only if the record,read as a whole,gives rise to a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.ex rel.five town cmty.sch,cir quoting lenn portland sch,cir.
renters of hotel rooms generally benefit from the same fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as they would if they were at home.see united states rengifo,cir citing stoner california,d while police acting pursuant to a warrant must ordinarily knock and announce their presence before entering a dwelling to which fourth amendment protections apply,see united states hawkins,cir,a entry will be deemed reasonable if the police have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence,under the particular circumstances,would be dangerous or futile,or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by,for example,allowing the destruction of evidence.united states boulanger,cir quoting richards wisconsin,d.
importantly,however,the supreme court has recently clarified that even if the police violate the fourth amendment by failing to knock and announce their presence in circumstances in which a entry is unwarranted,such violation,standing alone,will not compel the exclusion of evidence seized as a result of their entry into the dwelling.see hudson michigan,d.in the wake of hudson,we have recognized the absence of an exclusionary rule for violations,provided the police have a valid arrest warrant or some other valid grant of authority to enter the target residence,and reason to believe the target is inside.see united states pelletier,cir also noting that,g enerally speaking,this principle extends to the target hotel or motel room.
the district court decision denying jones motion to suppress,which predates both hudson and pelletier,addresses the merits of jones challenge to the entry,ultimately finding the entry justified because of the risk to the officers safety and that drug evidence might be destroyed.in light of hudson and pelletier,we need not go so far.the remedy jones seeks is the suppression of the fruits of the search of room.he does not challenge the validity of the arrest warrant against him,nor the officers professed belief that he was in room at the time.in any event,we find that such belief was objectively reasonable based on the following evidence credited by the district court the hotel manager told officers that jones had rented room for a period,and the man detained in the parking lot told officers that jones was then inside the suite.the arrest warrant and the reasonable belief jones was inside room gave the officers the authority to enter.see id.citing payton new york,d.even if they violated the fourth amendment by failing to knock and announce their presence before going in,the motion to suppress was not the appropriate vehicle for jones to obtain the remedy he seeks.see hudson,at.suggesting other avenues of relief.we thus proceed to jones next assignment of error.
the validity and scope of jones consent 
it is axiomatic that officers must ordinarily procure a warrant before searching a locale to which fourth amendment protections apply.see groh ramírez,d.several exceptions to this requirement exist,however,one of which is valid consent to search by someone having authority to give consent.see united states,cir.in order for consent to be valid,the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the consenting party gave it freely and voluntarily.united states marshall,cir.the assessment of whether consent is free and voluntary is a question of fact that requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the relevant transaction between authorities and the consenting party,at.the district court factual findings relating to the validity of the consent are reviewed for clear error.see marshall,at.
although the officers in this case had a valid warrant to arrest jones,they did not have a warrant to search room when they decided to enter the suite.the district court found the search of room constitutionally permissible nonetheless,because jones had given his consent freely and voluntarily.agent boucher testified that he advised jones of his miranda rights,and that jones acknowledged that he understood them.see united states kimball,cir giving of miranda rights a factor to consider in totality of circumstances.agent boucher also testified that jones did not appear to be intoxicated,that he seemed to understand what was going on,and that neither agent boucher nor any other officer extracted jones consent through threats or promises see,at threats,intimidation,and coercion are factors to consider in an analysis of the totality of the circumstances.the district court found this testimony to be a credible account of what actually happened.we see no reason to disagree.
jones argues,however,that three additional factors should lead us to overturn the district court finding that his consent was free and voluntary.first,he claims his consent could not have been free or voluntary because neither agent boucher nor any other officer advised him of his right not to cooperate.this argument is unavailing.we have repeatedly held that the failure to advise a defendant of his right to refuse consent does not automatically render such consent invalid.see id.at citing schneckloth bustamonte,d united states barnett,cir see also united states drayton,d no presumption of invalidity where person consents without explicit notification of right to refuse.in the relatively calm environment of the bedroom in which jones had been placed,agent boucher read jones his miranda rights,and jones acknowledged that he understood each of them,agreed to cooperate,and was not apparently under the influence.the district court did not clearly err in finding that jones appreciated the significance of giving consent despite the officers failure to advise him of his right to withhold such consent.
second,jones contends that,while none of the officers applied overt coercion on him to induce his consent,the circumstances should be regarded as inherently coercive some ten to fifteen government agents,guns drawn,entered his hotel suite without knocking,handcuffed him,placed him in a separate room,and proceeded to interrogate him.see barnett,at one factor to be considered in totality of circumstances is whether permission to search was obtained by coercive means or under inherently coercive circumstances.this argument also fails.as we have observed,a lthough sensitivity to the heightened possibility of coercion is appropriate when a defendant consent is obtained during custody,custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate coerced consent to search.id.citation omitted second and third alterations in original quoting united states watson,d.upon the officers entry,jones and his associates surrendered to them without a struggle and no shots were fired.jones was then handcuffed and made to sit on the edge of a bed.there is no indication in the record that jones was mistreated or placed in an uncomfortable position,or that agent boucher,agent bunch,or anyone else brandished a weapon,made threatening gestures,or spoke threatening words during the interrogation.considering the several countervailing factors outlined above,we find that the circumstances here were not so inherently coercive as to render jones consent unknowing or involuntary,even when considered together with the officers failure to advise jones of his right to refuse consent.
third,jones claims that any valid consent he may have given was confined to the bedroom in which he had been placed,and did not extend to the kitchenette or the other rooms of the hotel suite.a search justified by consent will be deemed reasonable as long as it does not exceed the scope of the consent given.see united states turner,cir.when determining the scope of consent,we apply a test of objective reasonableness w hat would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the subject united states meléndez,cir quoting florida jimeno,d.this inquiry requires an examination of the overall context,including contemporaneous police statements and actions.turner,at.as in past cases,we state no view on whether the scope of a given instance of consent is reviewed de novo or merely for clear error,as in the circumstances of the present case we would affirm under either standard.see marshall,at citing meléndez,at noting the split in our sister circuits on this question turner,at same.
agent boucher testified that he asked jones for consent to search the motel room.jones responded with a simple yes.as noted above,room was actually a suite with two bedrooms,a kitchenette,a living room,and a bathroom.although agent boucher did not specify which of these rooms he was seeking consent to search,jones did not expressly confine his consent to the bedroom.the district court found that agent boucher had made it reasonably clear that he sought consent to search the entire suite,not just the bedroom.jones,wl,at.we agree.an objective observer of the transaction between agent boucher and jones would have understood the term motel room to encompass the whole of room,and not just the bedroom.this is especially true considering that the officers had already viewed marijuana on the living room table,in close proximity to the couch on which jones was sitting when they entered,and smelled marijuana smoke in the air it is reasonable to expect that jones was aware that the officers noticed this evidence of recent drug use.in this context,a reasonable person in jones position would have regarded agent boucher as requesting consent to search the whole suite for additional drugs.
as such,the district court did not err in concluding that jones consent extended to the entire suite,and it was not unreasonable for agent boucher and the other officers to conduct a search of the other rooms for drugs,including the kitchen cabinet.meléndez,at dismantling and looking inside a speaker did not exceed the scope of consent to search a room,as t he speaker was located in the area that the consenting party had allowed the officers to search,and was a place in which the officers could have reasonably suspected drugs to be hidden.having dismissed jones challenge to his consent to search,we turn to his third and final assignment of error with respect to the denial of his suppression motion.
marshal cooper search of the kitchen cabinet 
jones argues that marshal cooper search of the kitchen cabinet,and consequent discovery of drugs therein,was not justified as a protective sweep or under any other exception to the warrant requirement.the district court examined the timeline as established through the testimony of the various officers at the suppression hearing,and found that the government had established by a preponderance of the evidence that marshal cooper actually discovered the drugs in the kitchen cabinet after jones had given his consent to agent boucher.we have reviewed the officers testimony and conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous we briefly explain.
agent welsh and marshal cooper each testified that when they entered room,they saw marijuana in plain view on the living room table.agent welsh testified that he immediately detained and handcuffed jones,who was sitting on the living room couch.jones was promptly taken into the bedroom,where agent boucher began the process of questioning him according to agent boucher,the point at which jones gave his consent was some ten to fifteen minutes after the officers initial entry into room.agent boucher then left the room and advised a couple of the agents that we in fact had consent from jones to search the motel room.agent wolf testified that he was one of those whom agent boucher informed.
according to marshal cooper,during this period the other officers detained jones associates and performed a quick scan of the suite to make sure there were no hidden persons.marshal cooper took responsibility for one of the detainees and initially had him handcuffed and lying on the bathroom floor.marshal cooper testified that,at this point,it occurred to him to announce to the other officers that he had seen marijuana on the living room table,in case they wanted to seek a search warrant.marshal cooper continued one of the officers told me at that point that it okay,they already had consent.sometime soon thereafter,when marshal cooper was satisfied that the suite had been secured,he attempted to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette,where he searched the cabinet and found what he believed to be drugs.the district court credited marshal cooper testimony and found that the search occurred after jones gave his consent 
we see nothing in the record that would lead us to quarrel with this finding,much less to reach a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made,as is required under the applicable standard of review.ex rel,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.because marshal cooper search of the kitchen cabinet occurred after jones gave consent affirmed scope of the consent extended to the kitchen cabinet,it was constitutionally valid.given this conclusion,we need not state a view on the district court alternative ruling that the search was lawful in any event by virtue of the independent source doctrine.
finding no infirmity in the denial of jones suppression motion,we proceed to examine the challenges relating to his sentence.
sentencing 
jones raises two challenges to his sentence.first,he contends that the sentencing court erred in its calculation of the quantity of drugs attributable to him,which accounted for a base offense level of.see c.second,he argues that the sentencing court erred in applying a further upward adjustment to his base offense level for his role as an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of other participants in the enterprise.see id.c.we again note the applicable standard of review,and then consider these two challenges seriatim.
standard of review 
a sentencing court findings of its calculation of drug reviewed for clear error questions of law involved in sentencing determinations are reviewed de novo.united states,cir united states laboy,cir.a question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and,therefore,engenders de novo review,at.
the calculation 
in determining drug quantity for purposes of calculating a defendant base offense level under the guidelines,the sentencing court may attribute to the defendant all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.cmt.ii.thus,a drug dealer who engages in criminal activity with others to further their collective interests may be held liable for the quantities of drugs sold by his partners,if those sales were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the jointly undertaken actions.laboy,at.if the quantity of drugs actually seized does not reflect the full scale of the offense,the sentencing court may make a reasonable estimate of the total quantity involved.see id.at citing cmt.the government must prove drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.we will uphold the sentencing court estimate as long as it is reasoned and finds support in the record.see id.at.
in adopting the psr recommendation,the sentencing court found jones responsible for kilograms of marijuana equivalent this figure included grams of powder cocaine kilograms of marijuana equivalent seized from room,and grams of crack cocaine kilograms of marijuana equivalent estimated from what coconspirator thomas told federal agents he had introduced into the southern maine market as part of the conspiracy 
the psr estimated the remaining amount as grams of heroin kilograms of marijuana equivalent.this quantity was based mainly on the trial testimony of foster that he received heroin from jones and thomas and distributed twenty bricks of heroin per week for twelve weeks from april to june,and sixty bricks per week for twelve additional weeks from july to september,until foster was arrested.a brick of heroin consists of fifty bags at grams each,for a total of grams distributed by foster.the psr then determined that jones continued in the conspiracy after the arrests of foster and thomas on september,until jones own arrest at the towneplace suites fourteen weeks later on december.the psr continued 
however,as there is no evidence of the quantities distributed during this time frame and the impact the arrest of jones sic had on his ability to continue to distribute large amounts bricks a week,the probation office has used the conservative amount of bricks a week.
twenty bricks per week for the fourteen weeks from september,to december,produced a total of grams.added to the estimate of the amount foster distributed for the conspiracy,the total came to grams of heroin,or kilograms of marijuana equivalent.
this amount added to the kilograms of marijuana equivalent in crack and powder cocaine produced a grand total of kilograms of marijuana equivalent.the sentencing court found the facts presented in the psr to be credible,and opined that in all likelihood the amounts were probably greater than that set forth in the psr and i find those quantities.in other words,the sentencing court found jones responsible for kilograms.
in challenging this finding,jones argues that the real weight attributable to him should be kilograms of marijuana equivalent he explained how he reached this figure in his brief and again at oral argument.jones also alleges that the grams the psr attributed to him for september to december is pure speculation.jones estimated result in a base offense level of.c.
yet even if we assume that jones has provided us and the sentencing court with a plausible estimate of the drug quantity attributable to him,he can not prevail.this is because we find the psr estimate also to be generally plausible and that it enjoys a preponderance of record support primarily in the trial testimony of foster.the sentencing court was therefore within its discretion when it chose the psr estimate over jones estimate.see united states marks,cir.
we say generally plausible because we do agree with jones in one respect.we are dissatisfied with the psr poorly reasoned conclusion that jones was responsible for grams of heroin kilograms of marijuana equivalent distributed between september and december,a finding for which the psr conceded there is no evidence but that the sentencing court nonetheless adopted.yet we need not decide whether such adoption was clearly erroneous,because any error that may have occurred was harmless.the threshold quantity that triggers a base offense level of which jones kilograms of marijuana equivalent.c.even if we subtracted from,the total found by the sentencing court,we would still be left with kilograms,and jones would receive the same base offense level.united states hernández,cir finding determination of drug quantity harmless,even if erroneous,as it did not affect defendant sentence.we move on to jones final assignment of error.
the c increase 
the guidelines provide for an upward adjustment to a defendant base offense level due to the relative importance of his role in the offense.united states cruz,cir en banc citing c.to qualify for a c upward adjustment,the evidence must show that the defendant exercised control over,organized,or was otherwise responsible for superintending the activities of at least one other participant in a criminal activity on at least one occasion.united states,cir quoting cruz,at accord united states voccola,cir single directed transaction is enough.while this showing is not a particularly onerous one to make,it is not enough that the defendant merely controlled,organized,or managed criminal activities,but must instead control,organize,or manage criminal actors,at.
after hearing the parties arguments,the sentencing court found that the government had satisfied the requirements of c by a preponderance of the evidence 
i taken into account the evidence in this case including the nature of this offense,the fact that jones was directing his runners,the fact that i believe he was given a greater share of the monies involved in this conspiracy,the fact that he was the key planner and organizer of the conspiracy,the others were basically runners for him,and his degree of control and authority and i think the two level enhancement is modest in this case based on my understanding of the evidence 
jones takes issue with this determination.he argues that,while he supplied his alleged accomplices with drugs to sell,there was no evidence presented at trial to show that he recruited any of them,that he collected a disproportionate share of the proceeds of the venture,or that he exercised any control or authority over the accomplices activities.instead,a drug supplier in new york oversaw the venture.
this argument is unavailing.there is an abundance of evidence in the in the trial testimony of foster and several federal support the sentencing court finding that jones coordinated the actions of a number of drug sellers including,most importantly,thomas and foster.jones essentially controlled the supply of the drugs to these persons,and determined to a considerable extent when and where they would make deliveries.this is more than sufficient to satisfy the government modest burden under c.in spite of jones assertions to the contrary,c does not require a showing that he recruited accomplices or received a disproportionate share of the proceeds.the sentencing court therefore committed no error in finding jones to be an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of at least one other criminal actor,and the enhancement was justified.jones sentence stands.
iii.conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm jones conviction and sentence.
we recite the facts relating to jones motion to suppress as found by the district court,consistent with record support.united states brown,cir see also united states jones,wl,magistrate judge recommended factual findings united states jones,wl,adopting magistrate judge recommendation.
the sentencing judge was not the same as the judge presiding over pretrial and trial proceedings.
we assume,as did the district court,that jones was entitled to the protections of the fourth amendment while in room.he had rented the suite,in his name,for a stay.moreover,the mere fact that the hotel manager gave the officers a keycard to enter room,thereby manifesting her consent for officers to enter the suite,did not divest jones of his reasonable expectation of privacy.see stoner,at.
agent wolf,who took over the questioning after agent boucher,also testified that jones was calm and did not seem to be under the influence of alcohol or give no weight to jones halfhearted intimation that he may have been under the influence of marijuana since the officers,upon entering room,discovered evidence of marijuana having recently been smoked by at least one of the suite several occupants.see united states luciano,cir.
with respect to the district court analysis of the timing of the consent,we apply the usual standard of review for factual findings in a decision denying a motion to is,clear error review.see marshall,at.
at a later point in marshal cooper testimony,the government asked again whether marshal cooper had learned of jones consent before attempting to relocate the detainee to the kitchenette.marshal cooper responded,i not sure,but immediately clarified that i would think it was after.the district court obviously credited this clarification.it did not clearly err in doing so.
as there are different controlled substances involved,the probation office converted each of the drugs into its marijuana equivalent,added the quantities,and looked up the total in the drug quantity table in c.see cmt.b.
thomas told agents that,on at least three occasions,he went to new jersey and brought back hundreds of vials of crack cocaine to maine.the psr estimated conservatively that thomas had made three trips and brought back vials per trip,at an average of grams of crack cocaine per vial,for a total of unknown reasons,the psr did not recommend that jones sentence reflect other drugs it determined had been seized from foster,thomas,customers including a confidential informant,and from room,as well as a quantity of heroin a customer named william zinn admitted
