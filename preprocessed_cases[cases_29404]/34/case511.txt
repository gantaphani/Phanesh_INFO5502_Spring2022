jose jimenez was convicted of misappropriating the identities of two people long dead.he raises two challenges,one relating to all the charges and the other only to the two counts of aggravated identity theft.first,jimenez argues that certain evidence admitted at trial should have been excluded for want of relevance or because it was unduly prejudicial.second,he claims that person in the statute defining aggravated identity theft refers only to the living.in the alternative,he argues that the statute is sufficiently ambiguous to require reversal under the rule of lenity.we affirm.
in january,jose jimenez was stopped pursuant to a warrant by springfield,massachusetts police.he identified himself as barry abraham and provided a driver license with that name on it.subsequent searches revealed many documents in the name barry abraham,including a united states passport and social security card,a tax return,a credit card statement,and bank records.mixed in with the correspondence addressed to barry abraham were verizon telephone bills addressed to david davison,although the real davison was long deceased.the searches also revealed the birth and death certificates of michael ian figueroa,who died in,and a document from certifying a change of name from michael ian figueroa to barry abraham.the death certificate of an unrelated jared figueroa was also found,as well as official responses to requests for his birth certificate.investigators discovered the high school and college transcripts of many other individuals as well as handwritten lists of names and biographical data,including the names and information of davison and jared figueroa.another page of handwritten notes concerned credit reporting agencies and the orange county,california clerk office,and on the reverse of this sheet were michael ian figueroa name and social security number.finally,a computer disk seized during one search contained electronic documents entitled the anarchist cookbook,ebay spy toolkit,and confidential info on anyone and credit.these electronic documents detailed how to establish a false identity,how to search the social security death database,and related topics.
jimenez was tried on nine counts relating to the acquisition and use of the identities of michael ian figueroa and david davison he moved in limine to exclude evidence that did not directly relate to the specific identities at issue,including the high school transcripts,the lists of other names with biographical data,and the electronic documents.he claimed both that the evidence was not relevant and that prejudicial impact upon the jury outweighed any probative value.the district court admitted the evidence but restricted the use of the anarchist cookbook,preventing use of the title of the document and allowing use only of the section entitled how to create a new identity.jimenez was convicted by the jury on all nine counts.
ii.the motion in limine 
jimenez makes three arguments relating to the following five kinds of evidence i documents on the computer disk ii handwritten lists of others biographical data names,social security numbers,dates and places of birth and death iii high school and college transcripts iv the death certificate,and denials of requests for the birth certificate,of jared figueroa and v the handwritten sheet with information about the orange county clerk office and various credit reporting agencies.first,he contends that such evidence should have been excluded because it is irrelevant.second,he claims that even if relevant,the evidence should have been excluded because it is mere character evidence with no special probative value.last,he claims that the evidence,even if otherwise admissible,should have been excluded because it is too prejudicial.we disagree.
we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.united states turner,cir united states,cir.the district court made no written resolution of the motion in limine,and at trial the treatment of the objection was cursory.but defense counsel did raise the objection and therefore is not relying solely on the motion in limine.see united states griffin,cir t o raise and preserve for review the claim of improperly constructing the rule balance,a party must obtain the order admitting or excluding the controversial evidence in the actual setting of the trial.
jimenez first challenges the admission of the evidence on the ground that it is not relevant.evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.we reject jimenez argument that none of this evidence relates to any element of any of the charges brought.
in our view,the evidence supports the government claim that jimenez was engaged in an effort to misappropriate identities,and that the specific acts he is charged with were the culmination of that effort.the electronic documents show how he learned how to commit the offenses.the fact,adduced at trial,that jimenez modus operandi very closely mirrored that set forth in how to create a new identity is directly relevant to this theory.the handwritten lists of biographical information likewise present evidence of a person in the process of committing identity theft.the piles of high school and college transcripts,the information and documents concerning jared figueroa,and the information about credit reporting agencies and the orange county clerk office all flesh out the jury sense of the crime,not just the man.they therefore meet the initial threshold of relevance under rule.
jimenez also argues that,even if relevant,the evidence is inadmissible under rule.that rule excludes evidence of prior bad acts when it is offered merely to prove the defendant character such evidence is admissible,however,to show preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.b.we have interpreted rule b to require some special relevance,that is,a purpose other than solely to prove that the defendant had a propensity to commit the crime in question.united states,cir.with this as our guide we examine the evidence for at least one permissible inference.united states nickens,cir quoting united states,cir.the showing of special relevance is not particularly demanding.in another identity theft case,we held there was no abuse of discretion in admitting evidence that the defendant was a resident in a federal halfway house and therefore necessarily a former inmate of a federal prison,because the halfway house was convenient to the atms used in the scheme,and this had special relevance to the defendant opportunity to commit the crime.united states scott,cir.
here,the evidence shows preparation and plan the handwritten lists demonstrate preparation for the act of misusing the social security number of the late davison in order to obtain telephone service.likewise,the handwritten information regarding the orange county clerk office tends to prove or disprove specific steps jimenez took to obtain information about david davison,whose death certificate was processed in orange county.before using another social security number,of course,one must obtain it the jury might reasonably think these were illustrative of research and preparation.the computer documents explain how to establish a new identity,likewise demonstrating jimenez planning and preparing to misuse identities.the documents regarding jared figueroa vital statistics show the jury how jimenez went about creating the false identities he was charged with misusing jared figueroa information also appears on the handwritten lists,strengthening the inference that all of this was part of jimenez planning and preparation.thus,even taking the evidence as extrinsic to the offenses charged,we hold it was not an abuse of discretion to admit it under rule b.
the government argues in this appeal that the handwritten lists and the computer documents were intrinsic to the offense,part and parcel of the crimes charged,or else tools of the trade of identity thieves.because we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion even if it admitted this as extrinsic evidence under rule b,we need not,and do not,decide this issue.
finally,jimenez claims that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence because the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any probative value.see.e vidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.we have long noted that all relevant evidence is in some sense prejudicial because it leads the jury to find a material fact more or less likely.see united states,cir virtually all evidence is prejudicial but it is only unfair prejudice against which the law protects.quoting united states pitrone,cir.for that reason the rule analysis is confined to unfair prejudice,and the scales do not tip in favor of exclusion unless the probative value is substantially outweighed.
evidence of past crimes or other bad acts carries an especially strong risk of unfair prejudice,but here the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence while the evidence complained of might lead a jury to believe that jimenez was embarked on a systematic program to identify and exploit the identities of others,this is not unfair prejudice.indeed,this evidence engages the critical faculties of the than circumventing focusing attention on the way such crimes are committed and by showing the government theory of how jimenez approached such a task.moreover,we are particularly reluctant to overturn a trial judge rule determination.see united states flemmi,cir o nly in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.internal quotation and citation omitted.here the district court had the benefit of both reflection and immediate response it not only weighed the motion in limine in the abstract before trial,but also made the final determination in the midst of trial with all the benefit of immediate experience of the trial as it unfolded.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence,even when it is considered as extrinsic to the crimes charged.
iii.aggravated identity theft 
jimenez argues that he can not be guilty of the two counts of aggravated identity theft because the word person in the definition of that offense excludes the deceased the district court issued a memorandum and order denying a motion to dismiss on this ground.the issue was preserved in an objection to the jury instruction that explicitly defined person as living or deceased,as well as in a motion for a directed verdict.we review matters of statutory interpretation de novo.turner,at united states frechette,cir.
when interpreting a statute,we begin with its text.united states brown,cir citing richardson united states,d plumley container,cir.here,we first consider the single word jimenez questions.certain definitions of person do include only living persons.see american heritage dictionary ed giving,as primary definition of person,a living human oxford english dictionary ed person in the sense of the physical body of a living human being.but others make no mention of the distinction.see,collegiate dictionary ed primary definition human,individual webster new third international unabridged primary definition an individual human being.indeed,the word meaning largely depends on as distinguished from animal,person as distinguished from mind or soul,person as distinguished from corpse.some legal definitions of person include corporations and similar business entities.see.as often happens under close scrutiny,the plain text is not so plain.united states councilman,cir en banc.the word person in isolation admits of more than one meaning.
when the plain meaning of a word is not clear,we consider surrounding language and the statute structure.aggravated identity theft has two variations,defined in consecutive sections.a.the first ensnared jimenez and is set forth above.the second relates specifically to terrorism and applies to those who possess,or use without lawful authority a means of identification of another person or a false identification document during or in relation to the commission of one of the offenses enumerated in the definition of federal crime of terrorism.a citing g b.the phrase means of identification of another person is identical in subsections a and a,strongly intimating that it has the same meaning in both.see comm r lundy,d close proximity of two statutory provisions strengthen s the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning internal quotation omitted 
section a refers to means of identification or a false identification document.means of identification includes any name or number that may be used to identify a specific individual.d.false identification document comprises any false or falsified document of a type intended or commonly accepted for the purposes of identification.d emphasis added.the meaning of person urged would not punish those using social security numbers identifying the dead unless the defendant happened to possess the social security card or another identification document.to avoid this nonsensical result,person in subsection a must refer to persons both living and dead.and person in subsection a most likely has the same meaning as in a.the structure of the statute resolves any initial ambiguity in the word person we agree with the district court that the broader definition is the correct one 
the apparent purpose of the statute confirms this interpretation.a false identity built on the bedrock foundation of real means of is to say,actual social security numbers,real names and dates of better cover for the wrongdoer than would one based on wholly fabricated identities,regardless of whether the person whose means of identification is used is alive from a deterrence perspective,a stiffer penalty is logically called for when the risk of detection decreases.but a more commonsense analysis is just as persuasive.the statute punishes two kinds of behavior first,the use of false identities that are less susceptible of detection in a broad class of felonies and second,the use of any false identity document in the commission of a offense.the use of any identity other than one own in a terrorism offense merits punishment.but the use of the means of identification of another real person also qualifies for harsher punishment because this kind of identity theft is particularly potent and therefore a particular threat.because the structure and purpose of the statute dispel any lingering ambiguity in the plain language,we decline to consider legislative intent.
nor does the rule of lenity avail jimenez.the rule of lenity requires that ambiguity in a criminal statute be resolved in favor of the accused.cleveland united states,d a mbiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.hughey united states,d l ongstanding principles of lenity demand resolution of ambiguities in criminal statutes in favor of the defendant.but genuine ambiguity requires more than a possible alternative construction.see caron united states,d the rule of lenity is not invoked by a grammatical possibility.it does not apply if the ambiguous reading relied on is an implausible reading of the congressional purpose.muscarello united states,d moskal united states,d w e have always reserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute intended scope even after resort to the language and structure,legislative history and motivating policies of the statute.internal quotation omitted mcelroy united states,d declining to apply rule of lenity absent significant questions of ambiguity.we recently wrote that the rule only applies if there is a grievous ambiguity in the statute.councilman,at quoting muscarello,at.internal quotation marks omitted.a brief review of two cases where we invoked the rule of lenity will illuminate the nature and scope of the ambiguity required
