on august,after a bench trial before judge kimba wood of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,defendant fadi alameh was convicted of one count of unlawful procurement of naturalization in violation of b.on appeal,the defendant challenges this conviction on multiple grounds,claiming that the statute of limitations had expired by the time the indictment was filed,that the district court erred a by not permitting discovery to establish whether the government was selectively prosecuting the defendant based upon his arab ethnicity and b in concluding that the government did not selectively prosecute the defendant based upon his arab ethnicity,that there was insufficient evidence at trial to establish that the defendant knowingly violated the statute,that the district court erred by not making sufficient findings of fact as required by rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,that the indictment should be dismissed because of delay,that the statute under which the defendant was convicted was unconstitutionally vague,and that the district court erred in permitting the testimony of an alleged.we affirm the judgment below.
background 
defendant came to the united states from lebanon in on a student visa,and was denied reinstatement of student status in.the ins issued an order to show cause why he should not be deported,and shortly thereafter alameh married ana margarita aviles,an american citizen.in december,alameh applied for status as a lawful permanent resident lpr based on his marriage to aviles,and in march that status was granted.
in september,alameh filed a petition for naturalization claiming that he had been married to a citizen for three or more years.he abandoned this petition after an ins interview in which he was instructed to return with evidence of marital union.alameh and aviles divorced in august.in february,alameh filed another application for citizenship,this time relying on the fact that he had held a green card for five years or more.he was granted a certificate of naturalization on november.
in february,the attorney office for the southern district of new york opened an investigation of alameh.on,alameh was indicted on one count of violating b,by allegedly obtaining citizenship on the basis of fraud.a bench trial was conducted at which alameh former wife,aviles,testified that she was paid approximately to marry alameh,that she married him the day she met him,that two other couples also entered into green card marriages on that day,that she only saw alameh a few times after their marriage,and that she never lived at the address listed on their marriage certificate.alameh was found guilty and sentenced to two years of probation,with one month of that to be served in a community confinement center.the district court also issued an order revoking alameh citizenship,as required under e f,but stayed that order pending this appeal.
ii.discussion 
statute of limitations 
the defendant was indicted under b,which has a ten year statute of limitations.alameh does not dispute that he was indicted within that ten year period.instead,he argues that the prosecution is because it depends upon a finding that he had illegally obtained lpr status in violation of a,which has a statute of limitations.the defendant claim has no merit.defendant is not being prosecuted for violating a,but for violating b.section b applies to persons not entitled to citizenship or naturalization who knowingly procure or obtain or appl y for citizenship.b.the reason that the accused is not entitled is irrelevant to the statute requirements and to its limitations period.accordingly,the fact that alameh lack of entitlement is based upon a fraudulent application for lpr status for which the statute of limitations has run does not matter.the district court correctly denied defendant statute of limitations claim.
selective prosecution 
alameh alleges that the decision to prosecute him was based upon his arab and muslim identity.he sought discovery to support this claim and offered two kinds of evidence in support of his motion.first,he provided affidavits from immigration attorneys declaring that the kind of prosecution brought against him was unprecedented,and that prosecutions of immigrants from the middle east have dramatically increased in the past few years,most notably after september.second,he offered statistical evidence derived from a search conducted through courtlink a subsidiary of lexisnexis identifying all individuals charged in the southern and eastern districts of new york under and two similar marriage and immigration statutes the defense obtained a list of more than names,and classified the accused according to whether it thought they did or did not have arab or muslim sounding surnames.if one credits the reliability of this dubious method,the results appear striking before september,fifteen percent of all such charges were brought against individuals with arab or muslim surnames,and percent were brought against individuals.after september,these proportions were inverted percent of charges were brought against individuals with muslim or arab surnames,and only fifteen percent against individuals.the district court,however,noted that the case against alameh was strong and very far along as of september,and concluded that the proffered evidence was insufficient to support discovery.
we review the district court factual findings regarding denial of discovery for clear error,and its legal conclusions de novo.united states koh,cir.as we have noted,the decision as to whether to prosecute generally rests within the broad discretion of the prosecutor.united states white,cir.this broad discretion is proper because the decision to prosecute is particularly to judicial review.wayte united states,d.of course,this discretion can not be exercised in fashion,and it is properly subject to constitutional constraints.united states batchelder,d.the equal protection component of the fifth amendment is one of the most important of these constraints,and thus the decision whether to prosecute may not be based on an unjustifiable standard such as race,religion,or other arbitrary classification.united states armstrong,d internal quotation marks omitted.
to make out a claim of selective prosecution,a defendant confronts a deliberately rigorous standard,id.at.he must provide clear evidence that the prosecutorial decision or policy in question had both a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.id.at.the discriminatory effect prong requires a showing that similarly situated individuals of a different classification were not prosecuted.id.a defendant seeking to show discriminatory purpose must show that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.wayte,at.quoting personnel adm r of massachusetts feeney,d.such purpose may,however,be demonstrated through circumstantial or statistical evidence.see arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.gomillion lightfoot,d yick wo hopkins.there is nothing unusual in this,for federal law does not generally distinguish between direct and circumstantial evidence,and permits a requires proof beyond a reasonable be based entirely on circumstantial evidence.see,desert palace,costa,d.
the standard for discovery is correspondingly rigorous,armstrong,at,but of course not identical to the standard applied to the merits.rather than clear evidence of discriminatory effect and motive as required for the merits,to obtain discovery defendants need only produce some evidence of discriminatory effect and intent.see united states bass,d.in armstrong,the supreme court held that to show discriminatory effect a defendant seeking discovery must adduce some evidence that similarly situated defendants of other races could have been prosecuted,but were not.at.the court did not decide the question of what showing of
