appellant kevin hickman was charged in two of the counts in a superseding indictment,namely conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin count i and possession of heroin with intent to distribute count vi,in violation of and a.alone among the eight defendants,hickman proceeded to trial.the jury convicted hickman on both counts and,pursuant to the government notice of enhanced punishment,the district court imposed a mandatory life sentence on the conspiracy count and a concurrent sentence of months of imprisonment on the possession with intent to distribute count.in this timely appeal,hickman principally contends that the government failed to offer sufficient evidence to support his conspiracy conviction and therefore the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on that count.he also assigns error with respect to the district court jury instructions its handling of jury questions and its use of a prior conviction in calculating hickman sentence.
we readily conclude that the evidence of hickman knowing participation in a conspiracy to distribute large amounts of heroin was overwhelming.nevertheless,for the reasons stated within,we further conclude that the district court erred,in part,when it denied hickman motion for judgment of acquittal as to the conspiracy charged in the indictment.the government strained attempt,through extrapolations testified to by a drug enforcement agent,to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the charged conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of heroin relies on impermissible speculation and can not be sustained.nevertheless,we hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove the lesser included offense of conspiracy to distribute grams or more of heroin.accordingly,we vacate hickman conspiracy conviction and remand with directions that the district court impose judgment on the lesser included offense.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the evidence offered by the government in this prosecution resulted from the confluence of two distinct investigations by federal and local law enforcement agencies into heroin distribution activities in baltimore.in the course of the federal component of the investigation,agents of the drug enforcement administration obtained wiretaps on the phones of hickman james jones also known as fat cat and james henderson,among others,and instituted surveillance of an store known as fat cat variety store,run by jones.
the wiretaps intercepted calls between tony caldwell who was also a and jones on april,in which caldwell informed jones he had found a buyer for him,whom he called hookie hickman.agents then set up surveillance at fat cat variety store.special agent bennet strickland observed hickman car arrive at fat cat variety store,and the wiretap confirmed that hickman and henderson spoke by phone only minutes before.
a few minutes after hickman arrival,jones called caldwell to ask if the person named kevin at his store was,in fact,hookie,and was told that he was.jones also told caldwell that he had five more grams of heroin than hickman could pay for,and asked whether he should give hickman the extra five caldwell instructed him to deliver only what he was supposed to get.shortly afterward,caldwell asked jones,you all know each other and jones confirmed,yeah,yeah,yeah,i know him,i know him.definitely yeah.caldwell then told jones that hickman was my,apparently alluding to an earlier drug prosecution in state court.just after leaving the store,hickman spoke with henderson by phone henderson asked if he ever ma d e it to the store and hickman confirmed that he had.
the investigators directed city police to stop hickman,and after allowing hickman to drive a few blocks away from the store so as not to raise suspicion,baltimore police officer keith sokolowski stopped hickman vehicle for a traffic violation.hickman was driving and his girlfriend,claudia lake,was in the front passenger seat.officer sokolowski testified that he discovered and seized grams of heroin in the passenger area of the car,which lake had tried to hide.subsequent analysis revealed that the heroin was pure.sokolowski also found vials of heroin hidden under the gas cap of the vehicle,though the heroin in the vials was never weighed.
hickman was arrested and then released on bail.the day of his release,he called henderson about arranging an additional purchase from jones.over the next few days,the two spoke several times about it though hickman told henderson that he had spoken with jones and was simply waiting on him,the government produced no evidence that this plan was ever consummated.
meanwhile,in a search of caldwell house on may,arising from a separate investigation,local law enforcement officers seized grams of heroin,later found to be pure.in a subsequent search of fat cat variety store on june,federal agents seized more than vials and a variety of colored tops,packaged by the hundred.the evidence showed that the vials were of the sort customarily employed to package quantities of heroin of a gram.
additional facts are set forth in the following analyses as needed.
hickman was charged with seven others in an superseding indictment.he was named in two counts count one alleged a conspir acy to distribute,and possess with intent to distribute,one kilogram or more of heroin,and count six alleged possess ion with the intent to distribute a quantity of heroin.although all of hickman pled guilty,none of them testified at trial,nor did the government call as a witness any other participant in the overall conspiracy.rather,the government adduced the testimony of the following witnesses special agent strickland,who was conducting surveillance outside of fat cat variety store at the time of hickman purchase officers sokolowski and michael woodlon,who took part in the traffic stop of hickman detective constantine passamichalis,who assisted in the raid on caldwell residence and criminologists anthony rumber and theodis warnick,who tested the narcotics seized from hickman and caldwell.
perhaps most significant for purposes of this appeal was extensive testimony from special agent brendan,who monitored the jones wiretap and who was accepted by the court as an expert in narcotics investigations.the government relied heavily on the content of the wiretap recordings,and it was agent who interpreted them for the jury,explaining the vague and coded terminology used by drug dealers.in its effort to prove that the conspiracy which the indictment alleged subsisted for only four months,from february through may involved more than one kilogram of heroin,the government asked agent to explain how heroin is typically cut down from its raw,state to level of approximately via mixture with mannite and quinine.critical to the government theory of the case was opinion that the vials seized from fat cat variety store would be enough to hold one kilogram of heroin.
after the government rested,the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal,which the district court denied.the defense at no time specifically argued that the government proof established only a conspiracy involving a lesser amount than one kilogram,and the defense never requested a lesser included offense instruction.nor did the defense call any witnesses.
the jury found hickman guilty on both the conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute counts.the jury was asked on the verdict form to determine whether the amount of heroin involved in the conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable to hickman was one kilogram or more,less than one kilogram but greater than or equal to one hundred grams,or less than one hundred grams.it found the conspiracy involved one kilogram or more and that such amount was foreseeable to hickman.after the verdict,hickman moved for a new trial pursuant to rule,which was denied.because hickman had two predicate felony drug convictions which the government had noticed pursuant to,he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count and to a concurrent sentence of months for possession with intent to distribute.
we first address hickman contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove the conspiracy.we easily conclude that the evidence adduced by the government proved the existence of a heroin conspiracy,but we are unable to find in the record adequate evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved one kilogram or more.after examining the evidence surrounding each of the transactions proven at trial,we consider the two inferences the government asked the jury to draw in order to reach its finding that the conspiracy involved at least one notably,that the conspirators seeming familiarity with the drug trade indicated that this conspiracy concerned some greater amount of heroin than was otherwise proved at trial.as we explain,the direct and circumstantial evidence in the record simply will not do the work the government assigned it,and we hold the evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the charged conspiracy.accordingly,we vacate the conviction and sentence on count i and remand with directions to the district court to enter judgment against hickman for conspiracy to distribute one hundred grams or more of heroin,a lesser included offense encompassed by count i of the superseding indictment amply supported by sufficient evidence.
we review the denial of hickman motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.see united states green,cir,cert.denied,and.v iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,united states bynum,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,we are to determine whether the conviction is supported by substantial evidence,where substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,united states young,cir.
though this is a heavy burden,it is by no means insuperable.the ultimate question is whether any rational trier of facts could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.bynum,at internal quotation marks omitted.where,as here,the trier of fact would have had to rely on attenuated inferences of drug quantity,the finding of quantity can not stand.
overwhelming evidence supports the jury finding that hickman was a knowing member of the basic conspiracy alleged in count i of the superseding indictment.

given the plethora of direct evidence,including but not limited to the content of the telephone communications and the circumstances surrounding the traffic stop of hickman,only very modest inferences,if any,were required here to show the existence of a conspiratorial agreement and hickman knowing membership in a heroin conspiracy.the damning wiretap recordings reveal hickman and henderson coordination and hickman purchased grams of heroin from jones henderson discussing his stake in the transaction and later exchanges between hickman and henderson concerning the possibility of a subsequent transaction after the police seized the heroin initially purchased moreover,agents observed hickman entering and exiting jones in the interim,wiretaps record jones discussing the hickman sale with caldwell and a police stop some minutes later found hickman in possession of those grams in the face of this mountain of evidence of hickman knowing participation in a heroin distribution conspiracy,hickman broader challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is plainly unavailing 
although there is overwhelming evidence of hickman knowing membership in a heroin distribution conspiracy,his challenge to the jury finding that the conspiracy of which he became a member involved at least one kilogram of heroin has merit.sufficient evidence supported a finding that hickman knowingly became a member of a heroin distribution conspiracy which involved,at the least jones,henderson,and caldwell,and that many of the acts of the coconspirators were reasonably foreseeable to hickman.yet,no matter how generously we indulge the available reasonable inferences in favor of the government,adding the weight of heroin from all known and reasonably inferable completed,attempted,or merely agreed upon by any of hickman reach a sum of one kilogram,if not a mathematical impossibility,would require reasoning so attenuated as to provide insufficient support for the jury verdict on the verdict.
the jury heard evidence of the amounts and purity of heroin seized during the traffic stop of hickman and the raid on caldwell home evidence of discussion between hickman and henderson of an attempt in the days after hickman initial arrest to do the same thing transaction again,presumably with jones and a vague statement the defense itself elicited on of a government witness concerning the recover y of heroin the week prior from someone exiting jones store.
the indictment alleged a conspiracy.the only definite amounts of heroin established by the government were the grams of pure heroin recovered during the stop of hickman vehicle vials also recovered during the traffic stop,the contents of which were never weighed the grams of heroin jones kept from hickman and grams of pure heroin seized from the raid on caldwell apartment.expert testimony from agent provided a basis for inferring that the coconspirators intended that the heroin be substantially diluted before reaching.to step on or cut down the heroin,a dealer would mix one part raw heroin with one,two,or three parts of cut the solvent used to dilute the heroin,often mannite or reach a concentration fit for most users,which agent estimated to be.
agent discussion of the dilution process was the jury only basis for inflating the weight of the recovered heroin,and as such the method of dilution he described must constrain the trier of fact reasonable inferences.as agent described,raw heroin is said,in the slang vernacular,to take a one,two,or a three depending on how many parts of solvent are mixed with each part of heroin,because the drug dealers on the street do have a laboratory,they are limited to this simple mixing process.agent lengthy discussion,and the vernacular terms he cites,indicate that this mixing of heroin with cut is always in the ratio of n,where n is a natural number.this,of course,would bound the maximum dilution of heroin of a given purity without a laboratory capable of more precise measurements and mixtures,dilution to precisely will ordinarily be impossible.thus the pure heroin recovered from hickman would only take a four be mixed with a mixture would decrease the purity below similarly,the heroin seized from caldwell,pure,would take a three.these dilutions would result in grams of purity and grams of,approximately grams of heroin.but we will assume,arguendo,that the hickman conspiracy would have diluted this heroin precisely to purity,generating grams and grams for hickman and caldwell,respectively.together with the grams jones kept from,assuming it was of the same purity as the grams jones sold him,would add another government would have established a total of grams.
as for the vials recovered during the traffic stop of hickman,their contents were never weighed.rumber,one of the government two criminologists at trial,testified that the gross weight of the vials was grams,and confirmed that the net weight of the heroin never measured.the only testimony on point is from agent,who explained that a vial of heroin typically contains grams.thus the vials support an additional grams of heroin.added to the grams assumed above,this would support a finding of no more than grams.
evidence concerning the remaining two potential transactions is scant,to say the least.during the week after hickman initial arrest and release,he and henderson spoke about attempting to do the same thing again,and hickman claimed he had made several telephone calls to a potential narcotics supplier,apparently jones.though hickman remained free until his arrest in august,no evidence of this transaction was offered.aside from henderson reference to do ing the same thing again,emphasis added,there is no evidence concerning the amount of heroin hickman and henderson sought.attributing any more than another grams to this potential the earlier purchase from be purely speculative thus,at a maximum,the jury could find that the conspiracy involved another grams of cut heroin,giving them a hypothetical sum of grams.
evidence of the final alleged brief statement on by agent about the seizure of some amount of heroin from some individual exiting jones store a week before hickman extremely vague 
q.how many people did you stop coming out of fat cat and recover heroin from 
a.we recovered heroin out week prior.i think it was april.
and you recovered it in terms of the stop of hickman is that right 
there is no evidence that this seizure had anything to do with hickman,henderson,or caldwell.moreover,given that jones was in the business of selling drug paraphernalia and so would likely be visited by those who had recently bought or intended to buy narcotics elsewhere,there is little reason to believe that the seized heroin had just been sold through jones store.that the surveillance of jones store bore no more fruit than this single drug seizure further undermines the circumstantial evidence of drug quantity implicating jones even if,squinting our eyes,it were to appear nonspeculative to attach an amount to this earlier seizure and link it to the count i conspiracy,the evidence could by no means bear any more than the stepped on amount of hickman purchase from jones,grams.and even with this final amount,the sum would fall short of one kilogram.
to reach its finding that the count i conspiracy involved at least one kilogram,the jury would have had to rely on either or both of two grounds that hickman was criminally liable for the distribution of heroin by buyers of paraphernalia from theory that fails as a matter of law or that,on account of the conspirators apparent familiarity with the drug trade,they must have undertaken to distribute some amount beyond the amounts involved in the evidenced transactions.neither theory can sustain hickman conviction on the conspiracy.
the government told jurors during closing argument that jones basically runs a shop for heroin,with thousands and thousands of vials that heroin goes in.tr.in united states hickman,vol,at.april.indeed,the evidence well supports the inference that jones was in the business of selling drug paraphernalia.as agent testified,a raid on jones store produced bins containing more than glass vials of the sort used to distribute heroin,packaged in groups of one hundred,in various sizes and with variously colored tops,also packaged in groups of one hundred customers were apprised of the merchandise by a binder on the counter.
yet there is absolutely no evidence to support a finding that hickman is liable for heroin distributions by those who had purchased empty vials from jones.indeed,it strains credulity even to think that,on the evidence in the record,jones himself could be convicted of a widespread conspiracy to distribute heroin on the mere fact that he sells drug paraphernalia and had such packaged merchandise at his store.finding such conspiracy liability for jones would have required the trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that jones purchase of paraphernalia for resale evidenced a conspiracy to conspire with future paraphernalia buyers concerning subsequent distribution.while paraphernalia vendors can certainly become parties to the distribution conspiracies of their buyers,such cases present substantial evidence of the vendor involvement in knowing facilitation of,a distributor operations.see,united states meredith,cir.
tellingly,agent testified that law enforcement did not stop a lot of people coming out of jones store because they knew that jones was also selling paraphernalia,like vials,and we not going to go out and arrest a particular person just for having the actual vials empty vials.unless there is a specific reason,and we know that a drug deal is taking place,he testified,we not just stopping everybody that coming out of there and trying to pull a bunch of empty vials off the street.in fact,the jury was told that in more than a month of surveillance of jones store,only a single patron other than hickman was found with narcotics on his person.where the government failed to present evidence about even a single buyer of the paraphernalia or any plans on the part of jones to involve himself in the distribution activities of his paraphernalia customers,it would be mere speculation to find that jones own distribution activities were coextensive with his paraphernalia business on this paltry evidence,no reasonable inference as to the scope of jones conspiracy to distribute narcotics could be drawn from the amount of paraphernalia merchandise he hoped to sell.
furthermore,even if the evidence had supported widespread conspiracy liability for jones on the basis of his trafficking in drug paraphernalia,this liability could not be transferred to hickman on this record.as an initial matter,while we have assumed that hickman and jones conspired together with respect to the distribution chain that included henderson and caldwell,no evidence was presented to suggest that the selling of paraphernalia entered into this agreement.moreover,as there was no evidence that hickman had or planned to have any involvement with or even any knowledge of jones paraphernalia buyers,such a conspiracy having jones at the center would have been a classic rimless,conspiracy,which has long been held to make out multiple,distinct conspiracies and not a single,large one,see kotteakos united states,dickson microsoft,cir.thus evidence of the number of packaged,empty vials in jones store is not a sufficient basis for further inflating the amount of heroin ascribable to the count i conspiracy.
nor could the jury properly convict hickman of the conspiracy in reliance on the government repeated assertions during closing argument that the count i conspiracy encompassed far more drug distribution activity and that hickman could reasonably foresee such quantity than that of which the government could produce competent evidence.the government strenuously urged jurors to draw such an inference,claiming that the evidence presented was only a window into the conspiracy,merely part of something larger that the evidenced transactions were simply two brief episodes in the life of this conspiracy or a few days in the life of a heroin conspiracy that this was an ongoing course of business,an ongoing thing.tr.in united states hickman,vol,at.april.i t clear,said the prosecutor,that this is a regular course of business for these gentlemen.it clear that this is the first time they done this before sic.it clear that this was going to be the last time hickman would have continued to seek out drug transactions.
this line of argument is troubling,not just because it seems to urge jurors to convict the defendant for what he would have continued to do which,to the extent these hypothesized future bad acts were not captured by an agreement within the charged period,is clearly improper,see united states cunningham,cir the government may not attempt to obtain a conviction by appealing to jurors to prevent futures crimes united states monaghan,a prosecutor may not urge jurors to convict a criminal defendant in order to deter future lawbreaking,but also because it invites the jury to speculate as to the amount of heroin involved in the conspiracy.
where no evidence exists to guide the trier of fact in determining the outer scope of a conspiracy,the trier may not simply guess at the magnitude or frequency of unknown criminal activity.unbridled speculation is an impermissible basis for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.
under more than two decades of federal law,it is impermissible to enhance drug amounts without particularized evidence of narcotics transactions.federal district courts have long struggled with extrapolating drug amounts under the sentencing guidelines,which instruct that,w here the amount of narcotics seized does not reflect the scale of the offense,the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.in reviewing district courts findings,the courts of appeals have developed a sizable body of case law narrowing the range of permissible inferences.its teachings are instructive here.
as the first circuit has explained,w here extrapolations have been upheld,the government managed to demonstrate an adequate basis in fact and that the drug quantities were determined in a manner consistent with the accepted standards of reasonable reliability.united states,cir citing to second and third circuit cases.concerned about the methodologies district courts employ to calculate their extrapolations,courts have cautioned against using small sample sizes.see,at warning that the smaller the sampling,the less reliable the resulting probability estimate,the court reversed where the sample size was minuscule united states.howard,cir a bsent a reliable evidentiary basis supporting the assumption as to the amounts buyers were able to purchase from defendant we are unwilling to rest on speculation from the details of a known purchase on remand,it will be the government responsibility to proffer some evidentiary basis from which a reasonable and reliable estimate may be made of the amounts buyers purchased from defendant on the other occasions.
to be sure,where courts have evidence of a number of transactions,they have been permitted to multiply that number by an average to reach an estimate,see,united states,cir upholding such a calculation using highly conservative estimates,cert.denied.united states rodriguez,cir approving of a calculation using a conservative estimate of united states durham,cir i t is also permissible for a court to take witness estimates of the amount of drugs they purchased and multiply that by the minimum quantity sold on each occasion,though the circuit courts have urged district courts to make conservative approximations,henderson,at see also united states sklar,cir w hen choosing between a number of plausible estimates of drug quantity a court must err on the side of caution.quoting united states walton,cir.
such conservative extrapolation as to the amount sold in evidenced transactions is perfectly proper but the courts of appeals have refused to allow a trier of fact to extend this extrapolation so far as to fabricate transactions of which there is no evidence.thus the first circuit has held that evidence that a drug conspiracy did a substantial amount of narcotics business was insufficient,i n the absence of particularized findings,to support a determination by a preponderance of the evidence of an amount of narcotics that seem ed attainable given the appellant role in the conspiracy,explaining that a court can not uphold a drug quantity calculation on the basis of hunch or intuition.united states,cir emphasis added.likewise the third circuit has reversed and remanded for more particularized findings despite proof that defendant involvement with cocaine was extensive and continued over a long period of time,holding that such evidence does not translate readily into a specific drug quantity finding.united states miele,cir.
here the government contends,unpersuasively,that hickman use of vague and coded language establishes familiar ity with drug trafficking and that only someone heavily involved in repeated drug trafficking would be so brazen and unrepentant to return almost immediately to trying to find more heroin to sell.br.of appellee at.in a case like hickman,where a lack of evidence would make particularized findings impossible,courts would have reversed a sentencing court by a mere preponderance of the hickman conspiracy involved one kilogram or more of heroin.and if such an inference would have been too speculative to satisfy the sentencing guidelines,which merely require an approximat ion,based on evidence with sufficient indicia of reliability to support a conclusion that they are probably accurate,then a fortiori it would fail to satisfy a rational trier of fact tasked with making findings beyond a reasonable doubt.
in this case,where evidence of unknown transactions was meager and offered virtually no guide as to the amounts that may have been involved,we hold that the jury verdict finding the heroin conspiracy involved one kilogram or more was not supported by sufficient evidence.
yet it is within our power to direct entry of judgment on a lesser included offense when vacating a greater offense for insufficient evidence.see rutledge united states,noting that federal appellate courts appear to have uniformly concluded that they may direct the entry of judgment for a lesser included offense when a conviction for a greater offense is reversed on grounds that affect only the greater offense accord united states silvers,cir united states plenty arrows,cir doing so government of virgin islands brown,cir same.some circuits have introduced limitations on this remedy,chief among them that the jury have been instructed on the lesser included offense.see,united states dhinsa,cir united states,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states nevils,cir.we decline to consider that question here,where even the most stringent limitations would be functionally satisfied.
because we conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to persuade a rational fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt of hickman guilt on the lesser included offense of conspiracy to distribute one hundred grams or more of heroin,we direct entry of judgment against hickman under count i of the indictment for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute heroin in the amount of one hundred grams or more 
hickman second contention,that the trial judge erred in rejecting his proposed instructions regarding the amount of heroin attributable to him,is without merit.
reviewing the refusal to give a jury instruction for abuse of discretion,we will reverse only when the requested instruction was correct was not substantially covered by the court charge to the jury and dealt with some point in the trial so important,that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant ability to conduct his defense.united states lighty,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this review is holistic we do not view a single instruction in isolation rather we consider whether,taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge,the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
at trial,defense counsel requested that the judge instruct the jury that hickman could only be held responsible for the amount of drugs that were foreseeable to the defendant and within the scope of his agreement.and counsel objected to the verdict form second question if you find the defendant guilty as to count,how do you find as to the amount of heroin involved asking that the following be appended and that is foreseeable to him and within the scope of his agreement.
the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that coconspirators actual or intended distribution of narcotics could only be charged to hickman so long as it was reasonably foreseeable to him that such a type and quantity of drugs would be involved in the conspiracy which he joined.twice see also acts or plans of coconspirators only attributable to hickman if reasonably foreseeable to him.with respect to the special verdict form,the judge specifically instructed the jury that the second question asked the type and amount of drugs reasonably foreseeable to the defendant that would be involved in the conspiracy,or that he possessed or distributed,and explained that t he burden is on the government to establish the type and amount of drugs beyond a reasonable doubt.
these instructions accord with the principles of pinkerton united states,and our cas
