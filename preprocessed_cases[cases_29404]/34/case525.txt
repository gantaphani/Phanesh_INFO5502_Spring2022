timothy duval and michael doucette were each convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,in violation of g.duval and doucette now appeal their convictions and sentences.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
on january,heath woodward,then a resident of sanford,maine,reported that his maroon buick was stolen from a convenience store parking lot.woodward later testified that he did not have any weapons in the car at that time.
in late january,duval,doucette,and carlos ramos an acquaintance of duval and doucette spent a few nights at an apartment rented by robert dyott.dyott was an associate of ramos and unbeknownst to his guests,an informant for the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf.dyott would later testify that while staying at his apartment,doucette said that he and duval had stolen a car from a convenience store and that they had some weapons in the trunk of that car that they wanted to move,sell.dyott also testified that duval and ramos were in the room when doucette said this,and that duval did not disavow doucette statement.according to dyott,doucette also said that he and duval were going to stay at a hotel the following night.
on january,a guest identifying himself as carlos ramos registered at the chelmsford best western for himself and a guest named paul santos.they were assigned room.in filling out the registration form,ramos identified his car as a maroon buick.that same night,a call was placed from room to a cell phone provided to dyott by the atf.
on february,dyott spoke with daniel meade,an atf agent,and told him that there was a stolen car with weapons at the chelmsford best western.the atf notified the chelmsford police department,which sent officers tyros and tine,joined by agent meade,to the best western to investigate the suspected stolen vehicle.officer tyros watched as a caucasian male,later identified as duval,walked toward a maroon buick carrying a black object,and paused briefly by the trunk of the car.tyros testified that duval noticed his presence and walked back to room.
later that day,agent meade encountered duval and doucette as they walked towards a gas station near the motel and asked them to identify themselves.upon learning their identities,agent meade arrested duval and doucette on outstanding warrants.meade found the keys to the stolen buick in doucette front pocket.a search of the car revealed a remington rifle,a remington shotgun,a marlin rifle,and ammunition inside the trunk.investigators found no fingerprints in the trunk,on the firearms,or the ammunition.however,duval and doucette prints were recovered from objects found in the passenger compartment.
on june,a complaint was filed with the united states district court for the district of massachusetts charging duval and doucette each with being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.the government filed an indictment against duval and doucette on september.both duval and doucette pleaded not guilty.
in an attempt to comply with local rule c and brady maryland,d,the government initially disclosed to duval and doucette in october that it would call dyott to testify at trial,and that dyott was a government informant.the government stated that dyott had not been paid for his cooperation and that there was no evidence that would otherwise cast doubt on his credibility.but two months later,the government informed duval and doucette that dyott had been paid for his cooperation since.then,in february,the government sent a letter to duval and doucette stating that in,it had dropped firearms charges against dyott in exchange for his cooperation.eight months after that,the government added that it had discovered that dyott had been paid an additional in and,and that dyott had a long history of mental illness.
on january,the government moved to supplement its witness list to include carlos ramos,the acquaintance of duval and doucette who had allegedly rented the motel room for them.the government disclosed in a letter to duval and doucette that ramos had a history of drug abuse,and had once cooperated with the government by making a controlled buy.the following week,on january,the government sent a second letter to duval and doucette stating that ramos had told the government that he did not see any guns or hear either defendant make any reference to guns,and that ramos had told agent meade in that he had no knowledge of a stolen car.other than this disclosure,the government indicated that it had no additional exculpatory information regarding ramos.
two days later,on january,the government sent another letter to duval and doucette.this time,the letter stated that the government did have exculpatory information regarding ramos,specifically that ramos was offered leniency for his participation in the firearms transaction in exchange for becoming an informant.the letter also stated that agent meade had interviewed ramos in february,but that meade had not made any notes of the interview.the letter stated that meade had asked ramos about his renting a hotel room for duval and doucette,but that he did not recall if he asked ramos whether he was in the room with dyott,duval,and doucette in late january when doucette was alleged to have offered to sell dyott weapons.the government continued to assert that ramos had not been paid for his cooperation on the duval and doucette case.on january,the government sent yet another letter to duval and doucette,amending its prior disclosure to add that ramos had in fact attempted to make at least three or four controlled purchases for the atf,and that meade had given him money to buy telephone calling cards.on the sixth day of the,government disclosed to duval and doucette,seemingly contrary to prior claims that ramos had not been paid in connection with the present case,that an entry on the atf payment roster indicated that ramos had been paid for informant subsistence.the entry included a reference to ducette sic duval.
duval and doucette moved to dismiss the indictment because of a pattern of government with its disclosure obligations.the government opposed the dismissal of the indictment,contending that neither duval nor doucette had suffered prejudice as a result of the belated disclosures.the court denied the motion to dismiss,stating that the government had violated its brady obligations,but that neither duval nor doucette were prejudiced.
duval and doucette also requested that the government provide the records of each individual payment to dyott and ramos so they could determine if the government had failed to disclose any other payments to the witnesses.instead,the government provided duval and doucette a summary of the payments made to dyott.duval and doucette claimed that the summary was insufficient given the history of belated disclosures by the government,and asked the court to compel production of the payment records,or in the alternative,to review the records in camera,in order to determine whether any additional payments had been made to dyott or ramos.the court denied the request 
in addition,duval moved to exclude as inadmissible hearsay dyott testimony that doucette had offered firearms for sale.the court denied duval motion to exclude without prejudice,ruling that he could raise it again at trial if the government failed to show that doucette statement was either a statement in furtherance of a conspiracy or an adoptive admission by duval.
the jury trial of duval and doucette began on february,and lasted eight days.at trial,dyott testified that he had met with duval,doucette,and ramos in late january,that doucette had told him that he had firearms to sell,and that duval said nothing when he heard this.dyott also disclosed on direct examination his past and present drug habits,mental illness,and criminal history.duval and doucette dyott as to his cooperation with the atf and payments that he received.in addition,both ramos and agent meade testified,along with various other witnesses.
during closing arguments,the government noted that duval had been within fifteen miles of the location where the buick was stolen,that the buick did not have firearms or ammunition in it when it was stolen,that the buick was later found at the hotel where duval and doucette were staying,that duval had suspiciously approached the vehicle but turned away when he saw the police,that doucette had the keys to the vehicle,and that the trunk contained firearms and ammunition.the government then stated,y ou can stop right there because that evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt that duval and doucette were in knowing possession of the firearms and ammunition.but there more.the government then noted that dyott had testified that doucette had admitted to possessing the firearms,and that duval had remained silent.the government acknowledged dyott substantial credibility problems but said,take dyott testimony,discount it altogether t here is still no reasonable doubt that these men possessed those guns and that ammunition.duval and doucette then gave their closing arguments.duval suggested that the government can not get around the testimony of robert dyott.if robert dyott testimony is not in this case,there is no case.doucette stated,i f you do believe dyott testimony about a conversation he claims to have heard january of,if you do believe his testimony beyond a reasonable doubt,you can not convict in this case.
duval and doucette then asked the court to give two instructions to the jury.first,they asked the court to instruct the jury that,if you do not believe dyott testimony beyond a reasonable doubt about his alleged conversation with doucette,you must acquit the defendant.second,duval and doucette asked the court to instruct the jury that o ne can not be found guilty of possessing an object unless he has knowledge of its presence.knowledge alone,however,is not enough to prove possession.similarly,mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.the court refused both instructions,and instead instructed the jury as follows 
to possess something means to have control or dominion and control over something.it is not necessarily the same as legal ownership.
the law recognizes different kinds of possession.possession includes both actual and constructive possession.a person who has direct,physical control of something on or around his person is in actual possession of it.a person who is not in actual possession but who has the power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something is in constructive possession of it.so whenever i use the word possession in these instructions,i mean both actual and constructive possession.
in considering the issue of possession in this case it is not necessary for you to conclude that a defendant in this case was in actual or constructive possession of the firearm ammunition for a specified period of time.
more than one person can have control over the same firearms ammunition.if this is so,then these people have what is called joint possession.for purposes of determining a defendant guilt,joint possession is not different from sole possession.
while you may consider a defendant proximity to the firearms ammunition in deciding whether the government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed those items,mere proximity to the firearm ammunition or mere presence of a defendant in the place where the firearm ammunition were found is insufficient by itself to support a finding of possession.
the government must also establish beyond a reasonable doubt as to each defendant that he knowingly possessed the firearms ammunition in question.the word knowingly means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of ignorance,mistake,or accident.thus,in order to convict a defendant,you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was in possession of a firearm ammunition and that he knew that what he possessed was a firearm ammunition as we commonly use these words.
the jury convicted both duval and doucette on the sole count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.presentence reports were prepared for both defendants,suggesting that they were subject to the armed career criminals act acca,e,which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years on any person convicted of a firearms charge who has been previously convicted of three violent felonies.neither duval nor doucette prior convictions were alleged before the jury,and the jury made no finding as to them.
both duval and doucette challenged the court ability to impose a sentence under the acca unless the predicate convictions had been proven to a jury.in addition,duval stated that one of the predicate convictions being used to support his eligibility for an acca sentence,a conviction for assault and battery under.ann.tit,a,was neither a violent crime nor a felony.the court rejected duval and doucette arguments and found them both to be subject to the acca because they had each been convicted of three prior felonies.the court imposed a sentence of months on duval and months on doucette.
ii.discussion 
duval and doucette appeal their convictions on the ground that the government failed to meet its obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence under brady,d,and the jencks act,b.in addition,duval argues that dyott testimony as to doucette statement during the january,meeting should not have been admitted against him because it was inadmissible hearsay.duval and doucette both challenge the district court failure to give their requested jury instructions regarding the elements of constructive possession and the sufficiency of the evidence against them.duval and doucette also bring a sixth amendment challenge to their sentences.finally,doucette argues that he has not been convicted of three violent felonies,and thus is not subject to sentencing under the acca.we discuss each of these claims in turn.
a.the government disclosure obligations 
duval and doucette argue that the government failed to comply with its obligations under brady and the jencks act to disclose exculpatory and impeaching evidence regarding dyott and ramos and that it should have been sanctioned accordingly.in addition,because of the belated disclosure that ramos had been paid for his cooperation with the atf,duval and doucette suggest that the government may have failed to disclose additional payments made to dyott and ramos,and they argue that they were entitled to in camera review of the government records of payments to confidential informants.we review the district court denial of sanctions and in camera review for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir united states devin,cir.
in brady maryland,the supreme court held that a prosecutor has a duty to disclose,upon request,evidence favorable to an accused where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.see also giglio united states,d reversing a conviction where the government failed to disclose that it had granted immunity to a witness upon whose testimony the government case was heavily dependent.likewise,under the jencks act,the prosecution has an obligation to provide,upon request,certain prior statements made by trial witnesses that relate to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.united states schneiderhan,cir citing b.to vacate a conviction because of a brady violation,a defendant must show that the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.united states casas,cir quoting united states josleyn,cir.the test for a jencks act violation is similar we look to see whether the government failed to disclose prior statements by witnesses that relate to their testimony at trial,and whether the nondisclosure was prejudicial.schneiderhan,at.when the issue is one of delayed disclosure rather than of nondisclosure,however,the test is whether defendant counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant case.united states ingraldi,cir see also united states arboleda,cir applying ingraldi to allegations that the government belatedly disclosed jencks act materials.
we begin by noting that the government conduct during the course of this prosecution was a clear violation of its brady and jencks act obligations.the government amended its disclosures of potentially exculpatory evidence no less than five times,each time disclosing information that further cast doubt on the testimony of dyott and ramos,two of the government principal witnesses at trial.at least part of the problem appears to have been that the atf agent involved in the investigation kept scant notes on conversations with ramos that tended to exculpate his prime suspects,duval and practice whose propriety is questionable another part of the problem appears to have been shoddy by the atf with regard to payments to confidential informants.finally,overly broad statements by the government that all exculpatory information had been disclosed may have led duval and doucette to believe that the government had in fact disclosed all that it knew,when it had not.whether the late disclosures were the product of happenstance or of negligence is unclear,but we take this opportunity to remind prosecutors that disclosure of brady and jencks act material is not a suggestion,but a constitutional and statutory obligation.
we are mindful that not all convictions must be vacated because of with disclosure obligations we must also determine whether the information prejudiced duval and doucette ability to present their case.the first set of evidence belatedly disclosed by the government was impeachment evidence regarding dyott,namely that he had been treated for mental illness and had been paid and given leniency in a prior case in exchange for his services as a confidential informant.this information falls within the purview of brady because it could be used to impeach the reliability and motivation of dyott testimony.however,the last of these disclosures occurred in october,nearly six months before the start of the trial.this left sufficient time for duval and doucette counsel to incorporate the information into their defense strategy.while we do not condone the lateness of these disclosures,we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the lateness did not prejudice duval and doucette in the preparation of their cases,and that sanctions were not warranted.
the second set of late disclosures involved statements by ramos to agent meade that he had not heard dyott and doucette discussing the arms sale this statement falls within the scope of material that must be disclosed under brady because it casts doubt on both the government claim that the conversation occurred,and the claim that duval heard the statement and adopted the implicit admission of criminal activity by remaining silent.it also falls within the ambit of the jencks act,as it is a prior statement by a witness that relates to his trial testimony.however,as the government points out,ramos remained missing until january,and it is unclear that duval and doucette could have located him before then.furthermore,ramos admitted during that he had told meade that he did not remember hearing anything about the sale of arms at the motel,and that he did not tell meade anything about the stolen car when they met in february.thus,even assuming that doucette and duval could have located ramos before that time and interviewed him regarding his statement,it is unclear what benefit this would have been to the defense strategy.see casas,at finding no prejudice where defense counsel had an opportunity to witness about belatedly disclosed cooperation agreement.again,we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in determining that neither duval nor doucette were prejudiced by the late disclosure of ramos statement,and thus that sanctions were therefore not warranted.
finally,duval and doucette point to the disclosure that the government may have paid ramos in connection with his cooperation in another case.the government has stated that it has no further records of payment,but duval and doucette,having observed a pattern of delayed disclosures,suggest otherwise.thus,duval and doucette suggest that the proper remedy for this late disclosure is to give them the opportunity to examine the government confidential informant payment records to determine if other payments have been made to ramos in the alternative,duval and doucette propose that we direct the court to engage in an in camera review of the records to determine whether additional exculpatory material exists.duval and doucette suggest that their case is similar to united states,cir.in that case,various government agencies had been pursuing a boat at sea that was observed dumping drugs overboard.id.at.the principal defense theory was that the pursuing vessels had lost track of the boat engaged in the dumping,and that they had mistakenly seized the defendants boat instead.id.at.accordingly,the defendants requested communication logs from the government,which they argued would conclusively establish that their boat could not have been the same boat observed dumping drugs overboard.id.at.we noted that the information in the logs was critical to defendants theory and was a disputed issue at trial,and that we do not see how the logs could fail to be relevant.id.at.thus,we ordered in camera review of the logs to determine whether they contained potentially exculpatory evidence.id.at.
two principal differences between the present case and support our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order in camera review of the government payment logs.first,the defendants in made a clear showing that the evidence they sought in fact existed the government had acknowledged the existence of the communication logs and that they dealt with the defendants case,but had argued that they were cumulative of other evidence presented.here,duval and doucette have merely postulated a theory that additional records of payment to ramos or dyott exist albeit a theory that was fostered by the government pattern of.while we emphasize that the government denial that additional brady or jencks act material exists is not dispositive to our analysis,duval and doucette have not done much better than to take a shot in the dark.this is insufficient to establish the likelihood of a brady violation,united states,cir,and as such is certainly insufficient to require in camera review.
second,the material sought in was undisputably directly relevant to the key issue in the case the tapes would either potentially reveal that the defendants boat had been the one pursued or that the government had,in fact,lost track of the boat in question.in duval and doucette case,even if there were an adequate showing that records of additional payments made to ramos or dyott existed,they would not bear directly on the guilt or innocence of either defendant.although the records would have some utility as impeachment evidence,duval and doucette were already aware that ramos and dyott had accepted payments from the atf thus,the records would have been cumulative of other evidence,and it is unclear that their addition would have put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.casas,at.accordingly,the court did not err in denying duval and doucette request to review the government records.see united states,cir holding that neither brady nor the jencks act provides grounds for relief unless the exclusion or failure to produce prejudiced the defense.
in short,while we disapprove of the practice of belated disclosures of brady and jencks act material,we do not find that the government conduct in this case was so prejudicial that the district court abused its discretion in denying sanctions.
use of the adoptive admission against duval 
duval next claim of error concerns the district court decision to admit against him the testimony of dyott,who claimed that doucette said that he and duval wanted to sell firearms in their possession.the government claimed that dyott testimony implicated duval because duval was present when the incriminating statement was made yet did not attempt to disassociate himself from it,and thus was admissible as an adoptive admission by an opponent party.see.d b on january,duval filed a written motion to exclude the use of dyott testimony as inadmissible hearsay.on february,the district court denied duval pretrial motion without prejudice to its renewal during trial.at the government request,the statement was admitted at trial.
while the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion,united states barrow,cir,we review the case at bar for plain error because duval failed to interpose a contemporaneous objection at trial.udemba nicoli,cir see also united states desimone,wl at cir.june,reviewing the admission of hearsay for plain error.under the plain error standard,an appellant must demonstrate that there was an error the error was plain and the error affected substantial rights.united states tom,cir quoting johnson united states,d.in addition,the error must have seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting johnson,at.
we have long recognized adoptive admissions,including admissions by silence or acquiescence,as admissible against a pursuant to federal rule of evidence d b.united states fortes,cir.in united states miller,we elaborated,stating that a party agreement with a fact stated by another may be inferred from or adopted by silence when i a statement is made in a party presence,ii the nature of the statement is such that it normally would induce the party to respond,and iii the party nonetheless fails to take exception,cir.alleged admissions by silence may be properly submitted to the jury only if a reasonable jury could properly find the ultimate fact in favor of the proponent of the evidence.united states barletta,cir.
in the present case,dyott testified as to the incriminating nature of doucette statement and placed duval at the scene of the conversation.duval argues that these foundational were proffered by the insufficient to prove that he heard the statement,and thus for it to be admitted as an adoptive admission.while in some cases,the paucity of facts introduced at trial precludes any reasonably grounded finding of actual acquiescence,see,united states moore,cir,we have left the resolution of substantial yet conflicting testimony for the jury,see,united states wiseman,cir.this same principle applies to cases in which the facts give rise to conflicting but plausible inferences.
in the present case,the trial court properly found that the government laid an adequate foundation for the admission of dyott testimony by offering testimony that the conversation between dyott and doucette took place in a small room,and that duval was in that room,testimony from which it could be reasonably inferred that duval heard doucette statements.although duval offered the contrary testimony of ramos,who stated that he did not hear the conversation between dyott and doucette,the ultimate question of whether to believe ramos testimony and to infer from it that duval also did not hear doucette was properly left to the jury.because the court properly found that a foundation existed for the admission of dyott testimony against duval,we see no basis for concluding that the district court erred,plainly or otherwise,in admitting his testimony against duval.
instructional errors 
duval and doucette argue that the court erred in denying their request for two jury instructions.first,duval and doucette contend that the court erroneously denied their request to instruct the jury on the sufficiency of evidence against them.second,duval and doucette argue that the court erred in refusing to give their requested instruction on the elements of constructive possession.
the standard of review varies with respect to claims of instructional error.see united states,cir noting this phenomenon.here,however,the claims of error are such that we review the denial of the requested jury instructions for abuse of discretion.fryar curtis,cir.in considering whether the district court abused its discretion,we look to see whether the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.white of,cir.
the constructive possession instruction 
duval and doucette claim that the court instructions on constructive possession were insufficient because it failed to give their requested instruction that knowledge alone,however,is not enough to prove possession.similarly,mere presence in the vicinity of the object is insufficient to prove possession.duval and doucette suggest that by failing to give this instruction,the jury was allowed to equate knowledge with possession,and that knowledge alone is not sufficient to establish constructive possession.
applying the test set forth in white,at,we note that there does not appear to be any dispute that duval and doucette requested instruction was correct as a matter of law mere presence in the vicinity of an object is insufficient to prove constructive possession of that object,see united states wight,cir,and knowledge of an object location,without more,is insufficient to establish possession of that object,see united states mclean,cir t here must be some action,some word,or some conduct that links the individual to the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it,some power over it.quoting in re sealed case.furthermore,there is little question that the issue of constructive possession was integral to the case.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested instruction,however,because the law of constructive possession was substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered.white,at.we have said before that a court is not obligated to follow the exact form and wording of the defendant proposed instructions.united states gibson,cir.here,the court very clearly instructed the jury that to find constructive possession it needed to find both power and intention to exercise control or dominion and control over something,and that defendants knowingly possessed the firearms ammunition in question.thus,it is not the case that the jury was invited to convict based on mere knowledge of the firearms rather,the jury was plainly instructed that it needed to find knowing possession.because the court instructions adequately expressed the law of constructive possession,we detect no error in its denial of defendant requested instruction.
the sufficiency instruction 
duval and doucette also argue that the court erred by refusing to instruct the jurors that,if they do not believe dyott testimony beyond a reasonable doubt that doucette had told dyott about the stolen guns,they must acquit the defendant.as we have already explained,the court correctly gave detailed instructions on the elements of the offenses with which duval and doucette were charged and a defendant is not entitled to an instruction on every particular that conceivably might be of interest to the jury,at.
nevertheless,duval and doucette put a new twist on their claim,arguing that the requested instruction was necessary because the prosecutor suggested on closing that,in fact,there was sufficient evidence apart from dyott testimony to convict duval and doucette.in analyzing this claim of prosecutorial misconduct,our first step is to determine whether the prosecutor did in fact make improper statements to the jury on closing.see united states lowe,cir reaching other elements of test for prosecutorial misconduct only after determining that statements made by the prosecutor were improper.
we set forth the standard for establishing constructive possession in wight the government must show that the defendant had dominion and control over the area where the contraband was found.at.while circumstantial evidence can be used to satisfy this burden,mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient to establish constructive possession,nor is it sufficient to show only that a defendant had access to the weapons,see united states kelso,cir.t he ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm or area where it is located,however,is sufficient to support a finding of constructive possession.united states robinson,cir.
the prosecutor argued to the jury that,even if they disregarded dyott testimony which had been heavily impeached at trial,the remaining evidence was sufficient to convict.duval and doucette argue that the government evidence was insufficient,as a matter of law,for the jury to infer constructive possession because apart from dyott,there was no direct evidence that they knew that the firearms were in the trunk.in support of this claim,duval and doucette provide a litany of supposedly analogous cases in which findings of constructive possession were overturned.see,united states reece,cir holding that w here possession is not clear,constructive possession requires some nexus,link,or other connection between the defendant and the contraband.united states soto,cir it is well established that mere presence as a passenger in a car from which the police recover weapons does not establish possession.the mere proximity of a weapon to a passenger in a car goes only to its accessibility,not to the dominion or control which must be proved to establish possession.citations omitted.furthermore,duval and doucette emphasize that here the guns were hidden in the trunk of their car rather than in the passenger compartment,which they argue distinguishes their situation from prior appeals where we upheld jury inferences of constructive possession.see,united states liranzo,cir affirming defendant conviction where the precarious,angled position of weapon suggested it was stashed after car came to stop,and defendant was only person observed moving.lastly they aver that,as in kelso,access to a place where a firearm is located is insufficient to infer knowledge that the firearm is there.at.absent dyott testimony,duval and doucette argument goes,the government did not offer sufficient evidence to prove that they were aware of the contents of the trunk.
we agree that the evidence could have supported a jury inference that duval and doucette did not constructively possess the weapons.however,that is not the question on appeal.the jury found duval and doucette guilty,and thus we must determine whether,as a matter of law,the prosecutor was incorrect when he stated that the jury could infer from the evidence presented that duval and doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk even if they disregarded dyott.
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence apart from dyott testimony for the jury to infer that duval and doucette constructively possessed the firearms found in the trunk,and thus that the prosecutor arguments were not improper.like the defendants in liranzo,the evidence suggests doucette and duval exercised exclusive dominion and control over the location of the gun.at.doucette had the keys when the two were apprehended,duval appeared to avoid opening the trunk upon sight of police officers,and the guns were not in the car when it was stolen.although much of the government evidence was circumstantial,we have held that circumstantial evidence may support a finding of constructive possession.united states mcfarland,cir.
accordingly,this is not a situation where the evidence showed only a defendant mere proximity to weapons.see soto,at united states madkins,cir holding that it was unreasonable for a jury to infer constructive possession of a weapon from the fact that the defendant was found working under the hood of a car where the weapon was found.duval and doucette reliance on united states blue,cir,is similarly misplaced.in blue,the fourth circuit overturned a conviction where the only evidence presented was the presence of a gun under the seat and testimony that the defendant dipped his shoulder as the police officer approached the vehicle.id.at.here,not only was there evidence that guns were in the trunk of the stolen car and that duval turned away from the trunk when he noticed a police officer,but also that doucette had the keys to the trunk,that duval and doucette had stolen the car and had exclusive possession of it thereafter,and that they had suspiciously registered under a false name at the chelmsford motel,where the car and the guns were eventually found.this quantum of evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to infer that duval and doucette constructively possessed the weapons at issue.
thus,because there was sufficient evidence apart from dyott testimony that defendants constructively possessed the weapons found in their car,we find no error in the denial of a jury instruction to the contrary.
constitutional challenges to the acca 
duval and doucette both argue that the government failure to plead and prove their prior convictions to the jury renders acca sentences invalid under the sixth amendment.we review constitutional challenges to the acca de novo.united states mckenney,cir.
the supreme court rejected this very argument in united states,d,and has since reiterated its position that the fact of a prior conviction is exempt from the general rule that a jury must find any fact that raises a sentence above the maximum,see united states booker,d apprendi new jersey,d.we continue to be bound by supreme court precedent on this point,and as such,we must reject duval and doucette sixth amendment challenge to the imposition of an acca sentence.see,mckenney,at united states coplin,cir.
duval challenges to the acca sentence 
in addition to his constitutional arguments,duval contends that he should not be subject to an acca sentence because he has not been convicted of three violent felonies.the acca imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on defendants convicted of three previous convictions by any court for a violent felony.e.a violent felony is defined as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.id.e b.in determining whether a conviction was for a violent felony,the trial court may look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.taylor united states,d.in shepard united states,the supreme court recognized that where a defendant had plead guilty to a prior crime,a court could also examine a statement of factual basis for the charge,shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court,or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea,d citation omitted.
there appears to be no dispute among the parties that duval had been convicted of at least two violent felonies prior to his conviction for the instant offense.thus,the dispute centers around duval third conviction,a conviction for assault and battery under.ann.tit,which provides in part that it shall be a crime for a person to intentionally,knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.ordinarily,simple assault and battery is punishable in maine as a class d offense,which provides for a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison,id.however,because duval had previously been convicted of two misdemeanor assaults,he was sentenced under maine recidivist offender statute,making duval conviction a class c offense,which provided for a maximum sentence of five years in prison,id.duval offers two arguments as to why his third conviction should not qualify as a violent felony for the purposes of the acca.
the recidivist sentencing enhancement 
first,duval argues that because assault is usually punishable as a class d felony with a maximum term of less than one year in prison,his conviction was for a misdemeanor,and thus not a felony,even though the sentence he received was five years because of maine recidivist sentencing statute.thus,duval asks us to decide whether the word crime as used in e b means criminal conduct assault or criminal conduct in combination with certain attendant circumstances assault plus recidivism.we ordinarily review de novo a claim that a defendant is not subject to the acca de novo.united states mastera,cir.
this question is a novel one in this circuit,but has been addressed by other courts.duval urges us to adopt the reasoning of the ninth circuit in united states,cir en banc.in,the ninth circuit held that under taylor categorical approach,the proper analysis for determining whether a crime was a felony would be to consider the sentence available for the crime itself,without considering separate recidivist sentencing enhancements.id.at.thus,the ninth circuit found that a prior conviction for petty theft in california,which provides for a maximum sentence of six months,code,could not be a felony conviction even though the defendant had been subject to california repeat offender statute which increased the maximum term to one year,id,at.also supporting duval position is a line of decisions which hold that the acca,itself a recidivist sentencing statute,does not alter the nature of the underlying offense,but simply changes the sentencing structure for it.see,united states mcgatha,cir concluding that the acca is simply a sentencing enhancement provision united states rumney,cir t he three felonies provision is for sentence enhancement and is not an element of a heightened crime.
the government,on the other hand,urges us to adopt the reasoning of the fifth and seventh circuits.in mutascu gonzáles,the fifth circuit found that where a defendant had been previously convicted and sentenced under california recidivist sentencing statute,the ultimate conviction was not merely for petty theft,but rather for petty theft with prior jail term,cir.thus,the fifth circuit refused to atomize a sentence into its recidivist and predicate components,and held instead that the relevant sentence for the purposes of determining whether a crime was a felony was the sentence ordered by a court of law.id.quoting a b.likewise,the seventh circuit has held that recidivist sentencing statutes may be used to determine the maximum sentence for a prior conviction when deciding whether a prior drug conviction constituted a serious drug offense for the purposes of the acca.united states henton,cir.the fourth circuit has suggested a similar conclusion,although it noted that the maximum sentence imposable under a recidivist sentencing statute might depend on compliance with additional safeguards codified in state law.united states williams,cir.
the parties also point to recent supreme court decisions on sentencing issues to support their positions.in apprendi,the supreme court very explicitly stated that recidivism does not relate to the commission of the offense itself.at.quoting,at.duval contends that this statement supports his argument that his recidivist sentence was the product of a sentencing enhancement and not a change in the underlying offense.the government points us to ewing california,in which the court,reviewing california recidivist sentencing statute,explained that the petitioner had not been convicted of merely shoplifting three golf clubs.rather,ewing was convicted of felony grand theft for stealing nearly worth of merchandise after previously having been convicted of at least two violent or serious felonies,d.this,the government argues,supports its argument that recidivist sentencing statutes in effect create new recidivist crimes,which might be construed as felonies even if the underlying offense was a misdemeanor.
these arguments highlight two conundrums.the first is that by using definitions of crimes to determine sentencing on federal offenses,congress may have allowed states to disturb the balance struck in the acca repeat offenders would be subject to higher sentences,but only if they had committed three violent felonies.for example,it appears that under maine recidivist sentencing statute,a person might be convicted of three violent felonies and thus sentenced under the acca even if he had only been twice convicted of certain felony offenses robbery and once of a misdemeanor offense assault.this would seem to disturb congress determination that the acca should be applied only to hardened criminals,those who have committed three rather than two crimes whose nature is so serious that they are punishable as felonies.
second,this case highlights the ambiguous status accorded to recidivist sentencing statutes.the government asks us to classify duval third offense as recidivist assault,an offense that is different than assault.however,in light of the supreme court holding in apprendi that a maximum sentence may not be raised based on elements of the offense not pleaded and proven to a jury,at,this calls into question holding that,in fact,prior convictions need not be proven to a jury before they are used to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum.at.rejecting argument that recidivism is an element of a crime that needs to be plead and proven to a jury see united states,d thomas,dissenting from denial of certiorari urging the court to overrule for this reason.
in spite of the difficult questions that the government position presents,we are ultimately persuaded that logic and precedent support the conclusion that duval was convicted of recidivist assault,and thus was convicted of a felony.first,although apprendi stated that recidivism did not necessarily relate to the commission of an offense,at,this does not mean that an offense could not be defined with respect to recidivism.in fact,since apprendi was decided,ewing construed a conviction under california repeat offender statute as recidivist theft,at,and more recently,in lópez gonzáles,the court noted that state drug possession statutes correspond to federal drug statutes,including possession of cocaine base and recidivist possession,d emphasis added.we acknowledge that these holdings create some tension with,but as justice thomas noted in his dissent from denial of certiorari in,the supreme court is the only court authorized to overturn that decision.at.
furthermore,although there are some anomalies in having maine recidivist offender statute affect the operation of the acca recidivist offender scheme,this is not a unique situation.a single conviction in maine for simple assault is ordinarily not treated as a felony for acca purposes because it carries a penalty of less than one year.ann.tit,whereas a conviction for the exact same conduct in massachusetts would be treated as a felony because massachusetts law punishes assault by up to two and a half years.laws ch,a.moreover,states use different characteristics to categorize the same crimes as felonies or misdemeanors.maine makes assault a felony if it is accomplished with the use of a firearm,see state gilbert,me criminal threatening is a class d crime,which,when committed with use of a dangerous weapon,is enhanced to a class c offense,whereas oregon uses the presence of a victim minor child to turn a simple assault into a felony,see united states,cir also noting that a conviction with such an enhancement would qualify as a felony crime of violence.it appears that congress implicitly accepted such inconsistencies in the application of the acca because it was concerned about federalism and wanted to preserve the state role in defining,enforcing,and prosecuting essentially local crimes 
in enhancing this federal firearms offense with acca type sanctions,if the defendant has been convicted three times of robbery or burglary,we are enhancing an existing federal crime,which would alleviate many of the problems associated with the acca such as the issue of a local veto or the difficulties encountered by federal courts in applying state robbery and burglary laws in federal prosecutions.
at,reprinted in.we can only assume that congress thought that these federalism concerns would outweigh whatever inconsistencies arose.
in addition,as one of the dissents in pointed out 
raising an offense from a misdemeanor to a felony has effects far beyond the extra time defendant might serve.while employers may be willing to overlook a misdemeanor in potential employees,they are much less likely to hire co
