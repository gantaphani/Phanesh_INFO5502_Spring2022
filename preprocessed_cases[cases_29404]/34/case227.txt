in july,a jury convicted defendant appellant charles stergios of two counts of bank fraud and one count of mail fraud.stergios appeals the jury findings that the banks he defrauded were fdic insured an element of bank fraud and that he used the united states mails to perpetrate his frauds an element of mail fraud.he also appeals restrictions on his internet usage that the district court imposed as part of his supervised release,as well as the district court inclusion of a counterfeit million check in its calculation of loss supporting stergios month sentence.we affirm.
facts background 
the convictions for bank and mail fraud that stergios challenges here were not his first.in april,after pleading guilty before judge singal to charges of wire,mail,and bank fraud,stergios was sentenced to months of incarceration,followed by five years of supervised release.on june,to complete his prison sentence,stergios was transferred to pharos house,a residential reentry center in portland,maine.about a month later,he was given permission to move to his mother and stepfather home in brunswick,maine,through pharos house home confinement program.as a condition of his supervision,he was not allowed to possess a computer or access the internet.
nevertheless,between july,and august,while living at pharos house and at his parents house on home confinement,stergios used the internet and other means to attempt to obtain money by false pretenses from maine bank trust mb t and usaa bank usaa.his was a variation on the classic check kiting scheme.he opened several bank accounts in person and online,apparently only two of which were opened with legitimate,but small,deposits.thereafter,he inflated the value of those accounts by depositing checks drawn from closed accounts and accounts with insufficient funds,making fraudulent wire transfers,and depositing empty envelopes purporting to contain cash.stergios then extracted money from the accounts by transferring funds between them,withdrawing money from tellers and atms,writing checks drawn from the accounts,and making purchases online and in person using debit cards issued for the accounts.
on january,stergios was charged in a superseding indictment.count charged bank fraud against mb t,in violation of.count charged bank fraud against usaa.count charged mail fraud involving usaa,in violation of.count,which alleged escape from custody,was severed from the other charges.stergios thus found himself once again before judge singal on july,for a jury trial on counts,and.
at the outset of trial,stergios argued that,in the absence of a certificate from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,the testimony of an mb t representative was insufficient to prove that mb t was fdic insured at the time of stergios crimes,as required by.the government presented two forms of evidence with respect to each bank status.first,a bank representative testified that the bank was fdic insured stergios objected to some of this testimony but not specifically to the bank representatives qualifications to provide the testimony.second,the government offered official copies of the banks fdic insurance certificates.each certificate was accompanied by an affidavit from valerie best,assistant executive secretary of the fdic and custodian of fdic records,authenticating the certificate and stating that the fdic had no record of either bank coverage having been terminated since the date on the certificate stergios did not object to these certificates or the accompanying affidavits.
stergios also argued at the outset of trial that there was no evidence that he had caused any specific item to be mailed,as required by,and thus that count,accusing him of mail fraud,should be dismissed.the government presented evidence that stergios had opened four accounts with usaa between july,and august,while he was living in maine.upon opening those accounts,stergios had requested debit or atm cards for all four of the accounts,and usaa had mailed those cards to him.
gwendolyn westrup,a fraud investigator for usaa,testified that usaa has no branch offices and does business exclusively by mail,over the telephone,and online.she further testified that the bank practice is to send all debit and atm cards by mail.the government also presented evidence that stergios used the debit and atm cards to perpetrate his frauds,by checking his account balances,making charges,and withdrawing funds.stergios made all of the charges in places other than indiana the location from which usaa mailed the cards and texas where the bank is based,which the government argued was evidence that usaa must have mailed the cards to stergios.
after deliberating for two hours,the jury found stergios guilty as charged on counts,and.the following day,stergios pled guilty to count.
at sentencing,over stergios objection,judge singal included as relevant conduct an additional fraud detailed in stergios report of presentence investigation psi.according to the psi,on august,an applicant giving the name thomas brooks opened a usaa checking account over the phone.thomas brooks was the name stergios had used when committing his offenses.the applicant also provided an email address that stergios had used in opening one of the usaa accounts included in the indictment.on august,a million check originating from a td bank account in the name of goldmansager was mailed to thomas brooks usaa account.the same day,usaa received a million check made payable to stergios from the brooks account though the million check did not result in any actual loss,judge singal included it as intended loss in his offense calculation.
judge singal therefore found that stergios base offense level under the sentencing guidelines was,and that the loss amount of raised the offense level to.given that stergios had a criminal history category of iv,that resulted in a guideline range of to months.having considered the guidelines,judge singal gave them no controlling weight and sentenced stergios to three concurrent terms of months on counts through,to be served concurrently with a month sentence on count.in addition,judge singal imposed concurrent terms of five years of supervised release for counts and,to be served concurrently with three years of supervision on counts and.
judge singal also imposed two special conditions of supervised release to which stergios objected.special condition limited stergios use of computers and access to the internet special condition required stergios to participate in a computer and internet monitoring program,which included periodic unannounced inspections of his computer,storage media,and other electronic or devices by his probation officer,based upon a reasonable suspicion of contraband evidence or violation of supervision as the text of special condition made clear,the program could result in partial or full restriction of stergios internet usage.
ii.discussion 
stergios raises four issues on appeal.first,he argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that the banks he defrauded,mb t and usaa,were fdic insured.second,he argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that he caused the united states mails to be used in furtherance of his scheme to defraud.third,he argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing special conditions of release restricting his use of the internet.fourth,he argues that the district court erred by including the counterfeit million check in its calculation of stergios intended loss amount.
fdic insurance 
stergios first argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mb t and usaa were fdic insured,a jurisdictional prerequisite as well as a substantive element of bank fraud under.united states ayewoh,cir.we review the preserved portion of stergios challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo but consider that evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.id.
stergios contends that the bank representatives testimony,the fdic insurance certificates,and the accompanying affidavits from the fdic records custodian were inadequate to demonstrate fdic insurance at the time of his crimes in.previously,we have upheld against a challenge the testimony of a bank official,standing alone.see united states vachon,cir.we have also upheld evidence of an fdic certificate,authenticated by testimony from the bank records custodian.see ayewoh,at.as a general matter,we have found that with evidence of fdic insurance both at a time predating the offense and at the time of trial,a reasonable jury could infer that,absent evidence to the contrary,the bank was insured on the date of the crime.id.at.here,for each bank,the government presented the testimony of a bank official confirming that the bank was federally insured at the time of trial and an fdic certificate predating the offense,accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the fdic had no record of termination of the bank insurance that was ample evidence for the jury to conclude that mb t and usaa were fdic insured.see id.
stergios also raises two specific challenges to the evidence,neither of which was properly preserved at trial.we need not,however,analyze whether stergios has demonstrated plain error,see united states olano,because we find no merit to these challenges under any standard of review.first,stergios argues that,because she was not a bank manager,mb t customer service representative joan voyer did not have adequate personal knowledge of mb t fdic insurance but to establish fdic insurance,courts have tended to accept any bank employee testimony as sufficient,regardless of whether that employee was in a managerial position.ayewoh,at.second,stergios contends that the certificates and affidavits were insufficient to establish fdic insurance at the time of his offenses,because those documents merely certified that the banks had been insured prior to and that there was no evidence of termination of insurance.putting aside stergios failure to object to the certificates and affidavits at trial,we find that a reasonable jury could have inferred,from the certificates and affidavits alone or in combination with the bank representatives testimony,that the banks were fdic insured at the time of stergios crimes.see id.at 
use of the mails 
next,stergios argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he caused the united states mails to be used in furtherance of his scheme to defraud,as required by.again,we review this challenge de novo but consider the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution.ayewoh,at.
the elements of mail fraud are devising or attempting to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud knowing and willful participation in the scheme with the specific intent to defraud and the use of the united states mails in furtherance of that scheme.united states montminy,cir.the defendant need not personally mail anything so long as it is reasonably foreseeable that the mails will be used in the ordinary course of business to further the scheme.united states cacho bonilla,cir.only the third in furtherance at issue here.stergios argues that the mailing of usaa debit and atm cards was not an act in furtherance of his scheme to defraud usaa.
the courts have generously construed the furtherance requirement of the mail fraud statute.id.at.for that requirement to be met,the use of the mails need not be an essential element of the scheme but need only be incident to an essential part of the scheme or a step in the plot.schmuck united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
a reasonable jury could have found that standard easily satisfied here.the government presented evidence that stergios caused the mails to be used at least four times,when he requested and was mailed debit and atm cards from usaa.the usaa fraud investigator testified that usaa did business exclusively by mail and that the bank practice was to send atm and debit cards by mail.the government also presented evidence that stergios used the cards in furtherance of his scheme and made charges in places other than indiana the location from which usaa mailed the cards and texas where the bank is based.assessing that evidence,the jury could reasonably have concluded that usaa sent the cards to stergios by mail and that the cards were incident to an essential part of stergios scheme.id.at.without the atm and debit cards,stergios could not have made certain fraudulent charges or withdrawn funds that did not belong to him.
the special conditions 
stergios also questions the legality of two special conditions of release that the district court imposed at sentencing.we review a preserved challenge to a condition of release for abuse of discretion.united states perazza mercado,cir citing united states york,cir.
the statute that governs supervised release terms,provides discretion for sentencing courts to impose certain special conditions of release.in this case,the district court imposed two special conditions to which stergios objects.special condition limits stergios use of computers and access to the internet.special condition requires stergios to participate in a computer and internet monitoring program,which includes periodic unannounced inspections of his computer,storage media,and other electronic or devices by his probation officer based upon a reasonable suspicion of contraband evidence or violation of supervision.
to assess the validity of a condition of supervised release,we apply d and b,which require that special conditions cause no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to achieve the goals of supervised release,and that the conditions be reasonably related both to these goals and to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.perazza mercado,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted stergios argues that the district court imposed what amounts to a total ban on his internet usage both at home and at work,which is a greater deprivation than is necessary to achieve the goals of supervised release.stergios has,however,mischaracterized the special conditions.
special condition allows stergios to use a computer and access the internet,as long as he obtains his supervising officer approval.the condition is s ubject always to review by the sentencing judge upon request by either the defendant or the government.stergios argues that special condition might prevent him from using a telephone upon his release,because he believes telephones will all be connected to an internet service provider at that point.we choose not to speculate as to how technologies will develop in the years to come,nor are we convinced that stergios use of a telephone would fall within special condition prohibition on possess ing or us ing a computer to access an online computer service.should stergios find special condition unduly restrictive upon his release,he need only speak with his supervising officer and,if that does not succeed,raise the issue with the district court.
nor is special condition unduly restrictive,as defense counsel conceded at oral argument.that condition requires stergios to participate in the computer and internet monitoring program,as part of which he must submit to unannounced examinations of his computer and other electronic or devices when his probation officer has a reasonable suspicion of contraband evidence or that stergios has violated a condition of supervision.as we noted in united states sebastian,cir,i f the district court could not mandate compliance with the rules of the treatment program,the required participation would be ineffectual.
both special conditions are reasonably related to the goals of supervised release,to the nature and circumstances of the offense,and to the history and characteristics of the defendant.perazza mercado,at.stergios relied heavily on the internet to perpetrate his frauds,including opening two checking accounts online through usaa,opening another using an email address,and conducting a number of electronic money transfers.moreover,stergios had a history of using the internet to commit crimes.stergios conviction involved hundreds of fraudulent internet transactions on ebay,totaling over.it was therefore reasonable for the district court to f
