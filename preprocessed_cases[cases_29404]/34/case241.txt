ii.background 
a reasonable jury could have found the following from the evidence presented during valle.
valle worked at the puerto rico ports authority from june until her termination on july.valle testified that her wages plus fringe benefits during the year before she was terminated amounted to.valle was first diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs in,and first requested workplace accommodations that year she submitted a report from her physician that described her symptoms as typical of cfs,including insomnia that usually kept her from sleeping more than four hours a night,joint and muscle pain and weakness,and headaches,varying in severity over time.the physician suggested valle work schedule be adjusted to begin at,instead of the ports authority standard start time to accommodate the difficulty valle insomnia caused her in arriving at work on time.the internal evaluation process for valle request after valle objected to the specific psychiatrist the ports authority had suggested to evaluate her.
from may,to january,valle occupied trust positions within the agency human resources department,first as special assistant to the director of the ports authority,miguel soto lacourt,and then as chief of the human resources department while she also maintained her special assistant position.when she first became soto assistant in,soto allowed her to work on a flexible schedule as to her arrival and departure times each day,as long as she completed the requisite hours of work per week or accounted for any shortfall with vacation or sick leave.this arrangement,however,was never reduced to writing.
on january,valle returned to her previous career position,auxiliary chief of the human resources department.for the first few months after her return,her new supervisor accepted her flexible schedule.
on may,however,sara gregory was named the new chief of the human resources department,and became valle supervisor.valle testified that gregory first questioned valle flexible schedule two days later,on may,and valle responded by explaining her condition and that the ports authority had documentation of it dating to valle reasonable accommodation request.
shortly thereafter,valle testified,gregory began monitoring valle entry and exit times,and,even when valle had worked hours total in a week,gregory deducted from valle leave time any shortfall from hours on a given day.gregory had also sometimes deducted from valle accrued leave daily shortfalls that valle testified she had made up for by working through her lunch hour on the same day.gregory questioned or harassed valle about her work schedule p ractically every week,including by asking valle why she had arrived late on particular days long after valle had told gregory about the medical conditions that led to valle difficulties arriving at work by gregory sometimes required valle to obtain doctors notes documenting valle need for one or two sick days,even though agency policy required such notes only for absences of three days or more.gregory also sent valle memoranda reprimanding her for some of her her late arrivals,and stating that insomnia is not a justified reason for absence.valle testified that during the fifteen years she worked at the ports authority before gregory became her supervisor,she had never once been reprimanded for any reason.
valle also testified that gregory had taken away from valle several individual workspace features that had helped valle work around her cfs symptoms.unlike other employees,valle had a printer in her office so that she would not have to walk to retrieve printed documents.gregory had the printer removed from valle office on may,five days after she became valle supervisor.also unlike other employees,valle had an air conditioner in her office so that she could control her climate,since temperature sensitivity was another of her cfs symptoms.in june,gregory made valle switch offices with her,so that gregory could better supervise the human resources department staff,according to gregory.valle new office had no air conditioner until december,because gregory delayed the requisition,insisting that valle get medical certification of its necessity.the new office was farther from the restroom and photocopier than her previous office was,leading to relatively long walks that exhausted her.
according to valle testimony,her relationship with gregory dramatically worsened over time,and that worsening contributed to a decline in valle health.valle testified that gregory was skeptical that valle had a real medical condition and harassed valle about her attendance and accommodation requests in many ways,including by repeatedly insisting on receiving more documentation of valle health conditions,forcing valle to duplicate the ports authority electronic timekeeping system with manual timekeeping,and sending valle written reprimands criticizing her handling of her own workday schedule and workload.valle testified that the persistent and increasing stress and anxiety caused by this negative working relationship exacerbated her medical conditions,leading her doctor to prescribe periods of rest,which she took as two periods of extended medical leave from june to july and from october to november.she testified that the stressful work environment persisted it as if there is no way to satisfy gregory interrogations or her questionings no matter how much one would sit down and talk with her.she would go back to the same theme again.she would bring it up again.valle wrote to the director of the ports authority more than once describing gregory treatment of her,but felt that he was not responsive to her concerns.
upon her return to work on november,valle submitted a new formal request for reasonable accommodation and another medical report by her treating physician,hoping that a new report would satisfy gregory demands for documentation and lead to formal accommodations.the report,by the same physician as in,stated that valle had first been diagnosed with cfs in march,and that she also suffered from associated depression and chronic mononucleosis.the report described her symptoms,in terms consistent with the report,and recommended several workplace accommodations,including adjusting valle workday to begin flexibly between and,instead of the ports authority usual start time,as an accommodation for her insomnia 
the agency responded by requesting that valle submit information from her physician explaining how her medical conditions substantially limited her ability to work,which valle testified was contrary to the ports authority normal procedure of either granting a documented request or sending the employee for an independent examination.valle,part of whose job as auxiliary chief of human resources was to manage the reasonable accommodation process for other employees,testified that no other employee had been required to provide the level of documentation she was required to provide before being granted a flexible work schedule.after several letters were exchanged between valle and a member of the director staff related to valle insistence that she had provided sufficient documentation,a new acting director of the ports authority deferred to the staff member determination that more documentation should be required.
on january,gregory formally recommended that the director of the ports authority discipline valle for mishandling the reasonable accommodation request of another employee,gladys orengo.valle was formally reprimanded on march for this incident.
valle appealed the reprimand,attaching parts of orengo file in an effort to show that gregory herself and another employee,not valle,had been responsible for orengo accommodation request.valle and orengo both testified at trial that before she used the documents from orengo file for this purpose,she obtained orengo oral authorization to do so.valle also testified that in obtaining this authorization she was following the agency rule for use of employee medical files contained in a november memo from the agency legal advisor to gregory,which valle produced as an exhibit.
nearly a year after the reprimand,valle received a letter dated march,informing her of the agency intent to dismiss her for using orengo confidential information in her internal appeal.
valle was out on medical leave in from february to and again from july to october.shortly after her return in october,on october,she submitted another formal reasonable accommodation request in which her physician stated that she suffered from fibromyalgia and anxiety in addition to depression and cfs the physician noted that the stress valle complained of in her work environment had exacerbated her symptoms,including her sleep disorder.valle again requested flexibility in her daily start time,this time asking that she be allowed to arrive between and.she also asked for flexibility in her schedule to permit her to attend medical appointments,and for the other adjustments she had requested in her submission.
valle testified at length about other employees who asked for and were granted flexible schedules,including four in order to accommodate their children school and times.admittedly,each of their adjusted schedules set a specific entry time,rather than a range of times.valle also testified that one employee with a disability was granted a flexible schedule without having to go through the reasonable accommodation procedure,with entry between and,which valle viewed as similar to what she had requested.valle presented documentation of the approval of each of these requests from other employees.
five months passed with the agency taking no action on valle october request for reasonable accommodation.eventually,on march,after she had received the march,letter of intent to terminate,valle filed charges with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging discrimination and retaliation by the ports authority.the very next day,with no additional medical examination or administrative procedure,the director of the ports authority partly granted her accommodation request,fixing her work schedule from to.she was granted her request for a shorter lunch period,accompanied by two rest breaks during the day,as well as the requests she had made for temperature control and reduced walking distances.she was not granted any of the flexibility she had requested as to a range of entry times or the ability to work fewer hours one day by making the hours up during other days of the same week.
on april,valle received a second letter of intent to terminate,updated to charge valle with using an agency computer and agency supplies during work hours to write a letter to colleagues who had offered to donate to her a day of their accrued vacation to cover a garnishment of valle wages to pay a debt she owed to the agency.the letter informed the colleagues that the agency director would not allow the donation to take effect and so no leave had been deducted.valle testified that she wrote the letter because a colleague asked her whether the leave donation had been completed,though the agency april letter to valle said a letter had been sent to the employees just after the decision had been made.valle testified that other employees had used the same leave donation procedure in order to help charity drives for disaster relief and for a colleague whose house had burned down,and that the organizing employees had used ports authority computers and time to do so.she also testified that other employees had used agency computers during work time to send emails on personal matters such as a baby shower,an invitation to a political activity,holiday greetings,restaurant menus,religion,jokes,and parties,and she provided copies of such emails as exhibits.on,valle acknowledged that sending physical letters used more agency resources,but she emphasized that she had considered matters relating to her relationship with the agency as agency,not personal,matters.
three months later,on july,after an informal administrative hearing,valle was dismissed for using orengo personnel file in her administrative appeal and for using agency resources on what the agency characterized as a personal matter,the rejected leave donation.
at the close of valle at trial,in an oral ruling,the district court granted the ports authority rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law on all of valle claims.the court held that valle was not a qualified individual under the ada,because work attendance is an essential function of any job,see,and so valle extensive absences from work prevented her from fulfilling the essential functions of her job as required to qualify for protection under the ada.the court also held that since the accommodation valle requested was eventually granted,and t here nothing in the statute that says the accommodation has to be granted within a particular time period,there was no violation of the ada reasonable accommodation requirement.finally,the court also held that as a matter of law gregory questioning of valle time cards and memoranda to valle stating agency policy did not constitute harassment.
iii.analysis 
a.the ada framework 
the standards under the ada are by now familiar.the ada prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual because of the individual disability,a,a prohibition which includes any failure to make reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability,id.b a see also carroll xerox,cir.to make out a reasonable accommodation claim,valle must show that she suffers from a disability,as defined by the ada,that she is an otherwise qualified individual,meaning that she is nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without reasonable accommodation,and that the ports authority knew of her disability and did not reasonably accommodate it carroll,at see also defining qualified individual lessard osram sylvania,cir describing qualified.
on appeal,the ports authority does not dispute that a reasonable jury could conclude that valle suffers from a disability,but argues vigorously that no reasonable jury could,on valle evidence,have found that valle was a qualified individual or that she was denied reasonable accommodation 
the ada also prohibits retaliation against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by the ada.a.requesting an accommodation is protected conduct for purposes of the ada retaliation provision,freadman,at,as,of course,is complaining of discrimination on the basis of disability.
a plaintiff retaliation claim may succeed even where her disability claim fails.id.to establish a claim of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that she engaged in protected conduct,she suffered an adverse employment action,and there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.id.while termination of employment obviously is an adverse employment action,an environment of hostility and harassment may also suffice if it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,quoting rochon gonzales,see also billings town of grafton,cir of course,retaliatory actions that are not materially adverse when considered individually may collectively amount to a retaliatory hostile work environment.and very close temporal proximity between the protected action by the employee and the adverse employment action by the employer may give rise to an inference of causation.calero cerezo dep t of justice,cir.
evaluating valle ada claims 
on appeal,valle argues that the district court erred in holding as a matter of law that she had not met her burden of proving that she was qualified to perform her essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation.valle also argues that the district court erred in concluding that the agency had granted her reasonable accommodations,gregory treatment of valle did not constitute harassment,in the district court usage,there was no retaliation,and valle failed to present evidence as to her salary as required to support her law claims.
we agree with valle that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to the ports authority at the close of valle.it was not the role of the district court to consider the credibility of witnesses,resolve conflicts in testimony,or evaluate the weight of the evidence.andrade,at quoting wagenmann adams,cir internal quotation mark omitted.valle presented evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find each element of her claims in her favor,and so she was entitled to submit her case to the jury.we do not engage in a long discussion of the evidence,in light of the district court ruling,but we briefly address each of valle claims of error in turn.we do not suggest that a jury could not reach the same conclusion on the evidence that the district court did.we hold only that the decision belonged to the jury,not the judge 
we examine the second element valle must show to prove her reasonable accommodations case that despite her disability she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job,either with or without reasonable accommodation.tobin,at.the district court held that valle is not a qualified individual under the ada because she was absent six months in a month period from june,to october,and a n employee who does not come to work can not perform any function,not just the essential functions of her job.the district court relied on our opinion in rios jimenez principi,cir,for support.
in rios jimenez,we held that,a t the risk of stating the obvious,attendance is an essential function of any job.id.at see also waggoner olin,cir a n employee who does not come to work can not perform the essential functions of his job.quoting nowak rita high,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is a true statement of law.but it is not dispositive here,where the district court failed to consider the evidence valle had presented that the flexible work schedule she had requested as an accommodation would have enabled her to fulfill this essential function of attendance.
valle testified that she had never been reprimanded in relation to her attendance during the period from in which her supervisors had informally granted her a flexible schedule.she also testified that the stress of gregory repeated haranguing about valle attendance contributed to valle acute need to take extended medical leave,which in turn resulted in the long absences on which the district court based its ruling.significantly,there was expert testimony to support this contention.valle expert witness,a psychiatrist,testified similarly,and also testified that it caused valle a great deal of stress to go to work realizing that she was going to be late,which led to many of her absences.a reasonable jury crediting this testimony could conclude that valle had produced sufficient evidence that she was able to attend work regularly when granted the reasonable accommodation of a flexible schedule.
the ports authority claims that,starting in august,gregory informally allowed valle to enter work as late as,and that this accommodation continued until valle request was formally granted in march,in the form of a start time.this,the ports authority argues,means that there was never a time during which valle was not accommodated,rendering her reasonable accommodations claim moot.however,whether there was any such informal arrangement between gregory and valle is a disputed question of fact for the jury,as valle denied any such informal arrangement on.further,the letter from gregory to valle memorializing the purported arrangement was dated april,after the agency had begun efforts to terminate valle,after valle filed an administrative complaint against the agency,and seventeen months after valle first formal accommodations request.
the district court also concluded that valle had failed to prove that the ports authority knew of her disability and did not reasonably accommodate it.see carroll,at.the district court reasoned,without reference to any of the evidence valle had presented,that because the ports authority eventually granted valle a flexible schedule,and because the ada does not specify a time period within which employers must grant accommodations,the ports authority had not denied valle reasonable accommodations.
as valle argues,unreasonable delay may amount to a failure to provide reasonable accommodations.see,astralis condo.ass sec y,dep t of hous.urban,cir holding on petition for review of agency enforcement order for discrimination on the basis of disability that condominium association delay of more than a year in deciding on request for designated handicapped parking spaces constituted a denial of accommodation request calero cerezo,at a factfinder might well conclude that the defendants simply stonewalled going so far as to deny,in the face of substantial medical evidence,that plaintiff suffered a disability at all.so too may an employer failure to engage in an informal interactive process following an employee request.soto ocasio fed.express,cir quoting jacques clean up,cir see also o ada interpretive regulations.here,where valle testified to ways in which the ports authority did not follow its normal reasonable accommodations procedure in her case,where the agency delayed months after even the request,and where the rigid to schedule eventually granted was not what she sought and arguably did not reasonably accommodate valle condition,valle was entitled to present to a jury the question of whether the agency failed to grant her a reasonable accommodation 
the district court entered judgment dismissing valle retaliation claim as well.there were no written motions or memoranda on the ports authority oral motion for judgment as a matter of law,only oral argument on the morning of the eighth day of the jury trial,which reveals little discussion about the retaliation claim and its relation to valle substantive discrimination claim.the district court oral ruling on the defendant oral motion merely stated that the retaliation claim was dismissed,without explaining the grounds on which the ports authority was entitled to judgment on it as a matter of law.
the events of harassment to which valle testified could be considered by a reasonable jury to be either discrimination on the basis of valle disability or retaliation for her reasonable accommodations requests.a jury could at least,on the record so far,conclude that the termination of valle employment was an act of retaliation.a jury crediting valle evidence that she was singled out for punishment despite other employees use of agency resources for personal matters,and her evidence that she did not violate any agency policy in her handling of the files from gladys orengo reasonable accommodation case,cou
