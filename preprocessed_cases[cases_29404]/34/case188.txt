the book of isaiah speaks of a time when beauty will replace ashes.isaiah.apparently getting the prophecy backwards,defendant paul mare tried to burn down his beauty salon.a federal jury convicted mare of attempted arson,but he now claims that the district court erred in making two evidentiary rulings that prejudiced his defense at trial.concluding that the district court acted well within its discretion in making each ruling,we affirm.
a condensed version of the facts suffices.mare owned and operated a beauty salon in downtown boston.on may,the salon was lightly damaged by a fire that bore telltale signs of arson.investigators concluded that mare himself had set the fire in order to collect insurance proceeds,and he was eventually indicted for attempted arson,i,mail fraud,and use of fire to commit the mail fraud,h.
one of the pieces of evidence linking mare with the crime was a conversation he had with nelson correia,a former stylist at the salon.on various occasions in september,mare had confided in correia about his plan to set the fire and use the insurance money to pay for a move to new york city.at one point,correia expressed skepticism that mare was actually capable of doing such a thing.mare retorted that arson was in fact nothing new to him.he recounted how,in may of,he was responsible for another fire at the salon that had led to an insurance payout large enough to cover not only the cost of repairs,but also several other outstanding debts.on the prior occasion as well,he needed money,and solved the problem by setting a fire and collecting a check from the insurance company.so,mare indicated to correia,he was not only capable of,but successful at,using arson to his financial benefit.
after the government notified mare of its intent to introduce correia account at trial,mare moved the court to brand the testimony inadmissible under two separate provisions of the federal rules of evidence.he first alleged that the government wanted to introduce it only in order to demonstrate a propensity to commit bad acts,in violation of rule b.he also argued that evidence of a similar but uncharged crime would be unfairly prejudicial under rule.
the district court concluded that correia testimony concerning mare admissions would not offend either of these rules.the court did,however,attempt to limit the prejudice to mare by having the parties stipulate to the fact of the earlier fire and payment of insurance proceeds,rather than letting the government put on additional evidence corroborating correia restatement of mare admission that the other fire was actually arsonous.correia was then able to testify about his conversation with mare,with that stipulation as the only backdrop concerning the fire in.the court would later emphasize to the jury that i t is up to you to decide whether correia is credible t here is no other evidence in the record that the fire outside of salon mare was an arson by mare.
after correia provided his account,mare used his cross examination to attack correia credibility.on redirect examination,the government attempted to rehabilitate correia by asking him whether he had ever been asked to undergo a polygraph test.but before the prosecutor could utter any more than the syllables poly,mare alertly objected and proceeded to a conference at sidebar.the court admonished the prosecutor that polygraph evidence is inadmissible.the prosecutor explained that she had only planned to ask correia about his willingness to take the test,not the results of any test that may have occurred.explaining that even that much was inadmissible,the court sustained the objection.mare immediately moved for a mistrial.the district court denied the motion,but on the next day delivered a curative instruction to the jury that 
polygraph tests as a matter of law are not reliable as trial evidence.every court excludes them.and because they unreliable,i instruct you that neither nelson correia nor any other witness called by the government was given a polygraph test and therefore the credibility of nelson correia,as with every other witness,is solely and exclusively to be determined by you,the jury.
the jury ultimately found mare guilty of attempted arson,but acquitted him of mail fraud and,consequently,of use of fire to commit mail fraud.mare then lodged this appeal from the single guilty finding,insisting that the district court reversibly erred both in admitting correia testimony and in refusing to declare a mistrial following the polygraph inquiry.
we begin with the admission of correia testimony concerning the fire.mare offered two possible bases for excluding correia remarks rule b and rule.we review mare objections,as we generally do preserved evidentiary challenges,for abuse of discretion united states morales machuca,cir.
rule b provides in pertinent part that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.the district court initially suggested that correia testimony was admissible for several of rule b permissible purposes,but ultimately admitted the testimony for a different reason.the court held that the testimony concerned matters intrinsic to the crime charged and therefore did not trigger rule b limitation on the use of evidence of other crimes,wrongs or acts.see united states villarman oviedo,cir noting that where the challenged evidence is intrinsic to the crime charged in the indictment,rule b is really not implicated at all.the court theory was that relevant inferences could be drawn from mare account of his own state of mind,rather than from the fact of a prior bad act.in its written order,the court singled out mare fraudulent intent as one such inference it relied on our decision in united states fazal ur raheman fazal,cir,where we held that intrinsic evidence that would satisfy the charged crime specific intent element is not governed by rule b.
this was not an abuse of discretion.in the typical b scenario,the evidentiary focal point is the existence of some bad conduct other than the charged offense.the concern is that,upon learning of that prior conduct,the jury might think worse of the defendant character out of some rel iance on the aphorism once a criminal,always a criminal.united states rubio estrada,cir torruella,dissenting.here,by contrast,the focal point was the defendant own statement concerning the charged offense itself i am going to do it the way i did it the last time.the fact that mare identified his plot with the uncharged offense sheds relevant light on his mindset in committing the charged offense.for example,as the district court suggested,it supported the government case that he specifically intended to commit the charged arson in order to defraud,an element of the mail fraud statute under which he was charged.see.that reasoning does not depend on an inference regarding mare character for acting in conformity with a prior bad act.indeed,it does not even depend on mare having actually committed the prior bad act at all.it depends only on mare having made the statement.reasonable jurors could have made pertinent inferences based solely on mare bark,regardless of whether they believed that he had ever previously backed it up with his bite.mare words were therefore relevant for a reason other than,to borrow a familiar phrase from another evidentiary canon,the truth of the matter asserted.
that leaves rule as the remaining sentinel guarding admissibility.rule provides in pertinent part that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.the balancing act that the rule demands is a quintessentially enterprise,and the trial judge is in the best position to make such factbound assessments.udemba nicoli,cir.for that reason,o nly rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing
