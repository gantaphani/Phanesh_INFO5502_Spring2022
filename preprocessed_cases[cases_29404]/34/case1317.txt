opinion of the court 
carol anne bond pled guilty to two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon,and two counts of mail theft,in connection with her efforts to harm a former friend.she now appeals the district court pretrial order denying her motions to dismiss the charges against her and to suppress evidence.she also challenges her sentence.for the reasons that follow,we affirm each of the court actions.
factual and procedural background 
bond was excited when her closest friend,myrlinda haynes,announced that she was pregnant.bond excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband,clifford bond,was the child father.she vowed revenge.
planning to poison haynes,bond a trained microbiologist stole a quantity of from her employer,the chemical manufacturer rohm and haas,and ordered over the internet a vial of potassium dichromate.these chemicals have the rare ability to cause toxic harm to individuals through minimal topical contact 
bond attempted to poison haynes with the chemicals at least times over the course of several months.she often would spread them on haynes home doorknob,car door handles,and mailbox.haynes noticed the chemicals and usually avoided harm,but on one occasion sustained a chemical burn to her thumb.
haynes called her local police about the chemical attacks.they suggested that the substance might be cocaine and told haynes to clean her car and door handles on a regular basis.unsatisfied to say the least with this response,haynes complained to her local postal carriers about the chemicals on her mailbox.they referred the matter to the united states postal inspection service.
based on haynes complaint,postal inspectors placed surveillance cameras in and around haynes home.these cameras captured bond opening haynes mailbox,stealing a business envelope,and placing potassium dichromate inside haynes car muffler.they specifically showed bond going back and forth between her car and haynes with the chemicals.
after testing the chemicals that bond placed in haynes muffler,postal inspectors attempted to trace their origin to the rohm and haas center where bond worked as a technical assistant.the inspectors determined that nearly four pounds of potassium dichromate were missing from a common storage area to which bond had access.
with this information,the inspectors sought and received an arrest warrant for bond and search warrants for her car and home.they supported their warrant requests with an affidavit detailing the gathered evidence,including the videotaped footage,results of the chemical analyses,and the report of the missing chemicals.the affidavit also explained bond responsibilities at rohm and haas,described her car and home,and noted that haynes had identified bond from a photo array.
postal inspectors arrested bond and took her to a holding cell in the philadelphia post office.once there,bond acknowledged and waived her constitutional rights,and admitted to taking the chemicals from rohm and haas.meanwhile,other inspectors executed the search warrants,finding a piece of haynes mail and amounts of the chemicals in bond home and car.
a grand jury in the eastern district of pennsylvania charged bond with two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon,in violation of a,a criminal statute implementing the treaty obligations of the united states under the chemical weapons convention.the grand jury also charged bond with two counts of mail theft,in violation of.
bond moved to suppress certain evidence and to dismiss the two chemical weapons charges.she claimed that the affidavits supporting the search warrants failed to establish probable cause to search her home and car,and she argued that is unconstitutional because it violates principles of federalism embodied in our constitution and the fair notice requirements of its due process clause.
the district court denied bond motions.it ruled that did not impinge on principles of federalism because it was enacted by congress and signed by the president under the necessary and proper clause of the constitution to comply with the provisions of a treaty.app.the court next concluded that the statute is not vague,because it is clear that if anybody uses a toxic chemical for other than peaceful purposes,th at person can be prosecuted.id.at.it ruled as well that the search warrants were properly issued,because sufficient evidence existed to permit a probable cause conclusion that a substantial amount of potassium dichromate would probably be found in bond vehicle or where she lived.id.at.
following the court denial of her motions,bond pled guilty to all charges,reserving her right to appeal.the court then held a sentencing hearing at which it enhanced bond total offense level by two levels based on a determination under that she used a special skill in the commission or her offense.the court ultimately sentenced bond to six years imprisonment,five years of supervised release,a fine,and restitution of.bond appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under and.
we review de novo a challenge to the constitutionality of a criminal statute.see de ashcroft,cir.we consider denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying factual findings and exercise plenary review of the district court application of the law to those facts.united states perez,cir.we likewise review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and consider its related findings of fact for clear error.see united states wood,cir.
iii.discussion 
bond claims that is unconstitutional,the search warrants for her home and car were invalid,and her conduct did not justify a sentence enhancement for using a special skill in the commission of a crime.we reject each of these claims.
constitutionality of 
the united states,along with many other nations,signed the chemical weapons convention in to ensure the complete and effective prohibition of the development,production,acquisition,stockpiling,retention,transfer and use of chemical weapons.this treaty states,among other things,that each signing nation shall,in accordance with its constitutional process,adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations under this convention.id.at.it specifically requires a complying nation to p rohibit natural and legal persons anywhere on its territory from undertaking any activity prohibited under this convention,including enacting penal legislation with respect to such activity.id.
the united states fulfilled its responsibilities under the treaty through the chemical weapons convention implementation act of,and the act associated penal provision.in relevant part,reads 
a unlawful as provided in subsection b,it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly 
to develop,produce,otherwise acquire,transfer directly or indirectly,receive,stockpile,retain,own,possess,or use,or threaten to use,any chemical weapon or 
to assist or induce,in any way,any person to violate paragraph,or to attempt to conspire to violate paragraph.
a.chemical weapon is defined as a toxic chemical and its precursors,except where intended for a purpose not prohibited under this chapter as long as the type and quantity is consistent with such a purpose.id.at a.toxic chemical is defined in part as any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death,temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals.id.at a.importantly,neither has a requisite federal interest element,a requirement that an offender conduct affect interstate commerce or a federal person,possession,or interest nor states a basis for its enactment beyond the chemical weapons convention,it does not assert authority under the commerce clause or other constitutional provision.
based on this framework,bond asserts that violates constitutional principles of federalism because it is not based on a valid exercise of constitutional authority,and does not require proof of a federal interest.bond br.at.she also claims that the provision is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad by virtue of its enormous scope and its failure to provide fair notice of the conduct covered by its terms.id.at.
federalism challenge 
under our federal system,the administration of criminal justice rests with the states except as congress,acting within the scope of its delegated powers,has created offenses against the united states.screws united states.bond contends that,by permitting prosecution of localized offenses without regard to the federalism boundaries enshrined in the constitution,signals a massive and unjustifiable expansion of federal law enforcement into the domain.bond br.at.specifically,she argues that because the statute brings citizens into the federal criminal area for conduct not properly the subject of federal prosecutors,id.at,and because it significantly restrike s the delicate balance between the federal and state governments,it violates the unique system of federalism protected by the tenth amendment to the constitution id.
the government responds that the tenth amendment is no impediment to the operation of because congress had authority to enact it under the necessary and proper clause of the constitution as a law enforcing its treaty power relying on missouri holland,the government asserts that need not be authorized by a specific power given to congress,nor contain a requisite federal interest element,because the chemical weapons convention is a valid treaty and i f a treaty is valid there can be no dispute about the validity of the statute implementing it under article i,as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers of the government.gov t br.at quoting united states lue,cir.the government highlights as well the declaration in holland that i t is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could.at.see also united states lara,d.thus,states the government,even if were otherwise prohibited legislation under the tenth amendment,the treaty power invest ed congress with independent authority to pass it.gov t br.at.
these arguments appear to present issues of first impression in our court.they raise questions about what constitutional authority legislation must cite,and how far such legislation may reach into an area over which s tates possess primary authority.brecht abrahamson,d.the arguments also ask us to wade into the debate over the scope and persuasiveness of the decision in holland.compare united states ferreira,cir applying holland to hold that because congress authority under the necessary and proper clause extends beyond those powers specifically enumerated in article i,section,it may enact laws necessary to effectuate the treaty power internal quotations omitted,and lue,at same,with oneida indian nation of new york new york,cir remarking that,despite holland,the ability of the treaty power to override state prerogatives is uncertain 
but before we can reach the merits of these arguments,we must ensure that bond has standing to raise a tenth amendment challenge to.see steel citizens for a better env t,d requiring that courts decide jurisdictional issues before considering the merits of a claim.because this inquiry implicates our jurisdiction,we conduct it even though the parties did not address it in their initial briefs.see donovan punxsutawney area sch,cir 
in tennessee electric power tennessee valley authority,utility companies chartered in tennessee argued that the sale of electrical power by the federally chartered tennessee valley authority was an impermissible federal regulation of a local matter in violation of the tenth amendment.the supreme court rejected this argument,concluding that the private companies lacked standing to maintain their claim 
the sale of government property in competition with others is not a violation of the tenth amendment.as we have seen,there is no objection to the authority operations by the states,and,if this were not so,the utility companies,absent the states or their officers,have no standing in this suit to raise any question under the tenth a mendment.
despite this explicit holding,courts of appeals are split on whether private parties have standing to challenge a federal act on the basis of the tenth amendment.two circuit courts have allowed private parties to bring such challenges.see gillespie city of indianapolis,cir,cert.denied,d atlanta gas light dep t of energy,cir five have not.see united states hacker,cir oregon legal servs,cir brooklyn legal servs.legal servs,cir,cert.denied,d medeiros vincent,cir,cert.denied,d united states parker,cir,cert.denied,d.
the seventh circuit court stated most clearly the rationale for permitting private parties,notwithstanding tennessee electric,to raise tenth amendment concerns absent the involvement of a state.deciding that a state police officer had standing independently to maintain a tenth amendment claim against a federal gun regulation,the court emphasized that standing barriers have been substantially lowered in the decades since the supreme court decided tennessee electric.gillespie,at.it further explained that new york united states,d,cabined the holding of tennessee electric by establishing that,in making tenth amendment claims,an individual actually is asserting his own rights.gillespie,at.the court based this explanation on the supreme court statement in new york that the constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals,at,which convinced the seventh circuit panel that the tenth amendment,although nominally protecting state sovereignty,ultimately secures the rights of individuals.gillespie,at.
contrary to this reasoning,the five circuit courts to reject independent private party standing for tenth amendment claims have focused on the continuing authority of tennessee electric.see,oregon,at brooklyn legal servs,at.noting that the supreme court decisions remain binding precedent until it see s fit to reconsider them,hacker,at quoting hohn united states,d,these courts have ruled that tennessee electric denies private plaintiffs standing for tenth amendment claims because there exists no directly contradictory authority from the supreme court.id.at.the courts also point to varying prudential considerations to support their determinations.see,id.at suggesting that the holding of tennessee electric comports with prudential standing principles that generally limit a plaintiff to asserting his own rights medeiros,at hesitating to disregard tennessee electric because doing so might induce a substantial increase in litigation before the federal courts.
we are persuaded by the reasoning advanced by the majority of our sister courts and conclude that a private party lacks standing to claim that the federal government is impinging on state sovereignty in violation of the tenth amendment,absent the involvement of a state or its officers as a party or parties.if a precedent of the supreme court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to the supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.rodriguez de quijas shearson,d.the holding of tennessee electric thus is binding irrespective of the language in new york about federalism protection of individuals.see medeiros,at noting also that new york never actually dealt with the question of standing.moreover,the fact that the supreme court in this decade granted certiorari on,but later declined to answer,the question of whether private plaintiffs have standing to assert states rights under the tenth amendment,pierce county,washington guillen,d,does no more than indicate an interest of at least four justices in tennessee electric binding status.
our interpretation makes it evident that bond lacks standing to pursue her tenth amendment challenge to.the requisite representation by the states or their officers is notably absent from her suit,brooklyn legal servs,at,and she does not even attempt to argue that her interests are aligned with those of a state.parker,at speculating that a private party could assert a tenth a
