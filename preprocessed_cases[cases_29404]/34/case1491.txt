opinion of the court 
nicholas albert appeals from the judgment of sentence entered after his conviction of first degree felony murder and other related offenses.albert argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted a videotape of the crime scene which included graphic views of the victim.
after viewing the videotape in its entirety,we conclude that the territorial court properly ruled that the probative value of the crime scene videotape outweighed its prejudicial impact.albert defense to the first degree murder charge was that he was not involved in the murder.the videotaped evidence is to the contrary.despite its gruesome depictions,its admission was not an abuse of discretion.in addition,assuming the videotape was cumulative of crime scene photos also admitted into evidence,given the other evidence of albert guilt,we find that its admission was harmless error.we will,therefore,affirm.
on november,barbara cromwell arrived at her family vacation condominium on croix.cromwell was president of the board of directors of the condominium complex and had come to croix to start negotiations with an insurance company and local contractors to reconstruct the premises after extensive damage caused by a hurricane.john reichert,the owner of another unit and a friend of cromwell,also traveled to croix to participate in the discussions.
on november,reichert and cromwell saw a little guy on the premises of the complex looking through an open door of cromwell unit and lurking around the condominium property.reichert told the young man to leave.a little later,reichert and cromwell discovered three young men inside one of the condominium units and called the police.one young man ran away.the second,identified as the defendant,old nicholas albert,picked up a rock and threatened reichert.the third man,later identified as johnny kidd,the little guy previously sighted on the property,left the area and walked down to the beach followed by albert.
reichert and cromwell spent the evening of november at cromwell condo,reviewing insurance papers.reichert left about shortly thereafter,kidd and albert crept into cromwell unit.the pair searched the apartment and took five to six hundred dollars from cromwell purse.they proceeded to rifle through dressers,a suitcase and a storeroom.
kidd and albert then moved into the bedroom where cromwell was sleeping.kidd took a lighter and started flashing it over cromwell face.she woke up screaming.what happened next was the source of differing testimony at trial.according to albert,kidd determined that cromwell should be tied up.albert testified that he picked up a pair of white shoes,took the shoelaces out and he and kidd each tied one of her hands to the bed.after cromwell was tied,albert went through the dressers in the bedrooms.he then left the room and found a set of keys.he went back into the room and asked cromwell to point out which key opened the outside gate.albert left to unlock the gate,returned and removed a television,vcr and stereo from the unit.he testified that kidd then walked out of the bedroom and said she dead,you know.albert saw blood on the wall,left the condominium and loaded cromwell car with the fruits of the robbery.
the government version of events differs.the prosecution theorized that when cromwell woke up and screamed,one of the intruders slashed at her with a knife while the other blocked her escape by hitting her with a blunt object.under the government scenario,while cromwell attempted to fight off her attackers,she was overcome by a knife stab to her throat,cutting the jugular vein and severing her windpipe back to the neck bone according to the government,it was after cromwell death that kidd and albert tied her to the bed,jammed a washcloth into her mouth,taped her face,spread her legs open to expose her genitalia and tossed a pornographic video onto the bed,attempting to stage a sex crime which could deflect suspicion away from them.
an anonymous tip led to the arrest of kidd and albert.albert turned himself in to the police,admitted committing the burglary with kidd,but blamed the murder solely on kidd.when arrested,kidd admitted,i did it.i was the one.i cut her.he did not name an accomplice 
albert was charged with first degree premeditated murder,first degree felony murder,burglary,burglary with intent to commit assault,conspiracy to commit burglary,kidnaping and conspiracy to commit kidnaping.at trial,the government,over objection by the defense,introduced a videotape of the crime scene which included a detailed look at cromwell partially naked body tied to the bed with the neck wound revealed.albert was found guilty on all charges except premeditated murder.
on december,the old albert was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of probation or parole on the felony murder count,plus years to be served consecutively on the remaining counts.a notice of appeal to the appellate division of the united states district court of the virgin islands was filed.on the issue relevant here,the appellate division found that albert did not properly object to the admission of the videotape of the crime scene therefore,the territorial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing it to be played to the jury.
albert filed a notice of appeal to our court on march,beyond the limit set forth in.b.defense counsel,a novice in criminal matters,mistakenly believed and informed albert that the appeal from the appellate division judgment had to be filed within,not,days.when albert was notified that the appeal faced possible dismissal due to the jurisdictional defect,he filed a motion for an extension of time to file the appeal on the grounds of excusable neglect.the district court of the virgin islands granted the motion.
the government filed an appeal from the award of the time extension arguing that ignorance of the rules does not constitute excusable neglect.at oral argument,however,the government conceded that caselaw could be interpreted to allow the present appeal to proceed.the government,therefore,abandoned its jurisdictional challenge.
we agree that authority exists for the viability of this appeal.see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs.partnership,d interpreting analogous bankruptcy rule united states clark,cir united states hooper,cir.but see amatangelo borough of donora,cir discussion of frap a a.
our jurisdiction rests upon.
the appeal presents a singular issue did the trial court err in allowing a videotape of the crime scene into evidence because its probative worth was outweighed by its prejudicial impact we review this ruling under an abuse of discretion standard,united states balter,cir,and will affirm the trial court determination unless it acted arbitrarily or irrationally.united states universal rehabilitation,cir i f judicial restraint is ever desirable,it is when a rule analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.united states scarfo,cir quoting united states long,cir.
after cromwell body was discovered,a forensic investigator took photographs,videotaped the scene and collected evidence.the government sought admission of the videotape into evidence.defense counsel filed a motion in limine to preclude its admission on the grounds that it was narrated and because its prejudicial nature outweighed its usefulness.in defense counsel words 
some of the shots are close ups of the neck area,showing the cut.it awful.it not necessary.a lot of what the video tends to portray is an issue.i can only surmise that the government is using the video to instill horror,to instill punishment,the element of punishment.
they have other ways of presenting the scene to a lay jury.it my understanding that the government has two dozen photographs,still photographs,which show the items that they claim are important.
so it not just unduly prejudicial,its cumulative.indeed,for us to sit and watch the video and then turn around and have to watch the still photos is a waste of time.you have a waste of time element.
the government,for its part,did not present a detailed argument for the videotape admission.its position was that the t
