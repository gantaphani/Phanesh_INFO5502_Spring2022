respondents hans walker and new york attorney general eliot spitzer collectively,the state appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge granting petitioner hoi man yung a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the district court concluded that the state trial court decision to close the courtroom to certain of yung relatives constituted an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent and the state was not entitled to a nieblas hearing.see nieblas smith,cir 
we agree with the district court conclusion that the state court did not make findings adequate to support the exclusion of each of yung three female relatives from the courtroom.we nonetheless part ways with the district court in that we stop short of concluding that there was a constitutional violation.instead,we hold that the district court exceeded the permissible bounds of its discretion in granting the petition without affording the state courts an opportunity to make additional findings and to conduct an evidentiary hearing to permit the parties to present additional evidence concerning the justification for the closure.we vacate and remand the judgment below so that the state court can do so 
the hinton hearing and the trial 
we assume familiarity with the prior opinions in this case we briefly summarize only those points salient to this appeal.
in,a new york state jury convicted yung of two counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree,nine counts of criminal sale of a firearm in the third degree,five counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,and three counts of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.yung is serving a to life sentence for these crimes.
an undercover police officer who testified for almost two of the four days of the trial was a key witness in the prosecution case.before the officer testified,the prosecution requested that the courtroom be sealed during his testimony.the trial court held a hearing pursuant to people hinton.
during the hinton hearing,the officer testified that he would fear for his safety if the courtroom were not closed during his testimony.in his nine years as an undercover officer,he had testified approximately forty times.in recent years,he said,he always had testified in a closed courtroom.
the officer testified that he had two pending investigations in the neighborhood in which yung had operated.he testified that he had been threatened by individuals who knew yung and yung brother,david,who had been arrested on similar charges.on cross examination,the officer conceded that the individuals who threatened him were not related to yung.in addition,he said that the last threat occurred nine months prior to trial,was not connected to yung trial,and was made by a person who was on trial in an unrelated matter.the officer never had been threatened by a member of yung family.
when asked by defense counsel whether he had any reason to fear any member of yung family other than yung brother david,the officer responded that he could not answer the question but that he had fears concerning a nyone who is involved in the current investigations,anyone who is affiliated with the individual who knows your client.
during the argument at the close of the hearing,defense counsel asked the court to exempt yung mother,ha chung yuk the mother of yung child,beverly soto and yung,theresa soto,from any closure order.defense counsel argued that courts have said even if closure should be allowed it should be limited to what necessary.yung three female relatives,defense counsel reasoned,should not be excluded because they have nothing to do with this case or any investigation whatsoever.
the prosecution objected,arguing that i t is speculation to suggest that the defendant family members will come in here and not report to the defendant brother david yung or to any of the other people with whom this defendant is associated who the undercover is,describe him and things of that nature.the prosecution emphasized that yung and his brother had been affiliated with violent criminal organizations and that officers had found holsters and bullet proof vests in yung apartment.
the hearing court noted that the three women were connected at least to david yung,who allegedly had participated in the same criminal activities as yung and was not incarcerated.it then closed the courtroom to them as well as to the general public.the court found 
i am closing the courtroom because this is an undercover police officer who is currently working in an undercover capacity.he is working in the same general area in his undercover capacity,namely the lower east side.he has open and pending cases with unapprehended suspects.he has been threatened in the past,i find that,by people connected with the defendant.to allow family members into the courtroom can jeopardize the safety,the life safety and security of this officer by making it easier for those who the defendant is associated with on the outside to identify him,thereby placing him in great risk for his life.
yung later testified at his trial.he admitted his involvement in the sales of drugs and guns for which he was charged,but insisted that he was entrapped into doing so.yung conceded,however,that he had lived a life of crime between and.during that time,he intermittently was involved in dealing drugs and guns.he testified that he had been arrested in may in connection with those activities,convicted of a federal drug felony in,and released in may.he testified also that police raided the apartment he lived in numerous times in,that during at least one such raid the police had found bullet proof vests and holsters,and that his brother david had kept guns in the apartment.
but,according to yung,his life turned a corner following his release from prison.he testified that he worked legitimate jobs,first as a bus boy from september through june,and then as a construction worker from june through july or august.he stated that immediately following his release from prison he participated in a drug treatment program that included counseling,drug testing,and weekly meetings.he testified that he successfully completed the program in april.
following his release from prison in,yung lived with his parents and his brother david in the same apartment he had lived in prior to his arrest,and he continued to live there up until his arrest in this case.his girlfriend,beverly soto,and their child,born in march,also lived in the apartment for at least part of that time,although the record does not indicate exactly when.
according to yung,his life stopped in june.he testified that he sold drugs and guns between june through august,but insisted that he did so only because a police informant threatened to have his parole violated if he did not participate.
yung testified that he gave approximately of crime proceeds to his family.the record does not reflect which family members received the money or whether they knew that the funds were obtained illegally.
although the record is not entirely clear on this point,it may be the case that yung did not keep contraband in the apartment in because police had raided it in.there is also some indication that yung may have avoided using the phone in his apartment to conduct his illegal activities,as he knew the police had tapped it in.
subsequent history 
yung appealed his conviction to the appellate division,first department,arguing mainly that the state exclusion of his family from the courtroom violated his right to a public trial under the sixth amendment and under new york law.the appellate division nonetheless affirmed,finding that the state court properly had closed the courtroom based on the officer testimony establishing particularized reasons for concern that defendant relatives posed a threat to his safety by revealing his identity.people yung,dep t.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.see people hoi man yung.
on february,after having exhausted his state remedies,yung filed the petition that is the subject of this appeal.he claimed that the closure of the courtroom to his family members violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial.
the district court examined the record of the hinton hearing to determine if the closure complied with waller georgia,d,which allows a court to close a courtroom only if 
the party seeking to close the hearing advance s an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,the closure is no broader than necessary to protect that interest,the trial court consider s reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,and i t make s findings adequate to support the closure.
waller,at.the judge below determined that the closure did not satisfy the second prong of waller because it was overly broad with respect to yung three female relatives.yung,d at.in doing so,he cited our decision in vidal williams,cir,which held that an order excluding family members was not appropriate where the prosecutor failed to show that the excluded family members likely would encounter the undercover officer during his operations or that they would be inclined to harm the officer.yung,d at.the district court found that the prosecution had shown neither.id.at.it held,moreover,that the state court had not satisfied the fourth prong of waller in that it did not make findings sufficient to justify the closure.id.at.it therefore granted the writ and remanded the case to the state court with instructions to release yung unless he is retried within a reasonable time.id.at.
the state appealed,arguing that the district court had erred by failing to presume the correctness of the state court finding that yung family members posed a danger to the undercover officer,and conduct an evidentiary hearing pursuant to nieblas smith,cir.in yung i,we vacated the judgment because the district court had relied upon vidal instead of supreme court precedent in determining that the courtroom closure was improper.at.we explained that the precise showing outlined in vidal was not necessarily mandated by clearly established supreme court precedent.id.we could not determine with confidence whether the district court would have reached the same result if it had applied the more general teachings of waller and in re oliver,rather than the specific language of vidal.id.
after concluding that the precise showing in vidal was not necessarily mandated by clearly established supreme court law,we nevertheless held that supreme court precedent requires a heightened showing to justify exclusion of family members.we wrote 
although the portion of in re oliver that specifically refers to family members is dicta,we believe that waller second the closure be no broader than required to protect the overriding interest at an examination not just of the length of the closure but also of the portion of the public to be excluded.in light of in re oliver,it would be an unreasonable interpretation of waller or,at a minimum,an unreasonable failure to extend waller,not to require a heightened showing before excluding family members.
we held also that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a nieblas hearing,as the state had not requested one.id.at.we suggested,however,that the district court might find it advisable to conduct a supplementary hearing or to remand to the state trial court for such a hearing.id.
we therefore remanded to the district court to reassess the reasonableness of the courtroom closure under supreme court precedent and,in its discretion,to conduct a nieblas hearing or to remand to the state court for a further hinton hearing.id.at.
on remand,the district court again granted the writ.yung,wl,at.it determined that only the fourth waller the court findings were adequate to support the at issue in this case.id.at.it then applied the heightened standard set forth in our original opinion.id.at.the district court concluded 
t he question before this court is whether the presumptively correct factual finding that the presence of family members would make it easier for others to identify the undercover is sufficient to justify closing the courtroom to the three female relatives.while this justification is sufficient to justify closure to the public at large,it does not meet the heightened showing for family members as required by in re oliver and waller.
the district court again declined to hold a nieblas hearing.id.at.it rejected the state contention that a change in the case law had occurred between the state trial court ruling and the filing of the habeas petition such that the state court failure to conduct a more extensive hinton hearing was excusable.id.the court explained if a state adjudication is contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,it can not also be said that a change of law has occurred between the adjudication and the filing of the petition such that the state court would have behaved differently.id.quoting d.in any event,the court concluded,people nieves,the intervening case relied upon by the state as having changed the governing law,had not so drastically changed or even clarified the law of closure,since,at the time of the state court adjudication,it was already the law that the closure of courtrooms to family members required heightened scrutiny.yung,wl,at.
yung i is amended 
shortly after the district court issued yung i,a different panel of this court decided sevencan herbert,cir sevencan i,holding that the heightened showing requirement of yung i is satisfied where the record reflects that the state trial court considered the familial relationship at the time the family member was excluded.id.at.it held also that yung i did not place an additional burden on the prosecution whenever a family member is excluded because to do so would alter the waller standard in violation of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.id.at emphasis in original.
turning to the facts of the case before it,the sevencan panel held that the state court decision to exclude the defendant wife from the courtroom during the testimony of an undercover officer was not an unreasonable application of supreme court law because the state court was aware of the familial relationship between the defendant and his wife before making its decision.id.at.
the panel decision in sevencan i was in some tension with this panel decision in yung subsequently,both panels filed amended opinions.see yung ii,at sevencan herbert,cir sevencan ii.in each instance,only the analysis,not the dispositions,changed.see yung ii,at compare sevencan i,at with sevencan ii,at.
in yung ii,we described the standard for excluding family members from a courtroom during a criminal trial without characterizing it as a heightened standard.we said 
waller second the closure be no broader than required to protect the overriding interest at applies to both the duration of the closure and to the portion of the public to be excluded.thus,waller prevents a court from denying a family member request to be exempted from a courtroom closure order unless the court is convinced that the exclusion of that particular relative is necessary to protect the overriding interest at stake.indeed,it would be an unreasonable interpretation of waller for a court to deny such a request if the exclusion of that particular relative,under the specific circumstances at issue,is not necessary to promote the overriding interest.
the amended sevencan opinion applied this holding to the facts of that case.sevencan ii,at.it considered more than the state court awareness of the familial relationship in determining whether the closure was necessary to protect the overriding interest.it noted,for example,that the defendant and his associates were highly dangerous,that the undercover officer conducted operations in the neighborhood where defendant wife lived,that the defendant wife was a timid,pliable woman likely to be susceptible to requests from her husband associates,and that the defendant wife was knowledgeable about her husband illegal activities.id.at alteration in original.
as we noted,the district court did not have the benefit of yung ii and sevencan ii.
the state now argues that the district court erred in holding
