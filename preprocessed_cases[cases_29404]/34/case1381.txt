a jury convicted kelvin ford of participating in the robbery of two new jersey banks on june,and june.the district court sentenced him to months of incarceration for these offenses.he now appeals two issues relating to his conviction and sentence first,ford asserts that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the testimony of the government shoeprint expert.second,ford challenges the application of the career offender provision in united states sentencing guideline a.
according to the evidence established at ford trial,on june,ford,donald johnson,and christopher howard robbed the fleet bank in mays landing,new jersey,stealing.on june,the trio robbed the commerce bank in somers point,new jersey,absconding with.the government presented evidence that during the fleet bank robbery,howard cased the bank,and ford and johnson committed the robbery and then fled to a getaway car driven by howard.the robbery of the commerce bank was executed in a similar fashion,except that howard only cased the bank,johnson alone committed the robbery,and ford drove the getaway car.there is no dispute that as johnson fled the commerce bank,ford,who was driving out of a fast food restaurant,stopped to pick him up.before ford was able to collect johnson,however,he hit another vehicle whose driver was able to identify ford automobile.ford car was later spotted by a police officer in egg harbor township as it pulled into a car dealership parking lot.ford and johnson left the vehicle and fled on foot.while they hid,ford used his cell phone to contact howard.ford and johnson were seen running through a wooded area,and police pursued them,apprehending both.a search of ford revealed that he had in cash.the police recovered from johnson.the currency stolen from the fleet bank branch was not recovered.
in addition to the testimony of johnson and howard that ford had been involved in the fleet bank robbery,the government presented evidence that three partial shoeprints lifted from the counter in the bank were similar to the type of imprints that would be made by the shoes that ford was wearing when he was apprehended.the jury convicted ford of both bank robberies.
at sentencing,the government sought the application of the career offender provision to ford on the basis of two prior convictions for crimes of violence.one of those crimes was an escape he attempted while incarcerated at lorton reformatory in virginia.the district court found ford escape to be a crime of violence and agreed with the computation of his criminal history category as a vi under the guidelines.
we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.joiner,d calhoun yamaha motor,cir united states sokolow,cir.ford argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony of government expert eric gilkerson regarding the shoeprint because the testimony failed to meet the standard for admissibility prescribed in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d and federal rule of evidence ford asserts that because gilkerson could not provide a more conclusive opinion regarding the likelihood that the shoeprint on the bank counter was left by the soles of ford shoes than mere similarity between the prints and ford shoes,the testimony lacked probative value and should have been excluded under federal rule of evidence.ford contentions find no support in settled principles of evidence law.
gilkerson was permitted to testify that the characteristics of ford shoes put them in the class of shoes that could have made the impression on the counter.before admitting gilkerson testimony,the district court conducted a daubert hearing.the two fundamental requirements of daubert are reliability and relevance.at.the second requirement should be evaluated under the standard expressed in rule.see,united states,cir what rule does require is that the district court make initial determinations that the proffered evidence possesses sufficient evidentiary reliability to be admissible as scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge and that the proffered evidence is relevant in the sense that it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.emphasis added amorgianos passenger,cir in fulfilling this gatekeeping role,the trial court should look to the standards of rule in analyzing whether proffered expert testimony is relevant.the district court exercised its gatekeeping function and determined that the testimony was based on a reliable methodology,and that it would assist the trier of fact in determining the fact at issue daubert,at.kumho tire,carmichael,d.the district court properly found that the expert shoeprint testimony was based on valid specialized knowledge and would aid the jury in making comparisons between the soles of shoes found on or with the defendant and the imprints of soles found on surfaces at the crime scene.see,united states rose,cir.
in particular,the district court evaluated the reliability of the methods and reliability of their application to the case at hand to determine whether there is a suitable fit between the proffered opinion and the facts of the case and,second,whether the opinion will be of assistance to the jury.the court found that there was general acceptance of shoeprint analysis in both the federal courts and the forensic community,the theory has been subject to peer review and publication,the potential error rate is known and there are standards and techniques commonly employed in the analysis the court agreed that gilkerson followed the recognized techniques.
the district court found that gilkerson opinion that the class characteristic comparison showed similarity between ford shoe and the print was an acceptable opinion for shoeprint experts to express under daubert.the court found that although the latent prints were not complete,there is clearly sufficient underlying information to reliably express the careful opinion regarding the similarity of characteristics and the inability to rule out based upon any difference.
the court then turned to the assistance that gilkerson testimony would provide the jury,and evaluated whether it provides in a reliable way some probative piece of evidence that would be helpful to a lay jury in understanding the case and reaching a reliable conclusion.the court determined that it did,stating that w hat he brings to this that a lay jury does not is his knowledge of shoeprint and forensic comparison in general,and second,his ability to make the examination,including making the direct print from the shoes themselves for purposes of comparison and,third,his ability to overlay the direct print and the lifted print 
by engaging in this evaluation,the district court followed the gatekeeping process contemplated in daubert and kumho.the district court assessed both the reliability and helpfulness or relevance concerns expressed in daubert.with respect to reliability,the district court heard gilkerson explanation of his methodology and found that it sufficiently conformed to the daubert factors.the court relevance determination was also proper.as the supreme court explained,rule further requires that the evidence or testimony assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.this condition goes primarily to relevance.daubert,at.gilkerson testimony,although cautious and tempered,went directly to a key factual question in the case whether the print on the counter was made by the shoes worn by ford on the day he was apprehended.this court has previously expressed the view that the standard for this relevancy factor is not that high.lauria passenger,cir quoting in re paoli yard pcb litigation,cir gilkerson testimony that ford shoes could not be ruled out as the source of the prints satisfies the basic relevancy standard in federal rule of evidence,as it makes a fact of consequence more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.see united states allen,cir finding no abuse of discretion in allowing testimony that a print could have been made by the defendant shoes,and noting that an expert need not have an opinion on the ultimate
