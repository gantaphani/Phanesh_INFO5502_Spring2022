this case raises challenging questions about the legality of a conducted after law enforcement officers forced their way into a house occupied by a group of unrelated individuals to execute an arrest warrant.inside the residence,the officers encountered and appellant james was not the subject of the discovered a gun in his pocket.after werra was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm,see g,he unsuccessfully sought to suppress the gun as the fruit of an unlawful search.the district court concluded that the officers lawfully entered the house and that werra detention and frisk were justified as reasonable safety measures.having failed to obtain suppression of the weapon,werra entered a conditional guilty plea.
on appeal,werra reiterates his contentions that the officers lacked the necessary level of suspicion to justify entry of the house without consent and that,like the residents of a traditional home,he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the foyer and other common areas of the house.hence,he claims that the officers forced entry violated his fourth amendment rights and the gun must be suppressed.alternatively,he argues that his suppression motion should have been granted because the officers had no justification for conducting the frisk that produced the weapon.
after close consideration of the law and the facts,we conclude that the officers had insufficient grounds to justify entering the house without consent.we also conclude that werra demonstrated an expectation of privacy in the foyer of menlo street sufficient to challenge the officers unlawful entry into the dwelling.the of werra thus violated his fourth amendment rights,and he is entitled to suppression of the firearm seized from him.accordingly,we vacate his conviction,reverse the denial of his motion to suppress,and remand for further proceedings.
we recite the underlying facts as found by the district court,noting where relevant the defendant contrary view of the testimony presented at the suppression hearing.
on the morning of november,police detective michael schaaf and massachusetts state trooper robert fries were driving around brockton,massachusetts,seeking to execute outstanding arrest warrants,including one for jeanine daley.they encountered a police informant named christine,who previously had provided schaaf with reliable information about the location of a suspect.christine told the officers that she recently had seen daley at menlo street,a house in a residential neighborhood that schaaf had been told within the previous year was a sober house for recovering drug abusers.christine told the officers that daley,whom schaaf knew to be a drug abuser,was staying there 
the officers proceeded to menlo street.their knock at the front door was answered by jeffrey cicerano,a familiar figure to schaaf because schaaf had once arrested cicerano on an outstanding warrant.cicerano was the named tenant on the lease for menlo street and paid most of the rent,but other people lived there and contributed to that payment.appellant werra paid cicerano to rent the third floor,which had a bedroom,kitchenette,and a bathroom.although werra girlfriend and her child had at some point lived with him there,they had moved out before november.after their departure,werra at times slept on a couch in the living room because people would party on the third floor.united states werra,wl,at d,order denying motion to suppress.
schaaf testified that when he saw cicerano at menlo street,he became concerned that the residence had become a drug house.standing outside the front door,schaaf asked cicerano if he could talk with him and others in the house.cicerano asked if schaaf had a warrant.schaaf said he did not,and then asked if he needed one.cicerano answered affirmatively and started to walk away from the door.the officers responded by kicking at the bottom of the door,prompting cicerano to turn back and offer to talk with them outside.
as cicerano opened the door,however,the officers pushed past him into the entry foyer despite cicerano demands that the officers leave,they persisted and instructed cicerano to bring everyone in the house down to the entry area.cicerano went upstairs,and the officers turned their attention to the living room that was adjacent to the foyer.through a partially open set of pocket doors,schaaf and fries observed werra sitting on a couch,where he schaaf words just sort of staring out into space.schaaf asked werra if he was all right,but received no response.
schaaf then heard sounds behind him,and he turned to see three individuals entering the foyer.two emerged from a bedroom and the third came from the kitchen,which was located at the back of the house opposite the front door.seeing movement out of the corner of his eye,schaaf turned again to see werra walking out of the living room toward him.werra hands were in his front pants pockets.schaaf saw a clip on the right pocket that he recognized as part of a pocket knife,and he reached over and removed the knife from the pocket.observing that werra left hand was still in his other pocket and moving a little bit,schaaf patted werra down and felt a hard object that he identified as a firearm.he removed the gun and told werra he was under arrest.werra attempted to flee,but was subdued after a brief struggle.he was subsequently charged for unlawfully possessing the weapon as a felon 
in ruling on werra motion to suppress the gun,the district court issued a thoughtful decision that focused on two separate aspects of the officers conduct their entry into menlo street and the of werra.the court concluded that no fourth amendment violation occurred with respect to either action.it found that the officers had the requisite level of suspicion that daley was inside menlo street to permit forced entry into the house to execute the warrant for her arrest.the court also held that,given the lawful entry,the officers were allowed to briefly detain werra while they looked for daley and arrested her.the court further concluded that frisking werra was justified given the circumstances,which included his possession of the knife and the officers suspicion that the residence was being used as a drug house.
having rejected werra challenge to the legality of the frisk that produced the gun,the court denied his motion to suppress the weapon.werra conditional guilty plea and this appeal followed.
werra claims that his fourth amendment rights were violated in two distinct ways,and he asserts that either violation is sufficient to require suppression of the firearm seized from him.first,he contends that the officers unjustifiably forced their way into menlo that any evidence resulting from their unlawful presence in the house must be suppressed.werra alternatively claims that,whether or not the officers were lawfully present in the foyer,they lacked justification for conducting the that revealed the gun.as described above,the district court rejected both of these contentions.
in evaluating a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review its findings of fact for clear error and apply de novo review to the application of law to those facts and to conclusions of law.united states rheault,cir.werra bears the burden of showing a violation of his fourth amendment rights.id.
the government argues that the court rulings are supportable on multiple,independent grounds.first,it asserts that,under payton new york,the officers lawfully entered menlo street without consent to execute the arrest warrant for daley and,once inside,they had the right under michigan summers,to detain werra to ensure that the warrant could be executed safely and effectively.see werra,wl,at the government argues that the frisk became necessary and proper because of the officers objectively reasonable suspicion that werra was armed and dangerous.see sibron new york.
second,the government argues that werra may not challenge the officers entry into,or presence in,the house because he lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location in which he was detained and frisked.see new york class,t he state intrusion into a particular area can not result in a fourth amendment violation unless the area is one in which there is a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.quoting katz united states,harlan,concurring rheault,at.under this theory,even if there was an unlawful entry that foreclosed reliance on the summers rationale,the government contends that the officers interactions with werra were permissible under terry ohio,
our analysis begins with werra expectation of privacy in the premises at menlo street.after explaining why we conclude that werra has shown the necessary privacy interest,we address the lawfulness of the officers entry into the house.the results of those discussions make it unnecessary for us to evaluate the propriety of the.
werra reasonable expectation of privacy in menlo street 
whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular place is a inquiry.we consider first,whether the movant has exhibited an actual,subjective,expectation of privacy and second,whether such subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.rheault,at.the inquiry is necessarily,taking into consideration the nature of the searched location,and using our prior decisions for guidance.see also united states beaudoin,cir fourth amendment analysis is renownedly fact specific,vacated on other grounds by champagne united states,mem.as the district court recognized,werra privacy interest in the foyer of menlo street is linked to the proper characterization of the building itself.werra,wl,at.as the resident of a dwelling that is akin to a traditional home,id.at,he would possess a reasonable expectation of privacy throughout the interior of the premises.see payton,at t he fourth amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house.united states weidul,cir noting that a defendant who was staying or living with a friend had an expectation of privacy in the friend home.if the residence were comparable to a apartment building,however,with d istinct,complete living spaces,werra,wl,at,werra privacy interest would not extend to common areas such as the foyer.see,rheault,at noting well settled precedent that a tenant lacks a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment building quoting united states hawkins,cir united states brown,cir rejecting fourth amendment claim based on officer entry into the lobby of apartment building.
the district court aptly observed that menlo street does not fit squarely into the paradigm for either a traditional family home or a apartment building.werra,wl,at.although it is a structure,the residents were not a traditional single family occupying the house together.as other courts have held with respect to rooming houses and fraternities,however,an unconventional household does not necessarily diminish the protection afforded the residents of the house.see,reardon wroan,cir noting that fraternity members could best be characterized as roommates in the same house,not simply sharing certain common areas state titus,so d,the mere fact that certain rooms traditionally associated with a home are shared by rooming house residents does not render the structure any less a home to those residents.people garriga,e xisting precedent,although sparse,supports the conclusion that the internal hallway area of this rooming house was part of the defendant home for fourth amendment purposes.but see,united states anderson,holding that appellant constitutionally protected privacy interest began at the door to his room rather than at the door to the entire rooming house 
thus,we agree with the district court that,unlike the typical inquiry,which focuses solely on the particular location in which the evidence the defendant seeks to suppress was found,see,united states bucci,cir front of home,as viewed by video camera rheault,at landing of the front stairway united states meada,cir gun case,we must conduct a broader examination of werra and the other tenants living arrangements throughout menlo street.if they lived apartment could not claim the common areas of the house,including the foyer,as their private space outsiders.however,if they did not live in individualized residences within the were thus more like the occupants of a right to privacy outsiders would begin at menlo street front door.under the latter scenario,the officers would have violated werra reasonable expectation of privacy by forcibly entering the house.we thus also agree with the district court that the relevant considerations for our inquiry include whether the building contains recognizably separate living units,the residents right to exclude others from parts of the building,the number of residents,and the formal legal relationship among them.werra,wl,at.other facts that shed light on how the tenants viewed the dwelling,including the tenants customary use of various spaces within the premises,also are pertinent in evaluating their subjective expectation of privacy.
we think it of particular note that,unlike an apartment building in which tenants contract individually with the landlord,menlo street was rented as a whole by cicerano.he described it as my house at the suppression hearing and,indeed,cicerano reported that he paid most of the everybody pitched in.the district court listed about a individuals who were living in the residence at the time of the police entry.they were not,in fact,did not know the last name of a tenant named they were also not thrown together randomly.cicerano explained that the residents were basically just friends trying to make it through n ot living on the street.the operation of menlo street was thus in some respects a collective undertaking,with both the financial arrangements and the informal relationship among the residents suggestive of a single household.
the residents use of the house points in the same direction.werra paid rent specifically for the third floor,which contained a bathroom and a kitchenette,and it apparently could have been used as a unit.at the time of the police entry,however,werra was not the only person to regularly make use of the third floor,and he did not live solely within it.werra testified that he had spent m any nights sleeping on a couch in the living room on the first floor because when i was up on the third floor,everybody wanted to come up on the third floor.
other testimony from werra and cicerano,although not fully consistent,also indicated that neither werra nor the other tenants viewed the third floor as an independent living unit at the time the officers entered the house.werra acknowledged that the third floor was his own personal space,but said that he had been paying rent for that space only until his girlfriend moved out at the end of october he testified that,more recently,he had been sleeping in the living room.he explained that he did not have a bed on the third a pullout said he and his brother moved furniture into the living room so he could stay there.
cicerano confirmed that werra relocated to the living room because the third floor was at times taken over by others,although he described werra relocation as intermittent rather than ongoing.he testified that werra once in a while slept in the living room because there was a lot of partying basically,and a lot of people went to the third floor,so when he wanted to sleep,sometimes he go in there.cicerano reported that the third floor had a door and that werra had the ability to keep people out,but he also indicated that it would have been difficult for werra to exclude others on the night before the november incident because the first floor was shut down in the aftermath of cicerano mother funeral taken as a whole,the evidence regarding werra use of the living room showed that he slept there at least intermittently,with cicerano consent but at werra own discretion.
although the record contains no direct evidence about werra use of the downstairs kitchen and the other bathrooms in the house,cicerano stated that people would sometimes congregate in the kitchen that adjoined cicerano bedroom on the first floor.given his proximity to the downstairs kitchen when he was sleeping in the living room,it is a fair inference that werra was at times part of such a group.in addition,when werra was asked at the suppression hearing to confirm that there was a bathroom on the third floor,he noted that bathrooms also were located on the first and second that he had used them instead of bothering to climb up the stairs 
not all rooms,however,were open to all tenants.cicerano had a lock on his bedroom door,and he rarely allowed others to use the adjacent living room because he did not want to be disturbed when he was sleeping.like werra,other tenants were assigned specific rooms cicerano testified,for example,that paul rented a room on the second floor.
yet,on balance,cicerano and werra testimony indicates that the tenants shared the house in much the same way as would a traditional family.offspring in a home may at times lock bedroom doors or post do not enter signs aimed at excluding their siblings and parents from their assigned rooms.and,just as occurs in the traditional family context,the supposed exclusivity of personal space at menlo least with respect to werra not always respected.werra were undeterred by the door to the third floor when that space was needed for their comfort and enjoyment.werra behaved similarly,claiming alternative space in the house when the third floor was targeted by others.though cicerano limited access to the living room to suit his needs,the record shows that the tenants shared use of the kitchen and the second and bathrooms.these circumstances are a far cry from a typical apartment building setting,where tenants live within discrete units and use common spaces,such as hallways and basements,primarily for storage or access to the outside.
in analyzing whether werra had demonstrated that menlo street was sufficiently like a traditional home to give him an expectation of privacy in relation to outsiders throughout the premises,the district court began by noting that the evidence lacked many details concerning the rights of the residents within the building and the relationships among those who lived there.werra,wl,at the court observed that the third floor appear ed to have been an independent living unit from which werra could exclude others,and it stated that werra had no reasonable expectations of privacy in the foyer because others over whom he had no control could pass through it without his permission.id.the court concluded its analysis by noting that werra expectation of privacy in the living room was limited to the permission for use granted by cicerano.id.
the government urges us to adopt the district court conclusion that the absence of key facts means that werra failed to carry his burden of showing that menlo street was equivalent to a traditional home.id.we agree that the record was less than ideal.that the evidence could have been stronger,however,does not make it inadequate.as we have described,the facts found by the district court indicate that living for the tenants at menlo street,including werra,occurred throughout the house.although the record does not show that the unrelated individuals who resided at menlo street behaved like a traditional family,it does show that they were not merely who passed through the common spaces of the house on the way to and from their independent pursuits.rather,like the fraternity members described in reardon,the residents of menlo street could best be characterized as roommates in the same house,not simply sharing certain common areas.at.indeed,the residents at menlo street were all living with cicerano,in his house,as part of a nontraditional single family household.as cicerano put it,werra stayed at my house,he lived at my house.
the district court analysis does not address the facts showing that menlo street was operated as a single household,including cicerano notable testimony that he paid most of the rent.the court finding that werra could have lived independently and excluded others from the third floor is correct,but that theoretical arrangement did not reflect the evidence on how werra and the other residents actually lived.although the dissent focuses on the discrepancy between werra and cicerano testimony about how frequently werra slept in the living room,the analysis is the same whether werra did so intermittently or m any nights the fact remains that it was an ordinary occurrence for others to use the third floor and for werra to relocate to the living room.moreover,werra testified that his brother helped him move furniture into the living room,conduct that shows a belief that he had a personal claim to the a claim that was subject to the quiet use that was demanded by cicerano 
the government cites no case in which a resident of a structure was found to lack a reasonable expectation of privacy,relative to outsiders,in the common areas of his or her house.instead,it points to inapposite cases involving duplexes or larger buildings in which tenants lived in separate,fully units.similarly,the district court mistakenly adopted the frame of reference for buildings in observing that werra lacked a privacy interest in the foyer because others living in the house could pass through the entryway without his permission.the inability to exclude cohabitants from shared spaces within a traditional home does not on its own eliminate a resident privacy interest in keeping outsiders from barging through the front door.individuals routinely bring friends into their homes without the consent of every family member who resides there,and such unilateral decisions do not convert the hallway or entrance of a private home into a public space.there is no evidence that people who did not live at menlo street routinely entered without the consent of a resident,which might have undermined the presumption of privacy that normally attends the interior of a residence 
in sum,based on the facts of record,we conclude that werra has met his burden to show that he possessed a subjective expectation of privacy in the foyer of menlo,more specifically,that he believed the entire house,and not just the third floor,served as his home and,hence,that he could prevent the entry of anyone whom he and his housemates wished to keep out.we further conclude that,on this record,werra expectation of privacy was reasonable.a resident of a structure who shares living arrangements as did the tenants of menlo street could reasonably expect that his right to privacy begins at the front door.see titus,so d at holding that,just like private homeowners,rooming house residents have an actual expectation of privacy in the common areas of the rooming house and that given the sanctity of the home,society is prepared to recognize that expectation as reasonable 
because werra had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the foyer,he is entitled to challenge the officers forcible,warrantless entry into the house.the government claims that the officers lawfully entered to execute the arrest warrant for daley.we now turn to that contention.
b.the officers entry into the house 
in payton new york,the supreme court held that police officers attempting to execute an arrest warrant have limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.at.payton inquiry thus requires us to ask whether schaaf and fries had a sufficient basis to believe that daley lived at menlo street and was at home at the time of their entry.the district court described the issue as close and the evidence supporting the government position as thin.werra,wl,at.the government itself stated at oral argument before the district court that the arrest warrant did not give the officers the authority to enter the house nonetheless,the court concluded that a reasonable officer in the same position could have formed an objectively reasonable belief that jeanine daley lived at the premises and was present at the time of entry.id.at.
as a threshold matter,werra argues that the court use of the reasonable belief standard was incorrect,and that the officers instead needed to demonstrate that they had probable cause to believe that daley lived in the menlo street house and was home on the morning of november.although most circuits to have considered the issue have adopted the reasonable belief standard,and treat it as less stringent than probable cause,see,el bey roop,cir united states thomas,valdez mcpheters,cir united states lovelock,cir,the ninth circuit requires probable cause,see united states gorman,cir.we have not explicitly made a choice,but have implicitly accepted the majority view.see,united states graham,cir.in this case,the government can not meet even the less stringent reasonable belief standard.
the relevant information possessed by the officers in this case,as found by the district court,was the following an informant christine told the officers that she had recently seen daley at menlo street and that daley was staying there,werra,wl,at christine had previously provided schaaf with accurate information about the location of a suspect schaaf was aware that daley had been a drug abuser on schaaf previous visit to menlo street,within the previous year,he had observed it to be a sober house with tenants living on the premises,and the officers arrived at the house relatively early in the morning,at approximately,id.at.
we doubt that this information was sufficient to support even the first prong of the payton schaaf and fries could reasonably believe that daley was living at menlo street when they forced their way into the house.although eyewitness evidence from a reliable informant that an individual was staying at a certain location might in some circumstances suffice to support a reasonable suspicion that the individual lives there,the context here does not permit such reliance on christine statement.in his affidavit,schaaf reported that christine had told the officers that at some point recently a term that could refer to days or weeks she had seen daley at the menlo street house.united states pruitt,cir finding reasonable belief that the suspect was present where,inter alia,an anonymous caller had reported seeing him within the past few hours.
a different home address appeared on the arrest warrant for daley and,even accepting that she had stayed at the menlo street house recently,the officers neither conducted surveillance nor took any other steps to verify that her stay had not been temporary.if the house were a sober house,as schaaf had been told,daley might have passed through only briefly in an attempt to deal with her drug abuse problem.an extended stay was no more inevitable if the house were instead a haven for drug users,which schaaf said he suspected when known drug to the door.
the skimpy evidence of daley residency at menlo street contrasts sharply with the information available to officers in other cases raising a payton issue.for example,in graham,at,a police report about a domestic incident identified the defendant as the offender and gave his address as the building where he was subsequently arrested.in addition,the officers had tried to execute the warrant at the defendant previous address,but did not find him.id.at.similarly,in united states clayton,cir,a police record indicated the defendant lived at the address where the arrest was made.id.at see also,united states jones,cir finding entry into hotel room lawful where hotel manager told officers that suspect had rented a particular room for three weeks,and a man detained in the parking lot told officers that suspect was then inside the suite united states pelletier,cir finding entry into a motel room lawful where officers who went to defendant home were told he was not there defendant girlfriend sister said he was at a certain room at a motel the room was registered in the sister name and a motel maintenance worker identified the defendant as the sole occupant of the room valez,at finding entry justified where,among other factors,suspect had told an officer that he lived at the location and other law enforcement officers informed the entering authorities that he lived there united states risse,cir finding entry lawful where,among other factors,the defendant had told the police that she was staying at the location and the officers could contact her there.
even if the informant tip,together with schaaf general impression of menlo street,were enough to support a reasonable belief that daley was living in the house,there was not a shred of evidence to satisfy the second payton the officers reasonably believed she was in the house at the time they entered.as noted above,the officers made no attempt to confirm the currentness of christine information by,for example,conducting surveillance or placing a telephone call to the house.el bey,at noting that a review of the relevant caselaw indicates that law enforcement officers often rely on independent investigation and observations of the premises to determine whether a suspect is actually inside before entering.although actual viewing of the suspect on the premises is not required,valdez,at,the officers must point to at least some evidence suggesting that the individual named in the arrest warrant is present.see id.citing numerous cases and various types of circumstantial evidence,including presence of a car associated with the suspect and knowledge of employment circumstances that would make it likely the suspect would be at home and asleep see also pruitt,at same,noting that reasonable belief may be generated by consideration of common sense factors and the totality of the circumstances.
the government asserts that officers should not be expected to conduct in order to arrest suspects at their known residences,and it correctly points out that courts regularly uphold entries where the time of day suggested the suspect presence at home.see,thomas,at noting that the early morning hour between and was reason enough for the officers to believe the defendant would be at home united states bervaldi,cir concluding that it was reasonable to believe,in the absence of contrary evidence,that suspect would be at his residence at in the morning united states terry,cir finding reasonable belief that suspect would be at home at on sunday morning united states bridgewater,app x,cir holding that e arly morning police entry weighs in favor of finding that the officers reasonably believed suspect was inside the house.the government argues that,as in those cases,schaaf and fries reasonably could rely on the time of day and assume that daley was home at on the friday morning they entered menlo street.
the precedent,however,does not support the conclusion the government wishes us to draw.in the cases cited by the government and in others where timing was a factor,there was no serious question that the location of the arrest was where the defendant lived and information beyond timing frequently contributed to the officers reasonable belief that the suspect was present.see,valdez,at holding that midday entry was constitutional where suspect was unemployed,liked to stay out late drinking,and sometimes abused drugs such as heroin and cocaine united states munoz,cir listing officers arrival as one factor supporting reasonable belief suspect was at home united states lauter,cir finding reasonable belief that suspect was in the apartment at monday because he was unemployed and typically slept late united states hayes,app x,cir rejecting challenge to reasonable belief that suspect would be home as frivolous where police entered at on a weekday and the suspect was an unemployed drug addict with no car.
the fact that an individual is known to live at a particular location is one sound reason to expect him or her to be there.see wayne lafave,search and seizure a ed noting that the police need not possess special knowledge that the defendant is at home for in the absence of facts tending to show that the defendant is not at home it is reasonable to infer that he would be there.here,however,the officers knowledge of daley residence consisted only of christine imprecise,uncorroborated statement that daley had recently been staying at menlo street.
moreover,there is no evidence to suggest that daley ordinarily would be home at on a weekday,wherever she lived.so far as the record shows,the officers had no information about whether she was employed or about her nighttime and daytime routines.entering a home at is significantly different from entering at or,when even working individuals can reasonably be presumed to be at home.the fact that daley was a drug abuser possibly living in a party house or a recovering drug user living in a sober house does not reveal her employment status or inclination to sleep late.nor does the crime for which the warrant was probation violation stemming from a conviction for larceny of a motor that she was likely to be unemployed and at home.in sum,none of the factors typically considered to be evidence of a suspect presence were part of the record here in these circumstances,the officers could not have formed a reasonable belief that daley was at menlo street when they forcibly entered the house 
the government thus got it right the first time,when it told the court that the information available to the officers was insufficient to support a reasonable belief that daley would be inside menlo street at the time they entered the house.hence,the officers entry into the foyer was unlawful and,because werra possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy there,the illegal entry violated his fourth amendment rights.the firearm seized in the course of the was a fruit of that violation and,accordingly,it should have been suppressed.see wong sun united states,united states sanchez,cir.
we hasten to add that we are not suggesting that officers who unlawfully enter a home must subject themselves to the risk of being harmed by a resident whom they believe is armed and dangerous.they are certainly entitled to take reasonable actions to defend themselves but the reasonableness of the officers interaction with such an individual for that protective purpose does not determine the fourth amendment suppression issue generated by the unlawful entry.in this case,because werra had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the foyer and the officers entered the house unlawfully,the officers encounter with werra and the discovery of the gun were both results of the officers unconstitutional conduct.werra was thus entitled to suppression of the gun.
we therefore reverse the district court denial of werra motion to suppress,vacate werra conviction,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
so ordered.
i respectfully disagree that werra had a reasonable expectation of privacy throughout menlo street such that he could challenge the officers entry.in any event,i conclude that the officers entry into the building was lawful.and i am persuaded that schaaf lawfully detained and patted werra during the execution of a valid arrest warrant.these views compel me to dissent from the majority conclusion that the firearm found in werra front pants pocket should be suppressed.
werra must establish that his own fourth amendment rights were violated by the challenged search or seizure.rakas illinois.his threshold burden is to prove that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.united states rheault,cir quoting united states.thornley,cir.to do so werra must show not merely that he had an actual,subjective,expectation of privacy,but that his subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.id.citing smith maryland.like the district court,i conclude that werra has failed to satisfy this burden.
following a evidentiary hearing,the district court found that werra did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy.the district court findings,set forth in a thoughtful rescript,included the following.werra paid rent to occupy an independent living unit on the third floor,replete with a bedroom,a kitchenette and a bathroom.united states werra,wl,at.his unit was his personal space and he had the ability to keep people out of that part of the building,although tenants would sometimes party on the,prompting werra to sleep on a couch downstairs once in a while with cicerano permission.id.at.unlike his unit,werra had no expectation of privacy in the foyer because others over whom he had no control could pass through it without his permission.id.at.and,critically,werra failed to demonstrate that menlo street was akin to a traditional home with evidence concerning the rights of the residents within the building and the relationships among those who lived there.id.
none of our cases is directly on point,but rheault provides an adequate starting point for the analysis.there,we concluded that a tenant renting the second of three units in a building a did not have an objectively reasonable privacy expectation in the landing.at.we reasoned that the proximity of the landing to the defendant unit cut against the reasonableness of his privacy interest,as did his inability to exclude others from that area.id.at a potentially revolving cast of tenants and their guests had relatively unfettered access to the very area in which rheault claims an expectation of privacy see also rawlings kentucky,no privacy interest in purse because petitioner did not have any right to exclude other persons from it.
other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion in circumstances remarkably similar to this case.for example,in united states befell,the defendant was arrested in the hallway of a rooming facility in which he occupied an upstairs room in exchange for rent.app x,cir internal brackets omitted.after the district court denied his motion to suppress,the defendant appealed on the basis of his purported privacy expectation in the rooming house at large.the second circuit,however,rejected his argument.it began with the bedrock principle that the defendant bears the burden of proving that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area intruded upon.id.at quoting rawlings,at.reviewing the scant evidence of communal living adduced below,the court held that the defendant fell short of that burden 
the defendant provided scant evidence to support the inference that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common hallway at the rooming house.he did not endeavor to show circumstances regarding his relationship with the other renters,their particular use of the common areas,or any other factor that might conceivably form the basis of a conclusion that the officers presence in the common hallway of the rooming house implicated the defendant reasonable privacy expectations.
id.emphasis supplied 
the majority ignores befell in favor of three cases that are not especially useful.the linchpin in that trio was that residents had to traverse common areas in order to get to shared kitchens and bathrooms,making their arrangements more like homes.state titus,so d,people garriga,see reardon wroan,cir indeed,in titus,the florida supreme court expressly limited its holding to common areas that linked such inseparable features of their home 
interior hallways in rooming houses are protected only by virtue of linking such traditional rooms within the provide rooming house residents with the only means of access to these rooms,and are an inseparable feature of their home.in other words,it is not any inherent nature of a hallway that controls,but rather what the hallway links,individual living units versus shared traditional living areas.
titus,so d at see also garriga,at there is too,in our view,importance on another level in finding the common internal hallway area of a rooming house a private,as opposed to a public,place clearly,it is economic necessity that requires those who live in such humble circumstances to dwell there.that they can not afford to have their own kitchens and bathrooms,and hallway access thereto,does not render such areas public.internal citations omitted 
here,werra did not need to pass through common areas in order to access his kitchen or bathroom.rather,the record is quite clear that werra regularly autonomously in his own unit on the third floor.true,we do not know whether other units were similarly,but that is precisely the point it was werra burden to show,as the majority acknowledges,that tenants were roommates in the same house,not simply sharing certain common areas.ante at quoting reardon,at.by failing to put forward evidence concerning the living arrangements of other tenants and their particular use of common areas,werra fell short of that burden.see,befell,app x at.
the majority cobbles together several pieces of testimony that,i am told,compel a contrary conclusion.in my opinion,none withstands close scrutiny.
first,drawing from cicerano testimony,the majority reports that unlike an apartment building in which tenants contract individually with the landlord,menlo street was rented as a whole by cicerano.ante at.in particular,the majority points to cicerano description of menlo street as my house,id.at see also id.at the residents at menlo street were all living with cicerano,in his house,as part of a nontraditional single family household.as cicerano put it,werra stayed at my house,he lived at my house,and his testimony that,although all his tenants pitched in,cicerano ultimately paid most of the rent.id.at see also id.at faulting the district court for not addressing the facts showing that menlo street was operated as a single household,including cicerano notable testimony that he paid most of the rent.thus,according to my colleagues,the tenants shared the house in much the same way as would a traditional family.id.at.
but however informal it may have been,the relationship between cicerano and his tenants was less familial than the majority characterization suggests.tenants were assigned rooms or apartments at least some of those could be locked to the exclusion of other tenants and at least also fully.they paid rent to cicerano in order to occupy those spaces.and,as far as the record shows,they were not related to cicerano or necessarily on close terms with him.cicerano testified,for instance,that he did not know the last name of one of his tenants.on this record,the majority analogy to a traditional family home is,in my opinion,rather inapt.
moreover,homes were common in the area.detective schaaf testified,for example,that there were many multifamily homes in the vicinity of menlo street.based on schaaf testimony,the record description of werra unit,and werra failure to adduce evidence concerning the living arraignments of his,i think it is unreasonable to the majority menlo street was the anomaly here.see,united states cook,cir when reviewing suppression denials,we must construe the record in the light most favorable to the district court ruling,drawing all reasonable inferences in the government favor.
and although cicerano testified that he paid most of the monthly rent,he never explained what he meant he could have meant several things he could have meant,as the majority appears to believe,that he paid nearly all of the rent or,equally plausible in my view,that he paid more than any other tenant but still less than half of the rent.see webster third new int l dictionary defining most as the greatest amount or quantity in addition to the majority of something.the latter,if true,would cut against the majority characterization of menlo street.the salient point,however,is that cicerano vague testimony is susceptible to different interpretations,and i see no basis for rewarding lost his motion to suppress the most favorable one.in fact,as noted,courts of appeals are supposed to do the very opposite.see,cook,at.
second,the majority refers to werra testimony that he had spent m any nights sleeping on a couch in the living room on the first floor because when i was up on the third floor,everybody wanted to come up on the third floor.id.at see also id.at werra were undeterred by the door to the third floor when that space was needed for their comfort and enjoyment.werra behaved similarly,claiming alternative space in the house when the third floor was targeted by others.
the district court,however,disregarded werra testimony in that respect.favoring cicerano version instead,the district court found both that werra could exclude others from his apartment and only sometimes slept downstairs 
the third floor was werra personal space and he had the ability to keep people out of that part of the building.in addition to renting the third floor,werra sometimes not a lot but once in a while,according to on the couch in the living room on the first floor,with cicerano permission,because people would party on the third floor.
werra,wl,at emphasis supplied.those supported in the based on a credibility determination,albeit an implicit one,that we review only for clear error.united states verdugo,cir see also united states espinoza,cir credibility only rare the district court prerogative united states zapata,cir appellate courts must exhibit great respect for the presider opportunity to hear the testimony,observe the witnesses demeanor,and evaluate the facts at first hand.the record suggests no reason whatsoever to question that determination.
the majority responds by asserting that,no matter whether the district court credited cicerano or werra,the fact remains that it was an ordinary occurrence for others to use the third floor and for werra to relocate to the living room.ante at emphasis supplied.according to the majority,that fact,along with werra testimony that he moved some of his furniture into the living room,shows a belief that he had a personal claim to the space.id.these assertions are perplexing.the first disregards the district court,which i have block quoted and emphasized above,on that precise question werra,wl,at.the second is beside the point.as discussed,werra subjective belief is meaningless unless society is prepared to recognize it as objectively reasonable.rheault,at.i doubt that moving one couch into another tenant living room,and then sometimes sleeping on it after obtaining permission which was not always granted here,warrants societal recognition of a privacy interest.and even if one were to engage in that doubtful assumption,the space in question is the foyer,where werra was stopped,not the living room.i discern no facts in the record that remotely suggest an objectively reasonable privacy interest in the foyer or,for that matter,throughout the building at large.
third,the majority points to cicerano testimony that people would sometimes congregate in the kitchen,ante at and to werra testimony that,in addition to the bathroom in his unit,bathrooms were located on the first and second floors.id.at.from these snippets,the majority declares that the record shows that the tenants shared use of the kitchen and the second and bathrooms.id.at.
in my view,that inference is at best highly questionable.as noted,werra central theory is that the tenants of menlo street lived communally.i think that it is telling,however,that werra failed to adduce any direct evidence that he used a kitchen or bathroom other than his own.he or any of the several,none of whom werra could have said so at the suppression hearing.the more reasonable inference to draw from the testimony as a whole is that werra and others generally used the facilities that were assigned to them.see,cook,at.and moreover,evidence that tenants may have gathered sporadically in one of multiple kitchens provides no reasonable basis to believe that life at menlo street was anything like the communal arrangements described in the cases relied on by the majority,in which all residents shared a single kitchen out of necessity.titus,so d at garriga,at see reardon,at.
in sum,i would hold that werra failed to establish an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy outside of his apartment.without that showing,he can not contest the officers entry into menlo street.new york class,rheault,at.
the above conclusion requires me to address the search and seizure of werra person.see terry ohio.i conclude that schaaf lawfully detained and patted werra,on an objectively reasonable basis of officer safety,while he and trooper fries executed a valid arrest warrant.
ultimate constitutional questions like these call for de novo review,espinoza,at legal conclusions,including ultimate constitutional determinations such as the sufficiency of the facts found to support a conclusion that,for example,reasonable suspicion exists or a seizure occurred,engender de novo review,and that review is not confined to a consideration of the grounds relied on by the district court.united states soule,cir see also united states,cir in the end,we will affirm the denial of a suppression motion if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.
i begin with the relevant background,taken from the district court rescript.detective schaaf knew cicerano from his past encounters with law enforcement,and when cicerano opened the door schaaf immediately suspected that menlo street had become a drug house.werra,wl,at.after entering the building,schaaf instructed cicerano to round up the tenants on the upper floors and bring them downstairs.while individuals began to assemble in the foyer,schaaf saw movement out of the corner of his eye.id.at.he turned and saw werra walking out of the living room towards him with his hands in his front pant pockets,half in and half out and moving slightly.id.detective schaaf observed a clip of a concealed pocket knife visible outside werra front right pocket,and promptly relieved werra of the weapon.id.at that point,werra left hand,which remained in his other pocket,was moving a little bit.id.fearing that werra might still be armed,schaaf conducted a pat frisk of werra front left pocket.he felt a hard object that he recognized as a firearm,removed it from werra pocket,and handed it to trooper fries.detective schaaf then placed werra under arrest.a brief struggle ensued,after which werra was subdued and taken into custody.
based on these findings,which neither party contests,the district court determined that both the detention and frisk were reasonable.the court noted initially that the circumstances did not warrant a terry stop because there was no reasonable basis to suspect that werra was engaged in criminal activity.see terry,at investigatory stop requires reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot.nevertheless,it concluded that the officers lawfully detained werra under michigan summers,search warrant authorizes limited detention of occupants during search for contraband.although the court recognized that summers involved a search warrant,it reasoned that the logic of summers applied equally to cases,like this one,where police enter a home in order to execute an arrest warrant.as for the pat frisk,the court concluded that the limited intrusion on werra person was justified because werra was visibly armed in a drug house suspected of harboring a fugitive.see sibron new york,terry,at.
i think that the pat and frisk is uncontroversial,based largely on the reasons identified by the district court.the more interesting question,in my opinion,is the stop.a prototypical terry stop takes place on the street.see,terry,at dealing with the myriad daily situations in which policemen and citizens confront each other on the street.we have,however,applied the terry doctrine to temporary detentions in and around the home,united states beaudoin,cir summoning the defendant outside his motel room,vacated on other ground sub nom.champagne united states,and although the inquiry in our residential cases tends to focus on officer safety,as far as i can tell we have not formally abandoned the requirement that police articulate reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to justify an stop.see,united states parker,cir summoning the defendant outside his hotel room on reasonable suspicion of a felony united states romain,cir detaining the defendant in an apartment on reasonable suspicion that he had threatened the person who placed the call.
but i see this case differently.detective schaaf and trooper fries entered a suspected drug house on the authority of a valid arrest warrant.during the execution of that warrant,they briefly detained a visibly armed occupant who approached them in a confined area where they were outnumbered at least.in such circumstances,i believe that requiring a showing of articulable criminal activity in order to justify a temporary detention would unreasonably jeopardize officer safety.like the district court,i would apply the rule in summers to situations,like this one,where temporary detentions are necessary for the police to execute an arrest warrant safely.and although the district court does not appear to have considered maryland buie,circumstances surrounding execution of arrest warrant authorize a protective sweep,i think that the logic of buie provides an additional basis for the same result.
i examine each below,beginning with summers.
in summers,police encountered the defendant descending the front steps of his house as they were about to search it for drugs.at.the officers requested his assistance in gaining entry and detained him while they performed the search.id.they found drugs,arrested the defendant,and charged him with possession.id.at.he filed a motion to suppress,which the state trial court granted that decision was affirmed by divided panels of both the state intermediary and supreme appellate courts.id.at.the supreme court took the case and reversed.
justice stevens,writing for the majority,held that a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.id.at.he reasoned that a neutral and detached magistrate had found probable cause to believe that the law was being violated in that house and had authorised a substantial invasion of the privacy of the persons who resided there.id.at.a brief detention in that circumstance,he continued,was less intrusive than the search itself,was unlikely to be exploited by the officer or unduly prolonged,id.at,and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the indignity associated with a compelled visit to the police station.id.
the defendant brief detention was also supported by several law enforcement interests.first,justice stevens observed that law enforcement had an obvious interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.id.second,less obvious but sometimes more important,was their interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers because the execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence.id.and third,they and others present had an interest in the orderly completion of the search because an occupant may induce them to open locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at hand.id.at.all these,justice stevens concluded,further justified the defendant brief detention while officers performed the search.
although we have not yet done so,other courts have applied the rule in summers to cases involving the execution of arrest warrants.united states enslin,cir police ordered occupant to show hands during execution of an arrest warrant for another occupant state valdez,utah policed restrained occupant during execution of an arrest warrant for another occupant people hannah,police ordered occupant to remain seated during execution of an arrest warrant for another occupant see cherrington skeeter,cir involving claims brought under anderson united states,app x,cir sotomayor,on panel involving claims under the federal tort claims act.
my review leads me to the same conclusion.similar law enforcement interests are present in this context.most importantly,brief detentions in such circumstances are justified because they reasonably minimize the risk of harm to officers and others present.whether for the purpose of arresting a fugitive or searching for contraband,entering a suspected drug house is dangerous business.in those potentially volatile environments,officers must have the authority to briefly detain individuals who might be armed and dangerous,especially when those individuals,like werra,are visibly armed.other courts have permitted similar detentions when the threat to officer safety was far less obvious.see,enslin,at no visible weapons police ordered occupant to show hands from beneath covers when he had just awakened from sleep valdez,at no visible weapons police restrained occupant while he was sleeping because his hands were concealed hannah.at no visible weapons police ordered occupant to remain seated.
moreover,such detentions prevent advanced warning of an impending arrest that might cause fugitives to hide or flee the premises.see anderson,app x at holding,in reliance on summers,that police were justified in detaining occupants during execution of an arrest warrant in light of the relatively high likelihood that they would warn a possibly dangerous person of impending arrest,coupled with the relatively brief period of additional detention involved.indeed,such detentions might even facilitate an arrest by inducing detainees to assist the officers in locating a fugitive to avoid the use of force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at hand.summers,at.elements of both scenarios are on display in this case.cicerano initially agreed to assist the officers by assembling the tenants downstairs,presumably based on his own in maintaining decorum in the building.when cicerano went upstairs,however,he warned tenants who had jeanine remain upstairs in order to avoid arrest.it was only after schaaf ascended the stairs,following his scuffle with werra,that he finally apprehended daley 
werra argues that the disconnect between a search warrant and an arrest warrant renders summers inapplicable.his position is overstated.true,a search warrant gives the police a ready basis for determining that occupants of a residence subject to search may have done something wrong an arrest warrant does not.but in my opinion the salient point in summers was the interposition of the magistrate determination of probable cause between the zealous officer and the citizen.at.of course,interposition is present whether the warrant authorizes a search or an arrest.and,much like the search context,brief detentions in the arrest context are unlikely to be exploited or unduly prolonged,because the end goal is the apprehension of the individual identified in the arrest warrant,not the detention of that individual.see id.at.in any event,i would not necessarily apply summers to all detentions in this context,but only those reasonably necessary to protect officer safety.so while the analogy may not be perfectly apt,i think that the distinction is ultimately less important than werra claims.
in buie,police entered the defendant home in order to arrest him in connection with an armed robbery.at.as the officers fanned out through the first and second floors,one of them announced that he would freeze the basement so that no one could come up and catch them off guard.id.the officer shouted into the basement ordering anyone down there to come out.the defendant soon emerged with hands raised.after he was arrested,another officer entered the basement in case there was someone else down there.id.in the basement,the officer found a red jump suit that connected the defendant to the earlier robbery.the defendant motion to suppress the suit was denied a jury later convicted him on the robbery charge.the state intermediary appellate court affirmed,but the state high court reversed on the ground that the suit should have been suppressed.id.at.on certiorari,the supreme court reversed.
authorizing protective sweeps,the court stated that police may employ a properly limited sweep in conjunction with an arrest when the searching officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.id.at.it reasoned that an arrest can pose a greater risk of danger than a typical terry encounter 
a terry frisk occurs before a confrontation has escalated to the point of arrest.a protective sweep,in contrast,occurs as an adjunct to the serious step of taking a person into custody for the purpose of prosecuting him for a crime.moreover,unlike an encounter on the street or along a highway,an arrest puts the officer at the disadvantage of being on his adversary turf.an ambush in a confined setting of unknown configuration is more to be feared than it is in open,more familiar surrounding.
id.at.in those circumstances,the court concluded,arresting officers may take reasonable steps to ensure their safety during,and while making,the arrest,id.at,as long as those procedures were aimed at protecting the arresting officers and lasted no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger.id.at.
we have extended buie when necessary to protect officer safety.for example,we have authorized police to conduct protective sweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants,drohan vaughn,cir united states daoust,cir,and where the existence of exigent circumstances prompts the entry of police,united states martins,cir.see also united states lawlor,cir applying buie to protective sweep in house following arrest outside of the home.
although our cases were within the search context,other courts have applied buie rationale to seizures.in united states.maddox,for instance,the tenth circuit upheld the detention of a potentially dangerous individual during an arrest,cir.there,while police arrested a woman inside a mobile home,the defendant pulled into the mobile home driveway in a truck.id.at.an officer stationed outside saw the defendant reach under his seat because the officer could not tell whether the defendant was placing or retrieving something under the seat,he interpreted the action as an unknown threat and instructed the defendant to remain in the vehicle.id.the court of appeals agreed that the brief detention was lawful,reasoning that,like a protective sweep,a protective detention was an obvious and reasonable measure to ensure officer safety 
because the ability to search for dangerous individuals provides little protection for officers unless it is accompanied by the ability to temporarily seize any dangerous individuals that are located during the search,we conclude that detaining potentially dangerous persons for the duration of the arrest qualifies as a reasonable step to ensure the officers safety.
id.quoting buie,at accord state ugalino,applying buie to a protective detention during the execution of an arrest warrant even if the officers lacked a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was involved in criminal activity,they were justified in fearing that he would use a concealed weapon against them if they did not temporarily detain him and perform a search for weapons.
i would apply the logic of maddox in this case.an objectively reasonable officer in the same situation as schaaf and trooper fries would have been concerned for her safety.although the record does not indicate that their target,daley,had a history of violence,they nevertheless entered a suspected drug house in order to arrest a fugitive on her turf.they were in a confined area where they were outnumbered at least.and a man,whose hands were concealed in his pockets,approached them armed visibly with a knife.werra may not have approached the officers in an overtly threatening manner,but the totality of the circumstances reasonably suggested a threat.in response to that threat,schaaf actions were correspondingly proportionate he detained werra only momentarily in order to remove the knife and performed a pat frisk limited in scope to werra other pocket.these minimally invasive actions were reasonable steps aimed at protecting the arresting officers and lasted no longer than was necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger.buie,at.
in sum,based on either summers or buie,or under the collective weight of both,i would hold that police have limited authority to detain an individual they encounter during an execution of a valid arrest warrant when they reasonably suspect the individual might be armed and dangerous.in this case,because i believe schaaf and trooper fries acted reasonably under the circumstances,i would affirm.
that is enough to affirm the district court thoughtful decision denying werra motion to suppress.but i will also briefly address the majority holding that the entry was illegal,because i am concerned about the holding practical consequences.
i begin,as before,with the district court findings.on their way to arrest daley at her last known address,schaaf and trooper fries spoke with a confidential informant ci.werra,wl,at.the ci,whom the officers identified as christine,had provided schaaf with reliable information concerning the location of a suspect in the past.id.when asked about daley whereabouts,the ci responded that daley was staying at menlo street and that she had seen daley there recently.id.based on the ci tip,and their suspicion that known drug well be staying at a sober house like menlo street,the officers proceeded to that address instead.see also id.at the tip that daley was staying at that address came from a previously reliable informant and was consistent with what schaaf knew about both daley drug abuse and the building at menlo street.to increase chances that daley would be home,they arrived relatively early in the morning,at approximately id.at.
although the question is a close one,these findings satisfy payton inquiry that police armed with a valid arrest warrant may enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.payton new york,united states graham,f d,cir recognizing that payton is satisfied when the police reasonably believed prior to entry that the suspect resided at the apartment and would be present 
as for payton first prong,the officers had reason to believe that daley resided at menlo street.detective schaaf and trooper fries obtained information that daley was staying at menlo street during a encounter with a reliable ci who was personally known to them.it was specific and based on the ci observations.and the ci presumably knew that,if that information was false,the officers could find her and hold her accountable.we have not required police to corroborate tips of this ilk in comparable circumstances.romain,at no independent corroboration required in order for police to make terry determinations following encounter with informant.
moreover,other courts have held that payton first prong was satisfied based exclusively on uncorroborated information gleaned from reliable cis.for example,in united states gay,the tenth circuit held that payton first prong was satisfied when police engaged in a discussion with a ci,who told them the location of the residence based on personal knowledge,and presumably remained accountable if the tip was fabricated,cir.here,daley history of drug abuse,along with the officers familiarity with cicerano and menlo street reputation,gave the officers at least some additional indicia that the ci information was likely correct 
as for payton second prong,the officers had reason to believe that daley would be present when they entered.in united states hayes,a case that bears an uncanny resemblance to this one,the seventh circuit held that a weekday entry easily satisfied payton second prong.app x,cir.there,the court pointed to a tip from the building caretaker that the defendant had been there recently and to the defendant history of drug abuse.id.observing that the defendant was an unemployed drug addict with no car see also valdez mcpheters,cir noontime entry on weekday reasonable in part because the defendant sometimes abused drugs.
similarly,here the officers entered menlo street at on a weekday based on a tip from a reliable ci who had seen daley there recently and their knowledge that she had a history of drug abuse.considering also that daley was a fugitive,see el bey roop,cir the defendant fugitive status also increased the likelihood that he might be at home during business hours,the officers could reasonably assume that she was at home when they entered.see generally lafave,search seizure collecting cases stating,in the absence of facts tending to show that the defendant is not at home it is reasonable to infer that he would be there 
the prompt execution of arrest warrants serves an important governmental interest.armed with new and reliable information about a suspect whereabouts,police should be able to respond rapidly.this is especially true with respect to fugitives,who often take steps to avoid apprehension.in this case,requiring the police to delay apprehension in order to verify information they obtained from a reliable ci disserves that interest and upsets the balance payton sought to strike.
i respectfully dissent.
appellant argues on appeal that the district court went beyond the evidence in finding that christine told the officers that daley not only was seen at menlo street,but also was staying there.although the record lends support to appellant contention,resolution of the factual dispute is unnecessary.see infra note.
the officers testified that cicerano had invited them into the house,but the district court largely credit ed cicerano contrary account of their entry.werra,wl,at.
daley was in fact found at menlo street and arrested.
recognizing that the facts underlying the motion to suppress offer the potential for multiple branches to the decision tree,the district court also assessed werra reasonable expectation of privacy in the foyer at menlo street.werra,wl,at.
in payton,the supreme court held that a valid arrest warrant implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.at.
in summers,the court held that a search warrant gives officers the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.at.this case involves an arrest warrant rather than a search warrant,but the district court found the difference of no consequence.it noted that other courts have extended summers to the arrest context on the ground that the same law enforcement interests are applicable in both scenarios.werra,wl,at citing cherrington skeeter,cir united states enslin,cir.
in united states romain,cir,we decline d to adopt a per se rule banning the terry doctrine from residential settings and similarly decline d any suggestion that terry requirement of particularized suspicion is in any way diminished within the home simply because an officer legitimately enters upon its premises.id.at.
we acknowledge,as the dissent emphasizes,that there are other cases relevant to the issue.none is precisely on point,and we find none more apt than the ones we have cited.as we have explained,the inquiry requires a close,holistic review of the particular record at issue.our conclusion in this case is a product of such a review.
the specific exchange between the prosecutor and werra was as follows q.that was your own personal space up there.that what you were paying rent.when melissa was there,yes.
when asked if werra could shut the door to the third floor cicerano responded i imagine,yeah.but with the downstairs being shut down,if you asking me could people have partied up there that night i ca tell you.cicerano was then asked if werra had the ability,had he wanted to,to keep people out of the third floor.he responded yes,but with the first floor being shut down,it would have been kind,yeah,he did.
the exchange on that issue,in relevant part,was as follows q.but at some point you decided it was too much trouble to go upstairs,and you just started living on the first floor there.the third floor had a bathroom.yes,it.and it was only three flights up.yeah,but there was also a bathroom on the first and second floor.
as an example of the imprecision in the record,the court stated that it is unclear whether the residents shared bathrooms and kitchens,to precisely what extent they were assigned specific parts of the building,and whether they locked doors to keep other people out.werra,wl,at.
even if,as our dissenting colleague asserts,the district court impliedly credited cicerano notion of how often werra slept in the living room over werra statement that he spent many nights there,there is no basis for concluding that the court generally disbelieved werra and hence we should disregard all of his testimony.the court analysis of werra expectation of privacy in the foyer was brief and,as noted,it emphasized the details missing from t
