opinion of the court 
in this interlocutory appeal filed by the united states we must interpret for the first time for this court the meaning of testimonial evidence as used in the supreme court recent decision in crawford washington,d,and determine its application to legally obtained wiretap evidence and evidence of conversations between some of the defendants and a murdered confidential informant ci.the district court for the virgin islands in ruling on the government motion in limine,held that because of crawford such evidence could not be introduced at trial.the united states appeals.for the reasons explained below,we will reverse the decision of the district court,and will remand in order to afford the district court the opportunity to analyze the disputed evidence under the proper standards 
on april,a federal grand jury sitting in the united states virgin islands returned a indictment charging andy antoine,jacquelyn carr,rafael cintron,rudolph clarke,elroy dowe,daniel fleming,craig hendricks,ranney laronde,kalisha martin,and russell robinson with one or more counts of conspiracy,narcotics possession and distribution,and money laundering according to the indictment,hendricks,who is the owner of a marine services business,was the leader of a organization,which prior to the arrests of the defendants,imported and distributed cocaine and marijuana throughout the united states virgin islands and elsewhere.
on january,the united states filed a motion in limine seeking pretrial rulings on the admissibility of,inter alia electronic surveillance tapes obtained pursuant to a court authorized wiretap issued under et hereinafter the title iii recordings and recordings of conversations between confidential informant hector rivera ci rivera and various of the defendants the united states maintained that the recordings and conversations at issue qualified either as admissions of a party opponent,see.d a,coconspirator statements,see.d e,statements against interest,see.b,or as statements covered by the residual hearsay exception,see,and thus were admissible.
in a memorandum opinion dated april,the district court ruled that crawford,in which the supreme court interpreted the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment of the united states constitution,has superceded the federal rules of evidence in barring all statements made by an unavailable witness whom a defendant has not had the chance to,with exceptions only for dying declarations and forfeiture for wrongdoing.at the district court noted that the defendants never had an opportunity to ci rivera and that due to ci rivera death,he would not be available to testify at trial.the district court therefore ruled that the united states could not introduce the conversations involving ci rivera at trial.
similarly,regarding the title iii recordings,the district court noted that the united states had not shown that any statement recorded on the wiretap was made by a person who is no longer available and whom defendants have had an opportunity to.at.thus,it ruled that the united states could not introduce at trial any statements intercepted in the title iii wiretaps except those statements made by a witness who testifies at trial.at.
the united states thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration.in its motion,the government noted that the rule announced in crawford is only applicable to testimonial hearsay statements.at citing crawford,at.at.it follows,the government argued,that nontestimonial hearsay statements may still be admitted as evidence against an accused if they satisf y both prongs of the ohio roberts,d,test.at quoting state rivera.the united states urged that none of the evidence at issue fell within the definition of testimonial hearsay it contended that therefore the evidence was not subject to the rule of crawford.
by order dated may,the district court denied the united states motion for reconsideration.although it agreed with the government that the crawford holding is inapplicable to nontestimonial statements,it found that the evidence at issue qualified as testimonial statements and thus fell within the rule of crawford.the united states thereafter lodged this timely interlocutory appeal.see generally an appeal by the united states shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence not made after the defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict or finding on an indictment.
the district court decision to exclude the evidence at issue turned on its application of the sixth amendment and its interpretation of the supreme court decision in crawford.this interlocutory appeal thus presents a question of law which we review de novo.united states trala,cir united states barbosa,cir.
as noted by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit,the recent decision in crawford has changed the legal landscape for determining whether the admission of hearsay statements violates the accused right s under the confrontation clause.horton allen,cir see also united states mcclain,cir crawford redefines the court sixth amendment jurisprudence.a somewhat detailed recounting of that case,therefore,is useful for resolution of the case at bar.
the state of washington charged michael crawford with assault and attempted murder for stabbing kenneth lee,a man crawford believed had tried to rape his wife.during the police investigation,both crawford and his wife gave formal statements to law enforcement officials.in her statement,crawford generally corroborated her husband version of the events leading up to the fight however,her account of the fight itself was arguably different from that of her husband with respect to whether lee had drawn a weapon before crawford struck him.crawford,at.at.
at trial,crawford claimed.under a washington statute regarding marital privilege,crawford was unavailable to testify.at.at.the prosecution sought to have crawford statements to the police admitted through a codified hearsay exception.in response,crawford argued that,notwithstanding the hearsay exception,the admission of his wife statements would violate the confrontation clause.the trial court,relying on ohio roberts,d,found crawford statements trustworthy and thus admitted them.crawford,at.at.
in roberts,the supreme court had held that the confrontation clause does not preclude the admission of an unavailable witness hearsay statement if it bears adequate indicia of reliability.roberts,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.under roberts,a hearsay statement contains adequate indicia of reliability if it falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or if it bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.applying this test,the trial court found crawford statements trustworthy and therefore admissible.although the washington court of appeals reversed that decision,citing reasons why crawford statements were not trustworthy,the washington supreme court agreed with the trial court that crawford statements showed sufficient evidence of trustworthiness to be admitted.at.at.the united states supreme court granted crawford petition for certiorari.
justice scalia,writing for the court,began by highlighting the differences between the common law practice of receiving evidence through live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing with the civil law practice of receiving evidence through ex parte private examinations of witnesses by government officials.although the court noted that common law systems had occasionally adopted and utilized elements of the civil law practice referring at some length to the notorious english trial of sir walter raleigh,it recognized that,as illustrated by various state constitutional provisions circa,the introduction of ex parte examinations against an accused has long been considered an anathema in common law systems in general and in the american system in particular.at.at.
after surveying various sources,the court stated that the principal evil at which the confrontation clause was directed was the mode of criminal procedure,and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.at.at see also united states lee,cir discussing crawford,noting the central function of this right of confrontation is to protect individuals from the use of ex parte statements as evidence against them in a criminal trial.with the principal focus of the confrontation clause thus established,the court proceeded to uncouple the rationale undergirding the prohibition against hearsay from the impetus behind the confrontation clause,suggesting that not all hearsay implicates the sixth amendment core concerns.at.at see also thomas reed,crawford washington the irretrievable breakdown of a union separating the confrontation clause from the hearsay rule.it continued 
an,overheard remark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules,but it bears little resemblance to the abuses the confrontation clause targeted.on the other hand,ex parte examinations might sometimes be admissible under modern hearsay rules,but the framers certainly would not have condoned them.
crawford,at.at.
the crawford court noted that the text of the confrontation clause is supportive of this distinction.the clause provides in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.thus,the clause applies to witnesses against the other words,those who bear testimony.at.at emphasis added quoting webster,an american dictionary of the english language.as recognized by the crawford court testimony,is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.at.at quoting webster,an american dictionary of the english language.thus,a person who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.crawford,at.at.
after engaging in this historical and textual analysis,the court concluded that,even if the confrontation clause is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay,that is its primary object.crawford,at.at.the court further opined that,w here testimonial statements are involved,we do not think the framers meant to leave the sixth amendment protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence,much less to amorphous notions of reliability.at.at.
therefore,the court,partially abrogating roberts,held that testimonial hearsay statements may not be introduced against a defendant unless the declarant is unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant.at.at.importantly,this outcome obtains regardless of whether the statement at issue falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or has a particularized guarantee of trustworthiness.id in sum,insofar as testimonial evidence is concerned,crawford replaced the malleable judicial inquiry mandated by roberts with a virtually per se rule of exclusion.see united states saget,cir it is clear that a court faced with an testimonial statement need not perform the roberts reliability analysis,as crawford replaces that analysis with a rule drawn from the historical origins of the confrontation clause.
the lynchpin of the crawford decision thus is its distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay simply put,the rule announced in crawford applies only to the former category of statements.crawford,at.at.as the court explained where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue,it is wholly consistent with the framers design to afford flexibility in the development of hearsay does roberts,and as would an approach that exempted such statements from confrontation clause scrutiny altogether.id thus,unless a particular hearsay statement qualifies as testimonial,crawford is inapplicable and roberts still controls.
notwithstanding the centrality of the term to its decision,the crawford court expressly declined to provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial statements.crawford,at.at id.at.at rehnquist,concurring.it did,however,reference several formulations of the core class of testimonial statements and further provided some concrete examples of evidence that is obviously testimonial.crawford,at.at see also united states manfre,cir the court in crawford specifically left ambiguous the definition of testimonial but did not leave us without some bench marks.
crawford had suggested defining testimonial statements as ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.at.at quoting brief for petitioner crawford.in its opinion,the court adopted crawford suggestion as examples of testimonial statements to which its opinion would apply.the court also referred to justice thomas earlier definition of testimonial statements as extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.at.at quoting white illinois,d thomas,concurring.the third and broadest formulation,offered to the court by amicus curiae the national association of criminal defense lawyers nacdl,would define testimonial statements as those made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement s would be available for use at a later trial.at.at quoting brief of nacdl.finally,the court provided several concrete examples of obviously testimonial statements,referencing prior testimony given at a preliminary hearing,before a grand jury,or at a former trial and to police interrogations.at.at.
as we noted above,the court declined to adopt any specific definition of testimonial statements.instead,it resolved the case by noting that formal s tatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are testimonial under even a narrow standard.crawford,at.at.the court therefore held that the trial court admission of crawford statements to the police as evidence against crawford violated his rights under the sixth amendment.
with this summary in place,it is now appropriate to consider how the confrontation clause analysis in crawford applies to the case at bar.
a.the title iii recordings 
following the decision in crawford,the courts of appeals have struggled with the definition of testimonial hearsay.see,united states,cir we conclude that llaurador signed confession,presented under oath to the prosecutor in puerto rico,is testimonial hearsay within the meaning given by the supreme court in crawford.united states cromer,cir stating that a statement made knowingly to the authorities that describes criminal activity is almost always testimonial and thus concluding that ci statement to police wherein ci implicated defendant in criminal activity constituted testimonial hearsay parle runnels,cir suggesting,in dictum,that statements contained in diary constituted nontestimonial hearsay united states bruno,cir stating that plea allocution transcript and grand jury testimony of unavailable witnesses constituted testimonial hearsay see generally robert mosteller,crawford washington encouraging securing the confrontation of witnesses,rich.
