nearly thirty years ago,alan newton was wrongly convicted of a crime he did commit.he served over twenty years in prison.had he been given access to exonerating dna evidence that the city of new york long misplaced and mishandled,newton very likely would have been a free man years earlier.newton and his attorneys procured his freedom,and a new york state court vacated his conviction,only after countless efforts to access that evidence finally came to fruition in.once freed,newton sued the city and various officials in the new york city police department nypd,claiming that the city evidence management system was inadequate and had deprived him of his rights to due process and access to the courts in violation of the fourteenth and first amendments,respectively.newton prevailed in a federal jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on these constitutional claims against the city,but the district court set aside the verdict based on our decision in mckithen brown,cir.
we consider two primary issues on appeal.first,does new york law provide a convicted prisoner a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with newly available dna evidence second,if so,does the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment entitle such a prisoner to reasonable procedures that permit him to vindicate that liberty interest mckithen answers neither of these questions district attorney office for the third judicial district osborne,d,requires that we answer both in the affirmative.we therefore vacate and remand with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict with respect to newton fourteenth amendment claim and to reconsider newton first amendment claim in light of this opinion.
background 
alan newton conviction 
on june,a woman,was assaulted,raped,and robbed after leaving a convenience store in the bronx.lost her left eye and suffered four broken ribs.she described her attacker to a police detective as a black male who identified himself as willie,approximately five feet,nine inches tall,from to years old,with a moustache and short,neat afro.the nypd collected a rape kit from that contained pubic and head hair,three cotton swabs,and four microscope slides.based on photo arrays and later an,identified newton as her assailant.a store clerk,too,identified newton from a photo array and a.
in may a bronx county jury convicted newton of rape,robbery,and assault based on eyewitness testimony,including the store clerk and identification of newton as her attacker.newton was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of eight and to years for each of the rape and robbery charges and a consecutive term of five to fifteen years for the assault.the rape kit was not tested for dna evidence prior to newton trial 
attempts to obtain dna testing and exoneration 
in newton moved for an order authorizing an expert to inspect the rape kit and conduct forensic tests to permit him to move to set aside his verdict pursuant to new york criminal procedure law section the new york state supreme court granted newton motion and ordered the bronx county district attorney to arrange to deliver the dna sample to the city office of the chief medical examiner,where newton expert could supervise testing.the district attorney office retrieved the rape kit from the nypd property clerk division pcd and delivered it to the office of the chief medical examiner,which reported that the sample contained no testable spermatozoa.
six years later,in,the new york state legislature enacted new york criminal procedure law section a,which permits a defendant to seek testing of dna evidence in order to vacate his conviction as follows 
w here the defendant motion requests the performance of a forensic dna test on specified evidence,and upon the court determination that any evidence containing deoxyribonucleic acid dna was secured in connection with the trial resulting in the judgment,the court shall grant the application for forensic dna testing of such evidence upon its determination that if a dna test had been conducted on such evidence,and if the results had been admitted in the trial resulting in the judgment,there exists a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendant.
proc.law a mckinney.shortly after section a was enacted,newton filed a pro se motion in state court seeking dna testing of the rape kit on the ground that technological advances since had enabled scientists to test samples they had previously deemed untestable.in opposing the motion,the district attorney office responded that its extensive investigation had revealed that the physical evidence was never returned after the analysis and that the rape kit could not be found at the district attorney office,the pcd,or the office of the chief medical examiner.the state court denied newton motion.
in newton filed a habeas corpus petition under in the southern district of new york.in the course of the habeas proceeding,and in response to newton request in that proceeding that the city produce the rape kit for testing,the city informed newton and the court that the kit could not be located.joint app x.other than clothes,which the city was able to find as part of its response to newton petition,little else appears to have come of newton habeas proceeding.and so,in,newton again sought dna testing of the rape kit and other physical evidence from state court.citing conversations with the pcd,the district attorney office reaffirmed that the rape kit could not be located and opposed the motion.as part of the government opposition,an nypd sergeant explained that the voucher describing the location of the rape kit was not in its last listed location and that the kit must have been destroyed.joint app x.the sergeant elaborated that the voucher was probably destroyed,either because a fire at the property clerk office had destroyed several files or because the property clerk office had a practice of destroying inactive records after six years.although the state court granted newton motion insofar as he sought dna testing of clothes,which the police had found,it denied his motion as to the rape kit.
in newton,through counsel,asked an assistant district attorney ada who was then chief of the sex crimes bureau of the bronx county district attorney office and who had previously not been directly responsible for handling newton case whether the pcd would search once more for the rape kit.attaching a copy of the voucher that had previously been reported lost,the ada asked inspector jack trabitz at the pcd to retrieve the rape kit based on the barrel number for the rape kit that appeared on the voucher,the pcd was able to find the rape kit in a barrel located in the pcd pearson place warehouse in queens.
in june the office of the chief medical examiner concluded that the dna profile derived from the rape kit did not match newton dna profile.within a month,newton and the district attorney office jointly moved to vacate his conviction.the next day,the new york state supreme court vacated newton conviction pursuant to new york criminal procedure law section g.by this time,newton had been incarcerated for more than twenty years.he had been seeking the evidence for the renewed testing that exonerated him and had been repeatedly told that it no longer existed and could not be found for over a decade.
newton lawsuit 
newton was immediately released from prison and filed his lawsuit a year later.his complaint asserted causes of action against the city and individual defendants.as relevant to this appeal,newton alleged that the city evidence management system deprive d him of important and well established rights under the fourth,fifth,sixth,eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,as well as his right to access to the courts under the first amendment.in october the district court dismissed his constitutional claims against the individual defendants so that only common law claims remained against some of them.
relying on osborne,however,the district court allowed newton to continue his claim against the city for violating his due process rights in osborne,the supreme court ruled that an alaska statute that permitted a prisoner to challenge his conviction when newly discovered evidence requires vacatur of the conviction gave the plaintiff a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence.at.the district court concluded that section a a of new york criminal procedure conferred on newton a similar liberty interest in vacating his conviction by accessing evidence in the state possession for the purpose of dna testing.newton city of new york,d.the court also determined that newton had raised a triable question as to whether new york procedures were inadequate to vindicate his rights newton has tested new york procedures and has shown them to fail.id.at.
before trial,discovery in the case uncovered the original voucher for the rape kit,which in turn revealed that the pcd had received a photocopy of an log from the city corporation counsel in indicating that the rape kit had last been removed in.the photocopy had prompted the pcd to review the file of vouchers for and led to the discovery of the original voucher in that file.
after a trial,a jury found that the city had denied newton his first amendment right of access to the courts and his fourteenth amendment right to due process of law,had engaged in a pattern,custom or practice of mishandling evidence and acted with an intent to deprive newton of his constitutional rights or with a reckless disregard of those rights,and had proximately caused newton protracted incarceration the jury awarded newton million in compensatory damages against the city.
the defendants moved to set aside the verdict pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that our decision in mckithen brown,issued after the verdict,foreclosed relief.in granting that motion,the district court relied on mckithen,osborne,and new york criminal procedure law section a b.based on mckithen and osborne,it determined that newton did not have a right to receive the dna evidence,but merely a right to the process under the new york statute.newton city of new york,d,emphases omitted.it also interpreted section a b as authorizing a state court,faced with a motion to vacate,to order the police to disclose the last known physical location of evidence,but preventing the same court from drawing an unfavorable inference from the fact that the evidence has been lost.id.at.the district court observed that prior to the enactment of section a b in the city was not obligated to disclose the location of evidence and that,in any event,section a b contemplated the possibility of lost evidence.id.at.for these reasons,the district court held that newton was entitled to no more than the last known location of the evidence.
the district court also held that newton constitutional due process claim failed because there was not enough evidence that city officials had acted with a culpable state of mind.id.at.it concluded that although newton had demonstrated that the city evidence management system was deficient,he had failed to prove that a specific person had acted with anything more than negligence.in addition,relying on the failure of his underlying fourteenth amendment claim,the district court granted the city motion to set aside the verdict as to newton first amendment claim.
newton appealed.

fourteenth amendment due process claim 
we review newton fourteenth amendment due process claim according to the familiar test for analyzing alleged deprivations of procedural due process rights whether newton has a cognizable liberty or property interest under state or federal law and if so,whether newton was afforded the process he was due under the constitution.mckithen,at.
newton liberty interest 
to determine whether new york law conferred on newton a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with newly discovered evidence,we start with osborne.
william osborne was convicted by an alaska jury of kidnapping,assault,and sexual assault and sentenced to years in prison.at.in a federal proceeding,osborne sued state officials under,claiming the due process clause gave him a constitutional right to access dna evidence in the case for testing by an advanced method not available at the time of his trial.id.at.the ninth circuit held that alaska was required to disclose the dna evidence to osborne as part of its brady obligations,which extended to certain potentially viable claims of actual innocence.osborne dist.att y office for the third judicial,cir,rev,d.without identifying the precise standard osborne needed to satisfy in order to prevail on his claim,the ninth circuit determined that osborne had demonstrated more than a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted had the dna evidence been disclosed to the defense at trial.id.at.
the supreme court reversed on the ground that there was no freestanding substantive due process right to dna evidence.at.citing the progress of individual states in passing statutes,the court expressed its reluctance to expand the scope of substantive due process or to embroil federal courts in questions of policy for example,questions such as how long a state must preserve forensic evidence that might later be tested,or whether a state would be obligated to collect evidence before trial.id.at.
despite its reservations about expanding the scope of the substantive due process right,the court located a liberty interest grounded in a general relief statute enacted by the alaska legislature that made evidence from dna testing available to defendants.id.at.that statute provided 
a person who has been convicted of,or sentenced for,a crime may institute a proceeding for relief if the person claims that there exists evidence of material facts,not previously presented and heard by the court,that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in the interest of justice 
alaska stat.a related provision stated,in relevant part 
b a court may hear a claim brought under alaska stat.based on newly discovered evidence if the applicant establishes due diligence in presenting the claim and sets out facts supported by evidence that is admissible and d that establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant is innocent.
alaska stat.based on these alaska statutory provisions,the court concluded that osborne does have a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence under state law,at,and that alaska provides a substantive right to be released on a sufficiently compelling showing of new evidence that establishes innocence,id.at.
the city does not genuinely dispute that new york law conferred on newton a liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence.mckithen,at.newton retains such an interest even without the city concession.for the purpose of determining whether a liberty interest exists in this case,we think the new york statute that newton invokes is materially indistinguishable from the alaska statute upon which osborne relied.specifically,at the time newton filed suit,section g of the new york criminal procedure law provided that a court may,upon motion of the defendant,vacate a conviction on the ground that n ew evidence has been discovered that would probably have led to an outcome at trial more favorable to the defendant.proc.law g mckinney.moreover,the state explicit statement on the importance of dna testing reflected in its enactment of section a in only strengthens the case for state recognition of a liberty interest.
what process was due 
we turn next to determine what process was due to vindicate newton liberty interest in demonstrating his innocence with new evidence,mindful of osborne related pronouncement that t his right can,in some circumstances,beget yet other rights to procedures essential to the realization of the parent right.at quoting.bd.of pardons dumschat,d.
as the supreme court explained,a criminal defendant proved guilty after a fair trial does not have the same liberty interests as a free man.id.in identifying any other procedural rights that may exist in this case,therefore,we start with the principle that a defendant who has been convicted after a fair trial has only a limited interest in postconviction relief and that the state may flexibly fashion and limit procedures to offer such relief.id.at.we have explained that the deferential standard of medina california,d,governs the process due a prisoner seeking evidence for the purpose of obtaining relief.mckithen,at.in keeping with that standard,which the medina court described as applying to state procedural rules which are part of the criminal process,we evaluate new york procedures for fundamental adequacy.id.at quoting medina,at.fundamental adequacy does not mean that state procedures must be flawless or that every prisoner may access the dna evidence collected in his case.nor does it mean that dna evidence must be stored indefinitely.it means only that when state law confers a liberty interest in proving a prisoner innocence with dna evidence,there must be an adequate system in place for accessing that evidence that does not offend some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,or transgress any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in operation.medina,at,quotation marks omitted.
before turning to new york law both in mckithen and in this case,we consider how these principles applied to the alaska statute in osborne.the procedures alaska implemented to vindicate a defendant right to relief could not plausibly be described as inadequate under the medina standard with caveats not relevant here,alaska law provided for discovery of newly available dna evidence in proceedings,at,and the alaska courts reinforced the statutory protection with a prophylactic measure that permitted defendants to access dna evidence if they could demonstrate that the conviction rested primarily on eyewitness identification evidence,there was a demonstrable doubt concerning the identification of the defendant,and scientific testing was likely to resolve the doubt,id.at citing osborne state,alaska.moreover,in concluding that the alaska state procedures we re adequate on their face,the supreme court emphasized that without trying them,osborne could hardly complain that they do not work in practice,id.at,and that osborne decision to file a action instead of avail ing himself of all possible avenues for relief in alaska state court had impaired his due process claim,id.at stevens,dissenting summarizing majority opinion.accordingly,the court concluded that osborne had received the process he was due and had no federal constitutional right to the dna evidence he sought.
although,as we have pointed out,the new york statute at issue in this case,section a,is in several respects quite similar to the alaska statute in osborne,what differences exist between the two statutes inure to newton benefit.for example,alaska statute requires that the new evidence prove actual innocence by clear and convincing evidence,while new york section a demands less of new york defendants,who must show only that the evidence creates a probability of a more favorable outcome.considering the similarities and differences between the two statutes,we conclude that the liberty interest created by new york law is no narrower than that created by alaska law procedures for vindicating this interest therefore should also be evaluated under the standard described in osborne.
in asking us in effect to condone its evidence management procedures in this case,the city invokes our decision in mckithen,on which the district court also relied to dismiss newton fourteenth amendment claim.mckithen had been convicted by a queens jury of a number of serious crimes.he moved pursuant to section a a for dna testing of evidence recovered at the crime scene.the state court denied his motion on the ground that there was no reasonable probability that mckithen would have received a more favorable verdict had the forensic testing been performed and the results been admitted at trial.at.mckithen then sued the queens district attorney in federal court,claiming that the denial of access to evidence for dna testing on its face violated his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.rejecting mckithen facial due process challenge,we held that new york state procedure for relief under section a a is facially adequate,see id.at,and that federal courts are to defer to the judgment of state legislatures concerning the process due prisoners seeking evidence for their state court actions,id.at.our decision in mckithen thus represented a straightforward application of osborne to new york state law,as both osborne and mckithen addressed direct facial challenges by plaintiffs relating to the effectiveness of state in contrast to municipal relief procedures.see osborne,at.
mckithen resolved an issue different from the one that this appeal compels us to consider.unlike mckithen,newton readily concedes that the state statutory procedures are adequate.instead,he contends that the city,not the state,provided him with fundamentally inadequate process by undermining the state procedures by its recklessly chaotic evidence management system.having demonstrated that in contrast to osborne and mckithen he diligently and repeatedly tried the state procedures for obtaining the necessary dna evidence,newton claims that the nypd evidence management system was so inadequate as to nullify those procedures.this appeal and newton arguments thus present an issue that we have yet to address relating to the interaction between state law and local government in the context of relief.we are unaware of precedent that prevents newton from challenging a municipal custom or practice that,he contends,undermines otherwise adequate state procedures.mckithen certainly does not do so,and so the district court erred insofar as it held that mckithen squarely foreclosed newton claims.moreover,by pointing out osborne failure to avail himself of alaska procedures,osborne appears to have contemplated precisely such challenges by plaintiffs who attempt unsuccessfully to invoke state relief procedures.see at.
the procedures created by section a require the state,upon a defendant motion,to show what evidence exists and whether the evidence is available for testing.people pitts,in essence,section a creates an essential corollary procedural right to a faithful accounting of evidence.see osborne,at.in new york,local government appears to play an integral role in this process,see admin.code a instructing the property clerk of the pcd to take charge of all property seized by police and requiring that a ll such property be described and registered by the property clerk in a record kept for that purpose,and a failure of local government in carrying out its role can nullify the adequacy of state procedures and expose the municipality to constitutional liability.
this is hardly a new concept.in other contexts we have permitted plaintiffs to pursue claims against municipalities for deprivations of interests.see,kapps wing,cir city administration of state home energy assistance program was constitutionally inadequate to vindicate plaintiffs property interest in program benefits winston city of new york,cir provision of city administrative code violated teachers due process rights by depriving them of a property interest in their contractual right to a pension,derived from the state constitution see also goldberg kelly,d city procedures inadequate to vindicate rights created by state and federal programs.if procedures followed by a municipality rather than a state prove to be constitutionally inadequate,even in the context of facially adequate state procedures,then a defendant may sue the municipality for violating his due process rights on the ground that the municipality implementation of state procedures is inadequate.
even in the realm of municipal rather than state inadequacy,however,we must take care to avoid suddenly constitutionaliz ing the area of dna testing and thereby plac ing the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.osborne,at quoting washington glucksberg.at least three factors help us avoid that pitfall here.
first,reinstating the verdict against the city will not impair the validity of,or expand the rights provided by,section a a.as noted,this case presents a challenge to the city execution of state law,not to the law itself.see mckithen,at t he osborne court was clear that the lower federal courts are to defer to the judgment of state legislatures concerning the process due prisoners seeking evidence for their state court actions.emphasis added see also id.at barring proof of fundamental inadequacy,osborne obligates us to defer to the new york state legislature judgment.we defer to states in this area because it is normally within the power of the state to regulate procedures under which its laws are carried out,patterson new york,d quotation marks omitted,and states have considerable expertise in matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process grounded in centuries of common law tradition,medina,at.
second,when,as here,a municipality promulgates policies or practices that affect the criminal procedure laws of the state,those policies or practices may fail to reflect the considered judgment of the state legislature.a local pattern,custom,or practice may frustrate or even obstruct otherwise adequate state law procedures.in those instances,it seems to us,neither osborne nor medina mandates the same level of deference to local government as they do to state legislative action.
third,the procedural right at issue here is quite narrow newton was not entitled to the preservation of evidence under state law,but only to a faithful accounting of the evidence in the city possession.we do not decide what specific city procedure is necessary to manage and track evidence.we simply reinstate a jury verdict that found that the system was inadequate and that the city,through its agents,servants,or employees,intentionally or recklessly administered an evidence management system that was constitutionally inadequate and that prevented newton from vindicating his liberty interest in violation of his fourteenth amendment right to due process.
the addition in of new york criminal procedure law section a b does not alter our analysis.that section provides that in conjunction with a motion to vacate under section 
t he court may direct the people to provide the defendant with information in the possession of the people concerning the current physical location of the specified evidence and if the specified evidence no longer exists or the physical location of the specified evidence is unknown,a representation to that effect and information and documentary evidence in the possession of the people concerning the last known physical location of such specified evidence.if there is a finding by the court that the specified evidence no longer exists or the physical location of such specified evidence is unknown,such information in and of itself shall not be a factor from which any inference unfavorable to the people may be drawn by the court in deciding a motion under this section.
proc.law a b.by envisioning that evidence might be lost or destroyed,the provision reinforces the limited nature of a convicted defendant liberty interest in proving his innocence through dna evidence.but it does so without eliminating the requirement that fundamentally adequate procedures be in place to allow the defendant to vindicate that interest.again,a fundamentally adequate system for permitting defendants to access evidence does not mean one in which evidence is never lost or destroyed.any police department will occasionally lose evidence,including useful evidence absent more,that lapse will not violate a defendant due process rights.see arizona youngblood,d.rather,section a b is consistent with requiring the nypd evidence management system to provide an adequate means to determine if evidence is available for testing and,if so,where the evidence is located.in addition,section a b proscription that no inference unfavorable to the people may be drawn from the fact that evidence is missing or destroyed applies exclusively to motions to vacate.the legislature reasonable determination that a convicted defendant should not be released because the police have lost relevant evidence does not prevent an exonerated person from having a civil remedy under against a municipality for an inadequate evidence management system.
whether the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that the city denied newton the process he was due 
to impose liability on a municipality under,a plaintiff must identify a municipal policy or custom that caused the plaintiff injury.bd.of cnty.comm rs of bryan cnty.brown,d citing monell dep t of soc.servs.of the city of,d.the city acknowledges that the district court correctly instructed the jury that in order to find the city liable it was required to find that the municipality itself directly cause d the constitutional violation by a policy,custom or practice,that is,a persistent,widespread course of conduct by municipal officials or employees that has become the usual and accepted way of carrying out policy,and has acquired the force of law,even though the municipality has not necessarily formally adopted or announced the custom.joint app x.nevertheless,the city argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings that the city evidence management system was fundamentally inadequate,and that the city officials failures and misconduct relating to that system reflected a practice or custom.
a careful review of the record demonstrates otherwise.the pcd property guide describes the nypd official evidence management system and also contains the pcd policies and procedures for storing and tracking evidence.according to the property guide,a key tool for tracking a particular piece of property was a yellow invoice created when the property arrived at a pcd borough office.the yellow invoice was stored in an active yellows file.whenever the property moved,its new location was to be printed on the yellow invoice.when the property was transported to court,the yellow invoice was to be stored temporarily in an yellows file,with an out of custody card placed in its stead in the active yellows file.when the property was destroyed or auctioned,that fact and the date of destruction or sale were noted on the yellow invoice and the invoice itself placed in a yellows box.if property was missing from its storage location,the supervisor of the pcd facility was required to start a preliminary search that included asking the arresting officer whether the property was ever removed to court and subsequently repackaged after return,and then checking with pearson place warehouse,a warehouse facility in queens,to determine if the missing property was located there.
the nypd evidence management system failed miserably in newton case.when newton moved for dna testing under section a,the district attorney office filed an opposition containing a statement by an nypd sergeant that mistakenly reported that the evidence and yellow invoice had likely been destroyed.in fact,the yellow invoice for the rape kit had been in the pcd yellows folder since may,when the evidence was first removed to be examined.the invoice had never been returned to the active yellows file,even though the rape kit had been returned to storage at pearson place warehouse.sergeant thomas was involved with documenting property stored in another pcd warehouse in the bronx and ultimately assigned to locate the yellow invoice for the rape kit while newton federal suit was pending.in one search,he found hundreds of propert
