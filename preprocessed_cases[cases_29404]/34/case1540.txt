after wilmington,north carolina police officer daniel roehrig stopped a vehicle in a area of wilmington at for giving chase to another vehicle and running a red light,he observed suspicious conduct of decarlos george,one of the passengers,and asked george to exit the vehicle.upon frisking george,officer roehrig discovered a handgun and arrested him.during george prosecution for possession of a handgun by a felon,in violation of g,george filed a motion to suppress evidence of the handgun,based on his claim that the frisk violated his fourth amendment rights.the district court denied george motion,and george pleaded guilty to the charge.
because the objective facts of record support the reasonableness of officer roehrig suspicion that george was armed and dangerous and thus his authority to conduct a frisk,we affirm.
at on sunday,november,officer roehrig,while patrolling wilmington district two,which he characterized as one of the highest crime areas in the city,observed a station wagon closely and aggressively following another vehicle within a car length as if in a chase.as the two vehicles made a right turn,they ran a red light at the fairly high rate of speed of approximately to miles per hour such that their tires screeched.as officer roehrig pulled behind the vehicles following the turn,the station wagon,which had accelerated to approximately miles per hour,slowed to miles per hour and broke off the chase,making a left turn.officer roehrig followed the station wagon as it made three more successive left turns,which officer roehrig interpreted as an effort by the driver to determine whether he was following the vehicle.when officer roehrig decided to stop the vehicle for its aggressive driving and red light violation,he called for backup,which was answered by officer poelling.with officer poelling nearby,officer roehrig then effected the stop in a parking lot.
as officer roehrig approached the vehicle,he observed four males in it,including decarlos george,who was sitting behind the driver seat.george was holding up his card with his left hand,while turning his head away from the officer.his right hand was on the seat next to his leg and was concealed from view by his thigh.roehrig instructed george to place both of his hands on the headrest of the driver seat in front of him,but george placed only his left hand on the headrest.this caused officer roehrig concern,as he did know what george had in his right hand,but it could easily have been a weapon.officer roehrig directed george again to place both hands on the headrest.as officer roehrig testified,i had to give george several more requests to move his hand.probably i asked four or five times.it was actually getting to the point that i was getting worried about what he had in his right hand.george ultimately complied,but he still never made eye contact with officer roehrig.
once officer roehrig observed that george did not have a weapon in his right hand,he proceeded to speak with weldon moore,the driver of the vehicle.moore denied running the red light and claimed he was not chasing anyone.when officer roehrig informed moore that he had observed moore chasing the other vehicle and going through a red light,moore adjusted his story,now saying that his girlfriend was in the front vehicle and that he was following her home.roehrig found this story inconsistent with moore aggressive chase of the other vehicle and the abandonment of that chase when the police were spotted.he found moore driving to be more consistent with hostile criminal activity,and he questioned the passengers in the car about recent gang violence.
officer roehrig then consulted with officer poelling,and the two decided to remove all four passengers from the car and interview them separately.because the officers were outnumbered,they called for more backup.when backup officers arrived,officer poelling removed the right rear passenger of the vehicle and conducted a protective frisk.officer roehrig then directed george to step out of the vehicle.as george was doing so,he dropped his wallet and cell phone onto the ground.as george bent over to pick the items up,officer roehrig stopped him by holding onto george shirt,fearing that letting george bend over to the ground would create an increased risk of escape.officer roehrig turned george around,had him place his hands on the car,and conducted a protective frisk.during the pat down,roehrig felt an object in george right front pocket that he immediately recognized as a handgun.after announcing the presence of the gun to the other officers,roehrig pressed george against the car and placed him in handcuffs,as a second officer removed the handgun from george pocket.
after the gun was seized,officer roehrig secured george in the back of his patrol car and issued moore a written warning for failing to stop at a red light.upon checking george criminal history,officer roehrig discovered that george was a convicted felon and that the serial number on the gun indicated that it had been stolen.george was charged and pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g.
before pleading guilty,george filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the gun on the ground that it resulted from an unlawful frisk,in violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
at the suppression hearing,george claimed that moore was dropping him off at his home and that they had circled around the block because they had driven past george house on the first pass.george also contended that he had made direct eye contact with officer roehrig during the stop and that he had put both hands on the headrest following officer roehrig first request for him to do so.george also gave an explanation as to how he obtained the firearm,stating that he had found it on the sidewalk when walking home from work.according to george,he accidentally dropped his cell phone,activating the phone light,which illuminated the gun as it was lying on the sidewalk.george claimed that he picked the gun up to get it off the street.
the district court,in denying george motion to suppress,found george testimony inconsistent and implausible and instead credited officer roehrig testimony on george demeanor and actions.george then entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.the district court sentenced george to time served,which amounted to a little over one year.
george filed this appeal,challenging only the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
george acknowledges that officer roehrig had the right to stop the vehicle in which he was a passenger w hen the driver ran the red light.he argues,however,that n o objective facts supporting reasonable suspicion that george was armed or dangerous arose during the stop.stated otherwise,he maintains that the facts of record,as found by the district court,failed to provide officer roehrig with a legal basis to frisk him and that the government and the court merely cobbled together a set of factual circumstances that fell far short of supporting reasonable suspicion in this case.
the facts of record show that officer roehrig legally stopped weldon moore vehicle for running a red light,see whren united states,d,and,after the stop,legally ordered the passengers from the vehicle,see maryland wilson,d.the issue in this case centers on whether,after asking george to exit the vehicle,the facts as found by the district court show that officer roehrig had a sufficient basis to frisk him.this is a legal question that we review de novo.see united states black,cir.
to conduct a lawful frisk of a passenger during a traffic stop,the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous.arizona johnson,d.the officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.terry ohio,d.the reasonable suspicion standard is an objective one,and the officer subjective state of mind is not
