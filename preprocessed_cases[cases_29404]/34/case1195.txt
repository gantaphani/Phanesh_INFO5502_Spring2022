opinion of the court 
introduction 
in light of the automobile exception to the usual search warrant requirement,it is difficult to pick a worse place to conceal evidence of a crime than an automobile.the supreme court has interpreted and reinterpreted the automobile exception so expansively that the court essentially has obviated the requirement that the government obtain a warrant to search a vehicle provided it has probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of a crime.nevertheless,appellee joseph donahue made a successful challenge in the district court to the warrantless search of a vehicle that he had been driving but did not own because the court accepted his contention that the government did not have probable cause for the search.the government appeals from the suppression order entered on november.
we trace the immediate background of this case to donahue conviction for fraud and related offenses and the resulting custodial sentence that a district court imposed on him in the middle district of pennsylvania.the court directed donahue to surrender by a given time at a designated place to serve this sentence but he did not do so.consequently,the court issued a warrant for his arrest and a short time later united states marshals apprehended donahue in las cruces,new mexico,while he was in his son ford mustang.the marshals took possession of the mustang and,over the next five days,personnel from two different federal agencies searched the vehicle several times,photographed,and even it,all without applying for or obtaining a search warrant.eventually an fbi agent found a firearm magazine clip under the mustang driver seat,a discovery that led to their finding a pistol in a bag that they had seized from the mustang trunk.
donahue failure to surrender and the recovery of the pistol resulted in a grand jury returning indictments against him in the middle district of pennsylvania for failure to surrender under a and b a i and for firearms offenses under g,j,and a.donahue filed a motion to suppress evidence found in the mustang and in a hotel room in las cruces in which he had registered under a false name.the district court granted the motion on the ground that the government lacked probable cause for the searches.united states donahue,cr,wl,at.the government appealed from the suppression order to the extent that the court suppressed evidence found in the mustang.the government,however,did not appeal from the portion of the order suppressing the evidence seized in the hotel room.
even though it is clear that the government had the opportunity to seek a warrant before searching the mustang,we hold that the automobile exception to the warrant requirement obviated its need to do so as the government had probable cause for the search of the mustang and its contents inasmuch as the automobile exception was applicable,there were virtually no temporal,physical,or numerical limitations on the search scope.thus,the government could make a broad search of the mustang including its contents,even if contained in packages and could repeat the search as long as it remained in continuous control of the mustang the government took advantage of this broad authority and,in making its search lawfully uncovered evidence that donahue had committed offenses.consequently,the district court should not have suppressed the evidence the government seized in the search.accordingly,we will reverse the order suppressing the evidence seized in the search of the mustang and its contents and we will remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
ii.factual background 
donahue enticed individuals to engage in his business ventures so that he could appropriate their identities and make unauthorized purchases using their credit.this scheme led to his conviction for counts of bank fraud,money laundering,accessing an unauthorized device,and making false statements.united states donahue,app x cir affirming conviction.on december,the district court sentenced donahue to a month custodial term and ordered him to pay in restitution.id.at.the court directed donahue to surrender by january,at his place of confinement at fort dix,new jersey.
donahue,however,did not surrender as ordered,and consequently the district court issued a warrant for his arrest on january.instead of surrendering,donahue drove across the country in his son red ford mustang to las cruces in an attempt to avoid imprisonment.this attempt came to naught when united states marshals in scranton,pennsylvania,in the middle district of pennsylvania,became aware that donahue might be in las cruces and notified authorities there of that information.two weeks after donahue should have surrendered,united states marshals in las cruces,assisted by new mexico state university police,arrested him near the campus when they saw him exit a hotel in which he had registered under an alias and enter his son mustang.united states marshal steven archuleta and other officers ordered donahue to exit the mustang and he did so without incident.archuleta then arrested and searched hi m,finding about in cash.
after archuleta handcuffed donahue and took him to his patrol car,he looked into the mustang and saw a very messy interior,j,containing,among other items,various maps in plain view.following instructions from his supervisor and a deputy united states marshal in scranton,archuleta seized the mustang a step that he acknowledged he probably would not have taken without those orders.inasmuch as archuleta did not know exactly what evidence was needed,he also entered donahue hotel room to take the trash from it and to conduct a superficial search he glanced around the room but did not open any drawers or look into the closets.as we have indicated,the government did not have a warrant for these searches.
the government subsequently transferred the mustang to a marshals facility in las cruces,where the marshals searched it pursuant to their inventory policy.archuleta and two other deputy marshals photographed the vehicle without essentially moving anything around,searched its trunk and cabin including the glove box and other compartments,and removed loose items.this process revealed items and closed bags,which at that time the marshals did not open.the marshals then transferred the vehicle to a public garage and placed the bags and other items that they removed in a secure holding area.
the next day,again under instructions from scranton this time from an fbi regional office an fbi agent in new mexico,amy willeke,retrieved the mustang and drove it to an fbi facility.when willeke reached the fbi facility,she made a second inventory search of the mustang during which she discovered a glock caliber magazine behind the driver seat.
after logging her discovery into evidence and having the car,willeke directed another agent to obtain donahue loose items that the marshals still possessed so that fbi agents could inventory the items and transfer them to scranton.on january,five days after donahue arrest,archuleta and an fbi agent opened and searched the previously seized bags and found a glock pistol.
iii.procedural background 
the foregoing events led a grand jury in the middle district of pennsylvania to return an indictment against donahue for failure to surrender and for weapons charges.donahue subsequently moved in the district court to suppress all the evidence seized from the mustang and the hotel room,arguing that the warrantless searches were unreasonable under the fourth amendment.after a hearing,the court granted donahue motion by order dated november.donahue,wl.
before addressing the substance of donahue motion,the district court found that he had standing to challenge the searches even though he had registered in the hotel under an alias and did not own the mustang.id.at.the court then held that the conditions for the automobile exception,which,if applicable,would have allowed the government to make a warrantless search of the mustang,had not been met because the government lacked probable cause to believe that there was contraband in the vehicle.id.at 
the government appeals,making only one of the arguments it raised in the district court.challenging the basis for the court order,the government contends that it had probable cause to search the mustang because it was reasonable to believe that donahue would be in possession of items that could help him avoid detection and that the possession of those items would support a charge that he knowingly failed to surrender to serve his sentence.appellant br.at.according to the government,none of the items found in plain view in the mustang,including the materials that were not contraband such as maps,newspapers and luggage should have been suppressed.that evidence,the argument runs,though not contraband,helped establish probable cause for the government to conduct a full search of the vehicle.the evidence also tended to show that donahue had planned his flight and acted deliberately in violation of the statute,a,that criminalizes knowing failures to surrender,and that his failure to surrender was not the result of circumstances beyond his control.the latter point was significant because if it could be shown that circumstances beyond donahue control had precluded him from surrendering as ordered,donahue would have had an affirmative defense to the charge,see c.appellant br.at.
iv.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and we have jurisdiction under.we review a district court grant of the motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying facts,but exercise plenary review as to its legality in light of the court properly found facts.united states crandel l,cir internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.on this appeal we exercise only plenary review,as there is no dispute of any material fact.
discussion 
the fourth amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons,houses,papers,and effects.const.amend.iv.but this protection is triggered only if the state invades an area in which the person has a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.new york class,quoting katz united states,harlan,concurring.thus,a defendant moving to suppress evidence seized in a search bears the burden of proving not only that the search was illegal,but also that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the subject of the search.rawlings kentucky.the latter inquiry turns on two specific questions whether the individual demonstrated an actual or subjective expectation of privacy in the subject of the search or seizure and whether this expectation of privacy is objectively justifiable under the circumstances.free speech,att y,cir.
after our initial examination of this appeal,we requested supplemental briefing on the question of whether donahue,who was a fugitive could assert that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in any seized object.we also directed that the briefs address the question of whether the government had preserved an issue for our review.in this regard we note that inmates generally do not possess a legitimate expectation of privacy,hudson palmer,and other courts of appeals have held that prisoners do not the right to such an expectation when they escape from prison,united states lucas,cir en banc united states roy,cir,or when they abscond after a mistaken release,united states ward,cir.see united states randolph,d,aff,app x cir.
although donahue may have forfeited any expectation of privacy that he arguably had in the mustang or its contents after he failed to surrender,we decline to address that possibility because the government did not raise it in the district court and thus did not preserve it for our review.see steagald united states,precluding government from arguing for the first time on appeal that defendant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy see also united states joseph,cir.rather,the government made the argument in the district court that donahue did not have an expectation of privacy in the mustang or its contents or in the hotel room in the first place,a contention that,if accepted,would have rendered a forfeiture argument moot as donahue would have had nothing to forfeit.the government,however,has abandoned even that narrow contention on appeal.
given that the government has not advanced,or at least preserved for our review,any issue on this appeal,we limit our inquiry to the question of whether the automobile exception authorized the government to search the mustang without a warrant the automobile exception permits vehicle searches without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of a crime.united states salmon,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states caraballo rodriguez,cir en banc.the government bears the burden of establishing the applicability of the exception,united states herrold,cir,by a preponderance of the evidence,united states vasey,cir.
although the scope of the warrantless search authorized by the automobile exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant,united states ross,the automobile exception includes two important elements specific to that exception first,i f probable cause justifies the search,it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.at.second,probable cause does not dissipate after the automobile is immobilized because the exception does not include an exigency component.maryland dyson.as a result,the government can search an impounded vehicle without a warrant even though it has secured the vehicle against the loss of evidence and it has the opportunity to obtain a warrant for the search.see michigan thomas,see also united states johns,extending the rule to closed packages seized from vehicles.
the broad sweep of the automobile exception is of controlling significance in this case because if we determine,as in fact we do,that the government had probable cause to seize and search the mustang,two more conclusions will follow from that determination.first,the government was justified in opening the bag found in the mustang trunk containing the pistol.see,united states.alexander,cir u nder the automobile exception to the warrant requirement,the police officers were authorized to open the bag and seize the handgun.second,the delay between the time that the government seized the mustang and the time of the search that uncovered the weapon five days after the government impounded the vehicle was immaterial.see johns,at.at holding that warrantless search of containers seized from a vehicle already impounded for three days was reasonable and consistent with our precedent involving searches of impounded vehicles united states gastiaburo,cir upholding warrantless search of a vehicle days after it was impounded united states mchugh,cir approving search seven days after truck seizure because the supreme court declined to impose an arbitrary temporal restriction on the automobile exception 
as a related matter,our analysis does not distinguish among the government searches starting with archuleta search,followed by willeke search,and concluding with the opening of the closed bags.we see nothing in the supreme court jurisprudence to indicate that the automobile exception may justify only a single search of a seized vehicle.to the contrary,the court has based its reasoning allowing warrantless searches of vehicles in part on the diminished expectation of privacy in a vehicle,and thus the court reasoning supports the conclusion that so long as the government maintains continuous control over the vehicle it needs probable cause only for its initial search and seizure and that subsequent searches should be viewed as part of an ongoing process.united states chadwick,one has a lesser expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle because its function is transportation and it seldom serves as one residence or as the repository of personal effects it travels public thoroughfares where both its occupants and its contents are in plain view.quotation marks and citation omitted.the degree of expectation of privacy does not expand during the time that the government possesses the vehicle.indeed,if anything,th
