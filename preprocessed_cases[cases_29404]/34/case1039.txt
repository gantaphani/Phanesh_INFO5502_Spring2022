appellant george lombardozzi was charged in four counts of a indictment.count charged him with conspiring to make an extortionate extension of credit in violation of count charged him with the substantive offense of making an extortionate extension of credit in violation of count charged him with conspiring to use extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit in violation of and count charged him with using extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit in violation of.the four charges all stemmed from loans amounting to approximately that lombardozzi made in and.a jury convicted lombardozzi of three of the four charged offenses.they acquitted him of count,the substantive offense of using extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit.his conviction was based in part on evidence presented in the form of a plea allocution.following the trial,the united states supreme court decided crawford washington,d,holding that in order for testimonial evidence such as a plea allocution to be admissible against a criminal defendant,the sixth amendment confrontation clause requires the unavailability of the witness and a prior opportunity for of the witness by the defendant.id.at.
lombardozzi raises a number of challenges to his conviction.he argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction that the admission of his plea allocution violated his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights that the district court improperly admitted expert testimony and evidence of prior bad acts and that the government presented perjured testimony to the grand jury.
for the reasons set forth below,the judgment of the district court leisure,is affirmed.
background 
lombardozzi,an alleged member of the gambino la cosa nostra crime family,first met henry leung in at a restaurant that leung managed in manhattan.leung was planning to open a new restaurant and needed a loan to be able to do so.one of leung frequent customers was daniel marino,whom leung knew was engaged in racketeering and loansharking or,as leung described him,a wiseguy involved with the mob.leung asked marino for a loan.in response,marino introduced leung to lombardozzi who agreed to provide him with the loan.leung was told that lombardozzi was the guy who takes care of the money.frank isoldi,another member of marino group and lombardozzi,subsequently met leung in the restaurant wine cellar and gave him a brown paper bag containing in cash.thereafter,leung made repayments to william scotto,whom he described as the muscle for the group.the loan was eventually paid off and is not the subject of the current indictment.
in,leung sought an additional loan from marino group.because marino was incarcerated,lombardozzi and isoldi agreed to loan leung the money.again,in the wine cellar of leung restaurant,isoldi delivered to leung a paper bag containing the money.the terms of the loan originally required repayment in the amount of per month for two years,but scotto subsequently informed leung that the old man whom leung understood to mean changed the terms and increased the payments to per month for two years.
shortly thereafter,leung again borrowed money from lombardozzi and isoldi,this time for both himself and his friend michael wong.he originally asked for for wong and for himself,but the principal amount of the loan eventually ballooned to.leung was required to pay two points,or two percent,interest each week per year,which amounted to per week in interest in addition to the principal.
given the exorbitant payments required,leung had to borrow money from other loansharks just to pay his debt to lombardozzi in a timely manner.the interest on the additional loans was more than twice what he was paying lombardozzi.in addition,leung sold many of his personal possessions,moved to a less expensive residence,and borrowed money from friends.eventually,leung was able to renegotiate the terms of the loans with the other loansharks,although he never sought to do so with lombardozzi.
the fbi approached leung in early seeking information about his dealings with lombardozzi,but leung denied knowing him.leung told isoldi and scotto about the fbi inquiry,and they gave him the phone number of a lawyer.despite the inquiry,the collections continued until lombardozzi was arrested in may.
in september,isoldi pleaded guilty to count of the indictment,under which he was charged as a of lombardozzi with conspiring to use extortionate means to collect on the extension of credit made to leung.in connection with his rule guilty plea proceedings,in response to judge leisure questioning,isoldi allocuted to the relevant facts underlying that charge.then,prior to the commencement of lombardozzi trial in april,the district court granted a motion in limine allowing the government to introduce a redacted version of isoldi plea allocution as evidence against lombardozzi.judge leisure instructed the jury that it was to consider the redacted plea allocution only as evidence of the existence of the conspiracy charged in count of the indictment and the nature of isoldi role in that conspiracy.following a trial,in which the government evidence against lombardozzi consisted of,inter alia,isoldi plea allocution,intercepted telephone calls,leung testimony,and expert testimony,the jury convicted lombardozzi on counts,and.it acquitted him of the substantive offense of using extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit count.the district court sentenced lombardozzi principally to months imprisonment,the lowest sentence possible within the applicable sentencing guidelines range.
discussion 
the government presented sufficient evidence at triala.standard of review 
lombardozzi challenges the sufficiency of the government evidence with respect to two elements of the crimes for which he was convicted.the first is the victim leung understanding that the loans he received were extortionate,an essential element for conviction under.the second is lombardozzi own state of mind with respect to the extortionate nature of the loans and their collection,an essential element for conviction under both and.
as we have repeatedly observed,a defendant raising an appellate challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction faces a heavy burden,because we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.united states gaskin,cir.this deferential standard is especially important when reviewing a conviction of conspiracy because a conspiracy by its very nature is a secretive operation,and it is a rare case where all aspects of a conspiracy can be laid bare in court with the precision of a surgeon scalpel.united states pitre,cir quoting united states provenzano,cir.reversal is warranted only if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.gaskin,at.
statutes under which lombardozzi was convicted 
lombardozzi was convicted of conspiring to make and making extortionate extensions of credit in violation of and conspiring to use extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit in violation of.section a prohibits mak ing any extortionate extension of credit,or conspir ing to do so.an extortionate extension of credit is defined as any extension of credit with respect to which it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time it is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person,reputation,or property of any person.emphasis added.the states of mind of the defendant and the debtor are,therefore,both essential elements of the crime of making extortionate extensions of credit under see united states allen,cir crucial to conviction under this statute is proof that both the creditor and the debtor understood when the loan was made that force could be used to collect the loan at issue.united states natale,cir noting that unlike,the state of mind of the victim is an essential element of to be proved by the government.section b further provides that the government can establish prima facie evidence that a loan was extortionate if it can show the repayment of the loan would be unenforceable through civil judicial process against the debtor,the loan had an annual interest rate in excess of percent,and a t the time the extension of credit was made,the debtor reasonably believed that the creditor had a reputation for the use of extortionate means to collect extensions of credit or to punish the nonrepayment thereof.b.
similarly,a prohibits knowingly participat ing in any way,or conspir ing to do so,in the use of any extortionate means to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit,or to punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof.e xtortionate means is defined as any means which involves the use,or an express or implicit threat of use,of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person,reputation,or property of any person.unlike,proof of a victim borrower state of mind is not an element of this offense.see natale,at noting that it is the conduct of the defendant,not the victim individual state of mind,to which the thrust of is directed.with regard to the defendant state of mind,the government must prove that he intended by his conduct to instill fear of harm in the victim borrower.see united states sears,cir.
whether the evidence was sufficient to prove leung state of mind 
lombardozzi argues that the government evidence was insufficient to prove leung requisite state of mind.we disagree.t he inquiry into the victim borrower state of mind should be whether the record as a whole discloses a reasonable basis upon which the borrower might have predicated his fear that default or delinquency might result in harm to himself or his famil y.annoreno,at.a finding that the record discloses such a reasonable basis does not necessarily depend on evidence of explicit threats made by the creditor,and the victim borrower requisite state of mind can be inferred.see,id.our review of the record compels the conclusion that the nature of these transactions,in which oral,unsecured loans were made at rates of interest often times the commercial rates with provision for nefarious repayment at such places as street corners,taverns,pool halls and closed barber shops,would inform the average borrower that the loans were extortionate in nature.in our analysis,the component of our standard of review that requires us to draw all reasonable inferences in the government favor is significant because even though leung did not testify as to any specific threats or discuss his state of mind in detail,his state of mind can be inferred from the evidence offered at trial.
first,the jury could infer from several portions of leung trial testimony his understanding that violence or criminal harm would result if he defaulted on his loans.leung testified that he was introduced to lombardozzi through marino,someone he knew was a wiseguy involved with the mob,who engaged in racketeering and loansharking.see united states madori,cir upholding the admission of evidence that the debtor believed the creditor was connected to organized crime to show the debtor belief that the creditor would use,or had a reputation for using,extortionate means to collect extensions of credit citing united states gigante,cir.regarding the loans he took out on behalf of his friend wong,leung testified that he sought money from other sources in order to repay the loans b ecause when the time come s,the day to collect,i have got to have the money ready,because they are not going after wong,they are going after me.with regard to making payments in general,moreover,leung testified that he was very nervous because every morning when i wake up,it this money,that money.and i have a business,i can not run away,and i do want anything to happen to the business.in describing a telephone conversation with isoldi about making payments,leung explained that in telling isoldi i f you can help me with that,i would be deeply appreciat ive,he meant that he wanted isoldi to hold off lombardozzi.indeed,he testified that i just do want them to do anything,you know,i a little scared,so that why i just telling him to hold off,hold off lombardozzi.finally,on cross examination,leung testified that when he was having trouble making payments,lombardozzi told him that he had better take care of it.although this statement does not necessarily rise to the level of an explicit threat,it at least permits the inference of an implied threat from which leung fear of harm can be reasonably inferred.see madori,at upholding the admission of evidence of veiled threats to prove the victim borrower state of mind citing gigante,at.
leung understanding that extortionate means would be used to collect on any default can also reasonably be inferred from his testimony regarding the terms of the loan,interest,the delivery of the money in a paper bag in leung wine cellar,and his statement to fbi agent christopher bryceland that isoldi acted as a runner for lombardozzi giving leung the actual cash and collecting payments on lombardozzi behalf.see annoreno,at.leung also testified that he sold his assets,sought loans from friends,and borrowed money from other loansharks at interest rates of more than in order to repay his loan to lombardozzi on time,all evidence from which the jury could permissibly infer that leung feared the consequences of.
finally,the testimony of agent bryceland and conversations between isoldi and leung constitute additional evidence from which the jury could infer leung understanding that delays in making payments could result in violence or other criminal harm.specifically,agent bryceland testified that leung told him that leung believed lombardozzi was involved with organized crime and that he would be dead if he talked to the fbi.leung also informed agent bryceland that he was concerned for his safety and that isoldi and another associate have muscle and would do harm to him personally or to his restaurant if he did not make timely payments.in a telling exchange with agent bryceland,leung initially denied knowing either lombardozzi or isoldi and lied about the loans,likely out of fear for his own safety,and from the taped conversations in evidence,the jury could infer that leung was scared and nervous.see,united states wills,cir noting that it is reasonable for a jury to conclude,based on recorded conversations,that the victim was in fear 
based on the foregoing proof and reasonable inferences that could be drawn from it,the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that leung understood that delay or default in making repayment could result in violence or other criminal harm.
whether the evidence was sufficient to prove lombardozzi state of mind 
with respect to lombardozzi state of mind,under the government had to prove that at the time lombardozzi caused the loan to be made to leung,lombardozzi had an understanding that if leung delayed in making,or failed to make,repayment,leung could be harmed.under the focus is on the defendant actions and intentions with respect to the collection activity.the government had to establish that,in collecting the loans,lombardozzi intended,as the result of his actions,to cause leung to fear he would suffer harm to his person,reputation,or property.lombardozzi argues that the government did not provide evidence sufficient to prove that he had the required state of mind.we disagree.
lombardozzi state of mind,much like leung,can reasonably be inferred from the terms of the loans that he extended.indeed,a jury may permissibly infer that someone who makes an unsecured loan and charges exorbitant interest rates surely intends to back up the loan with threats of violence.see united states polizzi,cir the jury could reasonably have concluded that the evidence proved that defendant knew the victim was paying an extortionate rate of interest on his debt and that defendant must therefore have known that the debt could have been secured only by threats of violence or harm to the victim.given the context of an unsecured loan at an exorbitant interest rate,a jury could also infer from lombardozzi own statements his intent to back up the loan with threats of violence.for instance,he told leung to keep up what he was doing when leung made payments,which leung understood to mean make the payments on time,be a good boy.further,when leung started having trouble making payments,lombardozzi told him that he had better take care of it.it is reasonable for a jury to infer that these statements were threatening in nature,if not direct threats themselves.in addition,those statements permitted the inference that lombardozzi not only understood the extortionate nature of the loan,which is the state of mind required under,but that he intended to instill fear in leung,which is the state of mind required under.while those statements were not made contemporaneously with the making of the loans,they nonetheless did provide evidence as to lombardozzi state of mind regarding their repayment.see united states lamattina,cir although these threats were made after the time of the loans,they may still shed light on appellant intentions when he made the loans.surely,this evidence is more than sufficient to reasonably infer the requisite understanding.
taped conversations between leung and isoldi also shed light on lombardozzi state of mind.the jury was entitled to infer from those conversations that leung was afraid that isoldi,as a coconspirator,was speaking for lombardozzi and that instilling such fear was lombardozzi intent.for example,in one such conversation,occurring at a time when leung was having trouble making payments,isoldi told him i think i going to have to make an appointment for you to see lombardozzi in person,because it going to get out of hand.isoldi also threatened to bring lombardozzi to the restaurant if leung did not make his payments.peter perrotta,isoldi associate,corroborated the details of the conversations.perrotta testified that isoldi seemed very animated that leung was ready to see lombardozzi,and basically said that lombardozzi was going to be happy,and that he does want to have to send scotto.from this evidence,a jury could reasonably infer that lombardozzi intended to harm leung if he did not pay,or at the very least that he intended leung to fear harm,particularly considering the suggestion of sending group muscle to see him.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,there is sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the government proved the requisite states of mind for leung and lombardozzi so as to sustain lombardozzi convictions under and.
the admission of kenneth mccabe expert testimony was not plain error 
a.the expert testimony of kenneth mccabe 
the government called kenneth mccabe,a criminal investigator for the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york,as an expert who testified as to,inter alia,the general structure of la cosa nostra in new york and lombardozzi affiliation with organized crime.on direct examination mccabe was asked whether he had an opinion as to whether lombardozzi is affiliated with organized crime.mccabe answered,yes.george lombardozzi is a soldier in the gambino crime family.earlier in his testimony,in describing the general structure of organized crime,mccabe stated that soldiers are also known as made members.on mccabe testified that his opinion regarding lombardozzi affiliation with organized crime was based on conversations with cooperating witnesses and confidential informants,but added that he personally observed lombardozzi activities approximately two dozen times since.mccabe testified that during his surveillance he witnessed lombardozzi having conversations with known organized crime figures and frequenting social clubs which mccabe identified as meeting place s for organized crime members to socialize and commit planned crimes,collect monies.lombardozzi failed to object to the admission of mccabe testimony on confrontation clause grounds at trial.
lombardozzi now argues on appeal that the admission of mccabe expert testimony was improper under,inter alia the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment because mccabe opinion,in effect,directly conveyed to the jury testimonial statements of confidential informants and cooperating witnesses whom lombardozzi never had an opportunity to.in crawford,the supreme court stated that the confrontation clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted,d.in light of that statement in crawford and this court previous determination that it is permissible for an expert witness to form an opinion by applying her expertise to otherwise inadmissible evidence because,in that limited instance,the evidence is not being presented for the truth of the matter asserted,see united states dukagjini,cir,the admission of mccabe testimony was error only if he communicated testimonial statements of cooperating witnesses and confidential informants directly to the jury in the guise of an expert opinion.while the record indicates that may have been the case,and admission of mccabe testimony,therefore,may have constituted error,we hold it did not rise to the level of reversible plain error because it did not affect lombardozzi substantial rights.
standard of review 
because lombardozzi failed to preserve the issue,we review the admission of mccabe testimony under a plain error standard.see united states banks,cir.that standard is not met unless there is,inter alia,error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson,at.internal quotations marks omitted.r eversal for plain error should be used sparingly,solely in those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.banks,at quoting united states frady,d.
whether the error was plain 
for an error to be plain it must be clear or obvious,olano,at,at the time of appellate consideration.johnson,at.in fact,the error must be so egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge and prosecutor derelict in permitting it,despite the defendant failure to object.united states feliciano,cir quoting united states gore,cir.as stated above,based on crawford,at.stating the confrontation clause bars only those testimonial statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted,and this court decision in dukagjini,mccabe reliance on testimonial statements in forming his opinion that lombardozzi is affiliated with organized crime may only have been permissible if mccabe applied his expertise to those statements but did not directly convey the substance of the statements to the jury.see dukagjini,at stating that united states locascio,cir,permits an expert to rely on hearsay evidence for the purposes of rendering an opinion based on his expertise but adding that an expert may not simply repeat hearsay evidence without applying any expertise whatsoever because it enables the government to put before the jury an declaration of another,not subject to for the truth of the matter asserted.in dukagjini,we found expert testimony to have been erroneously admitted even though the expert testified that his opinion was based on his own knowledge of the investigation as well as statements made by cooperating individuals,because his opinion,at least in part,seemed to convey statements to the jury directly.id.we held,however,the conclusion that the expert testimony actually conveyed statements to the jury require d an inference that was not so obvious as to be correctable as plain error.id.at.
similarly here,mccabe suggests that he relied on a variety of sources in forming his opinion as to lombardozzi affiliation with organized crime.while the statements made by cooperating witnesses and relied upon by mccabe were almost certainly testimonial,and the confidential informants statements also may have been testimonial,the content of those statements was never revealed to the jury,and there is no indication of the extent to which mccabe relied on them.it is clear,however,that mccabe opinion as to lombardozzi affiliation was fully supported by evidence that can in no way be considered testimonial,specifically,mccabe personal surveillance of lombardozzi.a conclusion,therefore,that in opining that lombardozzi was affiliated with organized crime mccabe was directly conveying to the jury testimonial than merely applying his expertise to those an inference not obvious or egregious enough to be correctable as plain error.see dukagjini,at united states stone,cir reviewing district court decision de novo,and finding no confrontation clause violation where defendants could not point to any testimony by the expert that was not supported by prior witness testimony or by documents properly admitted into evidence.
in addition to allowing mccabe to testify that lombardozzi is affiliated with organized crime,however,the district court allowed mccabe to testify that lombardozzi is a soldier in the gambino crime family,ruling that that evidence was relevant to show that leung subjective beliefs about lombardozzi debt collection practices were reasonable.although mccabe opinion as to lombardozzi actual rank in the crime family appears to have been based not on his own observations but on the inadmissible hearsay statements of others,and hence to have been excludable,as we explain below,we conclude that neither the admission of that part of his testimony,nor his testimony that lombardozzi is affiliated with organized crime,affected lombardozzi substantial rights.
ii.the error did not affect defendant substantial rights 
a n error affects a defendant substantial rights if it is prejudicial and it affected the outcome of the case.dukagjini,at internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,where the effect of an error on the result in the district court is uncertain indeterminate or only speculative,we can not conclude that appellant substantial rights have been affected.united states williams,cir.here,the government has shown that any effect on the outcome of the decision below is speculative at best mccabe did not offer an opinion as to an ultimate issue or even as to a critical issue in the case.united states forrester,cir error going to the heart of a critical issue is less likely to be harmless.he merely offered an opinion that lombardozzi is affiliated with organized crime and a soldier in the gambino crime that did not constitute an offense for which lombardozzi stood trial.in fact,judge leisure properly instructed the jury that it need not believe the expert witness,and that lombardozzi was not on trial for being a member of the gambino crime family.
lombardozzi affiliation with organized crime could be inferred,moreover,from other properly admitted evidence including,inter alia,leung statement to an fbi agent that he believed lombardozzi was connected to organized crime and leung direct testimony that lombardozzi lent him money on behalf of a person leung knew to be affiliated with organized crime.with respect to mccabe testimony as to lombardozzi specific rank as soldier,leung subjective beliefs about lombardozzi debt collection practices would have been reasonable even if by leung to be acting on behalf of marino,a known organized crime merely affiliated with organized crime.thus,the effect of the admission of mccabe testimony on the outcome of the case can only be characterized as uncertain and speculative.see dukagjini,at holding that mere corroborative and cumulative evidence did not affect the jury verdict and did not therefore affect the defendant substantial rights.
in sum,the admission of mccabe testimony did not cause the miscarriage of justice required under plain error analysis.see banks,at.because any confrontation clause error resulting from the admission of mccabe testimony did not affect lombardozzi substantial rights,we find it is not correctable as plain error and we need not consider whether lombardozzi has met the requirements of the fourth prong of plain error analysis williams,at because this appellant has not carried his burden as to the third prong of the plain error test,we have no occasion to decide how he would have fared under the fourth prong.
the erroneous admission of isoldi plea allocution was harmless 
a.the plea allocution and limiting instruction 
the following portion of isoldi plea allocution was introduced against lombardozzi as evidence tending to prove the existence of a conspiracy to use extortionate means to collect on an extension of credit in violation of,charged in count of the indictment,and isoldi role in that conspiracy 
q now,let turn to count,which charges you with conspiracy to collect extensions of credit by extortionate means on debtor two.tell me what you did.
a again,your honor,i conspired with others to collect a loan from leung and,again,leung interpreted my words as a sign of threat.
q and as part of that agreement,did you do anything what did you do 
a basically,what i did was just call him and speak with him and ask him to pay his debt.
q and did you use means that were calculated to create fear in him 
a yes,i did.
q fear that there would be physical harm if he did pay,correct 
q let make that clear,isoldi.you agreed with one or more other persons to do what you described to this particular victim,correct 
a correct,your honor.
q there was an agreement with others to do what you understand to be an unlawful act 
a absolutely,your honor.
lombardozzi argues that this evidence constituted the only proof at trial that he had the requisite intent in conspiring to use extortionate means to ensure repayment of leung loans,and absent the plea allocution statements,the jury could not have found that he had that state of mind required under.we disagree.
standard of review 
the government concedes that in light of the supreme court decision in crawford,the district court erred in admitting isoldi plea allocution,and that lombardozzi properly preserved for appellate review the question of whether the plea allocution was admitted in violation of the confrontation clause.the district court admission of the plea allocution is thus subject to harmless error review.see united states mcclain,cir noting that i t is well established that violations of the confrontation clause,if preserved for appellate review,are subject to harmless error review and crawford does not suggest otherwise.
a n otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say,on the whole record,that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.delaware van arsdall,d.thus,in determining whether an error was harmless,we must,upon a review of the entire record,be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of in this case the introduction of isoldi plea allocution did not contribute to the verdict obtained.mcclain,at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,to find the erroneous admission of isoldi plea allocution harmless we must be able to conclude that the evidence would have been unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question,as revealed in the record.united states quiroz,cir quoting yates evatt,d.
in assessing an error likely impact on the jury,the supreme court has found the following factors to be relevant the overall strength of the prosecution case the prosecutor conduct with respect to the improperly admitted evidence the importance of the wrongly admitted testimony and whether such evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.zappulla new york,cir.the strength of the prosecution case,however,is probably the single most critical factor.united states reifler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the past,this court has generally found admissions of evidence in violation of crawford to be harmless only where the remaining admissible evidence was overwhelming.see mcclain,at.
the essence of the conspiracy offense under is that the conspirators entered into a scheme or plan to extort and committed an overt act in furtherance of that scheme or plan.united states rizzo.on summation,the government stated 
there can be no doubt that a conspiracy existed because frank isoldi pled gu
