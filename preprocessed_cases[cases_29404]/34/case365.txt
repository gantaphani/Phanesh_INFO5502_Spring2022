following a jury trial,alfredo was convicted of three counts aiding and abetting in the interference of commerce by threats or violence in violation of and aiding and abetting in the use,carriage,and discharge of a weapon during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of c a iii and and aiding and abetting in the possession of a stolen firearm in violation of j and.all of the counts were connected with the robbery of an armored truck in bayamón,puerto rico.on appeal,contends that his convictions should be reversed because the government failed to establish a nexus to interstate commerce as required by the hobbs act.contends alternatively that his convictions should be vacated and a new trial awarded because the district court permitted the government,over his objection,to use the statements of accused accomplices as evidence of his guilt.although we find that the government established the required nexus to interstate commerce,we conclude that confrontation clause rights were violated by the admission of hearsay evidence.we accordingly vacate and remand.
on august,a grand jury returned a joint indictment against elías,jonathan,and appellant.count one alleged that the three men aiding and abetting each other,did unlawfully obstruct,delay and affect commerce,to wit,by robbing a loomis fargo armored truck,in violation of a and counts two and three alleged related weapons charges under c a iii,j,and.case was resolved by a guilty plea prior to jury selection,and jury selection proceeded with and as.after jury selection,but before trial,case was also resolved by a guilty plea,leaving only to proceed to trial on january.
for purposes of gauging the sufficiency of the evidence,we view the testimony presented at trial in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states capozzi,cir.we first describe the evidence apart from the disputed confessions of and.
a robbery of a loomis fargo armored truck took place in bayamón,puerto rico,on july,at approximately footage from a city surveillance camera system showed that a white acura appeared to be following the loomis fargo armored truck shortly before and that at the acura was parked at a total gas station.the acura license plate and occupants were not visible on the surveillance footage.wife testified that on the early evening of july,she and drove to the total gas station in bayamón in a white acura.wife exited the car,and two men named elías and jonathan arrived and got into the car with.the three men then drove away.
shortly after that same day,employees at the taco bell restaurant in the plazoletta canton mall in bayamón noticed two suspicious men sitting at a table without consuming food.an employee later identified one of the two men as her neighbor,elías.at some point between and,two loomis fargo employees on an armored truck route ricardo miró and jose libran made a stop at the taco bell to pick up the restaurant cash deposit.it was raining as libran,the driver,backed the armored truck into the parking space nearest the entry of the taco bell.miró,the courier,left the rear compartment of the truck and entered the restaurant to retrieve a cash deposit from the manager.after placing the cash from the restaurant manager into his courier bag and commencing his return to the truck,miró paused at the door of the restaurant for several seconds to wait for the pouring rain to subside.
as he waited,the two men who had been sitting at the table and a third man standing outside the door surrounded miró.two taco bell employees later identified as the man outside the door.one of the assailants hit miró on the back of the head,informed him he was being robbed,and took the bag containing the cash.the assailants took miró pistol from his holster and forced him outside and into the back of the truck.the men demanded that miró open the truck vault after miró explained that he did not have access to it,one of the assailants shot him in the leg before leaving the truck.miró later identified the man who shot him as jonathan.upon realizing that the assailants had exited the truck,libran drove away together with miró.
witnesses testified that three men were seen fleeing the scene on foot.although no witness testified to the presence of a white acura at the taco bell,a witness did testify that at approximately,about half an hour after the robbery,two persons in a white acura with license plate number cdb checked into the las villas motel in bayamón.it was established that acura bore license plate number cdb.the witness who testified that the acura was at the motel did not identify either of the car two occupants.a police officer did testify that,approximately two weeks after the robbery,he saw driving in his white acura.
at trial the government sought to introduce over objection various statements allegedly made by alleged accomplices,and.first,the government presented the testimony of fbi special agent carlos torres,the case agent assigned to the robbery investigation.torres had interviewed after the robbery.the following exchange occurred between the court,the government prosecutor bazan,and defense counsel 
bazan sir,at the time elias was arrested,was he advised of his rights

following the court ruling and a question by the court,the government continued to question agent torres about the information obtained through confession

bazan and who was that second individual 
the witness jonathan baez rodriguez.
bazan sir,what other location,if any,did you go to obtain evidence pursuant to this interview with elias 
the witness we went to las villas motel in levittown area i believe.either levittown or the town adjacent to that.and we were able to retrieve a log that the motel personnel prepared on a daily basis that shows a car with the description that matched the same car elias has provided in interrogation entering the motel minutes after the robbery had taken place.

the witness,sir.
at the close of the government evidence,made a motion pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure for a judgment of acquittal,which was denied.on january,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each of the three counts of the indictment.on may,the district court sentenced to months imprisonment.timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.
federal jurisdiction under a 
on appeal,first urges that his conviction should be reversed because the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence that the robbery affected commerce,as required by a.the parties dispute the appropriate standard of review to be applied to challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on this element of the crime.contends that de novo review is required because he properly preserved his objection,see united states,cir,while the government argues that did not properly raise this theory below and thus our review is for only plain error,united states,cir.we need not resolve this dispute,because challenge fails under even the less deferential standard of review.
the hobbs act,under which was convicted,provides that w hoever in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion shall be fined or imprisoned a emphasis added to prove that a robbery violated the provisions of the hobbs act,the government need demonstrate only a de minimis interference with commerce,at quotation marks omitted.when a business is the victim of a robbery,an effect on interstate commerce may generally be demonstrated by showing the business engaged in interstate commerce,and that the robbery either depleted the assets of the business or resulted in the business temporary or permanent closure.id.citing,at,and united states,cir.
there is no serious question but that loomis fargo,a company engaged in the transportation of money from the federal reserve to places of business or vice versa,was a business engaged in interstate commerce.the evidence presented by the government was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that the robbery depleted loomis fargo assets.loomis fargo assumed the loss of the more than taken from its custody during the robbery.additional testimony established further effects on commerce from the robbery loomis fargo operations on the route were disrupted,and other business clients did not receive services that day due to the robbery.taken as a whole,the government evidence of the robbery effect on interstate commerce was sufficient to support the jury verdict.see capozzi,at government need show only a realistic probability of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce quotation marks omitted citing united states butt.cir.
confrontation clause objection 
also contends that his convictions on all three counts should be vacated and a new trial awarded because the government made improper use of statements of his alleged,and,in violation of sixth amendment confrontation right 
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the constitution provides that a criminal defendant shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him const.amend.vi.in crawford washington,the supreme court made clear that the confrontation clause generally prohibits the admission of testimonial statements against a criminal defendant,d see also united states earle,cir crawford held that the confrontation clause bars admission of testimonial hearsay in a criminal case unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity for.there is no dispute that the confessions of elías and jonathan,taken by police officers in the course of custodial interrogations,are testimonial in nature.crawford,at.thus,unless the statements fall within one of the narrow categories of testimonial statements that do not offend the confrontation clause,admission of the statements at trial was improper.
this court has identified three circumstances where statements,though testimonial,may nevertheless properly be admitted into evidence where the statement is not hearsay in that it is being admitted for a purpose other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted the declarant testifies at trial or the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant and the declarant is unavailable.united states,cir.
on appeal,the government relies solely upon the first exception,contending that the statements of and through the testimony of agents torres and rivera are not hearsay.thus,the government argues,the introduction of the confessions raises no confrontation clause problem because the statements were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted,but rather to put the investigation into context.appellee br.as this court has previously noted officers should not be put in the misleading position of appearing to have happened upon the scene of the crime and therefore should be entitled to provide some explanation for their presence.united states maher,cir quoting broun et,mccormick on evidence,at ed.the government argues that it should equally be able to provide context for the discovery of other evidence,such as the registration card obtained at the las villas motel.appellee br.
although s ometimes the rationale that an statement provides context for other admissible evidence will be valid,it is plainly not the case that every statement by an informant to police which sets context for the police investigation is admissible.maher,at.such an impossibly overbroad rule would allow the context exception to effectively eviscerate the protection against testimonial hearsay provided by the sixth amendment and recognized in crawford.see also united states silva,cir allowing agents to narrate the course of their investigations,and thus spread before juries damning information that is not subject to,would go far toward abrogating the defendant rights under the sixth amendment and the hearsay rule.
there are two basic problems with the government context theory here.first,the statements were used to emphasize the guilt of alleged accomplices,rather than to provide context for the discovery of other admissible evidence.a central contention of the government case was that three men were involved in the robbery the jury was aware that and were named with in the indictment.the jury had additional knowledge that was previously,as jury selection proceeded with both men to be tried jointly.in opening statements,the government referred to and as.the emphasis on admissions of guilt directly suggested that was guilty as well.
this improper purpose is particularly glaring with respect to the testimony concerning the amount of money that and received.the government elicited from the fbi agents not only the mere fact of confession by and,but also detailed testimony of how much money each admitted to having received from the robbery.these additional admitting to having received and no relevance to the police investigation of and added no necessary context.their only purpose was the improper purpose of demonstrating that the two men had in fact participated in the robbery.the government made considerable use of this evidence in its closing argument to directly suggest that and statements somehow established the guilt of as well 
you will also remember that among the things that elías told the fbi is that his participation in the robbery was.so in order to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt,i brought evidence of a search warrant that was made at the home of jonathan baez.
and lo and behold,what amount of money did we find at his house in different places of the house.the exact number the other aider and abetter,elías,had also received as his participation in the robbery.
so you put that together,you make a determination of participation,of aiding and abetting,of being part and attempting to obtain a result by way of the robbery of an armored truck.
such use of the unconfronted,confessions of and contradicts the government contention that the statements merely provided context for the government investigation.see crawford,at,noting th
