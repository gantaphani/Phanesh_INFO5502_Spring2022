appellant jay bonanza briley was convicted after a jury trial on four counts arising from intimate sexual activities in a national park and an ensuing physical altercation with united states park police officers.briley now challenges the interpretation of the statute under which he was convicted.he also contests the admission of evidence of a subsequent act under federal rule of evidence b.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
in reviewing briley conviction,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,here the government.evans united states,d see united states moye,cir en banc.
on the afternoon of january,park police officers were patrolling the washington sailing marina in alexandria,virginia.the marina serves as a recreational area at daingerfield island,a national park situated along the george washington memorial parkway and the potomac river.the marina,which has several parking lots,is also a reputed meeting place for sexual encounters.officers also patrol the area to prevent criminal activities such as illicit drug use,alcohol offenses,and disorderly conduct.
two park police officers on patrol in an unmarked vehicle,william brancato and robert usher,observed a man parking his car next to briley suv.after the man entered briley vehicle,the two men reclined the front seats,and briley placed a sunscreen across the windshield.seeing other people approaching,briley drove to another marina parking lot.inside the newly parked suv,briley was naked,and his companion pants were down.from afar,the two officers saw briley and the other man preparing to engage in sexual relations.
brancato and usher contacted two other park police officers on patrol nearby,corey mace and thomas twiname.mace and twiname,who were wearing tactical attire with police markings,drove to the marina and approached briley suv on foot.briley exclaimed,it the cops.in response to a directive from mace,briley companion opened the front passenger door,exited the suv,and lay on the ground.briley remained in the vehicle.
standing on the driver side of the vehicle,twiname banged on the window and yelled,police,open the door.when briley objected that he was naked,twiname threatened to smash the window.briley then opened the door,but he refused to follow twiname subsequent order to exit the vehicle.twiname grabbed briley left arm and struggled to pull him from the vehicle.after twiname let briley pull his pants up,briley locked his legs under the steering column to secure himself and began honking the horn.in an unsuccessful effort to handcuff briley,twiname entered the suv and ended up behind the driver seat.from there,he wrapped his arms around briley neck and upper shoulders.mace tried to assist his fellow officer with a wristlock,to no avail.twiname could not subdue briley.
the two officers,usher and brancato,arrived on the scene,shouting police and stop resisting.after securing briley companion,usher joined brancato on the driver side of the car.as these two officers grabbed briley and attempted to wrest him from the vehicle,briley tried to push usher out of the way and struck him in the arms,side,and lower back.usher suffered from various problems after the incident.
during the fracas on the driver side of the car,briley kicked brancato in the abdomen.brancato then tried to loosen briley position in the vehicle by striking him on his side.as the effort to subdue briley continued,briley placed another kick this time,harder into brancato abdomen.brancato later suffered from impairment of his pancreas and lost his gallbladder.
briley eventually agreed to exit the vehicle,but as soon as he stepped out,the struggle resumed.briley moved his arms to keep the officers from handcuffing him and assumed an aggressive stance.brancato sought to control briley by attempting to grab his shoulder,but instead hit him on the side of the head.briley then rushed toward both brancato and usher and pushed them backward.even as brancato slung his arm over briley shoulder,briley managed to drag twiname joined the fray along with usher,and they all tumbled to the ground.after further tussling with briley on the ground,the officers placed him in handcuffs.briley finally ceased resisting.he subsequently denied punching or kicking anyone,and he said he did not know whether these individuals were in fact police officers.
a grand jury indicted briley in the eastern district of virginia.in the superseding indictment,the government alleged three violations of a for briley conduct against the officers,as well as disorderly conduct.count charged briley with the felony of forcibly assaulting,resisting,opposing,impeding,and interfering with officer brancato while making physical contact.count charged him with the felony of forcibly resisting,opposing,impeding,and interfering with officer usher while making physical contact but omitted a specific allegation of assault.count charged him with the misdemeanor of forcibly resisting,opposing,impeding,and interfering with officer twiname but omitted specific allegations of either assault or physical contact.last,count charged him with the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct for recklessly creating a risk of causing public alarm,nuisance,jeopardy,and violence by engaging in an obscene display and act within federal land administered by the national park service,in violation of a.
during a jury trial,briley contested all the counts against him.the defense moved to dismiss counts and on the ground that the government had failed to allege an assault in those instances,but the district court denied the motion.for count,the district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove that briley forcibly assaulted,resisted,opposed,impeded,or interfered with officer brancato.emphasis added.for counts and,the court told the jury that it was not necessary to find assault the government had to prove only that briley forcibly did any one of the several alternative acts as charged toward officers usher and twiname.
the district court allowed the government,under federal rule of evidence b,to introduce evidence of other instances in which officers had caught briley engaging in public sexual activities within federal conduct that occurred after the underlying january incident.the defense objected to the introduction of briley prior and subsequent acts,but was overruled.the court allowed this evidence as well within the wheelhouse of permissible testimony under rule b.
although the government initially asked to introduce the evidence of prior and subsequent acts as part of its,it ended up calling the apprehending officers to testify on rebuttal,after briley own testimony.to help satisfy the elements of the disorderly conduct charge,the government presented evidence of briley prior citations for masturbating in public restrooms in the marina area in,and at another nearby federal park in.
in addition,the court permitted the government to introduce evidence of briley conduct approximately two months after the underlying altercation.on march,officer enrique wong had spotted briley in the same marina parking area engaging in sexual activities with another man in the same suv.wearing a police uniform and driving a marked police cruiser,wong found briley nearly naked,putting on his pants,with the vehicle front seats reclined.wong arrested briley and the other man without resistance or further incident.at separate bench trials,both were found guilty of disorderly conduct for this activity.
the jury convicted briley on all four counts the district court sentenced him to a prison term of months,with the sentences for the various counts running concurrently.the court also imposed a term of three years of supervised release and ordered briley to pay in restitution.the lion share of that sum,was directed to officer brancato.after hearing expert medical testimony,the court concluded that the trauma from briley kicks had caused brancato pancreatitis,which in turn had compelled the removal of his gallbladder.briley now appeals his convictions.
briley first contends that assault is a required element of the a offenses alleged in counts,and.he maintains that the government failed to charge an actual violation of a in counts and,and that the district court failure to mandate a specific finding of assault rather than other predicate acts vitiated the convictions on all three counts.we find no merit in briley argument.the district court read the statute properly.
section protects both the physical safety of federal officers and the integrity of their functions.see united states feola,d.indeed,through congress wanted to afford uniformly vigorous protection of federal personnel to the maximum degree.id.at.under the heading assaulting,resisting,or impeding certain officers or employees,the statute provides 
a in general.whoever 
forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with any person designated in section of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties or 
forcibly assaults or intimidates any person who formerly served as a person designated in section on account of the performance of official duties during such person term of service,
shall,where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year,or both,and where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b enhanced penalty.whoever,in the commission of any acts described in subsection a,uses a deadly or dangerous weapon including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component or inflicts bodily injury,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the individuals designated in a and include any officer or employee of the united states or of any agency in any branch of the united states government,such as a park police officer.id.
several features are immediately evident from the statutory structure.one is the type of officials who are protected.subsection a applies to individuals actually engaged in the performance of official duties,while a applies to those formerly engaged in such duties.the relevant acts differ for current officials in a forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes and former officials in a forcibly assaults or intimidates.id.a.
another important feature is the statute graded penalty structure.the punishments increase with the severity of the crime.the final paragraph of a provides that,where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,a person has committed a misdemeanor,punishable by up to one year in prison.id.a.next,where the acts in violation of entail either physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony,a person has committed a felony,punishable by up to eight years in prison.id.moving another step up,b specifies that,where a person performs any of the violative acts outlined in a and also either uses a deadly or dangerous weapon or inflicts bodily injury,that person has committed a felony,this time punishable by up to twenty years in prison.id.b see also united states campbell,cir.
in essence,proscribes five types of offenses a misdemeanor constituting only simple assault,two less serious felonies involving either physical contact or felonious intent,and two more serious felonies involving either a weapon or bodily injury.notably,in defining the penalties for the various offenses,each statutory provision refers back to the original list of violative acts against current or former officials.a the acts in violation of this section id.such acts id.b any acts described in subsection a.for any of the penalty provisions,then,a jury must find every element of a charged offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt,for each step on the scale increases the maximum statutory punishment.see apprendi new jersey,d jones united states,d see also campbell,at b provide s for steeply higher penalties,which are condition ed on further facts that seem quite as important as the elements of the principal crime found in a.alterations in original quoting jones,at.
a number of observations emerge from this analysis of the statutory structure.first,because briley actions involved current park police officers undertaking their official duties,all six verbs listed in the disjunctive in a are available.second,the contours of the three a counts come into sharper relief.counts and alleged physical contact felonies against officers brancato and usher,respectively,while count alleged a misdemeanor against officer twiname.by the terms of a,either a misdemeanor or a physical contact felony may arise from any of the acts in violation of this section namely,forcibly assaulting,resisting,opposing,impeding,intimidating,or interfering with current officers such as these.and third,the district court squarely instructed the jury that the government shouldered the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that briley had committed each and every element of the offense charged in the indictment.the jury then returned a verdict finding briley guilty on all three counts.although the statute is written disjunctively or,the jury found briley guilty on counts that were worded conjunctively and.
briley now argues that assault is a required element not only of the misdemeanor in a,but also of the statute physical contact felony.although the government charged assault as part of the felony in count against brancato,it chose not to charge assault for either the felony in count against usher or the misdemeanor in count against twiname.for several reasons,we do not think assault is a required element.
first,briley reading renders a slew of verbs in a largely surplusage.when we interpret statutes,we must construe all parts to have meaning.psinet,chapman,cir.we avoid interpretations that would turn some statutory terms into nothing more than surplusage.united states medina,cir in re total realty,llc,cir.subsection a expressly covers a person who forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with a federal official.a.briley reading would render five of those six words all but assault inoperative with respect to both the misdemeanor and the physical contact felony.we must,however,ascribe meaning to the five remaining verbs.
second,and relatedly,briley assessment of wanders too far from congressional intent.congress enumerated these six verbs in the disjunctive.why would congress,in the same subsection,then swiftly render five of these verbs extraneous or defunct the statute,moreover,consistently references the same set of all six alternative verbs for each penalty provision the acts in violation of this section for the misdemeanor in a,such acts for the lesser felonies in a,and any acts described in subsection a for the greater felonies in b.those phrases obviously denote all six verbs.why would congress repeatedly refer back to the same list of threshold acts for every designated offense,and yet covertly assign varying acts to different crimes the obvious answer is that congress had no such intention a person could commit any one of these six acts and still fall under the statute coverage.
third,briley interpretation rips a big hole in the statutory scheme.although his reading largely preserves the protections for the physical safety of federal officials,it leaves those officials without protection for the carrying out of federal functions.it misses the crucial point that safeguards not only physical safety,but also functional integrity.see feola,at.more broadly,it undercuts the statute mandate of full and vigorous enforcement.see id.at.
fourth,briley take on produces an absurd result.his reading would allow an individual to commit an array of forcible acts against federal officials performing government functions without criminal consequence.that person could use force to resist federal officials,to oppose them,to impede them,to intimidate them,and to interfere with them and yet escape the reach of.apparently,such a person could evade sanction so long as he or she did not also act with the intent to commit another
