at issue in this case is whether the federal death penalty act of the fdpa,title vi,a,stat,codified at et,is unconstitutional because c of the fdpa permits the admission of evidence at the penalty phase of a capital trial that would not be admissible under the federal rules of evidence fre.under the fdpa,evidence may be excluded where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury.c.in a september,opinion and order,the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,iii,district judge,held that this provision of the fdpa was unconstitutional on the ground that the fdpa c direction to ignore the rules of evidence when considering information relevant to death penalty eligibility is a violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the rights of confrontation and guaranteed by the sixth amendment constitutional rights.united states fell,d.we disagree.
while it is true that the fre are inapplicable to death penalty sentencing proceedings under the fdpa,the fre are not constitutionally mandated.indeed,the fre are inapplicable in numerous contexts,including ordinary sentencing proceedings before a trial judge.see.d moreover,the fdpa does not alter a district court inherent obligation to exclude evidence the admission of which would violate a defendant constitutional rights.the admissibility standard set forth in c of the fdpa provides one means of complying with this responsibility.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
background 
donald fell was indicted on four counts relating to the abduction and murder of teresca king in late november.counts and charged fell with carjacking and kidnapping.because the charged crimes resulted in death,both counts were charged as capital crimes.on january,the government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty,which set forth certain statutorily defined aggravating factors the government believed to be implicated in the case.in the summer of,following the supreme court decision in ring arizona,d,the grand jury issued a superseding indictment that included a notice of special findings reiterating the same aggravating factors noticed by the government six months earlier.in addition,the government issued a supplemental notice of intent to seek the death penalty,in which it identified several aggravating factors it believed to also be applicable to the case,as permitted by the fdpa.see c permitting jury to consider any aggravating factor for which notice was given united states jones,cir holding that government authority to define aggravating factors is not an unconstitutional delegation,aff on other grounds,d.
the defendant moved to have the fdpa declared unconstitutional on numerous grounds.see fell,d at listing claims.the district court addressed only two of them.it first held that nothing in the fdpa precluded the government from having the grand jury issue an indictment concerning the existence of aggravating factors.this ruling is not a subject of this appeal.
the district court next addressed the defendant claim that the assertedly relaxed evidentiary standard applicable during the penalty phase of trial pursuant to c the fdpa standard renders unconstitutional any jury findings as to the existence of one or more of the aggravating factors necessary to impose a sentence of death.the defendant asserted that the fdpa standard would permit the government to introduce statements made by the defendant that inculpated the defendant with respect to one or more of these aggravating factors,but that these statements would not be admissible under the fre.the district court agreed that the fdpa standard was unconstitutional and struck the grand jury notice of special findings from the indictment as well as the government supplemental notice of intent to seek the death penalty.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to entertain this interlocutory appeal pursuant to which permits an immediate appeal of any district court decision that,inter alia,dismisses any part of a criminal indictment.see united states quinones,cir holding that courts of appeals have jurisdiction under to entertain appeals by the government where a district court has stricken a death penalty notice and collecting similar cases see also united states wilson,d holding that is to be construed broadly to allow government appeals whenever the constitution would permit.
ii.ripeness 
although neither the district court nor any of the parties has addressed the question,as a threshold matter we must determine whether the defendant challenge to the fdpa standard is ripe for consideration,or whether,instead,the district court properly should have dismissed the claim as premature.see united states sampson,d,discussing ripeness of constitutional challenge to fdpa standard when raised before trial see also quinones,at discussing ripeness of different constitutional challenge to the fdpa.
ripeness is a constitutional prerequisite to exercise of jurisdiction by federal courts.the court,therefore,can raise the issue sua sponte.nutritional health alliance shalala,cir internal citations omitted see also quinones,at.at the core of the ripeness doctrine is the necessity of ensur ing that a dispute has generated injury significant enough to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii of the constitution by prevent ing a federal court from entangling itself in abstract disagreements over matters that are premature for review because the injury is merely speculative and may never occur.dougherty town of hempstead bd.of zoning appeals,cir.here,of course,the defendant has not been tried,let alone convicted thus,he may never be subjected to a penalty phase in which the government has sought to introduce the challenged evidence.
in order to determine whether an issue is ripe for adjudication,a court must make a evaluation of both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds,califano sanders,d.in quinones,a case also involving a ruling that the fdpa was unconstitutional,we applied the abbott laboratories test,and,in words that apply equally to this appeal,held that 
due regard for the rights of criminal defendants compels the conclusion that the defendant constitutional challenge to the fdpa was ripe for consideration by the district court and is ripe for our review.first,the defendant argument clearly was fit for adjudication.a challenge to the facial constitutionality of a criminal statute is a pure question of law that is eminently fit for judicial review.
a defendant suffers practical and legally cognizable disadvantages by postponing a facial challenge to the death penalty until after trial.quite apart from a defendant obvious desire to know in advance whether he will be risking his life by going to trial,a defendant may reasonably prefer the ordinary allocation of peremptory for the government,ten for the than the allocation in a capital case of twenty for each side a defendant may reasonably prefer a jury on which persons who are conscientiously opposed to the death penalty are not excused for cause.
further,if the death penalty remains a possibility during trial,a defendant may be forced into trial tactics that are designed to avoid the death penalty but that have the consequence of making conviction more likely.moreover,the possibility of capital punishment frequently induces defendants to enter into plea agreements in order to guarantee their own survival.and the supreme court has specifically held that a plea of guilty is not invalid merely because entered to avoid the possibility of a death penalty.accordingly,to the extent that a defendant might be disposed to plead guilty before trial in order to avoid capital punishment,withholding consideration of a facial challenge to the death penalty until after trial,conviction and sentence could cause him substantial hardship.
because both of the factors for ripeness set forth by the supreme court in abbott laboratories were present when the district court considered the constitutionality of the fdpa,the defendant constitutional challenge to the fdpa was ripe for consideration by the district court and is now ripe for our review.
quinones,at internal citations and footnote omitted.
quinones addressed whether prosecution under the fdpa was unconstitutional,a claim that was raised by a defendant whose prosecution under the statute was certain and imminent.see id.at.although we address a hypothetical evidentiary decision that may never be required,we nevertheless believe the reasoning of quinones applies with comparable force here.accordingly,we conclude that fell fdpa challenge is ripe for consideration.
iii.the federal death penalty act 
under the fdpa,if a defendant is convicted of a federal offense that carries the potential of a death sentence,the defendant is entitled to a separate sentencing hearing to determine the punishment to be imposed.b.during this separate hearing,referred to as the sentencing or penalty phase,the jury first considers whether the government has sustained its burden of proving the existence of one or more statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.see c.a finding that an aggravating factor exists must be unanimous.d.if the jury finds that the government has not sustained its burden of demonstrating the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor,the death penalty may not be imposed.id.
if the jury finds that the government has sustained its burden in this regard,however,the jury must next 
consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death,or,in the absence of a mitigating factor,whether the aggravating factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a sentence of death.
e.unlike findings concerning aggravating factors,mitigating factors need be found only by one or more members of the jury and only by a preponderance of the evidence.see c,d.based upon this consideration,the jury by unanimous vote shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death,to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.e.
section c of the fdpa sets forth the fdpa standard,which is the evidentiary standard that applies only during the sentencing phase of a capital trial.it provides,in part 
proof of mitigating and aggravating factors.
the defendant may present any information relevant to a mitigating factor.the government may present any information relevant to an aggravating factor for which notice has been provided under subsection a.information is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury the government and the defendant shall be permitted to rebut any information received at the hearing,and shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to the adequacy of the information to establish the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factor,and as to the appropriateness in the case of imposing a sentence of death the burden of establishing the existence of any aggravating factor is on the government,and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established beyond a reasonable doubt.the burden of establishing the existence of any mitigating factor is on the defendant,and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established by a preponderance of the information.
c emphasis added.it is this provision exception of the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials,namely,the fre,that is the subject of this appeal.fell argues that the admission of evidence that is not constrained by the fre will render a jury recommendation of a death sentence inherently unreliable.
iv.the district court decision 
the district court held that the fdpa standard is unconstitutional when viewed in light of the supreme court decisions in ring arizona,d,apprendi new jersey,d,and jones united states,d,because it denies a defendant the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the confrontation and guarantees of the sixth amendment with respect to the penalty phase.see fell,d.
in ring,the supreme court held that the aggravating factors necessary for imposition of the death penalty under arizona analogous state death penalty act were elements of a capital crime,such that they had to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt in conformity with the reasoning of apprendi.see ring,at.unlike the arizona death penalty statute,however,the fdpa does require the issue of aggravating factors to be submitted to a jury for determination beyond a reasonable doubt,which is all that was at issue with respect to ring application of apprendi to a death penalty statute.moreover,following the ring decision,the government in this case,in an exercise of caution,resubmitted the case to the grand jury to enable it to issue an indictment that included a notice of special findings in which it set forth specific aggravating factors it found to be applicable.thus,here there is no dispute that there has been literal compliance with the mandates of ring and apprendi.
nevertheless,the district court reasoned that in light of the trend in supreme court rulings concerning the constitution indictment clause,it was not enough to have the case comply with ring.rather,consideration had to be given to whether the supreme court reasoning in these cases affects a defendant rights during a capital sentencing phase with respect to the full or entire panoply of criminal trial procedural rights.fell,d at,internal quotation marks omitted.
following this line of analysis,the district court found that the inapplicability of the fre to capital penalty phases was inconsistent with the supreme court repeated admonition that heightened reliability is required of cases that impose the death penalty.id.at.both the government and the district court appear to have agreed with defendant that the statements of his dead would be inadmissible under the fre but admissible at the penalty phase under the fdpa.fell,d at.yet admission of this evidence,according to the district court,would be wholly unreliable.id.at.
the district court also noted that under the reasoning of apprendi,former sentencing factors that are held to be elements of the crime,such as drug quantity,are thereafter to be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.by necessary implication,the district court reasoned,such elements,which had formerly been found by a district court judge who was not bound by the fre,see.d,were now to be found by a jury on the basis of evidence constrained by the fre.fell,d at.in light of this significant change in procedures,the district court concluded that it was inconceivable that congress would have intended to single out elements of the death penalty as the only criminal elements to be found by a jury that was unconstrained by the fre.id.
the district court also held that no alternate construction of the fdpa was possible and,thus,that the constitutional question presented by the fdpa standard could not be avoided,and further,that the fdpa standard was not severable from the rest of the fdpa because it was an integral part of the statute and its omission would substantially alter it.id.at.as a result,the district court concluded that the fdpa,which bases a finding of eligibility for imposition of the death penalty on information that is not subject to the sixth amendment guarantees of confrontation and,nor to rules of evidentiary admissibility guaranteed by the due process clause to involving offense elements,is unconstitutional.id.at.
flaws with the district court reasoning 
we fully agree with the district court that heightened reliability is essential to the process of imposing a death sentence.as the supreme
