we consider here whether we may exercise appellate jurisdiction over a lawyer appeal from a district court order directing him to produce documents and appear for a deposition,despite his assertions of various privileges belonging to himself and his client,where the lawyer has not disobeyed the order and been held in contempt.
the appeal arises out of lawsuits filed against,inter alia,airbus industrie airbus following the crash of american airlines flight at belle harbor,new york,on november.during consolidated pretrial proceedings,the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge granted airbus motion to compel jeffrey golan golan,a lawyer licensed in pennsylvania,to produce certain documents and appear for a deposition in compliance with a subpoena,over his objections based on privilege,the work product doctrine,and the reporters shield laws of new york and germany.golan asserts that he represents a german reporter,who is not a party to these proceedings,and that he serves as a consultant for plaintiffs counsel in the underlying litigation.the district court subsequently designated the order as a final order and directed its immediate entry pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b rule b golan appealed,and airbus moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because the order was not a final decision under golan responded that under a line of cases deriving from the supreme court opinion in perlman united states,he was exempt from the general rule requiring a subpoenaed in a criminal or civil proceeding to disobey the subpoena,be held in civil or criminal contempt,and then appeal the contempt order,sa celanese ag,cir the district court invocation of rule b rendered the order a final decision for the purposes of and in any event,we should accept his appeal pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.by order dated april,we summarily granted airbus motion to dismiss the appeal.we write now to explain our reasons for doing so.
background 
on april,the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all lawsuits concerning the november,crash to the southern district of new york pursuant to.the transferred cases were assigned to judge sweet for consolidated pretrial proceedings with related actions already before him.he subsequently appointed a plaintiffs executive committee pec to coordinate the work of plaintiffs counsel.plaintiffs in the underlying litigation seek relief under various theories,including wrongful death,products liability,and breach of warranty.
on october,airbus served the pec with a document request for any material in its possession obtained from current and former airbus employees.on march,the pec provided airbus with a privilege log identifying three memoranda written and transmitted to the pec by golan.on november,airbus served golan with a subpoena issued and signed by airbus counsel on behalf of the district court the subpoena commanded golan to appear for a deposition and to produce thirteen categories of documents,including all documents received from any current and former airbus employees,all documents concerning the november,crash and certain airbus aircraft,and all documents provided to any other person regarding the litigation.golan served objections to the subpoena on november,and amended objections on november.
golan amended objections to the subpoena consisted of six general objections,a discussion of the basis for the general objections,statements in response to each category of documents requested by airbus,and broad descriptions of the documents being withheld.golan asserted that the subpoena called for the production of materials protected by the privilege called for the production of materials protected by the attorney work product doctrine was overly broad,unduly burdensome,and harassing sought information protected by reporters shield laws in the united states and europe attempted to the plaintiffs march,designation of privileged documents and required him to appear for a deposition on a day when he had other professional commitments.golan explained that he became aware of information relevant to the litigation as a result of serving as counsel for a european journalist,and that any information golan shared with the pec was done in anticipation of potential litigation the journalist might bring,to aid the journalist in the pursuit of an eventual investigative publication,or to assist the pec.
on january,airbus filed a motion to compel golan to produce the documents and appear for the deposition.both golan and the pec opposed the motion.in a declaration filed in support of his opposition to the motion,golan specified that several months after the november,crash,he was contacted by a reporter at a german publication who was seeking legal counsel regarding,inter alia,whether a person not injured in the crash could bring a private action in the united states and how to obtain information disclosed in the course of litigation that had already commenced.golan stated that he continued to serve as the reporter attorney after the reporter decided not to initiate any litigation golan also claimed that he entered into a consulting relationship with the pec for the purpose of investigating and communicating information pertinent to the crash.in sum,golan claimed that all of the information and documents that he possesses have come into his possession solely as a result of his providing legal advice to his client,the reporter,and later,as a consultant to plaintiffs counsel.purporting to assert a good faith and sufficient basis for protecting from production all documents in his possession and all information that he may have learned relevant to this matter,golan invoked the privilege,the attorney work product doctrine,and the reporters shield laws of new york and germany.
the district court issued a memorandum opinion on march,granting airbus motion to compel.in re air crash at belle harbor,new york on november.the district court concluded that golan failed to establish the existence of an relationship with either the unnamed german reporter or the pec even if golan could prove an relationship,the reporter waived the privilege with respect to any material that had been shared with the pec,and the pec waived the privilege with respect to any material that had been shared with other persons under an earlier discovery decision of the district court,the work product doctrine was inapplicable to any materials admitted to contain airbus documents or information in any event,golan waived application of the work product doctrine by failing to submit a privilege log in accordance with the requirements of local rule golan failed to engage in any analysis that would lead to the application of germany shield law and did not present evidence of any connection between the reporter and germany and the protections afforded by new york shield law do not apply to any information that the reporter shared with golan.see id.at.
on march,the district court entered an order directing golan to appear for the deposition on or before march and to produce all documents responsive to airbus subpoena on or before march.the march order also directed plaintiffs to produce related documents.on march,golan filed a notice of appeal from the march order.also on march,in response to a request from golan,the district court issued a further order in which it designated the portions of the march order pertaining to golan as a final order with respect to golan.the district court found no just reason for delay in the entry of the final order and directed its immediate entry pursuant to rule b.golan filed an amended notice of appeal on march,which indicated that the march order had been entered as a final order under rule b pursuant to the district court instructions.
at oral argument before this court,golan informed us that if his appeal were to prove unsuccessful,he would abide by the district court order compelling compliance with the subpoena,and that he has received his reporter client authorization to do so in that event.
discussion 
this court shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.under traditional finality principles,a district court decision to compel compliance with a subpoena or to deny a motion to quash a subpoena is generally not a final decision and therefore is not immediately appealable.sa,at.this general rule applies whether the subpoena is issued in connection with civil and criminal actions,or grand jury proceedings,see united states constr.prods.research,cir,and whether the person or entity seeking to prevent enforcement of the subpoena is a party to the litigation or a witness,see sa,at.to obtain appellate review,the subpoenaed person ordinarily must defy the district court enforcement order,be held in contempt,and then appeal the contempt order,which is regarded as final under.constr.prods.research,at see also united states nixon,d alexander united states.sa,at dove atl.capital,cir super spuds,mercantile,cir friendly.under this rule,t he remedy of the party witness wishing to appeal is to refuse to answer and subject himself to criminal contempt that of the witness is to refuse to answer and subject himself to civil or criminal contempt.super spuds,at.
requiring the subject of a subpoena to submit to contempt before appealing promotes the strong congressional policy embodied in against piecemeal reviews,and against obstructing or impeding an ongoing judicial proceeding by interlocutory appeals.nixon,at.as judge friendly has explained,even the softened application of this requirement serves a useful purpose in curtailing appeals,with consequent delay in litigation super spuds,at.both sides benefit from having a second look.id.the subpoenaed person may decide that the importance of the issue and the risk of adverse appellate determination do not warrant being branded as a contemnor,while the person seeking information may decide that the quest is not important enough to seek a contempt citation,thereby entailing the delay of an appeal id.
the requirement of submitting to contempt,however,is not without exception and in some instances the purposes underlying the finality rule require a different result.nixon,at.thus,for example,a district court order enforcing a subpoena issued by a government agency in connection with an administrative investigation may be appealed immediately without first performing the ritual of obtaining a contempt order,because the administrative proceeding is and,unlike in the case of a grand jury or trial,there is no further judicial inquiry which would be halted were the offending subpoenaed party permitted to appeal.constr.prods.research,at alteration in original quoting cobbledick united states.internal quotation mark omitted.
i.the perlman exception 
golan argues that his appeal falls under the perlman exception to the rule requiring the subject of a subpoena to submit to contempt before a district court order compelling compliance with the subpoena is appealable.in perlman united states,the supreme court permitted perlman,the target of a grand jury investigation,to immediately appeal the district court denial of his motion for an order restraining the united states attorney from using property belonging to him that had been impounded and deposited with the clerk of the court,after the clerk had been ordered by the district court to produce the property.see id.at.super spuds,at discussing perlman facts and procedural history.thus,in perlman,the contempt avenue for ultimately securing review of the district court production order was not available since perlman was not being required to do anything,super spuds,at citing cobbledick,at.moreover,it was unimaginable that the disinterested clerk would defy the district court order so that had no connection to the appeal.id.
perlman has since come to stand for the principle that the holder of an asserted privilege may immediately appeal the enforcement of a subpoena when the subpoena is directed at another person who does not object to providing the testimony or documents at issue.see sa,at w here a subpoenaed witness does not object to testifying,but someone else on the grounds of district court refusal to quash the subpoena is immediately appealable by the objecting party.in re katz,cir w here the subpoena is directed against a third party,the movant who claims that production of the subpoened material would violate his fifth amendment privilege against is permitted an immediate appeal.see also in re grand jury proceedings,cir interpreting in re katz as concluding that the holder of an asserted privilege may appeal when a subpoena is directed at a third party because of the risk that the third party will surrender the privilege rather than risk a contempt citation.the perlman exception applies to appeals both from orders denying motions to quash,see,in re katz,at,and orders granting motions to compel,see,in re grand jury proceedings,at.it also applies to appeals from orders issued in both grand jury proceedings,see,in re katz,at,and criminal and civil actions,see super spuds,at.
golan contends that,like the clerk in perlman,it is unimaginable that he would defy the district court order to assert privileges belonging to his reporter client.golan claims that because he is a licensed attorney who often appears on a pro hac vice basis in the southern district of new york,it would be virtually impossible for him to risk a citation for contempt.although golan does not explain the basis for this impossibility in his submissions to this court,at oral argument he implied that a mere citation for contempt would have adverse professional consequences,primarily affecting his appointment to plaintiffs executive committees in other complex litigation.
golan argument fails,and the perlman exception is inapplicable to his appeal,for two reasons.first,the perlman exception is relevant only to appeals brought by the holder of a privilege where the disputed subpoena is directed at someone else.it is impossible for such an appellant to pursue the normal avenue of to,like perlman,that appellant has not been required to do anything by the district court.in the instant case,however,golan is both the appellant and the subject of the subpoena.the power to abide by or defy the district court order is in his hands alone.see in re am.tobacco,cir perlman may not be extended to permit the party in possession of the subpoenaed documents to appeal prior to contempt simply because other persons might have been able to do so.in re grand jury subpoena for state income tax records,cir since the state is both the holder of the privilege and the custodian of the records the perlman doctrine does not permit this appeal.
second,unlike the court clerk in perlman,a lawyer in golan one concerned about the effects of a contempt citation on his not lack countervailing motivations to submit to contempt,as well as ethical obligations to assert his client privileges.as the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has noted in a similar situation,a lawyer who assert s his own interests in work product and in not being subject to what he claims is burdensome and abusive discovery,plus the privilege of his client which he is normally to assert has the requisite incentives as well as the clear ability to risk contempt and thereby force review into the usual channel.in re sealed case,citations omitted.moreover,if a mere citation for civil contempt might hinder an attorney attempts at obtaining representation in future cases,the refusal to submit to such contempt under any circumstances might drive away clients in the future 
because golan can not take advantage of the perlman exception to obtain review of the district court order,the ordinary contempt requirement would prevent immediate appeal unless we were to create a new exception for lawyers that is similar to the exception established for the president of the united states by the supreme court in united states nixon.in that case,the supreme court held that the president,who had been issued a subpoena to produce certain tapes and documents in connection with a criminal proceeding where he was named as an unindicted,could immediatel
