ii.analysis 
denial of request for entrapment instruction and preclusion from arguing entrapment at closing 
teleguz primary argument is that he was entitled to an entrapment instruction because the evidence shows that ortiz was an insistent buyer who was doggedly persistent,and this amounted to improper inducement of teleguz.teleguz also argues that the district court erred in precluding him from arguing entrapment to the jury at closing.teleguz preserved his objections at trial we review the denial of the entrapment instruction de novo,united states,cir,and review the limitations placed on defendant closing argument for abuse of discretion,united states wood,cir.
the entrapment defense is not a doctrine of constitutional dimension or one expressly created by statute.united states russell,d see also united states luisi,cir.rather,it is a judicially created doctrine which recognizes that congress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.sherman united states,d.
the question is whether a reasonable jury could view the evidence as establishing that defendant was entrapped.see united states rodriguez,cir.if so,teleguz was entitled to an entrapment instruction if not,there was no error in the district court denial of defendant request.
the entrapment defense consists of two prongs.luisi,at.the first prong requires a showing of improper government inducement.united states gamache,cir.the second prong requires that the defendant have had a lack of predisposition to commit the offense.id.because entrapment is a judicially created doctrine,courts have been careful not to contravene congressional intent to punish those who commit the offense that,in turn,requires that the doctrine take into account the practical problems faced by federal law enforcement.see luisi,at.
our case law stating that a defendant has a low burden for obtaining an entrapment instruction,gamache,at,should not be misunderstood as defendant here misunderstands.in assessing whether the burden for an instruction has been met,we look at the evidence most charitably to the defendant and determine whether it is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that there was entrapment.see rodriguez,at.
in this case,no reasonable jury could conclude that there was any improper government inducement.defendant argument is based on an erroneous understanding of what it takes to show improper inducement,the personal nature of the entrapment defense,and the scope of the record to be considered.
