shawn lowe appeals the conviction for illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon,in violation of g,that resulted from his conditional guilty plea.the only issue raised is whether the district court erred in denying his suppression motion.the matter comes before us after a different panel of this court remanded lowe challenge to the suppression ruling back to the district court for and resolution of the conflicting suppression hearing testimony.see united states lowe,app x cir lowe i.on remand,neither party supplemented the record with additional evidence.the district court merely entered findings of fact and conclusions of law and again denied lowe motion to suppress.this appeal followed 
lowe sole argument is that,because the police did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct a terry stop when they seized him,the evidence discovered as a result of the stop and corresponding frisk was obtained in violation of the fourth amendment and should have been suppressed.we agree.we now hold that the district court erred in identifying the moment of seizure,and that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion when they actually seized lowe.accordingly,we will reverse the district court denial of lowe suppression motion.
we review the district court denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying factual findings and we exercise plenary review over questions of law.united states brown,cir.our review of the district court determination of the moment of seizure under the fourth amendment,as well as whether a seizure is supported by reasonable suspicion,is de novo.see ornelas united states,johnson campbell,cir.a district court factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.accordingly,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we will not reverse it even if,as the trier of fact,we would have weighed the evidence differently.united states price,cir internal citations omitted alteration in original.
in lowe i,we were presented with conflicting versions of the facts necessary to determine the moment of seizure.accordingly,as noted above,we remanded to enable the district court to make specific written findings of fact and conclusions of law.app x at.in his concurring opinion,judge ambro highlighted the gaps in the that the district court needed to address on remand.he explained that if lowe may have stepped backward initially on the order to stop walking,this did not undermine his submitting to that order.id.at ambro,concurring citing united states johnson,cir.in judge ambro view,to any extent lowe merely looked like he was getting ready to run per officer testimony but did not actually run,he still would have submitted,and if lowe effectively halted at the officers behest,he was seized at the outset of the encounter.id.thus,in lowe i the panel concluded vacate d and remand ed the matter to enable the district court to make specific written findings of fact.id.at.on remand,the district court issued conclusions of law and factual findings that described the encounter more fully.
on september,at approximately,philadelphia police officers mcginnis and campbell received a radio call reporting flash information of a black male wearing a gray hoodie with a gun in his waistband talking to a female that was at north markoe street outside.united states lowe,crim,wl,at.the tip was anonymous.the block of north markoe street is located in a violent,high crime area known for drug crimes.id.approximately minutes before receiving the radio call,officers campbell and mcginnis had received a call regarding an alleged gun shot at the block of street,which is around the corner from north markoe street.id.the officers testified that they knew that a shot had been fired at a house,but that no one had been shot and no suspect had been apprehended.north markoe street was the home address of tamika witherspoon,who is lowe close friend.
officers mcginnis and campbell were near north markoe street when they received the radio call,and they immediately drove to the address.they arrived within two minutes of receiving the call.the officers initially turned their police sirens and lights on,but they turned them off when they were about a block and a half away from the address.the officers parked their police car roughly to feet away from the house.within seconds,two additional police cars pulled in behind their car.officer pezzeca was in one of the additional police cars.officers mcginnis and campbell,followed shortly thereafter by officer pezzeca and another officer,got out of their cars and quickly moved towards lowe.as the officers approached the house,they saw lowe speaking with witherspoon in front of north markoe street.lowe was wearing a gray hoodie his hands were in the hoodie pockets and were not visible to the officers.however,the officers did not see a gun or anything indicating that lowe had a gun,nor did they see or hear any argument or disturbance when they pulled up to the residence.there was a construction fence on the sidewalk preventing access to the north of witherspoon house.
the district court recounted the varying versions provided by the officers of what happened next.id.at.officer mcginnis testified that,as he and officer campbell approached lowe,he asked lowe to remove his hands from his pockets five to ten times,and lowe instead froze and looked both ways over his shoulders.id.according to officer mcginnis,only after he gave five to ten commands and drew his gun did lowe take his hands out of his pockets and start to move towards the wall,at which point the officers pushed lowe against the wall.in contrast,officer campbell testified that lowe did put up his hands in response to the command to stop and do so,and he testified that lowe voluntarily placed his hands on the wall.officer pezzeca testified that as officers campbell and mcginnis approached lowe and told him several times to put his hands up,lowe backed away from the officers and kept his hands in his pockets until officers campbell and mcginnis grabbed lowe and placed him against the wall.id.all of the officers agreed that the frisk took place by the wall and that,following a brief struggle that ensued when lowe reached for his waistband during the frisk,a firearm was recovered.
this sequence of events unfolded quickly officer mcginnis estimated that less than a minute elapsed between the first command and when lowe moved to the wall,and officer campbell indicated that the whole incident,from his arrival on the scene to the struggle with lowe and the recovery of the firearm,took less than two minutes.
in its findings of fact,the district court described these events as follows 
w hen the officers first arrived on the scene,lowe was standing in front of north markoe.as the officers steadily moved toward lowe,he took several steps backing away from them.he was prevented from moving back more than a few steps by the construction fence next to north markoe street.the court also finds that officers mcginnis and campbell gave lowe multiple commands to raise his hands or take his hands out of his pockets while in close proximity to lowe.lowe did not initially comply.
lowe,wl,at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court explained that it afford ed more weight to the congruent testimony of officers mcginnis and pezzeca,whose accounts provide a consistent story,and slightly less weight to officer campbell recollection regarding lowe compliance with the order to raise his hands.id.
the district court did not resolve some significant conflicts in the police officers testimony.this includes conflicting testimony regarding whether lowe put his hands on the wall voluntarily,or whether his hands were placed there by the officers.the district court also failed to resolve the discrepancies in the police officers testimony about the number of times they ordered lowe to show his hands and their distance from him when they issued those orders.though the district court lack of precision fuels some of the appellate arguments,the findings of fact that the court did make are sufficient to allow us to determine the legality of lowe seizure.
the district court reached the following conclusion of law regarding when the interaction became a stop for fourth amendment purposes 
the encounter between the officers and lowe did not become a terry stop at the officers first command that lowe remove his hands from his pockets instead,the interaction became a stop when the officers repeated their commands,ma king it clear that the suspect was not free to ignore the officers and would not be left alone until he complied.johnson campbell.cir finding that stop occurred after officer second command to individual to roll down his car window.
lowe,wl,at.the district court thus held that lowe was seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment at the point when the officers repeated their commands to him,and he responded by not fleeing.id.accordingly,the district court found that lowe failure to show his hands in response to the officers initial commands could be considered in the totality of the circumstances in evaluating reasonable suspicion.the court found that the officers were aware of the following pieces of information at the moment of seizure 
an anonymous tip that a male matching lowe description was engaged in criminal activity,the fact that north markoe street was located in a neighborhood in which a shooting had occurred over an hour earlier,the late hour of the night,and the fact that,when lowe was approached and asked to show his hands,he refused to remove his hands from his hoodie pockets.
id.based on its conclusion that these facts provided reasonable suspicion to conduct the search of lowe that disclosed the firearm,the district court denied lowe motion to suppress.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.though law enforcement officers ordinarily must obtain a warrant based on probable cause before conducting a seizure,in terry ohio the supreme court articulated an exception that allows law enforcement to conduct a brief investigatory stop in limited circumstances.under terry and its progeny,an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow.the reasonable suspicion that justifies the terry stop of a suspect also justifies a subsequent protective frisk of that suspect,where officers have reason to believe that the suspect may pose a danger to the officers.terry,at.
in assessing the legality of a terry stop,we must first pinpoint the moment of the seizure and then determine whether that seizure was justified by reasonable,articulable facts known to the officer as of that time that indicated that the suspect was engaged in criminal activity.campbell,at.a seizure occurs when there is either a a laying on of hands or application of physical force to restrain movement,even when it is ultimately unsuccessful,or b submission to a show of authority.brown,at quoting california hodari.where a seizure falls in the latter category,we determine if there has been a show of authority using an objective test whether the officer words and actions would have conveyed to a reasonable person that he was not free to leave.hodari,at 
whether an individual has submitted to a show of authority depends on both the nature of the show of authority as well as the suspect conduct at the moment the officer asserted his or her authority.when a suspect flees after a show of authority,the moment of submission is often quite clear it is when the fleeing suspect stops,whether voluntarily or as a result of the application of physical force.see id.at.but different factors must be considered when an individual is already stationary,or when an individual submission to a show of governmental authority takes the form of passive acquiescence.brendlin california.thus,while a fleeing man is not seized until he is physically overpowered,one sitting in a chair may submit to authority by not getting up to run away.id.at.in either case,a show of authority without actual submission is no more than an attempted seizure,and a suspect conduct in the interval between the show of authority and the submission can be considered in determining the reasonableness of the eventual seizure.id.at citing hodari,at.
we therefore turn to the two questions presented in this case when did lowe actually submit to the show of authority,and did the facts known to the officers at that moment of seizure give rise to reasonable suspicion 
the district court cited to campbell,at,in finding that the seizure occurred the instant that the officers repeated their commands to lowe.lowe,wl,at.it concluded that lowe submitted at that moment by not fleeing.id.however,campbell arose in a very different context and is therefore of little assistance to our inquiry.there,a single officer made a hand gesture to an individual seated in a parked van indicating that the officer wanted that individual to roll down his window.campbell,at.when the individual did not comply,the officer persisted in making the same request.id.we found that,because an objective person in the individual situation would have felt free to decline the officer first gesture,the first request was not a show of authority for fourth amendment purposes.id.at.rather,we held that an objective person would only reasonably not have felt free to decline the interaction after the officer repeated his motion,and we thus concluded that that the repetition of the motion was the show of authority component of the seizure under the fourth amendment.id.since the individual submitted immediately by remaining seated in the van,he was seized when the officer repeated his request.id.that case does not,however,stand for a per se rule that an officer does not assert his or her authority for fourth amendment purposes until he or she repeats a command.
to the contrary,in determining whether there has been a show of authority,courts must examine all of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether a reasonable person would have felt free to decline the interaction with law enforcement.see brendlin,at.in mendenhall,justice stewart identified such factors as the threatening presence of several officers,the display of a weapon by an officer,some physical touching of the person of the citizen,or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer request might be compelled.united states mendenhall,opinion of stewart.here,three marked police cars nearly simultaneously arrived at witherspoon residence at in the morning.four uniformed police officers immediately got out of their patrol cars and approached lowe and witherspoon,commanding them to show their hands.although the district court did not make explicit findings about the speed with which the officers approached lowe,the record indicates that they arrived in a hurried manner and at least one drew his firearm at some point during the encounter.a reasonable person in lowe position would not have felt free to decline this interaction,turn,and leave.
indeed,the government candidly conceded that the officers made a show of authority from the moment they first approached lowe see united states waterman,cir holding that a show of authority occurred when two uniformed police officers approached a house and commanded that people on the porch show their hands united states smith,cir holding that there was no show of authority when two officers repeatedly asked an individual where is your girl house,but where the two officers were still in their car,neither officer displayed his weapon,there was no physical touching,and no indication as to the language or tone of the officer voice that might have signaled a clear show of authority.
on this record,the officers approach constituted a show of authority,as a reasonable person in lowe position would not have felt free to decline the interaction or leave.however,that does not end our inquiry.we must also determine when lowe submitted to that
