appellant arturo ramirez was convicted of various charges stemming from his participation in a conspiracy to distribute large quantities of cocaine.on appeal,ramirez raises two questions that this court has not yet addressed whether title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,bars the use of testimony and materials sourced from an unsealed set of wiretap recordings,which are identical to a properly sealed set and whether the failure to broadcast audiotape evidence through a public courtroom speaker as it is being played through headphones for the trial participants denies a defendant his sixth amendment right to a public trial we answer both inquiries in the negative,and will affirm the judgment of the district court.
in november and december of,the pennsylvania superior court authorized two wiretaps on mobile telephones used by steven carnivale.pursuant to these wiretaps,authorities simultaneously recorded carnivale telephone conversations on three separate tape recorders.this resulted in three identical sets of tapes.one set was judicially sealed the sealed set and stored.the other two sets were left unsealed the unsealed sets and were used for investigative and trial preparation purposes.
the contents of the intercepted telephone conversations implicated ramirez in a conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.on january,a federal grand jury indicted ramirez on seven criminal counts related to his alleged participation in this conspiracy conspiring to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine,in violation of attempted distribution of more than grams of cocaine,and aiding and abetting,in violation of and,and four counts of unlawful use of a communication facility,in violation of b and distribution of more than five kilograms of cocaine,and aiding and abetting,in violation of and.
before trial,the government notified ramirez that it intended to introduce audiotape copies of the wiretap recordings as trial evidence and to provide jurors with transcripts of the recorded conversations that they could use as an aid to their understanding of those conversations as the tapes were played.the government used the unsealed set to create both the copies and the transcripts.ramirez filed a motion to suppress.in his motion,ramirez argued that since the copies and transcripts were not derived from the sealed set,they did not meet title iii sealing requirements and could not be used at trial.after conducting an evidentiary hearing on the matter,the district court denied ramirez motion.
on january,ramirez was jointly tried with three.at trial,the district court admitted the audiotape copies into evidence over ramirez renewed objections.the district court also made the transcripts of those audiotapes a part of the record so that they were available to the public.
on the morning of january,the government played seven recorded conversations that implicated ramirez in the conspiracy,and elicited testimony from carnivale about those conversations.presentation of this evidence took approximately one hour.all the trial judge,jury,attorneys for all parties,carnivale,and headphones to listen to the recordings that the government played.the jurors also had transcripts of the recordings in their possession.without notifying the court or ramirez,however,the government turned off the public loudspeaker that would have broadcasted the recordings into the courtroom.as a result,any members of the public who attended the trial that morning were unable to hear the recordings as they were being played for the trial participants 
during the court lunch recess,ramirez learned that the recordings played in the morning were not simultaneously broadcasted into the courtroom.once the court reconvened,ramirez counsel notified the court of this fact and moved for a mistrial or,in the alternative,to strike the testimony elicited based on the recordings.ramirez argued that the failure to broadcast the conversations over the public loudspeaker violated his constitutional right to a public trial.in response,the government stated that it had intentionally chosen not to play the tapes over the loudspeaker to ensure that inadmissible portions of the tapes were not accidentally heard.
the district court remarked that the government explanation seemed dis ingenuous.the court pointed out that the government could have avoided any accidents by simply stopping the tapes before reaching any inadmissible portions.nonetheless,the court denied ramirez motion for a mistrial or to strike.the court held that ramirez had waived the issue by failing to raise it earlier.it also concluded that ramirez had not been prejudiced by the government actions.the court,however,ordered that the remainder of the recorded conversations played for the jury should be broadcasted simultaneously over the public loudspeaker.
after the court ruling,the government played additional wiretap recordings,twenty of which were conversations between ramirez and carnivale.each of the recordings were broadcasted over the public loudspeaker as they were played for the jury.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found ramirez guilty of all charges.since ramirez had one prior conviction for a felony drug offense,he was subjected to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of twenty years pursuant to b a.after conducting a hearing,the court sentenced ramirez to twenty years of imprisonment,ten years of supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment of.ramirez filed a timely appeal.

ramirez first claim of error is that the district court improperly allowed the government to present wiretap evidence at trial,in violation of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of.ramirez argues that title iii prohibits the government from introducing the audiotape copies of unsealed wiretap recordings into evidence,using transcripts of those recordings at trial,and eliciting trial testimony about the contents of those recordings.
the contents of intercepted wiretaps or any evidence derived therefrom can not be used at trial if the disclosure of those contents would be in violation of title iii.see united states chavez,d section provides that the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication,and any derivative evidence,may not be used at a criminal trial,or in certain other proceedings,if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.quoting.section authorizes the disclosure of the contents of wiretaps and any derivative evidence at trial 
any person who has received,by any means authorized by this chapter,any information concerning a wire,oral,or electronic communication,or evidence derived therefrom intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may disclose the contents of that communication or such derivative evidence while giving testimony under oath or affirmation in any proceeding held under the authority of the united states or of any state or political subdivision thereof 
section a sets forth preservation and sealing procedures for intercepted wire communications,and makes judicial sealing a prerequisite for trial use and disclosure pursuant to section 
the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall,if possible,be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device.the recording of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication under this subsection shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations.immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order,or extensions thereof,such recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders.they shall not be destroyed except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge and in any event shall be kept for ten years.duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections and of section of this chapter for investigations.the presence of the seal provided for by this subsection,or a satisfactory explanation for the absence thereof,shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom under subsection of section.
here,the government used the unsealed sets to produce the wiretap evidence that it presented at trial the audiotapes played at trial and introduced into evidence were copies of the unsealed sets the transcripts given to the jury were produced from the unsealed sets and the testimony about the recorded conversations was elicited after playing the audiotape copies of the unsealed sets.the sealed sets were left undisturbed in storage throughout the entirety of ramirez trial.
ramirez claims that the government failure to use the sealed set as the source of its wiretap evidence violated a.ramirez points out that section a makes no mention of judicial sealing for d uplicate recordings that are used or disclosed for investigations pursuant to sections and in contrast,section a imposes a judicial sealing requirement for wiretap recordings used and disclosed at trial t he presence of the seal provided for by this subsection shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom under subsection of section.emphasis added.according to ramirez,this means that unsealed duplicates can only be utilized for investigative purposes,and not to prepare evidence and other trial materials.therefore,he argues that since the government wiretap evidence was sourced from unsealed duplicates,its presentation at trial was improper.
we reject ramirez reading of section a because the plain language does not support it.first,section a does not prohibit the government from using unsealed duplicates for purposes that go beyond investigation.in fact,the government may use unsealed duplicates at trial if the contents of those duplicates exist in a set of recordings.section a makes a judicial seal a condition for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom emphasis added.it is silent,however,as to the manner of such a disclosure section a does not,for example,specify that the contents of a wiretap recording must be disclosed through the use of the sealed set of tapes instead of through unsealed duplicates,witness testimony,transcripts,or any other manner of disclosure.see united states rivera,cir this provision broadly states that the content of such recordings may be disclosed in court proceedings,but places no restrictions on the form of the disclosure.this means that section a imposes no restrictions on how the government chooses to use and disclose the contents of a wiretap communication at trial.see id.a s long as the government complies with title iii,it may,at trial,disclose the contents of the recording in whatever fashion it chooses,including the use of duplicate and compilation tapes.united states denton,cir w e find no violation of title iii in the preparation of the composite tapes and transcripts and their admission in evidence.united states dimuro,cir rejecting the argument that section a bars the presentation at trial of a composite tape,and concluding that t he statute does not apply to the preparation of a trial tape of selected intercepted conversations whose accuracy is not at issue see also united states scully,cir there was also no error in allowing the government to produce a single master tape of all the conversations it intended to use and to introduce the master along with the originals into evidence,judgment vacated on other grounds sub nom.united states cabral,d.
second,section a sealing requirement does not preclude unsealed duplicates from being a proper source of the wiretap evidence that the government uses and discloses at trial.to satisfy the sealing requirement,section a demands that the recording of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.once this is done,however,it is the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom,not the contents of the sealed recordings,that may be used or disclosed.this is an important distinction.section a specifically distinguishes between the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication,which shall,if possible,be recorded,and the recording of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication,which shall be sealed under the judge directions.since fulfilling the sealing requirement allows the use and disclosure of the contents,not the judicially sealed recording of the contents,the source of the materials used and disclosed at trial need only be the contents,and not the judicially sealed recording of the contents.therefore,section a does not require the government to source its wiretap evidence from the judicially sealed set of recordings rather than an unsealed set of duplicates,provided that a properly judicially sealed set exists.
in sum,as long as the government has obtained and preserved a set of wiretap recordings in accordance with title iii,section a neither restricts the manner in which the government chooses to use and disclose the contents of those recordings at trial,nor requires the government to source its wiretap evidence from a judicially sealed set of recordings.in other words,under title iii,the government may use duplicate tapes,compilation tapes,transcripts,trial testimony,or any other manner of use or disclosure provided that the contents to be used or disclosed exist in a properly obtained and sealed set of wiretap recordings.
we recognize that section a expressly provides that d uplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections and of section of this chapter for investigations,but contains no similar express authorization for the use of duplicates at trial.unlike ramirez,however,we do not interpret this language as prohibiting the government from using unsealed duplicates or materials sourced from such duplicates at trial.although the principle of statutory construction of expressio unius est exclusio alterius instructs that when congress expresses one thing,it excludes the others,this principle should be taken with a grain of even better,with a grain of common sense.abdullah am.airlines,cir.expressio unius serves only as an aid in discovering legislative intent when that is not otherwise manifest and can never override clear and contrary evidences of congressional intent.id.at quoting united states barnes.and neuberger comm r.
here,section a clear focus is on preserving the accuracy and authenticity of the contents of the wiretap recordings used and disclosed at trial.see a the recording of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication under this subsection shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations.emphasis added united states ojeda rios,d the primary thrust of a,and a congressional purpose embodied in title iii in general,is to ensure the reliability and integrity of evidence obtained by means of electronic surveillance.internal citations omitted dimuro,at the primary purpose of a is to ensure accuracy of recordings at the time of monitoring and to require sealing to deter alterations.allowing the use of unsealed duplicates and materials sourced from such duplicates at trial furthers section a aim an original recording remains sealed and undisturbed so that if a defendant had reason to question the authenticity of the recording,or wished to assert that misleading editing has been done,the original tapes would be available to serve as the definitive record of what was recorded off of the wiretap.rivera,at.in contrast,requiring the use of a sealed set as either the wiretap evidence presented at trial or its source risks compromising the accuracy and authenticity of the co
