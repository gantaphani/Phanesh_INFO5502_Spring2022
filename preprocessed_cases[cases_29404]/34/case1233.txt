opinion of the court 
james turner appeals his judgment of conviction following a jury trial.turner lawyers raise two issues on appeal.in addition,they have noted nine other issues they deem frivolous.further complicating matters,turner has filed several documents pro se.the apparent discord between turner and his counsel invites us to explain the proper role of appellate counsel who represent intransigent clients and to clarify the meaning of our local appellate rule.
in late or early,special agent patrick edwards of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf began patronizing kazoo barber shop school of hard knocks in downtown philadelphia.during his periodic visits to kazoo,agent edwards noticed that his barber whose real name was victor lawson,but who called himself mikail always carried guns.edwards also became aware of illegal activities at kazoo,including the sale of stolen and counterfeit items.this prompted edwards to investigate,and he learned that lawson had been convicted of felonies in pennsylvania and new jersey.consequently,edwards decided to try to purchase firearms at kazoo.
edwards made three purchases from lawson.on a fourth occasion,lawson displayed a kel tec rifle that he boasted could be used for urban combat.edwards expressed interest in the kel tec rifle and said that he would return with money for the purchase.he then prepared probable cause affidavits and obtained a warrant to search lawson residence and kazoo.when atf agents executed the warrants and arrested lawson,they recovered the rifle.edwards traced the rifle to lou loans,a federal firearms licensee in upper darby,pennsylvania.the original buyer was lionel coates.
lawson could not have obtained the rifle legally because he was a felon,so edwards asked him how he got it.lawson responded that he bought the rifle from jabriel in philadelphia.edwards showed lawson a photo array,but lawson could not identify the man who sold him the gun.turner photo was not part of this array.
edwards then interviewed coates,the original purchaser of the rifle,who said that he bought the gun for jabriel.according to coates,jabriel really was named james and lived near and ritner street.edwards entered this information into a database and retrieved turner photo.when presented with an array that included turner photo,coates and lawson identified him as jabriel.
according to coates,jabriel approached him to buy a gun.jabriel drove coates to lou loans and pointed to the kel tec rifle he wanted.a week later,jabriel again drove coates to lou and gave him money to purchase the rifle.both men entered the store,and coates supplied his identification and paperwork,including a written statement that he was the actual buyer of the firearm.when the purchase was complete,the men left the store and placed the gun in jabriel car.jabriel paid coates.
based on this evidence,turner was indicted for three weapons offenses.count one charged him with conspiring to make false statements to a firearms dealer,see,a a,and alleged that coates acted as turner straw purchaser at lou loans.count two charged turner with knowingly aiding and abetting coates in making false statements to a firearms dealer.see a a.count three charged turner with knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony.see g,e.
lawson and coates entered into plea agreements with the government and testified against turner at trial.turner counsel attacked their credibility in his opening statement,suggesting that lawson and coates spill ed their guts to get a deal.counsel also referred to the cooperating witnesses as rotten timbers to support the roof of the government case and called lawson a bad apple and a rat.he concluded his opening statement by asserting that the government had nothing but the testimony of two liars.
during,turner counsel accused agent edwards of helping to orchestrate the government case and insinuated that edwards impermissibly helped lawson identify turner.counsel also implied that lawson had lied to curry favor with the government,asking edwards when victor lawson started to spill the beans,you took notes with respect to all of the individuals that he targeted,correct,and as far as you know how this process works,when he ultimately gets sentenced,who knows how many years from now,the judge who going to be sentencing him is going to hear how he testified in other cases whether the testimony was truthful or not.
on redirect examination,edwards testified that lawson had cooperated with the government in other cases against twelve or thirteen people.according to edwards,lawson provided information regarding home invasions,robberies,straw purchasers,narcotics traffickers,and counterfeiting.when the government asked edwards,w hat happened with the other cases,turner objected.the district court overruled the objection,and edwards answered,a ll of the defendants that have been charged to date have either pled guilty or gone to trial and were found guilty.turner renewed his objection,but the district court denied it because edwards statement was an objective fact.
the jury also heard lawson testify that he initially did not tell edwards that jabriel was turner because lawson had been calling turner jabriel for so long that he had forgotten turner real name.on,turner counsel accused lawson of forget ting things that are convenient and diming out people to fulfill a contract with the government.
during redirect examination,the government argued that turner had opened the door about how well lawson knew turner and sought permission to ask lawson how he kn ew what turner real name was as opposed to his muslim name.the court allowed the government to do so but instructed the government to use pointed questions and to avoid using the word muslim.when questioning resumed,lawson stated that he met turner through a religious organization in the,when he knew him both by his birth name and as jimmy x turner.lawson used this name in a dossier,which was a profile on each member of the religious organization,their name,their home address,their educational background,their criminal records,and so on and so forth.finally,lawson testified that by the time edwards interviewed him,he had forgotten turner real name and only referred to him by the name that given to him in the organization because n obody uses their christian name on the streets.lawson confirmed that his own religious name was mikail.
the jury found turner guilty on all three counts.he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of months imprisonment pursuant to the armed career criminal act,e,and his advisory imprisonment range under the united states sentencing guidelines was to months.the district court varied downward,imposing a sentence of months imprisonment.turner filed a timely notice of appeal.the district court then granted trial counsel leave to withdraw and appointed new counsel for turner 
once on appeal,this case took several unusual turns.first,turner counsel filed what might be called a brief,which raised a combination of colorable and frivolous arguments.as for the colorable arguments,turner counsel challenged the district court failure to give a jury instruction regarding testimony about the guilty pleas and verdicts resulting from lawson cooperation with the government.counsel also challenged the district court failure to strike lawson references to jimmy x turner and the criminal record s in his dossier.in addition to these two arguments,turner counsel raised nine issues in the style of an anders brief,explaining why they considered those issues frivolous.
taking his cue from counsel brief,turner filed a pro se document requesting that his counsel withdraw and advancing entirely new arguments on the merits.because turner styled this document as a supplement to be attached to the brief filed by counsel,we construed it as a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief.two weeks later,turner counsel filed a separate motion for leave for the appellant to file a pro se supplemental brief.in doing so,counsel acknowledged that third circuit local appellate rule prohibits represented parties from filing pro se briefs,but they noted that t
