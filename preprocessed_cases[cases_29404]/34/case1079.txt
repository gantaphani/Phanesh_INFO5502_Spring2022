sometime in the early afternoon of november,local law enforcement officials executed a search warrant at glenwood avenue in rochester,new york the glenwood residence.the warrant,which had issued on the basis of reports by two confidential informants that they had separately bought dime bags of cocaine from persons at that address,authorized a entry and search of the glenwood residence for cocaine,for records showing the sale and trafficking of cocaine,for proceeds from such sales,and for documents indicating the occupancy,residency ownership of the premises.the warrant did not,however,authorize any arrests,nor was there evidence suggesting the involvement of any specific individuals.
lieutenant eric paul paul of the rochester police department was one of the first law enforcement officials to enter the glenwood residence upon entering the residence,paul observed lionel summersett summersett step out of the bathroom at the top of the home stairwell.from the bottom of the stairs,paul ordered summersett to lie on the floor.with gun drawn,paul held summersett in that position until the other officers completed an initial safety sweep of the home ground floor 
paul then went up the stairs.while other officers took summersett into custody,paul went into the upstairs bedroom closest to the stairwell.there he found jerrell heath heath sitting on the bed,talking on a cell phone.paul placed heath in handcuffs,ordered him to lie on a pile of clothes,and him.the frisk revealed nothing incriminating.paul and other officers then searched the bedroom.behind a dresser,concealed from plain view,paul discovered a small bag with ounce of marijuana.the dresser was approximately five feet from where heath was found sitting on the bed talking on the phone.
once paul discovered the marijuana,other members of the rochester police department took heath from the bedroom and formally arrested him.a search attendant to that arrest revealed that heath had in cash.
while heath was being arrested in the hallway,paul continued to search the bedroom and discovered a loaded handgun in the top dresser drawer.paul then left the bedroom and was informed that other officers had found several small bags of cocaine in plain view in the residence.
ultimately,heath was charged with the following offenses possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking,in violation of c a being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g possession of marijuana,in violation of and possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute,in violation of a.thereafter,in proceedings before magistrate judge marian payson,heath argued that he had been arrested without probable cause,and moved to suppress the seized currency.in due course,the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that,because the only evidence linking heath to the marijuana was his proximity to that hidden contraband,the police lacked probable cause for his arrest.the magistrate judge based this conclusion on three fourth amendment cases discussing premises and proximity liability united states di re,sibron new york,d,and ybarra illinois,d.the magistrate judge further held that the supreme court recent decision in maryland pringle,d,did not justify heath arrest,as heath was arrested in a fixed residence,not in an automobile.finally,the magistrate judge determined that the currency found on heath person was not admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine.
the district court telesca,agreed with the magistrate judge recommendation and ordered that the evidence found on heath be suppressed.in so doing,the district court declared its unwillingness to extend pringle to the situation in this case,because fourth amendment jurisprudence recognizes a distinct difference between a passenger in an automobile and an occupant of a fixed premises.
in this interlocutory appeal,the government argues that the district court erred by suppressing the evidence.we need not,at this time,address the government primary contention on heath arrest was constitutional under,assuming arguendo that heath was arrested without probable cause,we find that the evidence at issue may well have been admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine,notwithstanding the putative fourth amendment violation.in so doing,we emphasize that the inevitable discovery doctrine is available only where there is a high level of confidence that each of the contingencies required for the discovery of the disputed evidence would in fact have occurred.in circumstances such as those before us,where the government contends that the challenged evidence would inevitably have been discovered during a search incident to a valid arrest,one of the contingencies that must be resolved in the government favor involves a police officer discretionary decision to arrest and search the person on whom the evidence would presumably have been found.
on the record before us,we believe that the district court erred in reaching a firm conclusion that the currency seized on heath person would not have been inevitably discovered,and we conclude that further consideration of that issue is needed.at the moment of heath arrest,paul and the arresting officers knew only that heath was in the same room as a small,concealed quantity of narcotics.even if this was not an adequate basis upon which to arrest we assume,arguendo,that it was sufficient reason to justify the arrest and a search attendant to the arrest arguably became evident a few moments later.but whether the relevant officers would have acted on that reason,and would then have arrested heath,thereby bringing the inevitable discovery doctrine into play,is not clear to us.nor do we have findings by the district court on the matter.we therefore remand the case for further findings.
under the inevitable discovery doctrine,evidence obtained during the course of an unreasonable search and seizure should not be excluded if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably without the constitutional violation.nix williams,d see also united states eng,cir inevitable discovery doctrine requires the district court to determine,viewing affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,what would have happened had the unlawful search never occurred emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.in essence,the inevitable discovery doctrine application turns on a central question would the disputed evidence inevitably have been found through legal means but for the constitutional violation if the answer is yes,the evidence seized will not be excluded.in the case before us,this inquiry requires the government to prove a that law enforcement officers could have validly arrested heath on the basis of evidence that became available moments after heath was arguably improperly arrested,and b that law enforcement officers would have acted on that evidence and,given the circumstances,would have arrested heath.that is,the currency should not be excluded if there is sufficient proof that a later arrest was valid and sufficiently likely to occur as to qualify as inevitable.
ii.validity of a later arrest 
the arguably valid reason for a later arrest,and hence for inevitable discovery,came about in the following way.as soon as paul emerged from the bedroom,he learned that other officers had discovered several loose dime bags of crack cocaine on the landing of the stairwell,on the stairwell itself,and at the bottom of the stairwell.at that point,paul observed what appeared to be small bags of cocaine in plain view in each of these locations.three of the small bags of cocaine were at the bottom of the stairs.the magistrate judge determined that summersett must have dropped the bags of cocaine on the stairwell and on the landing which were found underneath or around summersett when paul initially commanded him to lie down.the magistrate judge factual the logical inference to be drawn from the circumstances was that the cocaine found underneath or immediately around summersett was dropped by him upon exiting the not clearly erroneous.and so we can not say that the cocaine assertedly dropped by summersett created probable cause to arrest heath,because these facts would not,in and of themselves,lead a person of reasonable caution,united states rogers,cir,to believe that heath was complicit in summersett apparent possession of the cocaine found on the stairwell and on the landing.
but neither the magistrate judge nor the district court reached any similar conclusion as to the origin of the cocaine in plain view at the bottom of the stairwell.while the magistrate judge noted that the logical inference was that the cocaine on the stairwell,and on the landing,was dropped by summersett on his way to or from the bathroom,no such finding was made regarding the origin of the cocaine at the bottom of the stairwell similarly,although the district court order noted that the government evidence did not establish that heath had actually seen narcotics or firearms anywhere in the house prior to the officers entry into the residence,the district court did not,at any point,make specific findings on this question.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party here,heath,see united states harrell,cir,we can not say that heath actually saw the cocaine on the stairwell,on the landing,or at the bottom of the stairwell before he entered the bedroom and began to speak on the cell phone.still,undisputed evidence indicates that the bags of cocaine at the bottom of the stairs were in plain sight when the officers discovered them.and a reasonable officer could,therefore,conclude that the bags at the bottom of the stairs were likely to have been there prior to the arrival of law enforcement officials at the glenwood residence.
under the circumstances,whether heath actually saw the bags of cocaine at the bottom of the stairs before the police entered the glenwood residence is of no import.he could see them,and in fact would be expected to see them,in the regular course of walking through the small home public spaces.as a result,a person of reasonable caution,rogers,at,could properly have concluded that heath had committed or was committing a crime.after all,those who are permitted to observe obvious criminal activity in a home are,absent indications to the contrary,likely to be complicit in the offense.see,united states pennington,cir having entered the residence lawfully,the officers could act upon the drug manufacturing evidence in plain view.that evidence provided probable cause to arrest the occupant of the apartment,which justified a search of his person incident to the arrest.internal citation omitted united states jones,cir concluding that probable cause existed based on defendant evident status as a resident of a private household in which counterfeit money was being sold on a regular basis and in which the evidence of counterfeiting lay in plain view emphasis added united states holder,holding that keeping narcotics openly on display in a private residence was indicative that the residence owner considered a visitor sufficiently complicit to allow him a full view hollyfield united states,cir holding that visible contraband in plain view within the apartment provided probable cause for an arrest of person found therein united states macdonald,cir holding that undercover agent observation of cocaine and marijuana in plain view throughout an apartment containing six men provided probable cause to arrest all six occupants.
in the case before us,there is no evidence that any precautions were taken to prevent people in the house from coming across the putatively visible contraband,and from doing so in the ordinary course of their expected behavior.as a result,reasonably cautious police officers could have concluded that the home adult occupants were complicit in the illegal activities involving the contraband.it follows that the law enforcement officials seemingly had a valid ground for arresting both of the adult occupants of the glenwood residence and,accordingly,we conclude that heath arrest,though effectuated in quick order and arguably prematurely,might well have validly occurred in an appropriate manner as soon as the plainly visible contraband came to the attention of the arresting officers 
iii.inevitability of a later arrest 
in cases where the government argues that disputed evidence would inevitably have been discovered during a search incident to arrest,the government must establish that the arrest would have been valid.but,evidence that an arrest would have been supported by probable cause and,therefore,could legally have taken place,only makes the inevitable discovery doctrine potentially applicable.that is,to find that reasonable police officers could properly believe that they had probable cause to arrest heath shortly after they,seemingly improperly,arrested him does not mean that they would inevitably have done so at the later time.the circumstances of this case force us to focus on the possible gap between,on the one hand,facts that are sufficient to qualify as probable cause and thereby enough to validate an arrest,and,on the other hand,facts that are sufficient to establish that a legal arrest and subsequent search would inevitably have taken place very soon after the arguably unconstitutional arrest.even if the present record provides enough evidence to suggest that a reasonable police officer could have made a valid arrest supported by probable cause,it does not establish with a sufficiently high degree of certainty that a reasonable police officer would have made the arrest under the circumstances.because we can not,on the record before us,resolve this latter contingency,we can not at this time decide whether paul and his fellow officers would in fact have discovered the currency whose exclusion is at issue in this case.we therefore remand the case for more findings.
we have previously indicated that the government can not prevail under the inevitable discovery doctrine merely by establishing that it is more probable than not that the disputed evidence would have been obtained without the constitutional violation see united states cabassa,cir.on the contrary,we held in cabassa that proving that a judge could validly have issued a warrant supported by probable cause was not necessarily enough to establish that a judge would have issued the warrant in question.see id.at.in that case,agents from the drug enforcement agency dea entered the defendant home and seized controlled substances,weapons,and money,all without a warrant.see id.at.at the time of the search,other dea agents were in the process of requesting,but had not obtained,a warrant from a magistrate judge.id.rejecting the district court conclusion that the contraband would inevitably have been found because a warrant would surely have been issued,we suppressed the evidence on the grounds that the magistrate judge might not have granted a warrant to conduct the search.we did so even though we conceded that the district court might well have been correct that the government draft affidavit demonstrated probable cause to support the issuance of a warrant.see id.at.but,because there was some room for disagreement,we found a residual possibility that a magistrate judge would have required a stronger showing of probable cause before authorizing the search and seizure.id.at.since this eventuality could not be resolved in the government favor,we declared the evidence inadmissible.id.
our decision in cabassa established that evidence minimally sufficient to support probable cause would not always be enough to demonstrate that a governmental actor vested with,a magistrate judge asked to issue a act on that evidence on the basis of cabassa,district courts in our circuit have held that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule is available only where a court has a high level of confidence that each of the contingencies needed to obtain the evidence legally would be resolved in the government favor 
the teaching of cabassa,which is supported by principles of probability,thus is straightforward.it suggests that a trial court task in the context of inevitable discovery is to deny the motion to suppress on the ground of inevitable discovery only if it has a high level of confidence that the warrant in fact would have issued and that the specific evidence in question would have been obtained by lawful means.inevitable discovery analysis therefore requires a court to examine each of the contingencies that would have had to have been resolved favorably to the government in order for the evidence to have been discovered legally and to assess the probability of that having occurred.
united states lavan,d,kaplan,emphasis added see also united states arms,wl,block,finding that discovery of the evidence was inevitable when there is no question that a warrant would in fact have issued.
the tenth circuit has similarly required substantial certainty with respect to each of the contingencies involved in the causal chain of inevitability posited by the government.see united states cunningham,cir w e held it permissible for a court to apply the inevitable discovery doctrine when it has a high level of confidence that the warrant in fact would have been issued and that the specific evidence in question would have been obtained by lawful means.inevitable discovery analysis thus requires the court to examine each of the contingencies involved that would have had to have been resolved favorably to the government in order for the evidence to have been discovered legally and to assess the probability of the contingencies having occurred.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.see also united states romero,cir under the inevitable discovery exception,unlawfully seized evidence is admissible if there is no doubt that the police would have lawfully discovered the evidence later.emphasis added.
in contrast,other circuits have required only that there be a reasonable probability that the contested evidence would have been discovered by lawful means in the absence of the police misconduct.united states chambers,cir see also jefferson fountain,cir united states james,cir united states kennedy,cir united states thomas,cir.and before our decision in cabassa,two district courts of this circuit also used the reasonable probability threshold.see united states yanes,dorsey,united states levasseur,glasser.
to the extent that any confusion lingers in our circuit after cabassa,we now expressly eschew the reasonable probability framework that some of our sister circuits have used to analyze inevitable discovery cases.in its consonant with the teachings of cabassa,with the tenth circuit methodology in cunningham,and with the approach most recently taken by our district conclude that evidence will be admissible under the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule only where a court can find,with a high level of confidence,that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government favor.
applying this analysis to the instant case,the issue becomes can we conclude,with sufficient confidence,that law enforcement that they were legally entitled to arrest have done so under the circumstances for the purposes of this inquiry,we apply cabassa analyzed a judge discretionary decision to grant a search a police officer discretionary decision to make an arrest with respect to such a decision by a police officer,we hold that relatively weak evidence of the right to arrest is not sufficient,without further findings,to establish that an officer would,in fact,have made an arrest.to hold otherwise would undermine the discretion we give to police officers to the basis of police protocol,of the circumstances confronting them,and of their trained and in what cases they should use their power to arrest 
for some circuits,evaluating a police officer discretionary decision to arrest as part of the inevitable discovery analysis is nothing new.although,in the decisions we have found,this evaluation resulted in the admission of the evidence,in various key cases,the evidence was admitted only after an express determination that an arrest would,in fact,have occurred.and,the validity of the arrest seemed to be a necessary,but not sufficient,condition for the application of the inevitable discovery rule.thus,in united states cherry,cir,the fifth circuit admitted contested fingerprint evidence after explicitly agreeing with the district court conclusion that the defendant eventually would have been lawfully arrested and fingerprinted.id.at emphasis added similarly,in united states white,cir,the tenth circuit permitted evidence that purportedly would have been found during a lawful arrest only after deciding a that a background check would inevitably have been conducted,and b that ample evidence support ed the conclusion that,once the background check revealed the defendant outstanding warrant,the defendant would have been lawfully arrested id.at emphasis added.hence,in both cherry and white,the circuit court accepted the government argument that the disputed evidence would inevitably have been found during an arrest,but did so after making specific findings,based on a careful examination of the record,not just that the contingent arrest was proper,but also,and importantly,that the arrest was inevitable 
in contrast,in the circumstances of this case,it is possible that an arrest,even if potentially valid,would not have been made.and if no such arrest would have been made,then there would have been no inevitable discovery,and,hence,the currency at issue would be properly excluded.it is,of course,also possible that the arrest and discovery of the cash would have occurred.but,on the record before us and without further findings by the court below,we can not say whether the likelihood of such an arrest was great enough to justify the application of the doctrine of inevitable discovery 
because we can not at this time and on this record know whether inevitable discovery would have occurred,we can not decide whether the district court exclusion of the currency at issue was correct.accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in part ii of the majority opinion holding that the officers here would have had probable cause to arrest heath upon the plain view discovery of cocaine elsewhere on the scene only moments after heath had been arrested,perhaps mistakenly but in good faith,by lieutenant paul.however,because i do not agree with the majority assessment of what the inevitable discovery doctrine requires in this case,or the decision to remand to the district court for further,i respectfully dissent from parts i and iii of the majority opinion.
the majority opinion requires that,for the inevitable discovery doctrine to apply in this case,the district court must be convinced with a high level of confidence not only that the officers in question would have had probable cause to arrest heath only moments after they had arguably prematurely arrested question answered in the affirmative in part also that the officers actually would have arrested heath once they had probable cause to do so.for the reasons stated below,i disagree with the majority decision to impose what could be called a probable standard in the context of a search incident to an exception to the warrant importing a standard more appropriately limited to those cases in which the police have engaged in a warrantless search of property otherwise unsupported by any exception to the warrant requirement.moreover,even under the legal standard devised by the majority,i see no need to remand here so that the district court may confirm what is already apparent on the,that given the willingness of the officers in question to arrest heath without probable cause,they inevitably would have done the same once they had even greater reason,probable cause to arrest heath only moments later.
in requiring separate proof that the officers would have arrested heath once they had probable cause to do so,the majority relies heavily on the implied teachings of our court in united states cabassa,cir,as well as the gloss put on that case by the district court in united states lavan,d,and the tenth circuit adoption of a high level of confidence standard in united states cunningham,cir,and united states souza,cir.i do not doubt that cabassa and its progeny set forth a reasonable approach for those circumstances in which the police have entered into a home without a warrant.indeed,prior cases have indicated that courts view warrantless property searches with suspicion and thus require a showing that the police had taken tangible steps to ensure that they inevitably would have obtained a warrant from a neutral and detached magistrate.see,cabassa,at requiring,i n cases in which a claim of inevitable discovery is based on the expected issuance of a warrant,an analysis of the extent to which the warrant process has been completed at the time those seeking the warrant learn of the search the strength of the showing of probable cause at the time the warrantless entry occurred whether a warrant was actually obtained after the illegal entry whether the same evidence would have been discovered pursuant to the warrant during a hypothetical subsequent search and whether there is any evidence that law enforcement agents jumped the gun because they lacked confidence in their showing of probable cause.
courts require these detailed showings of each of the contingencies involved,see lavan,d at,precisely because they do not wish to encourage officers to obviate or nullif y the fourth amendment warrant requirement by baldly asserting that they inevitably would have had the probable cause needed to obtain a warrant.see,united states mejia,cir t o excuse the failure to obtain a warrant merely because the officers had probable cause and could have obtained a warrant would completely obviate the warrant requirement.united states brown,cir to say that a warrant is required for a search is to say that the police must get judicial approval before acting.yet if probable cause means that discovery is inevitable,then the prior approval requirement has been nullified.united states cherry,cir when the police forego legal means of investigation simply in order to obtain evidence in violation of a suspect constitutional rights,the need to deter is paramount and requires application of the exclusionary rule.united states eng,cir noting that special care is required on the part of a district court when the government relies on the subpoena power in light of the need to prevent the inevitable discovery exception from swallowing the exclusionary rule.
however,the concerns animating these,the need to deter warrantless property not apply with equal force to the facts of this case.not only were lieutenant paul and his fellow officers lawfully on the premises pursuant to a valid search reducing any significant concern that applying the inevitable discovery doctrine in this case would subvert the fourth amendment warrant evidence here,and the logical inferences therefrom,demonstrate that the police would have obtained heath currency during a valid search conducted pursuant to a exception to the warrant requirement,namely,a search incident to a lawful arrest.see united states allen,cir e ven assuming that the search of the defendant was conducted prior to the discovery of the cocaine on his companion,the defendant could have been searched seconds later,once the cocaine provided probable cause to arrest therefore,the search was incident to a lawful arrest regardless of the exact sequence of events emphases added united states romero,cir recognizing,without inquiring whether the officers would necessarily have arrested the defendant,that the discovery of the marijuana in the van provided probable cause to arrest the defendant,and upon arrest the officers unquestionably would have searched the defendant and discovered the marijuana in his pocket emphasis added see also united states,cir applying inevitable discovery exception because,although the defendant had been prematurely arrested,the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant vehicle and would have noticed the suspicious burlap bags during the course of a lawful terry stop.
moreover,even if we were to distinguish the circumstances of this case from the clear import of the holdings in allen,romero,and thereby require evidence that the officers would in fact have arrested heath once they had obtained probable cause to arrest him only moments after the initial arguably unlawful see no need to remand for further in this particular case.absent a conclusion that the officers here would only have arrested heath when they lacked probable cause,there is little reason to conclude that the officers in question somehow would have backed down from their earlier decision to arrest heath,even though they would have had a stronger,probable which to make that very arrest immediately thereafter.
our decision in united states eng,cir,provides a constructive framework of analysis for this case and,i believe,demonstrates that a remand would be unnecessary here.in eng,we noted that proof of inevitability is made more convincing when the areas of the search or investigation are,the government effort is planned and methodical,and a direct causal relationship and reasonably close temporal relationship exist between what was known and what had occurred prior to the government misconduct and the allegedly inevitable discovery of the evidence.eng,at see also id.at i nevitable discovery analysis logically must begin with the progress of the investigation at the time of the government misconduct.
in this case,each of these factors weigh heavily against the granting of a remand.unlike a hypothetical scenario in which,for example,the police initially arrest a defendant without probable cause and then contend that they inevitably would have arrested the defendant days later,in a different location,and as part of a separate investigation,the demonstrated historical facts,see nix williams,d,here show that the officers would have obtained an independent basis of probable cause to arrest heath at the same location at which the original,arguably unlawful,arrest of heath had taken place as part of the same search and investigation that led to the initial arrest and only a few moments,op.at,after the alleged government misconduct had occurred.it is precisely the seamless nature of the police search of the premises and the nearly simultaneous arrests of heath and summersett that should lead us to conclude here that there is no residual possibility,see cabassa,at,that heath would not have been arrested only moments later,at the same location,and as part of the same investigation.see allen,at applying inevitable discovery doctrine where it was clear that both searches occurred at approximately the same time romero,at noting that the evidence clearly would have been discovered within a short time through a lawful investigation already underway lavan,d at finding inevitability because there were relatively few contingencies,and the probability that each would have been resolved in the government favor was extraordinarily high cabassa,d at noting that no one can say with any certainty how much time would have been taken to complete the warrant application,to submit it to the magistrate judge for consideration,and to secure the warrant issuance,and questioning even whether the evidence would have been in the apartment when a lawful search occurred eng,at noting that some weeks passed between the warrantless search of the defendant safe and the issuance of some of the subpoenas and that d elays of this kind are not fully consistent with the suggestion that the government was informed and ready to move as soon as the defendant was arrested and the risk of flight removed emphasis added id.at outlining in eight paragraphs several specific contingencies and unresolved factual inquiries necessitating a remand.
accordingly,having determined in part ii of the majority opinion that the officers here would have had probable cause to arrest heath based on the plain view discovery of cocaine elsewhere in the apartment,we should conclude,just as did the courts in allen,romero,and,that heath currency inevitably would have been discovered pursuant to a exception to the warrant requirement,in a search incident to arrest.moreover,even if the inevitable discovery doctrine requires evidence that the officers in question inevitably would have arrested the defendant,no remand should be granted here due to the demonstrated historical facts already evident in the record.
because the majority in part ii has misconstrued the record below,inadequately deferred to the lower court findings,and lowered the threshold for a probable cause finding under the fourth amendment,i respectfully dissent from part ii of the majority opinion that finds the police had probable cause to arrest heath.i also respectfully dissent from part i of judge calabresi opinion.given the record before this court,there is not sufficient evidence on which to conclude that the police inevitably would have arrested heath,and,accordingly,i concur in part iii of judge calabresi opinion.
the task in this appeal is to determine whether the trial court has applied the proper legal principles and whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous.puritan ins.eagle,cir.if the factual findings are not clearly erroneous,this court may not disturb them.id.in undertaking this task,the court is required to give considerable deference to the trial court determination as to which of competing inferences should be drawn from the evidence of record.id.
contrary to the findings of the magistrate judge and the district judge,judge calabresi,in part ii,states that police found dime bags of cocaine in three separate locations,and that the court below made no finding concerning the origin of the cocaine found at one of those locations,the bottom of the stairs.see op.part ii at.however,the court below found that dime bags of cocaine were found in two places,at the top landing of the stairs under or near the prone summersett and at the bottom of the stairwell,and,based on the record,reasonably inferred that the dime bags were dropped by summersett on his way to or from the bathroom.
the record clearly supports these findings.lieutenant paul testified that he did observe what appeared to be cocaine on the upper stairwell on the landing underneath summersett legs as well as cocaine that was downstairs in the bottom of the stairwell.suppression hr g tr.at emphasis added.several answers later,he testified that,there was cocaine on the stairwell,at the bottom of the stairwell as well as the landing itself.id.at see also id.at.thus,paul identified two locations on the stairwell upper and bottom.
the majority in part ii appears to read this latter testimony to find a third location and then states that the court below did not conclude that summersett dropped the cocaine at the bottom of the stairs.see op.at.however,the court below did make that finding after noting that paul observed the bags both at the top and the bottom of the stairs,the magistrate judge,in her report and recommendation that the district court adopted in full,inferred that the dime bags of cocaine fell from summersett on his way to or from the bathroom.see united states heath,slip op.at may,heath i.this inference is strongly supported by the fact that summersett was on the move when the police entered,and heath was not further record support for this inferential finding is that summerset had bags of cocaine on and around him when he was ordered to lie down by paul.id.at.the court below then found that it could not infer that the dime bags were visible to heath before the police entered.united states heath,p,slip op.at july,heath ii.in fact,in referring to the residence as a whole,the district court specifically found that the government offered no evidence that drugs or guns were in sight prior to the officers entry,or that the property was being used as a drug house.id.emphasis added.these findings and inferences must be reviewed only for clear error,see puritan,at,and must be viewed in a light most favorable to the prevailing party below,in this case heath,see united states harrell,cir.
after stating that the district court factual findings concerning the cocaine did not include the three dime bags at the bottom of the stairs,the majority in part ii acknowledges that it can not say that heath saw the cocaine.instead,it opines that whether heath saw the dime bags of cocaine at the bottom of the stairs is of no import.op.part ii at.the majority in part ii cites several cases for the proposition that a person of reasonable caution the circuit standard when determining the existence of probable cause under united states rogers,cir could properly conclude that those who are permitted to observe obvious criminal activity in a home are,absent indications to the contrary,likely to be complicit in the offense.op.part ii at citing united states pennington,cir united states jones,cir united states holder,united states macdonald,cir in banc hollyfield united states,cir.therefore,the majority in part ii concludes,the police would have had probable cause to arrest heath based on the cocaine discovered in plain view at the bottom of the stairwell shortly after he was actually arrested.see op.part ii at.
none of the cases relied on by the majority,however,support this broad proposition furthermore,each case involved situations inapposite to the one here it is the absence of the fact of unavoidable observation of criminal activity,or even some evidence that heath knew or could have known of the presence of cocaine,that serves as the point of distinction between the cases cited by the majority in part ii and this case.in pennington,the defendant owned and resided in a house where authorities found drug manufacturing equipment in plain view and where there were odors in the house associated with methamphetamine production.at.similarly,in jones,at,the police,upon entering the defendant residence,observed the defendant wife attempt to stuff an envelope full of counterfeit bills down her pants in his immediate presence.in addition,there were numerous items of contraband scattered in plain view throughout the house.id.in holder,the police found the defendant standing approximately five feet from several bags of cocaine base,a razor,a plate with cocaine base on it,and an individual sitting at a table who was holding a package of cocaine.at.in macdonald,a case in which the defendant challenged the finding of exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless entry and not the finding of probable cause to arrest,the defendant,counting a stack of money and in reach of a gun,was present during an undercover drug sale that immediately proceeded the arrest.at.the police in macdonald also smelled marijuana in the apartment where the sale and arrest occurred.id.
in each of these cases,it was unavoidable for the defendant to have observed the criminal activity in his presence based on one or more of the following findings he was actively participating in it he could not help but perceive the odor of drugs he was in the presence of a notorious display of drugs or he was an owner and a resident of the dwelling in which the plain view contraband discovery took place.it does not follow from these cases that probable cause hinges on the mere possibility of observing criminal activity in a dwelling.rather,the defendants in these cases actually observed criminal activity.moreover,the criminal activity in each of these cases was overwhelmingly conspicuous,in contrast to the potential presence of three dime bags of cocaine at the bottom of a flight of stairs for example,in holder,the immediate proximity of the defendant to the proximity which is lacking in the record of this found necessary to support the inference that the defendant had knowledge of the criminal activity.as the holder court opined 
more crucially,in this case the drugs were openly on display,and therefore appellant proximity to the drugs clearly reflected his knowledge of,and probably his involvement in,narcotics activity unlike the situation in ybarra,where the defendant presence in a public tavern was itself ostensibly innocent,holder presence in a private apartment just a few feet from a table full of cocaine can hardly be so described.this is not a case in which officers probable cause depended partly on mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity.the grounds for suspecting the other occupant applied almost equally to holder.
at quoting ybarra illinois,d first,second,and third emphasis added citation omitted.at most,the cases relied on by the majority in part ii stand for the proposition that probable cause exists where a person is undeniably in the presence of criminal activity they do not support the broader proposition that merely inferring the possibility that a defendant was permitted to observe criminal activity provides sufficient probable cause to arrest.see op.part ii at.
however,even if the standard utilized by the majority in part ii was correct,there is no basis in the record for inferring that heath was permitted to observe the three dime bags of cocaine.as already noted,the district court found that there was no evidence that drugs or guns were in sight prior to the officers entry,or that the property was being used as a drug house.heath ii at.asserting,as the majority in part ii does,that the bags of cocaine at the bottom of the stairs were in plain sight when the officers discovered them,op.part ii at,does not encompass the conclusion that the three dime bags of cocaine were in heath sight before the officers discovered them,and this assertion is not equivalent to the finding by the majority in part ii that they were in plain view at a time when heath was permitted to see them,see id.at.based on the record below,the possibility that heath was permitted to observe criminal activity is pure speculation.since the government bore the burden of proof at the suppression hearing,see,nix williams,d see also united states eng,cir,this speculation can not support a reversal of the district court.
there was also nothing in the record to suggest that heath was an owner or tenant of the residence,or evidence to connect him to the residence,such as keys or mail.there was also no evidence as to heath relationship to summersett,to the children found downstairs,or to anyone else with a connection to the residence.the inferences that could be drawn about the participation in criminal activity from the relationship of the defendants to the property and to each other in pennington and jones simply can not be drawn here.further,other than the putative dime bags,there is no physical evidence of conspicuous criminal activity occurring in the presence of heath prior to the entry of law enforcement,such as odors or paraphernalia,as was present in pennington,jones,holder,and macdonald.in those cases,such facts supported the conclusion that the defendant was implicated in the discovered criminal activity.
on the record before the court and the findings below,supreme court precedent compels the conclusion that paul lacked probable cause to arrest and then search heath.in each of several cases,a defendant was illegally searched,or arrested and then searched,based upon his mere proximity to suspected illegal activity.in ybarra,the defendant was searched because he was in a bar whose bartender was suspected of dealing drugs.at.in united states di re,the defendant was found in a car with an informant,a known suspect,and visible contraband.in sibron new york,the defendant was observed over the course of eight hours speaking to known drug addicts,d.the supreme court held in each case that a defendant mere proximity to contraband,suspect individuals,or illegal activity did not give the police probable cause to search or arrest him see ybarra,at.di re,at.sibron,at.as the supreme court explained in ybarra,a person mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,without more,give rise to probable cause to search that person.at.citing sibron,at.such a search or seizure must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.this requirement can not be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be.id.
this case is much closer to ybarra than to the cases relied on by the majority in part ii.the location searched here was a private residence,and the police found a small amount of cocaine in plain view in an open area.however,there is no evidence that heath was a resident of the dwelling,that he made any suspicious movements or uttered any incriminating statements,or that he observed,or could have observed,or knew,or should have known,about the cocaine at the bottom of the stairwell.nor did the government present any other evidence linking heath to the cocaine found at the bottom of the stairwell.as stated in ybarra,a search of a person must be based on probable cause particularized to that person.at.m ere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not create probable cause particularized to the others present.id.
the majority in part ii accepts the finding below that the cocaine near summersett is attributable to him and not to heath.because the government did not offer any evidence to support a finding that the cocaine lying at the bottom of the stairs at the time of their may not have been present before their attributable to heath,or that he knew or could have known about it,the government and the majority in part ii are left with the argument that heath mere presence in the residence not in proximity to,or within sight of,the cocaine is sufficient for a finding of probable cause to arrest and search him.this argument has been rejected by the supreme court.see,ybarra,at.
therefore,on the record before this court,i would affirm the ruling of the district court regarding the lack of probable cause to arrest heath.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from parts i and ii of the opinion.
however,given the majority opinion in part ii,i concur in part iii of judge calabresi opinion because the record before us does not support the conclusion that the police would have inevitably arrested heath on the basis of the alternative source of probable cause discussed in part ii.
paul was the only witness to testify at the suppression hearing.the account of the search and of heath arrest is based entirely on paul undisputed testimony.
the initial downstairs sweep revealed two children.
the magistrate judge did state,in a general comment about the bags of cocaine found throughout the glenwood residence,that the record does not indicate whether summersett dropped the bags on his way to or from the bathroom or when he was ordered to lie down on the stairwell,or whether they were recovered during the officers search of him.there is nothing in the record currently before us,however,that supports the position that these three possibilities were the only ways in which the cocaine could have found its way to the bottom of the stairs.we do not know whether the magistrate judge list of possible origins of the found drugs was meant to be exclusive.but if it was,that finding would be clearly erroneous.see,krizek cigna group,cir recognizing that factual findings were clearly erroneous where the record before the court was simply devoid of any basis for the district court conclusion.it is possible to read the magistrate judge order,and paul testimony,as asserting that cocaine was found in only two top of the stairwell which,on this reading,includes the landing,and at the bottom of the stairwell.while we do not read the record in this fashion,we note that even if the cocaine at issue were found in just two locations,the magistrate judge findings still would not appear to address the origin of the cocaine at the bottom of the court statement that the logical inference,it seems to me,is that the bags of cocaine fell from summersett on his way to or from the bathroom,is best read as a statement that the bags of cocaine at the top of the stairwell were dropped during summersett exit from the upstairs bathroom.there is nothing in the record as we have it at this time to support the inference that summersett,while held at gunpoint and observed by paul,or once taken into custody by the other agents,somehow managed,undetected,to throw several bags of cocaine onto the floor of the apartment at
