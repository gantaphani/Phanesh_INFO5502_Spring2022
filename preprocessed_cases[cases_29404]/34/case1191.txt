ebon brown brings this appeal following his conviction in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,g.he raises three arguments on appeal.first,he argues the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the firearm recovered by law enforcement.second,he argues that the district court erroneously admitted,under federal rule of evidence b,evidence that he had previously obtained guns through a straw purchaser.and third,he argues that a new trial is warranted because the district court permitted the prosecutor to make improper statements during closing arguments we are not persuaded by brown argument that evidence of the firearm should have been suppressed.we agree,however,that the district court erred in admitting evidence of brown past firearm purchases and by overruling brown objection to the prosecutor closing arguments.because the rule b error was not harmless,we will vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for a new trial.
in the early morning hours of march,four pittsburgh police detectives judd emery,mark adametz,calvin kennedy,and thomas gault were patrolling pittsburgh hill district in an unmarked police cruiser.as the detectives approached the intersection of wylie avenue and duff street,they observed a maroon chevy impala driven by ebon brown park near the intersection across the street from the flamingo bar,a nuisance bar where drug dealing and shootings regularly occur.all four detectives believed the impala had been parked too close to the intersection in violation of.see app.
the detectives stopped their cruiser in the middle of the street and watched as brown and three other passengers exited the impala.as brown was stepping out,he looked in the detectives direction and appeared to recognize their unmarked cruiser.brown then sat back down in the impala and made a motion which appeared consistent with removing an object from his waistband and placing it beneath the driver seat.brown then stepped out of the vehicle,closed the door,and walked in the direction of the flamingo bar.all four detectives testified that,based on their experience,they believed brown had removed a gun from his person and attempted to conceal it under the driver seat.see app.
the detectives exited the police cruiser and approached brown and the other passengers.the detectives badges were visible and they identified themselves as pittsburgh police officers.detective gault began speaking with brown and informed him that the impala was parked in an illegal location.as this exchange was taking place,detective emery walked around to the passenger side of the impala and shined his flashlight through the windshield.with the inside of the vehicle illuminated,detective emery observed the grip and rear slide portion of a firearm sticking out from underneath the driver seat.app.detective emery immediately gestured to detective gault by extending his thumb and index finger that there was a gun in the vehicle.after seeing detective emery gesture,detective gault grabbed brown to prevent him from fleeing.the detectives then asked brown whether he had a permit to carry the firearm.when brown answered that he did not,they placed him under arrest.
detective emery retrieved the gun from the impala,cleared a round from the chamber,and placed it in the trunk of the detectives cruiser.the detectives then performed searches of the other passengers,but found no weapons and did not place anyone else under arrest.at brown request,the detectives gave the keys to the impala to another passenger,james cole.cole moved the impala to a legal parking space,and then he and the others proceeded to the flamingo bar.
the government charged brown in a indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.prior to trial,brown filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the gun retrieved from underneath the impala seat.he argued that the police conducted an unlawful stop and that they did not have a lawful basis to search the vehicle.the district court denied the motion to suppress,app,and brown proceeded to trial.
brown theory at trial was that the firearm belonged to his girlfriend,brittney mccoy,and that she had left it beneath the seat of the impala without his knowledge.mccoy testified for the defense and corroborated brown story.mccoy explained that she had borrowed the impala from its owner,cassandra whitaker,on the evening of march,because she needed it for an appointment the following morni ng a.mccoy stated that immediately after borrowing the car,she removed the gun which she had purchased for personal protection in august from her purse and placed it under the driver seat.she then drove the impala to brown house and parked it in the driveway directly behind brown car.according to mccoy,later that evening while she and brown were trying to sleep,her nephew called and asked brown to give his girlfriend a ride somewhere.brown agreed and left in the impala because it was blocking his car in,not knowing the gun was under the seat.a.
the government maintained that brown physically possessed the gun and placed it under the seat of the impala after he spotted the police cruiser.the government also argued that even though mccoy purchased the gun,she had really purchased it for brown.to establish this claim,the government sought to introduce under federal rule of evidence b statements that brown made nearly seven years earlier in admitting that he had used a straw purchaser to acquire firearms.in january,brown was arrested by pittsburgh police for public urination.pursuant to a lawful search of brown vehicle in connection with his arrest,police officers recovered a handgun and more than stamp bags of heroin.after his arrest,brown agreed to speak with agents of pittsburgh bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms,and explosives atfe.brown informed atfe agents that he had repeatedly sold heroin to a white male who had agreed to buy firearms for brown in exchange for the drugs.brown claimed that the white male had purchased twelve guns on six different occasions,which brown then sold to friends and relatives.brown was later convicted of possession with the intent to distribute heroin and possession of a gun in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.he was not charged with any crime related to the straw purchase transactions.
in a pretrial motion,brown sought to exclude the statement he had made to the atfe agents about using a straw purchaser to obtain firearms.in response,the government argued the statement was relevant to show that brown did have the knowledge that there was a firearm in his car and that he knows what firearms are.app.further,the government argued that these statements supported its theory that mccoy straw purchased this firearm for brown.app.brown countered that the statement would be relevant only for propensity purposes,merely showing that if he had used straw purchasers before,then he must have used mccoy as a straw purchaser for this gun.he also argued that the government did not have any evidence that mccoy was involved in the earlier straw purchases or that she purchased this firearm in concert with brown.app.
after hearing from the parties,the district court agreed with the government and concluded that the evidence was relevant to show motive or knowledge and that type of thing along those lines.app.however,the court concluded the statements would be admissible only if mccoy took the stand and testified that she had purchased the firearm for personal purposes.a.the court also limited the manner in which the evidence could be introduced,allowing the government to introduce only a stipulation that brown used straw purchasers to acquire guns.the parties agreed to the language of a stipulation,which was read to the jury at the close of evidence.the stipulation provided the defendant acknowledges using straw parties to purchase firearms for him in the past.app.despite brown agreement to the language of the stipulation,the court noted his continuing objection to its admissibility under rule b.
during summation,defense counsel argued that there was a gap in the prosecution case because there was no fingerprint evidence connecting brown to the gun.defense counsel stated that none of us would have to be here today if there had been a fingerprint analysis because it would show what you already know,that brown never possessed that gun or ammunition.app.at the conclusion of defense counsel closing argument,the prosecution requested an instruction stating that the government was not legally obligated to use any particular investigative technique.app.the court agreed and gave the following instruction 
you have just heard argument by counsel that the government did not use specific investigative techniques,such as fingerprint analysis.you may consider these facts in deciding whether the government has met its burden of proof however,there is no legal requirement that the government use any specific investigative technique 
the prosecutor then began his rebuttal by flipping defense counsel argument,stating that w e have heard any expert from the defense regarding fingerprints.app.brown objected to this remark and argued that it impermissibly placed a burden on the defense.the court sustained the objection and struck the comment.app.the prosecutor then continued to address the lack of fingerprints.i want to see if we can talk about your own common sense in your daily experience about fingerprints,he said.app.the prosecutor explained that,in the heat of the moment,detectives do not have time to get out rubber gloves,to put this thing in a paper bag,and then go walk it over to the police vehicle and put it in a plastic evidence bag.app.he then followed this point with the following remarks,which are central to one of brown arguments on appeal 
you heard the officer,the first thing he did on this particular occasion was to take the gun,he moved the slide back to take the one round that was in the chamber out of there and then he extracted the other rounds from the magazine he quickly put it back in the police car and in the process of doing that,he put his own fingerprints on what may have possibly existed there.we have no way of knowing whether there could be fingerprints on there,but i want to talk about your own common sense and your daily experiences.
many of you probably have children.your children probably touch your coffee table.coffee table may have a glass top to it.when you see those marks that are on the coffee table from your children,do you see fingerprints of the type when the police officers roll fingerprints or do you see smudges and smears,things that come into contact with that but could not be called fingerprints they smudges and smears.even on a nice,clean,smooth surface like a piece of glass that is on your coffee table you find only smears and smudges,you do not find fingerprints.
at this point,defense counsel objected and argued the prosecution was testifying about facts that were not in evidence.app.you do see fingerprints on glass surfaces.we did hear testimony about that.defense counsel argued that the prosecutor statement fairly implied,if not explicitly stated,that a fingerprint could only smudge or smear glass,not put fingerprints on it,which is he could suggest that is common sense,that that a fact,but it not we did hear testimony on that,so we need a qualifier.app.the district court overruled the objection and allowed the prosecutor to continue making the argument as long as he direct ed his statements to common sense and not the jurors everyday lives.app.
after the objection was overruled,the prosecutor continued arguing that the jurors common sense should inform them that smudges and smears on a glass table are not the type of fingerprints that one would roll from a police thing.app.he then extrapolated this point to the firearm recovered by law enforcement,arguing that the jurors common sense should inform them that a gun with a microtextured surface is equally unlikely to hold fingerprints.app.rhetorically asking the jurors is it likely that you going to find fingerprints on a firearm with a microtextured surface,from your own experience,from your common sense.
the jury returned a verdict convicting brown of the single g offense charged.the district court subsequently sentenced brown to a month term of imprisonment.this timely appeal fol lowed 
brown raises three arguments on appeal.first,he contends the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the firearm.second,he argues the stipulation about his prior use of a straw purchaser was improperly admitted.and third,he argues that a new trial is warranted because the prosecutor made improper statements during his closing argument that fundamentally affected the fairness of the trial.we address these arguments seriatim.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.brown contends that both his seizure by police and the seizure of the firearm and ammunition from the impala were violative of his fourth amendment rights.we disagree.
police encounters with citizens fall into one of three broad categories,each with varying degrees of constitutional scrutiny exchanges involving no coercion or detention brief seizures or investigatory detentions and arrests.united states perez,th cir.the first type of encounter does not implicate the fourth amendment.united states williams,cir stating that officers do not violate the fourth amendment merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places see also florida bostick.the second category,brief seizures or terry stops requires a showing that the officer acted with reasonable suspicion.illinois wardlow,stating that an officer may conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot citing terry ohio.and the third category,arrests is proper only when an officer has probable cause.beck ohio,whether an arrest was constitutionally valid depends upon whether,at the moment the arrest was made,the officers had probable cause to make it.here,the detectives brief interaction with brown touched on all three but was valid under each.
the initial step in our suppression analysis is to determine whether a seizure has taken place and,if so,when the seizure occurred.united states torres,cir johnson campbell,cir stating that in conducting a suppression analysis,the court must first determine at what moment the defendant was seized.as already noted,a fourth amendment seizure does not occur simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions.bostick,at.rather,a seizure occurs only when a police officer,by means of physical force or show of authority,has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.united states crandell,cir quoting terry,at.
we apply an objective test when evaluating whether an officer show of authority would have led a reasonable person to believe they were not free to leave.crandell,at stating that the test is whether a reasonable person in light of all the circumstances would have perceived the officer actions as restrictive.the supreme court has articulated several factors to be considered as part of this objective inquiry,including,inter alia,the threatening presence of several officers,the display of a weapon by an officer,some physical touching of the person of the citizen,or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer request might be compelled.united states mendenhall,see also united states drayton.
considering these factors,we agree with the learned district judge that no seizure occurred prior to the moment detective gault physically grabbed brown to prevent him from fleeing the scene.there was nothing about the detectives brief initial approach that constituted a fourth amendment seizure.the evidence at the suppression hearing shows that the detectives did not activate their lights or sirens,brandish their weapons,block brown path,physically touch brown,or make any threats or intimidating movements.instead,the detectives merely exited their cruiser and approached brown in a public space to discuss their concerns about where the impala was parked.
brown argues that the detectives demonstrated their authority by approaching in a group of four,displaying their badges,and identifying themselves as pittsburgh police officers.these facts are not enough to tilt the balance in brown favor.a fourth amendment seizure does not occur merely because police officers identify themselves when engaging a citizen in conversation.and although the detectives approached in a group,as the district court found,there was no threatening presence,since the number of detectives evenly matched the number of individuals who had exited the impala.app.citing mendenhall,at.we agree with the district court that the totality of the circumstances suggests that the detectives approach and initial contact with brown was a mere encounter that did not implicate the fourth a mendment 
although the detectives initial interaction with brown did not implicate the fourth amendment,the encounter ripened into a terry stop at the moment detective gault grabbed brown waistband to prevent him from fleeing.although this conduct constituted a fourth amendment seizure,it is that officers do not need to obtain a warrant to conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.wardlow,at citing terry,at.
reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence.wardlow,at citing united states sokolow.the officer must simply have some objective justification for the stop and must be able to articulate more than an unparticularized suspicion or hunch that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity.wardlow,at citing terry,at.when making reasonable suspicion determinations,reviewing courts must look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.united states arvizu,quoting united states cortez.this process allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.id.quoting cortez,at.we give considerable deference to police officers determinations of reasonable suspicion.united states mosley,cir 
we agree with the district court that detective gault brief seizure of brown was supported by reasonable suspicion.detective gault grabbed brown after detective emery had legally observed the firearm under the impala driver seat and communicated his discovery by making a hand gesture.although there may be some circumstances where simple knowledge of a firearm does not provide reasonable suspicion for a terry stop,see united states ubiles,cir,here the observation of the firearm is considered in conjunction with the fact that the officers witnessed brown make furtive movements consistent with an attempt to conceal the weapon and the fact that the encounter occurred in a high crime area.wardlow,at see id.o fficers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.united states valentine,cir noting the fact that the stop occurred in a high crime area among the relevant contextual considerations in a terry analysis.viewing these circumstances as a whole,we find that the brief detention of brown was justified by reasonable suspicion.
we also find no constitutional infirmity with brown subsequent custodial arrest.immediately after seizing brown,the detectives inquired whether he had a permit to carry the firearm.when brown answered that he did not,the officers placed him under arrest.brown admission that he lacked a permit to carry the firearm provided probable cause to support his arrest.
the detectives also did not violate the fourth amendment when they recovered the gun from the impala.officers may conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle incident to arrest in two instances if the arrestee is within reaching distances of the vehicle during the search,or if the police have reason to believe that the vehicle contains evidence relevant to the crime of arrest.davis united states,quoting arizona gant.this case fits squarely within the second exception because unlawful firearm possession was the crime for which brown was arrested.
for these reasons,we will affirm the district court denial of brown motion to suppress the firearm.
brown next challenges the district court decision to allow the government to introduce evidence that he had previously used a straw purchaser to obtain firearms.we hold that the admission of this evidence was improper.
federal rule of evidence b,which governs the admissibility of a defendant prior bad acts,provides that e vidence of a crime,wrong,or other act is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.b.the rule states,however,that t his evidence may be admissible for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.b.
we have explained that rule b is generally a rule of exclusion.united states caldwell,wl,at cir.july.it directs that evidence of prior bad acts be excluded unless the proponent can demonstrate that the evidence is admissible for a non propensity purpose.id.our opinions have repeatedly and consistently emphasized that the party seeking to admit evidence under rule b bears the burden of demonstrating its applicability.id.at.
there are four distinct steps that must be satisfied before prior bad act evidence may be introduced at trial it must be offered for a proper purpose that is at issue in the case it must be relevant to that purpose its probative value must not be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under rule and it must be accompanied by a limiting instruction,if one is requested.caldwell,wl,at citing united states davis,cir.this methodical process requires careful precision by both the proponent in proffering the prior act evidence and by the trial judge who must decide the question of admissibility.id.at.
at trial,the government argued that brown statement to atfe agents that he had used a straw purchaser to obtain firearms was relevant to show that he did have the knowledge that there was a firearm in his car and that he knows what firearms are.app.applying the framework described above,we must first determine whether the identified purpose here,knowledge is at issue in the case,and then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant to that purpose.
when evaluating whether a purpose is at issue,we consider the material issues and facts the government must prove to obtain a conviction.caldwell,wl,at quoting united states sampson,cir.in other words,the government can not offer rule b evidence for a purpose if doing so would not materially advance the prosecution case.here,brown was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,g,which requires proof that the defendant has been convicted of a crime of imprisonment for a term in excess of one year the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm and the firearm traveled in interstate commerce.united states huet,cir.thus,the government may introduce rule b evidence only if it is offered for a purpose that is probative of one of the elements essential for a conviction.
we reject out of hand the government argument that the evidence was admissible to show that brown knows what firearms are.app.it is conceivable that a defendant might challenge a g charge by claiming he does not know what a firearm is in the ordinary course,however,a defendant general knowledge about firearms is not in question in a case,and the government is thus not required to show that the defendant knows what firearms are to secure a conviction.to be sure,brown did not claim he was unfamiliar with firearms.absent such a claim or suggestion by a defendant,a rule permitting the introduction of rule b evidence for the purpose of showing the defendant knows what firearms are would have the effect of rendering all prior bad acts related to firearms admissible in a trial.such a result could not have been the intent of the drafters of the federal rules of evidence.
we thus turn to whether the evidence was admissible to show brown had knowledge there was a firearm in his car.app.we have recently explained that a defendant knowledge is rarely at issue in a case when the prosecution relies exclusively on a theory of actual possession.caldwell,wl,at.this is because,absent unusual circumstances,the knowledge element in a case will necessarily be satisfied if the jury finds the defendant physically possessed the firearm.id.in contrast,however,e vidence of knowledge is critical in constructive possession cases,as a defendant will often deny any knowledge of a thing found in an area that is placed under his control,a residence,an automobile or claim that it was placed there by accident or mistake.united states williams,cir quoting united states jones,cir.this case presents the paradigmatic constructive possession scenario,united states garner,where a firearm is found in proximity to a defendant who claims he did not know it was there.accordingly,we have no difficulty concluding that showing brown knowledge that the gun was in the impala was an appropriate purpose for offering the evidence of brown previous straw purchases.
yet it is not enough for the government to merely identify a valid purpose under rule b.crucially,the government must also show that the evidence is relevant to that purpose.to do so,the prosecution must clearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences,no link of which can be the inference that because the defendant committed the proffered prior offense,he therefore is more likely to have committed the charged offense.sampson,at.this is where the government proffer falls short.the government has completely failed to explain how the fact that brown used a straw man in to purchase firearms tends to prove that he knowingly possessed the gun under the driver seat of the impala six years later.these are two entirely distinct acts,and participation in one has no relationship to the other.see davis,at holding that defendant prior conviction for cocaine possession not admissible to show knowledge in a trial for cocaine distribution because p ossession and distribution are different in ways that matter caldwell,wl,at if the prior possession was of a different gun,then its value as direct or circumstantial evidence of the charged possession drops and the likelihood that it is being used to show propensity to possess guns rises considerably.similarly,as the prior possession is further removed in time,it becomes less probative of possession on the date charged.citation omitted.
the government primary argument,which was accepted by the district court,is that the straw purchaser evidence refutes mccoy testimony that she purchased the gun for her own personal protection.according to the government,the fact that brown used a straw purchaser in the past makes it more likely that he used mccoy as a straw purchaser to obtain the gun recovered by the detectives.extrapolating from this proposition,the government argues then that it is likely that brown knew about the gun in whitaker impala.there are multiple problems with this line of reasoning.
first,the fact that brown used a straw purchaser to obtain firearms in does not discredit mccoy testimony that she purchased the gun for personal protection in august.the circumstances surrounding brown use of a straw purchaser were unique to him he was selling heroin to an unnamed individual who agreed to purchase firearms in exchange for drugs.there is no parallel between that scenario and mccoy purchase of the firearm in august,one day after four armed men assaulted her friend in an attempt to collect debts owed by her brother.the government did not present evidence disputing the sequence of events surrounding mccoy purchase of the firearm.an even more conspicuous omission was its failure to present evidence that mccoy had previously participated in a straw purchase with brown or anyone else for that matter.and significantly,this all occurred while brown was still serving a prison sentence for his conviction.it is simply too great a leap in logic to suggest that because brown once used a straw purchaser in a quid pro quo drug transaction,he must also have used mccoy as a straw purchaser for the gun recovered in whitaker impala.and it is an even greater leap to then conclude that such a strained inference somehow made it more likely than not that brown constructively possessed the firearm.
all of this aside,there is an even more fundamental problem with the government proffer under rule b.quite simply,the government chain of inferences is indubitably forged with an impermissible propensity link.the first logical step in the government analysis requires the jury to conclude that because brown used a straw purchaser in the past,he must therefore have used a straw purchaser here.this is propensity evidence,plain and simple.davis,at t he government must explain how the evidence fits into a chain of inferences a chain that connects the evidence to a proper purpose,no link of which is a forbidden propensity inference.
our concern that the evidence went only to show brown propensity to commit gun crimes is not alleviated by the district court explanation for why the evidence was admitted.as we have explained,t he district court,if it admits the evidence,must in the first instance,rather than the appellate court in retrospect,articulate reasons why the evidence also goes to show something other than character.sampson,at see also caldwell,wl,at o ur decisions are emphatic in requiring the proponent and the trial judge to articulate,with precision,a chain of inferences that does not contain a propensity link.emphasis added.after hearing from the parties,the court concluded that the prosecution could use this evidence to show motive or knowledge and that type of thing along those lines.app.emphasis added.this statement does not reflect the type of careful precision our precedent demands.caldwell,wl,at.it supplies the defendant with little notice of the purpose for which the evidence against him is being admitted,and it says nothing of how the evidence is probative of that purpose.of course,a mere recitation of the purposes in rule b is insufficient.davis,at see also christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,federal evidence,at i t is lamentably common to see recitations of laundry lists of permissive uses,with little analysis or attention to the particulars.
when confronted with a proffer under rule b,a district court should not merely inquire of the prosecution what it wishes the evidence to prove.rather,the court should also require the prosecution to explain exactly how the proffered evidence should work in the mind of a juror to establish the fact the government claims to be trying to prove.caldwell,wl,at quoting united states miller,cir emphasis added.in our case,that means the district court should have asked the government to answer this question how,exactly,does brown admission to atfe agents that he sold heroin in exchange for firearms in suggest that he had knowledge of the gun found under the driver seat of the impala on the morning of march,put to this task,the government would have been unable to articulate the requisite chain of inferences without resort to links or attempts to build a bridge too far 
for these reasons,we conclude that the evidence that brown used a straw purchaser to obtain firearms in the past was admitted in error.nevertheless,the government maintains that,even if erroneous,the admission of evidence regarding brown past use of a straw purchaser was harmless.the test for harmless error is whether it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment.united states cunningham,cir citation omitted.we will find such a high probability only when we have a sure conviction that the error did not unfairly prejudice the defendant.id.at.
the government contends the error was harmless because the evidence of brown past invol
