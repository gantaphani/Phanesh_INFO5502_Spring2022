this appeal arises from appellant william scott judgment of conviction entered on september,in the southern district of new york buchwald.scott was convicted after a jury trial of one count of distributing,and possessing with the intent to distribute,a controlled substance,in violation of b c.at his trial,the prosecution introduced,over defense objection,testimony from two police detectives that they were familiar with scott and had spoken to him on numerous occasions prior to his arrest in the instant case.scott argues that admission of this testimony under federal rules of evidence b and was an abuse of discretion and that the error in admitting it was not harmless.we agree.scott conceded that he was present at the scene and did not argue that police witnessed someone else engage in a drug transaction.instead,he argued that the detectives observed him engage in innocent conduct.the challenged recognition testimony served no purpose other than to invite jury speculation about scott propensity to attract police contact and monitoring.we therefore vacate scott conviction and remand for a new trial 
background 
scott was arrested on july,in the bronx after two detectives,mark moran and robert geary,observed him engage in what they believed to be a drug sale.testimony at trial indicated that the detectives stopped at an intersection in a high narcotics prone location after observing scott,whom they recognized from prior interactions,standing with a group of other individuals on the corner.moran testified that he witnessed scott take something from an unidentified woman.geary testified that this object appeared to be currency.moran then saw scott retrieve something out of a hole in the tree,which he fumbled with and then put back.both detectives testified that scott then returned to the woman,who appeared to take something from him geary testified that scott then exchanged currency with another individual.the detectives made all of these observations through the tinted windows of their vehicle,using the rear and side view mirrors.both detectives testified that scott looked as though he was going to run after he noticed them,but stopped and went towards them after moran called to him.scott was then arrested.at that point,moran searched the tree,where he found eighteen plastic bags containing crack cocaine hidden inside a cigar wrapper.no drugs were recovered from scott or from the woman,though detectives testified that when they approached her,she put her hand to her mouth as if to swallow something 
prior to trial,the government informed defense counsel that it planned to ask the following questions during the direct examination of each of the two police witnesses about how many times had you seen scott in the past had you spoken to him before and when you had spoken to him before,what was about the longest conversation you had ever had with him the government indicated that one detective would say his longest conversation with scott lasted five minutes,the other twenty.defense counsel first objected to this line of questioning at a pretrial telephone conference.the district court overruled the objection because the amount of time that the witnesses would state that they had spoken to scott before would not lead someone to conclude that he had ever been arrested,and as we all know,that is something that,unless he takes the stand,we are not getting into his prior record.defense counsel continued his objection before trial,arguing that the recognition testimony would encourage the jury to speculate about scott prior encounters with the police.he stated 
i do think anyone in the jury box is going to think it was a friendly encounter.i do think the jurors are going to believe that scott was just saying hello and asking about the officers family life.but,rather,it would be clear that the police engaging in these conversations were doing so in the course of investigative processes,and the jury is going to believe that this is an individual who is known to the police again,it not a matter of the jury just being led to believe that the officers were setting up in a location and watching to see what,if any,activity would be happening in this known drug location,but,rather,that they intentionally stopped because they saw an individual who has been known to them in the past,who they have had encounters with in the past,and therefore they chose to stop and observe him,which would only lead a jury to believe that there is a history of criminal activity on behalf of scott,there is a propensity for him to commit crimes or a propensity for them to do something that would warrant police observation.
defense counsel then suggested that the police testify that they stopped because they knew the area to be drug prone and that they ha d seen scott in the past,with in an unspecified period of time,without detailing the number and length of conversations they had had with him.the government argued that such testimony would be untruthful,because the police did in fact stop because they recognized scott.
the court responded to these arguments by expressing its view that there is just a limit to how much a defendant with a criminal record can insist that he ought to be portrayed as someone who i am trying to think of a good expression i think the expression is.defense counsel continued to object,and the court said again,it is to me inappropriate to pretend that scott has never had any contact with the police before.defense counsel and the court then had the following exchange 
farber i guess the question is how is that properly before this jury that he has had prior police contact if i raise the issue of identification,or lack of familiarity with his face,clearly,i am opening up the door.but if it a matter of simply the officer 
the court farber,we have been through this.the government has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.they are entitled to have their witnesses identification supported by the fact that they have seen him before.
the district court indicated that it understood the detectives would testify that they stopped because it is a known drug location,but that they would also be permitted to testify to the fact that they had recognized scott.
the recognition testimony featured prominently throughout scott trial.during the opening statement,the government told the jury that it was going to hear how two officers were on a routine patrol that day in the bronx.they saw the defendant,a man they knew and had spoken to before engage in a drug transaction.as expected,during direct examination,both detectives were questioned as to their prior knowledge of scott.the relevant testimony of detective moran proceeded as follows 
q you said scott.i want to take a step back.had you seen scott before 
a yes,i have.
q about how many times had you seen scott before you saw him on july 
a about ten times.
q have you ever had a chance to talk with scott 
a yes,i have.
q about how many times have you had a chance to talk with scott 
a about four or five times.
q what is the longest amount of time that you have spoken to scott 
a about minutes.
q during that minute conversation,how far away were you from scott 
a about feet.
moran redirect testimony also included a confirmation of his recognition of scott.the relevant testimony of detective geary proceeded similarly 
q what did you observe once you pulled over 
a observed a group of males.one of the males that i had recently,that i had known before,a male named william scott 
q now,was july,the first time you had ever seen scott 
a no.i had seen him approximately five to ten times before in the past.
q before that day,before july,had you had occasion to speak with him in the past 
a yes,approximately two or three times.
q what is the longest amount of time you had ever spoken to him before that day 
a approximately five minutes.
q how far away from him were you when you had that five minute conversation 
a approximately one to two feet away from him.
this was not the last time the jury was exposed to the recognition testimony.it also featured prominently in the prosecution closing arguments,making up one of out six transcribed pages.the prosecutor told the jury,in part 
now,why is the detectives experience with scott significant well,common sense tells you why it is significant.if you have ever seen a friend,a coworker,or a neighbor down the street,you watch what they are doing,you know right away that it them.it a lot easier to follow the action,to follow what they are doing,if it someone you recognize,someone you know.and that important here because the detectives saw not just a drug dealer,but someone they recognized,someone they recognized engage in a drug transaction.
for its part,the defense told the jury in the opening statement that during the trial they would come to see how an innocent encounter between scott and another individual rose to become this case that you asked to sit on the jury today.in his closing,defense counsel argued that if scott had actually been selling drugs,he would have run when he was called by the detectives,because by the state own admission,he knew they were police officers.
in addition to the two police witnesses,a lab technician,who tested the material taken from the tree,and a paralegal from the united states attorney office,who transcribed the text messages,testified.the jury found scott guilty and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
scott makes two major contentions on appeal first,that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence under rule b,and second,that it abused its discretion by failing to engage in the required rule analysis.in response,the government argues primarily that the evidence was not rule b evidence in the first instance,and in the alternative,even if it was rule b evidence,that it was properly admitted.
i.the nature of the testimony 
at the time of scott trial,rule b of the federal rules of evidence provided that 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident 
the government primary contention is that the detectives testimony is not other act evidence within the meaning of rule b.while we agree that not all other acts are subject to rule b,the cases the government cites in support of the argument that the recognition testimony is not so subject are simply inapposite,standing as they do only for the unadvanced proposition that where other acts are direct evidence of or are otherwise inextricably intertwined with the charged act,then they may be admissible without being subject to rule b.see united states quinones,cir united states baez,cir.
the only colorable argument the government presents on this point arises from our holding in united states lumpkin,cir.in lumpkin,we held that a police officer testimony that he often saw the defendant in the area where the relevant drug transactions occurred was not other acts evidence subject to rule b.id.at.we determined that the nature of the repeated observations did not qualify as evidence of a crime or bad act,because nothing in the officer observations indicate d that the defendant wa s of bad character.id.the government argues that the recognition testimony at issue here is analogous to that in lumpkin,because the detectives did not testify that scott was engaging in criminal or wrongful conduct.id.the problem with such an argument is that rule b is not limited to evidence of crimes or wrongs.by its very terms,rule b addresses other crimes,wrongs,or acts.emphasis added.nothing about these words implies that the other acts to which rule b refers must be bad.indeed,to read the rule as such violate s the cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that courts must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.triestman united states,cir quoting united states menasche.while crimes,wrongs,or bad acts may be more likely than other kinds of acts to demonstrate criminal propensity and thus be inadmissible for that reason under rule b,the rule itself is in no sense limited to such acts.each of our sister circuits to consider the issue has concluded that rule b extends to acts or wrongs and we now join them.
the district court determination that the testimony was admissible because the testimony would not lead jurors to conclude scott had previously been arrested was thus in error.even if the jury would not reach that conclusion based on the recognition testimony,unlike the testimony in lumpkin,geary and moran prior contacts with scott would certainly bear adversely on the jury judgment of his character.united states cooper,cir.the difference between a police officer mere observations of a defendant in an area and testimony that two different detectives had had occasion to speak to him up to five times and for up to twenty minutes and on at least some different occasions is substantial.that a police officer has merely seen a person,even repeatedly and even in a location,may simply suggest that the person lives or works near the officer daily patrol in that sense,it is not evidence of any act at all.but that two detectives have not only seen but spoken on multiple,lengthy occasions to a defendant indicates to a jury that he is,at a minimum,the sort of person who warrants a level of police observation to which citizens are unaccustomed.as defense counsel stated during his initial objection,a jury hearing this testimony would not believe that scott was just saying hello and asking about the officer family life.that is especially true since no such innocent explanation for scott significant contacts with the police could be offered.a jury hearing this testimony would conclude that scott was a person with a propensity to engage in wrongful,criminal or otherwise unusual behavior that would attract the attention of the police,and not,as in lumpkin,merely a person who had been seen by a police officer at some point in his life.this testimony falls well within rule b,which prohibits the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that might adversely reflect on the actor character.huddleston united states,d.the testimony here invites speculation about the defendant propensity to come into frequent contact with police.because this testimony might adversely reflect on the actor character,the evidence must be evaluated under b.to the extent the district court decision rested on its determination that the testimony must relate to criminal conduct leading to arrest to fall under the rule,it was in error.
ii.the admissibility of the evidence under rule b 
having determined that the recognition testimony is properly analyzed under rule b,we next analyze whether it was properly admitted.this circuit has adopted an inclusionary approach to other act evidence under rule b,which allows such evidence to be admitted for any purpose other than to demonstrate criminal propensity.united states laflam,cir per curiam.we have,however,emphasized that this inclusionary rule is not a carte blanche to admit prejudicial extrinsic act evidence when,as here,it is offered to prove propensity.see,united states mccallum,cir holding that evidence of prior convictions was propensity evidence in sheep clothing.we review the district court determination of admissibility under rule b only for abuse of discretion.united states brand,cir.
in conducting this review,we follow the inquiry laid out by the supreme court in huddleston,at.see also united states gilan,cir discussing adoption of huddleston test.under huddleston,t o determine whether a district court properly admitted other act evidence,the reviewing court considers whether it was offered for a proper purpose it was relevant to a material issue in dispute its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect and the trial court gave an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury if so requested by the defendant.laflam,at.no limiting instruction was requested here,and so we limit our analysis to the first three factors.
whether the evidence was offered for a proper purpose 
the first huddleston inquiry is whether the evidence was offered for a proper purpose.the government argues there are two proper purposes justifying the admission of the evidence first,that it was relevant to prove identity,and second,that it supported the reliability and the credibility of the detectives testimony,in part by corroborating it.identity is conceded by both parties as a proper purpose under rule b,but whether the testimony could properly be offered to support reliability and credibility is disputed.
the government contends that t he fact that the detectives previously knew scott spoke loudly to the reliability and credibility of their observations,as the jury could infer that the detectives,knowing who they were watching,were able to focus more closely on what they were watching.this theory was also advanced during the government summation 
if you have ever seen a friend,a coworker,or a neighbor down the street,you watch what they are doing,you know right away that it them.it a lot easier to follow the action,to follow what they are doing,if it someone you recognize,someone you know.
we find this argument to be entirely unpersuasive.first,scott identity was not in dispute,see infra,and second,there is no evidence in this record even remotely suggesting that an officer watching what he believes to be a drug sale would generally have any reason to focus extensively on the identity of the perpetrator rather than the action itself.an officer on patrol who believes he is witnessing a crime and that an arrest is imminent has no immediate need to identify the suspect.detective moran admitted as much at trial when he testified that he and detective geary did not test the drugs recovered from the tree for fingerprints or for dna b ecause on an observation sale of narcotics,when you see the crime occur in your presence,there no reason to get fingerprints,because i already know who committed the crime.emphasis added.we reject the notion that freeing the detectives brains from a task we have no reason to believe they were engaged in made their observations somehow more credible or reliable.
in addition to the lack of rationale arising out of police procedure,neither does the government proffer any credible explanation sounding in common sense or science about why a person is better able to follow the action or to physically see an event because he is familiar with a person involved.there is only one reason a person is better able tell what someone he knows is doing,which is that he knows what someone he is familiar with is likely to be doing.the government summation underscored this when the prosecutor stated,the recognition is important here because the detectives saw not just a drug dealer,but someone they recognized,someone they recognized engage in a drug transaction.emphasis added.it may be true that the detectives knowledge of scott made them more reliable because it helped them to identify as a drug transaction what might have otherwise been ambiguous,but that fact goes to criminal propensity alone,precisely what rule b prohibits.even our inclusionary approach,laflam,at cir,to rule b evidence can not support the admission of such propensity evidence.
nor can we say the recognition testimony bolstered the credibility of the detectives by explaining their actions,something our cases support as a proper purpose for other act evidence.in united states bermudez,we held admissible an officer testimony that he overheard the defendant make comments because it explained why the officers attention was focused on the defendant as opposed to any number of other individuals in the high crime area,cir.we determined that without this explanation for singling out the defendant,the officers entire testimony would be suspect.id.there is no such rationale here.the detectives testified that they were on patrol in a location when they witnessed a drug sale.detective moran further testified that the area was pretty desolate except for the group surrounding scott at the time of the stop.the jury needed to hear no further explanation for why the detectives were drawn to the scene.
in the same vein,the government also argues that the recognition testimony corroborated the detectives other testimony.we have consistently held other act evidence admissible to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.united states everett,cir.but this allowance for corroboration is not unlimited t o avoid potential prosecutorial abuse,we have required the proponent of the evidence to demonstrate a close relationship between the proffered evidence and the evidence to be corroborated.id.the corroboration must be also be direct and the matter corroborated significant.id.internal quotation mark omitted.here,the government has presented no explanation for what exactly was corroborated by the fact that the detectives had seen scott before,much less demonstrated the required close relationship.we find no disputed fact that the recognition testimony could possibly have corroborated.it can not corroborate the detectives accounts of the crime itself,because it is not relevant to them.it can not even serve,more generally,to corroborate either detective testimony by suggesting overall truthfulness since the two accounts of police interactions do not match up nor is there a reason for them to.even if we were to accept the government argument that under our case law,it is acceptable to introduce other act evidence to corroborate overall testimony which is not at all what everett teaches,there is no such corroboration here,except to the impermissible extent it suggests that,since scott had been up to no good before,the detectives were right to think that he was up to no good again.the government must do more than disclaim an intention of proving that the defendant is a bad man.for what prosecutor in his right mind will ever offer that improper justification instead,the prosecutor must show that the evidence is relevant,and there is no presumption that it is.united states,cir.the government here has failed to show to how the recognition testimony was relevant to corroborating the detectives other testimony.we therefore reject this suggested purpose.
whether the testimony was relevant to an issue in dispute 
the only purpose proposed by the government that we can credit at all is that the recognition testimony was relevant to identity.but relevance is not the end of the inquiry evidence admitted under b must be relevant to an issue in dispute.laflam,at.while the government itself admits that identity was not disputed per se,it contends that scott failure to concede identity meant that it was sufficiently in dispute for the recognition testimony to be relevant and admissible.the record belies such an argument,however.identity was not only not in dispute during the trial it was also clear to the government and to the court that it would not be beforehand.we have held that a formal stipulation removing an issue from a case,while preferable,is not necessary 
whether an issue remains sufficiently in dispute for similar acts evidence to be material and hence admissible,unless the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially outweighs its probative value,depends not on the form of words used by counsel but on the consequences that the trial court may properly attach to those words.when the government offers prior act evidence to prove an issue,counsel must express a decision not to dispute that issue with sufficient clarity that the trial court will be justified a in sustaining objection to any subsequent or jury argument that seeks to raise the issue and b in charging the jury that if they find all the other elements established beyond a reasonable doubt,they can resolve the issue against the defendant because it is not disputed.while those consequences can be attached to a formal stipulation that the issue has been conceded,a formal stipulation is not required or necessarily appropriate.
united states figueroa,cir emphasis added citation omitted.here,scott counsel did not explicitly concede identity,but he was not required to in order to remove identity from the case.the record indicates that d
