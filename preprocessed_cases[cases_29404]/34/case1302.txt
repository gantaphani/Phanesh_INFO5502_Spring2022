opinion of the court 
james henry johnson pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony,in violation of g.the united states probation office assigned johnson a base offense level of under the united states sentencing guidelines based on his conviction under the pennsylvania simple assault statute psas.johnson challenged that calculation,arguing that his simple assault conviction did not constitute a crime of violence under the guidelines.the district court rejected that argument and sentenced johnson to months imprisonment.johnson appeals,arguing that the district court determination that his simple assault conviction is a crime of violence can not be reconciled with the supreme court decision in begay united states,d.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate johnson sentence and remand for resentencing.
the facts giving rise to this case are relatively straightforward.on november,johnson was sitting in a car parked in a grocery store parking lot in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.pittsburgh police officers received a tip regarding johnson whereabouts and arrested him pursuant to an outstanding warrant issued in connection with unrelated charges.inside the car,the officers found a loaded firearm with an obliterated serial number.thereafter,johnson was charged in the western district of pennsylvania with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a felony,in violation of g.johnson subsequently pled guilty to that charge.
before sentencing,the probation office prepared a presentence report psr.pursuant to a a,the probation office calculated johnson base offense level as based on his simple assault conviction in the allegheny county court of common pleas,which the probation office designated as a crime of violence pursuant to a.after giving johnson a increase because the firearm he unlawfully possessed had an obliterated serial number,and a decrease to reflect his acceptance of responsibility and his timely notification of his intention to plead guilty,the probation office calculated johnson total offense level as.the psr also detailed johnson criminal history.it noted that johnson had the following five prior convictions a conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer,possession or distribution of marijuana,and a failure to yield to traffic signs a simple assault conviction a conviction for possession of a firearm without a license,unauthorized use of an automobile and other vehicles,and driving without a license a conviction for possession of a firearm without a license and unauthorized use of an automobile and a conviction for simple assault the probation office assigned johnson a total of criminal history points to reflect these prior convictions.three more points were added because johnson conviction arose while he was on parole for a previous offense and within two years of his release from parole for another previous offense.accordingly,johnson was assigned a total of criminal history points,resulting in a criminal history category of vi.johnson total offense level of and criminal history category of vi resulted in an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment 
at sentencing,johnson objected to several aspects of the psr.in pertinent part,johnson objected to the application of a a in the calculation of his base offense level.he asserted that his simple assault conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence under a in light of begay.he pointed out that count one of the criminal information in the simple assault case charged him with intentional,knowing and reckless conduct,and that,aside from the information,the government had introduced no other evidence on the basis of which to determine his particular mens rea when he committed that crime.johnson contended that reckless conduct could never constitute a crime of violence in light of begay because such conduct,by definition,is not purposeful.the government urged the district court not to make a blanket ruling to that effect,and asked the court to infer from the criminal information alone that johnson simple assault conviction evinced the sort of conduct that could be considered a violent crime under begay.the government noted that while a sentencing court could consider the plea agreement and the plea colloquy,among other things,to determine a defendant actual mens rea,in johnson case the former was not particularly helpful and the latter was not available.app.after hearing the parties respective positions,the district court ruled as follows 
i do not read or see begay as broadly as the defense does.i do not believe that begay instructs that this type of underlying offense can never be a crime of violence.a crime is violent if it presents a serious risk of injury to another person.in this case,johnson plea to simple assault demonstrates from the charging document and the statute itself that it presented a serious risk of injury to another person.and i do believe that it is similar in kind as well as in the degree of risk posed by the commission of other crimes.and it similar in kind because it involves purposeful,violent and aggressive behavior.so,that is my ruling in this case.it would keep the offense level at a.
the district court accepted the psr calculations and was unpersuaded by johnson other objections.the court sentenced johnson to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.
this timely appeal followed.johnson argues that his simple assault conviction is not a crime of violence under a his sentence is procedurally unreasonable and his sentence is substantively unreasonable.

the guidelines provide that a defendant base offense level is if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of a crime of violence.a a.the guidelines define a crime of violence as 
any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

in united states dorsey,cir,we held that a conviction under the psas is a crime of violence under of the guidelines.id.at.as both parties recognize,the analytical framework we employed in dorsey has been altered by the supreme court decision in begay,to qualify as a crime of violence the crime in question must present a serious potential risk of physical injury and be roughly similar,in kind as well as degree of risk posed,to the examples burglary,arson,extortion,or use of explosives themselves.united states polk,cir emphasis and alteration in original quoting begay.at.a crime is similar in kind to one of the enumerated examples if it typically involve s purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.begay.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted if the crime of conviction is materially different in terms of these characteristics,it does not come within the residua l clause.hopkins,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we generally use a categorical approach to classify a prior conviction.see taylor united states,d.under that approach,a court must ask whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision,without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.james united states,d emphasis omitted.where a statute criminalizes different kinds of conduct,some of which would constitute crimes of violence while others would not,a court may look beyond the statutory elements to determine the particular part of the statute of which the defendant was actually convicted.see evanson attorney of the united states,cir singh ashcroft,cir see also united states smith,cir such an examination is only to determine which part of the statute the defendant violated.emphasis in original and other citation omitted quoting united states howell,cir.in conducting such an inquiry,a court is generally limited to examining the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.shepard united states,d.this rule is not meant to circumvent the categorical approach by allowing courts to determine whether the actual conduct of the individual defendant constituted a purposeful,violent and aggressive act.smith,at citations omitted.
to determine categorically whether a conviction under the psas qualifies as a crime of violence,we begin with the statutory text.see united states siegel,cir.however,under the categorical approach we must first determine how broadly to read that statute.see chambers united states,d th e categorical approach requires courts to choose the right category.and sometimes the choice is not obvious.it is undisputed that johnson pled guilty only to subsection a of the psas.as a consequence,we focus our analysis on that subsection alone.
subsection a of the psas imposes criminal liability on an individual if he attempts to cause or intentionally,knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another.a the statute plainly criminalizes distinct types of conduct,all of which could constitute simple assault.under these circumstances,we may resort to the materials outlined in shepard to determine,not the factual circumstances of johnson conduct,but the specific part of a to which johnson in fact pled guilty.see,siegel,at clearly,the statute invites inquiry into the underlying facts of the case because we are unable to determine from the face of the statute which crime or crimes siegel pleaded guilty to commonly,the best way to resolve the question raised by a conviction under a statute phrased in the disjunctive,or structured in outline form,will be to look to the charging instrument or to the plea colloquy.citation omitted.
here,the criminal information filed against johnson charged,in relevant part,as follows 
the actor attempted to cause or intentionally,knowingly or recklessly caused bodily injury to pamela hall,that is to say the actor struck choked otherwise assaulted the victim,in violation of.a.
as the parties both acknowledge,the subsection of the psas to which johnson pled guilty criminalizes intentional,knowing and reckless conduct.on appeal,johnson renews his position that,because the criminal information does not specify his mens rea when he committed simple assault,and because the government presented no other evidence,such as his plea colloquy,to establish his mens rea,the district court erred in concluding that his simple assault conviction constituted a crime of violence.he restates his view that a crime committed recklessly can not be considered a crime of violence.in its brief,the government initially argued that johnson particular mens rea when he violated the psas is not relevant because all three states of mind enumerated in the statute satisfy begay.the government urged us to find that the crime of which johnson was convicted is typically committed intentionally.appellee br.however,in a letter submitted pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure j,the government tells us it has changed course 
s ince the filing of the government brief,the department of justice has clarified its position that reckless conduct,standing alone,is not the type of purposeful conduct that can constitute a crime of violence under a residual clause.thus,to the extent that the government has argued that reckless conduct is sufficient to satisfy this standard,the government no longer rests on this position.
appellee rule j letter.
in light of the government new position that reckless conduct does not qualify as a crime of violence,we have no occasion to consider whether johnson simple assault conviction is a crime of violence to the extent he acted recklessly accordingly,our categorical assessment of the psas focuses only on whether an intentional or knowing violation of subsection a of that statute may qualify as a crime of violence in the ordinary case.james,at.we have no trouble concluding that such a violation would qualify.
at the first step of our inquiry under begay,we ask whether intentional or knowing simple assault presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.we easily answer that question in the affirmative.in the ordinary case,a violation of the psas poses a degree of risk of physical injury because the defendant must cause or attempt to cause bodily injury to the victim.in other words,the statute itself contemplates bodily harm to the victim as a prerequisite to conviction.see commonwealth smith,bodily injury is an element of simple assault.in short,we can not imagine a scenario in which simple assault under pennsylvania law could not present a risk of physical injury.james,at.the armed career criminal act does not require metaphysical certainty one can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury but that does not mean that such an offense is categorically nonviolent.
we likewise find that the other requirements articulated in the defendant crime must present a degree of risk similar to that presented by the enumerated crimes and also be similar in kind to those readily satisfied in this case.as noted above,the psas predicates criminal liability on a finding that the defendant caused or attempted to cause bodily injury to the victim.pennsylvania law defines bodily harm as i mpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.a conviction under that statute therefore poses a risk of injury that is more or less comparable to the enumerated crimes.see james,at.holding that attempted burglary is a violent felony under the armed career criminal act because,like the enumerated crimes,it create s significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury emphasis added.indeed,a conviction under the psas in most instances poses a greater risk of bodily injury than that presented by extortion,for instance,one of the enumerated crimes.
simple assault under pennsylvania law is also similar in kind to the enumerated crimes that crime,to the extent it is committed intentionally or knowingly,is by definition purposeful.united states harrison,cir finding that florida willful fleeing statute requires conduct that is purposeful and intentional,cited with approval in hopkins,at see also begay.at equating crimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct see also,united states wilson,cir concluding that missouri child abuse statute satisfies begay purposeful conduct requirement based on the offense mens rea of knowingly inflicting cruel and inhuman punishment emphasis in original citation omitted united states almenas,cir concluding that t he purposefulness requirement is easily met by massachusetts resisting arrest statute because b oth methods of resisting arrest require the offender to act knowingly united states rooks,cir begay instruction that the proscribed conduct be purposeful is easily satisfied here,as the st
