this appeal from a conviction for securities fraud primarily concerns the timeliness of an indictment and the calculation of the amount of loss for purposes of determining the sentence.david rutkoske appeals from a judgment of conviction for securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud entered on august,by the district court for the southern district of new york richard conway casey,district judge following a jury trial.rutkoske contends that the indictment and the superceding indictment were untimely,the evidence was insufficient,evidence of subsequent acts was improperly admitted,and the sentence is unreasonable.we reject the challenges to the conviction but remand for resentencing.
background 
the defendant.at all relevant times,rutkoske owned a brokerage firm,lloyd wade securities lloyd wade.lloyd wade,headquartered in dallas,encompassed eight to ten offices across the country by.rutkoske worked out of the dallas office.lloyd wade sold stock to retail customers and provided investment banking services to institutional clients.the indictment stems from the firm involvement with netbet,a internet gaming company.
the indictments.on december,the government filed an initial indictment charging rutkoske with participation in a securities fraud conspiracy in connection with lloyd wade purchase and sale of netbet stock.rutkoske was not charged in this initial indictment.
on april,the grand jury returned a superceding indictment indictment adding rutkoske as a defendant.the indictment charged rutkoske with securities fraud,in violation of b,and,and conspiracy to commit securities fraud,commercial bribery,and wire fraud,in violation of.it charged that the conspiracy continued from december to at least on or about april,rendering the indictment facially timely by just three days.indictment charged numerous overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy of these,only one was alleged to have occurred within the applicable limitations period,o n or about april.
after the filing of indictment,rutkoske repeatedly sought from the government details of the alleged april,overt act in order to pin down the on or about phrasing to a precise date.at a hearing in july,rutkoske notified the district court that he intended to move to dismiss indictment as untimely,and the government stated that it was planning to file a superceding indictment.
a second superceding indictment indictment,charging rutkoske alone,was returned on july.indictment charged rutkoske with the same offenses as indictment.it did not include the april overt act,but instead alleged two other overt acts occurring on april and,acts that would have been within indictment limitations period.
in september,rutkoske moved to dismiss indictment as untimely.at a hearing on the motion,defense counsel told the court that the government had realized in september that the april overt act alleged in indictment had not occurred on that date,and contended that this concession rendered indictment untimely and unavailable for indictment to relate back to it.
the district judge denied the motion.see united states rutkoske,d.judge casey concluded that indictment,though containing a latent defect,was validly pending at the time indictment was filed.see id.at.he also concluded that indictment did not materially broaden the charges against rutkoske.see id.therefore,he ruled,indictment related back to indictment for purposes of satisfying the statute of limitations.see id.
evidentiary ruling.before trial,the government moved to admit testimony about,and recordings of,conversations between rutkoske and a as evidence of other acts,admissible under rule b of the federal rules of evidence.see united states rutkoske,cr,wl,at.judge casey ruled that the proposed evidence,which suggested that rutkoske had engaged in a similar market manipulation scheme after the events alleged in indictment,was relevant and was being offered for the proper purpose of rebutting an innocent participation defense.see id.at.however,because it was unclear whether rutkoske would present such a defense,judge casey concluded that he could not conduct the rule balancing analysis in advance of trial and therefore denied the motion without prejudice to renewal.see id.at.the evidence was admitted at trial.
trial.at the jury trial the government presented the testimony of rutkoske alleged,some of lloyd wade customers,and securities experts,and introduced documentary evidence showing rutkoske knowledge of undisclosed commissions earned by his brokers.in brief,the evidence permitted the jury to find the following.in,rutkoske permitted manuel bello,who had a history of stock manipulation,to head a new branch office in west paterson,new jersey.bello introduced rutkoske to the executive team at netbet.lloyd wade head of research and investment banking discouraged rutkoske from doing business with netbet,but rutkoske entered an investment banking agreement with netbet.the agreement contained a provision prohibiting significant shareholders from selling their shares and obliged netbet to use its best efforts to ensure that all sales occurred through lloyd wade.bello,with rutkoske knowledge,bought discounted blocks of netbet stock from entities controlled by netbet insiders.
lloyd wade began selling netbet stock to its customers.when it wanted to sell netbet stock at prices above the market price,lloyd wade would take out offers by buying stock from other firms making a market in the stock,thereby increasing the price.it was not difficult to increase the price of netbet stock because it was thinly traded and lloyd wade controlled the vast majority of shares.rutkoske sometimes instructed bello to increase the price.
brokers in the west paterson office used boiler room tactics to sell netbet stock.cold callers posing as brokers called prospective customers and pretended that they had previously spoken.brokers used sales pitches to induce customers to buy netbet stock.they sometimes lied about having visited netbet facilities and having met its management.one broker purchased netbet stock for a client over the client objection.brokers avoided customers phone calls when the customers wanted to sell netbet stock,and one broker refused to comply with a client instruction to sell the stock.rutkoske visited the west paterson office four or five times,and the brokers did not attempt to hide their tactics from him during all but the first of those visits.
brokers selling netbet stock received large commissions,which rutkoske personally authorized.the commissions were not disclosed to clients in fact,brokers often told their clients that they received no commission,and trade confirmations stated that there was no commission.following an audit by the national association of securities dealers nasd,lloyd wade recharacterized the commissions as trading profits and created a new trading account to track the hidden commissions.rutkoske knew that the firm was hiding commissions.
from january to april,lloyd wade accounted for percent of retail sales of netbet stock from july to december,it accounted for percent of the trading volume.eventually,the price of netbet shares plummeted.investors lost more than million.
the district judge allowed other acts evidence of conversations between rutkoske and bello about the stock of a company owned by rutkoske,paradise tan.the conversations,which occurred four years after the charged conspiracy,revealed that rutkoske desired to push up the stock price.for example,he stated,i need a friendly market maker to help me set the market so i can cross some stock.bello and rutkoske discussed how to take out offers to increase the price and how to compensate brokers for their role in these efforts.rutkoske told bello to comply with the registration and solicitation regulations so you do draw attention,stating crudely,g et me all my registrations and all that other shit,now i can go fuck around with the stock.the district court gave the jury a limiting instruction at the time of the testimony and in the jury instructions.
the jury convicted rutkoske on both counts.
sentencing.the presentence report psr calculated a total offense level of,which comprised a base offense level of,see a a enhancement for loss of more than million,see id.b p and other enhancements for a scheme to defraud more than one victim,use of mass marketing,a leadership role in an activity involving at least five participants,and abuse of a position of trust a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i yielded a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
rutkoske objected to the psr loss calculation,which had been based on the trial testimony of an nasd expert,which we discuss further below.the district court rejected rutkoske objections,accepted the testimony of the witness,and estimated the loss to be.judge casey imposed a sentence of months imprisonment and required restitution in the amount of.
discussion 
timeliness of the indictments 
rutkoske contends that both indictments were untimely.the statute of limitations governing securities fraud and conspiracy is five years.see a indictment must be found within five years after offense committed.when conspiracy requires proof of an overt act,as in this case,the statute of limitations is satisfied if the government proves that the conspiracy operated within the period preceding the date of the indictment and that a conspirator knowingly committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy within that same period.see united states salmonese,cir.it is that the government may satisfy this test by proof of an overt act not explicitly listed in the indictment,as long as a defendant has had fair and adequate notice of the charge for which he is being tried,and he is not unduly prejudiced by the asserted variance in the proof.id.at quoting united states frank,cir.
this court seminal opinion in united states grady,cir,governs the timeliness of a superceding indictment filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations.in grady,the original indictment properly alleged overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy taking place within the statute of limitations.see id.at.a superceding indictment was filed after the limitations period had run.see id.the court noted that the bringing of the original indictment tolled the statute of limitations as to the charges contained in that indictment.id.it then held 
since the statute stops running with the bringing of the first indictment,a superseding indictment brought at any time while the first indictment is still validly pending,if and only if it does not broaden the charges made in the first indictment,can not be barred by the statute of limitations.
id.at footnote omitted.subsequent cases applying grady have stated that a superceding indictment relates back to a pending timely indictment so long as the superceding indictment does not materially broaden or substantially amend the original charges.salmonese,at emphasis added accord united states ben zvi,cir.
thus,grady and its progeny impose a test for relation back of a superceding indictment the original indictment must be validly pending,and the superceding indictment must not materially broaden or substantially amend the charges.rutkoske contends that the indictments fail both prongs of this test.
whether indictment was validly pending.rutkoske first contends that indictment was not validly pending because it was untimely.the premise of this argument,not previously considered in this circuit,is that an indictment that is facially valid only because of one alleged overt act within the limitations period should not be considered to have been validly pending under grady when the government concedes that the overt act did not occur within the limitations period.
there can be no doubt that indictment was facially timely when returned.it alleged a conspiracy that extended into the limitations period and an overt act occurring within that period,unlike the initial indictment in ben zvi,at,which alleged no overt acts within the limitations period.furthermore,had the government proceeded to trial on indictment and failed to prove that the alleged april overt act occurred within the limitations period,it could nonetheless have satisfied the statute of limitations by proving another overt act within the limitations period,even though the other act was not alleged in the indictment.see salmonese,at frank,at.since failure to prove the april overt act at trial would not have rendered indictment dismissable as long as a timely act,although uncharged,was proved,it is arguable that the government concession in advance of trial should not matter,regardless of when the concession was made.see united states smith,cir a n original indictment remains pending until it is dismissed or until double jeopardy or due process would prohibit prosecution under it.whether or not that would be so,we see no basis to deem indictment untimely on the facts of this case where the concession did not occur until after the return of indictment.on the day indictment was returned,indictment was facially timely and validly pending.nothing in the record suggests that the government deliberately withheld its concession concerning the april overt act until after return of indictment.
whether indictment impermissibly broadened the charges.rutkoske next argues that even if indictment was validly pending,indictment impermissibly broadened the scope of the conspiracy.a superceding indictment containing additional overt acts relates back to a previous indictment when the additional overt acts simply flesh out or provide more detail about the originally charged crime without materially broadening or amending it.salmonese,at.indictment alleged two new overt acts extending the scope of the conspiracy by one week.this extension can not be characterized as a material broadening of the charges against rutkoske.united states ratcliff,cir holding that a superceding indictment could not relate back when it expanded the conspiracy by twelve years and ten conspirators.rutkoske contends that the extension of the conspiracy was critically important because its purpose was to save the indictment from dismissal.this contention simply restates rutkoske first argument that indictment was not validly pending when indictment was returned.
since indictment did not materially broaden the scope of the conspiracy charge,it related back to indictment and was therefore timely.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
at trial,the government based the conspiracy and securities fraud charges on theories of both failure to disclose brokers profits and material misrepresentations.rutkoske argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that lloyd wade brokers had a duty to disclose their profits to their customers.we need not consider this argument because,whether or not the omission theory was proved,the evidence was sufficient to support the misrepresentation theory,and the supreme court has held that a verdict should be affirmed when two theories of an offense are submitted to the jury and the evidence supports one theory but not the other.see griffin united states,d see also united states vasquez,cir.in such cases,courts assume that the verdict is based on the valid theory.see,united states skelly,cir see also united states washington,cir w here an impermissible basis of conviction arises from an insufficiency of evidence and a valid basis remains on an alternative theory,a defendant must request the trial judge not to submit the invalid basis to the jury or else the objection will be deemed waived.
iii.the admission of the paradise tan evidence 
rutkoske final challenge to his conviction concerns the other acts evidence of his conversations with bello about paradise tan.rule b of the federal rules of evidence permits the introduction of evidence of other acts for the purpose of proving a defendant knowledge.evidence may be introduced under rule b if it is introduced for a proper purpose,it is relevant to the charged offense,its prejudicial effect does not substantially outweigh its probative value,and it is admitted with a limiting instruction if requested.see huddleston united states,d see also united states edwards,cir.rutkoske implicitly concedes that the paradise tan evidence was introduced for the permissible pu
