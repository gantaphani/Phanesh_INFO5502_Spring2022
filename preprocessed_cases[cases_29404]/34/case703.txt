the government appeals from a pair of orders excluding evidence in the prosecution of gary decicco decicco.the government indicted decicco for four counts of violating and two counts of violating h and.the district court excluded evidence related to prior bad acts by decicco.after careful review,we reverse.
factual background 
decicco purchased a brick warehouse located at rear heard street,in chelsea,massachusetts,on august,the heard street warehouse.before securing the mortgage on the heard street warehouse,decicco applied to the city of chelsea for an occupancy permit to use the building as a warehouse for his moving companies.the city denied the application,noting that the heard street warehouse was surrounded by residential properties and had a narrow driveway to provide access to and from the street.decicco used the building as a warehouse,notwithstanding the city of chelsea opposition.in the ensuing dispute,the city of chelsea prevented decicco from using the property as a warehouse.
after the permit was denied,decicco paid for the heard street warehouse.the purchase was financed with a loan from somerset bank,which was secured by a mortgage on the property.as proof of insurance on the property,decicco submitted an insurance binder from the john biggio insurance agency,signed by andrew biggio,and covering the property for the first month that decicco owned it 
decicco was in arrears on his mortgage to somerset bank by september.somerset bank obtained a foreclosure order on the heard street warehouse.decicco had other outstanding obligations to somerset bank a loan used to build a new warehouse in revere,massachusetts the revere warehouse and a commercial loan.liens were imposed on both the heard street warehouse and the revere warehouse,as well as on other properties owned by decicco businesses.
in october,two years after purchase,decicco obtained insurance on the heard street warehouse.two applications were completed by the broker a standard form application and an arson application.an insurance binder was issued by lincoln insurance company and an expert was retained to examine the property.the inspector never managed to speak with decicco,but he visited the property and determined that,contrary to decicco representations that the property was occupied,the heard street warehouse was in fact empty.on march,lincoln insurance company cancelled the policy on the heard street warehouse due to decicco alleged misrepresentations.a notice advised decicco that the policy would be cancelled effective at on march.
in the meantime,somerset bank informed decicco that he was behind on his payments and that foreclosure proceedings would follow unless the bank received the amount owed by march.
on march,a fire broke out at the heard street warehouse.investigators of the chelsea fire department determined that the fire was started intentionally the arsonist used a liquid accelerator on the support pillars,in order to bring down the building as quickly as possible.due to the fire department quick response,little damage was done to the warehouse.decicco did not file a claim related to this fire and a period of three years and two months transpired during which the heard street warehouse went uninsured.
in the meantime,decicco hired richard stewart stewart,an accountant.stewart was allegedly retained because decicco had significant tax liabilities and wanted to institute sound bookkeeping practices for his businesses.regardless,it is undisputed that decicco owed more than one million dollars to the internal revenue service irs and other monies to the massachusetts department of revenue dor decicco also owed over in real estate taxes to the city of chelsea and an undisclosed amount to the city of revere.
on may,scottsdale insurance company scottsdale issued an insurance policy for the heard street warehouse,listing decicco as the beneficiary.decicco told the scottsdale agent that the building was a new purchase,even though decicco had owned it for nearly six years.he also told the scottsdale agent that there was no mortgage on the property.the policy was for a term and provided coverage of up to.
on july,the heard street warehouse was intentionally set on fire by means of four separate fires started on the second floor.the fire department again responded quickly and the property was spared.decicco hired an insurance adjustor to assist him in filing an insurance claim,but that claim was never filed.
during the early morning hours of july,a third fire broke out in the heard street warehouse.investigators determined that the fire was set with an accelerant poured at the base of the support columns.the third time proved to be the last.this time,a much larger fire injured several firefighters as well as some surrounding residential property.per the city of chelsea order,the heard street warehouse was demolished because the damage was too extensive.
decicco obtained payments for the third fire from scottsdale,for a total aggregate amount of.
the government alleges that,in violation of,decicco transmitted false and fraudulent insurance claims for building loss insurance proceeds to scottsdale.four distinct acts of mail fraud are alleged in addition,decicco was charged with two counts of knowingly using fire to commit a felony,in violation of h and.
decicco filed a motion in limine seeking the exclusion of the following evidence at trial any testimony of richard stewart,the accountant and any evidence related to any fires at the heard street warehouse or any other property which july,the district court orally granted the motion on the first day of trial.the government appeals from this ruling.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court ruling to exclude evidence under.b for abuse of discretion.see united states williams,cir.a n abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.united states gilbert,cir citing united states roberts,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.analysis 
exclusion of evidence related to fire 
decicco sought to exclude evidence of the march fire from the government case in chief.decicco argued,inter alia,that the fire was evidence of other crimes which should be excluded under.b,and that there was insufficient evidence that he committed the prior bad act.
federal rule of evidence b provides that 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity or absence of mistake 
therefore,mere propensity evidence is never admissible solely to show a character inclined towards unlawful behavior.the same evidence may be admissible,however,even if it may be construed as propensity evidence,if it is used to show any of the other elements set out in the rule.see united states taylor,cir stating that rule a codified the general prohibition against bad acts evidence,but rule b allows for the admission of evidence of prior bad acts to prove elements other than propensity united states frankhauser,cir.we review the admissibility of this type of evidence under a test first,a court must determine whether the evidence in question has any special relevance exclusive of defendant character or propensity and second,notwithstanding its special relevance,whether the evidence meets the standard set forth in.see united states sebaggala,cir frankhauser,at.
the government argues that evidence of the march fire is probative of a common plan or scheme to burn the heard street warehouse for the insurance proceeds,or,in the alternative,that it is probative of identity.before delving into these arguments,we consider the threshold question whether the government has proffered enough evidence to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that decicco committed the march fire.
