following convictions on four child pornography charges,girard lafortune appeals from the denial of a motion to suppress challenging the probable cause determination of a magistrate judge who issued a search warrant for lafortune residence.in making that determination,the magistrate judge reviewed an application for a search warrant that included an affidavit from an investigating officer and copies of pornographic images.lafortune claims that the affidavit and the accompanying images did not permit the magistrate judge to determine whether the images depicted real children rather than virtual children.instead,lafortune argues,the magistrate judge required the assistance of informed lay opinion,evidencing some kind of basic technical familiarity with virtual imaging and giving specific reasons why the proffered depictions could readily be ruled out as artificial creations.without such assistance,lafortune argues,the magistrate judge could not make the necessary probable cause determination.the district court rejected this argument.
lafortune also appeals the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to e,arguing that the enhancement violates his sixth amendment rights because a jury did not determine the fact of his prior convictions.we affirm the convictions and the sentence.
the facts relevant to the motion to suppress are largely undisputed.in may,kari morales marsh,a federal bureau of investigation agent in the arizona office of the innocent images task force,was working undercover on the internet.marsh was posing as a male who had an interest in pedophilic behavior when she encountered a internet group called,limited to members only.after marsh was allowed to enter the group,she observed and recorded images that she believed were in violation of statutes prohibiting the making,possessing,and distributing of child pornography.see a e.
among the images marsh viewed were six images attached to a message posted on may,by a.two of the pictures were of a particular girl called holly.the subject line of the message posted by was entitled as promised and read a dded a few pics in the folder.holly n rim.they my two favorites,will post more later,please post fills if u have.
marsh then sent administrative subpoenas to and comcast in order to obtain the internet protocol ip address connected with.this ip address was assigned to comcast customer girard lafortune at allen road,billerica,massachusetts.marsh sent this information to the fbi office in lowell,massachusetts.thereafter,special agent todd richards took over the investigation.
by contacting the department of motor vehicles,richards determined that lafortune had a dodge caravan registered in his name at the allen road address.during the week of october,a police officer from the billerica police department observed a dodge caravan with the license plate number registered to lafortune parked in front of allen road.richards also checked the commonwealth of massachusetts sex offender registry board and the records maintained by the fbi.in the sex offender registry,he discovered that lafortune was registered as a sex offender living at allen road the fbi records revealed that the fbi had interviewed lafortune in at this address.during that interview,lafortune admitted to visiting child pornography groups and using the email address 
using the information detailed above,richards prepared an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant for allen road.richards included in the affidavit a description of three pictures that had uploaded to the group photo album holly n rim.although richards characterized each picture as depicting a prepubescent girl,he did not explicitly assert that the pictures portrayed real children richards attested that a search of lafortune home and computer would reveal evidence of materials depicting the sexual exploitation of actual minors in violation of,which prohibits knowingly shipping or receiving sexually explicit materials depicting actual minors.attached to the affidavit were copies of the three pictures described in the affidavit.
after reviewing richards affidavit along with the images richards had attached to it,the magistrate judge wrote on the affidavit on october,i personally reviewed the referenced photographs,and signed her name beneath this statement.she then issued the requested search warrant.on october,fbi agents and local police executed the search warrant,seizing a substantial amount of material,including a laptop,compact discs,digital versatile discs,and video tapes.
while the police were searching the residence on allen road,they interviewed lafortune,who admitted to viewing child nudity on the internet frequently,being interested in pictures of girls between the ages of ten and fourteen,storing pornographic images on compact discs,and using an email address beginning with.lafortune also said that he was the sole user of his laptop.he was then arrested.
on march,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts indicted lafortune on four counts transportation and attempted transportation of child pornography,in violation of a,b receipt of child pornography,in violation of a possession of child pornography in violation of a b and printing or publishing a notice or advertisement for child pornography in violation of d.
lafortune then filed in the district court a motion to suppress both the items obtained and the statements made during the search of the home on october.relying on the supreme court decision in ashcroft free speech coalition,d,which held on first amendment grounds that congress can not ban materials depicting sexually explicit conduct by virtual children rather than by real children,lafortune argued that a magistrate judge must expressly find that the images presented in conjunction with a search warrant application are actual children rather than images created exclusively on the computer.moreover,he contended that the magistrate judge had inadequate information for making a determination that the images were of real children.
the district court denied his motion to suppress.in response to the argument that the magistrate judge had to find explicitly that the images reflected real children,the district court stated that d efendant cites no authority requiring a magistrate to make express findings in issuing a search warrant,either in the child pornography context or in other contexts,where the search might trigger first amendment protections.under established case law,the probable cause determination is sufficient.with respect to the claim that the magistrate judge had inadequate information to determine that the images depicted real children,the district court was similarly unpersuaded essentially defendant seems to be pressing for a requirement of expert testimony that images depict actual children as a prerequisite to issuing a search warrant.the probable cause standard requires only a fair probability,based on the totality of the circumstances,that evidence of child pornography would be discovered at defendant residence.the district court concluded that the images attached to the affidavit,which the magistrate judge reviewed,provided that evidence.
on october,without the benefit of a plea agreement,lafortune pleaded guilty to counts and.six days later,a jury found lafortune guilty on counts and.on march,the district court sentenced lafortune to months of imprisonment,followed by months of supervised release.since lafortune was a offender,convicted of advertising child pornography in violation of d a,months was the mandatory minimum sentence.see d e.this sentence was months longer than the maximum term would have been without the sentence enhancement for prior convictions.see e.
lafortune now appeals the district court decision to deny his motion to suppress,arguing once again that there was no probable cause for the search of his residence and computer.we review the probable cause determination de novo.ornelas united states,d.he also appeals his sentence,arguing that it violates his right to trial by jury.
there is a familiar quality to lafortune challenge to the probable cause determination.in arguing that the magi
