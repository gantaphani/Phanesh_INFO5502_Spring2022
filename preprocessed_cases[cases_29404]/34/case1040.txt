background 
on october,shcherbakovskiy entered into a joint venture agreement with da capo al fine,to restructure zetek power,a british manufacturer of alkaline fuel cells.at the time,zetek power was in the british equivalent of bankruptcy.howard seitz,a member of dc al fine board of directors and its lawyer,negotiated the agreement with shcherbakovskiy.under the agreement,dc al fine and shcherbakovskiy each contributed to the joint venture.that allowed zetek power to continue its operations while in bankruptcy.however,by december,zetek power had exhausted its financial resources.
dc al fine then formed a subsidiary called da capo fuel cell company.seitz wrote to the administrator of zetek power estate in great britain and offered,on behalf of dc fuel cell,to buy zetek power assets for.pursuant to an asset transfer agreement,dated october,between dc fuel cell and zetek power joint administrators,dc fuel cell purchased zetek power assets.after dc fuel cell acquired zetek power assets,they were transferred to a new entity called eident,formed by dc fuel cell with another company.
on february,shcherbakovskiy filed suit against seitz and dc al fine in the southern district of new york.his complaint alleged that i seitz and dc al fine fraudulently induced him to enter the joint venture agreement funding zetek power and ii seitz and dc al fine,by acquiring zetek power assets for themselves,breached fiduciary duties owed him under the joint venture agreement.seitz and dc al fine answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and conversion.
the conversion counterclaim involved a russian subsidiary of zetek power,zetek russia.zetek russia assets included a development agreement with russia rocket space corporation,known as energia.the counterclaim alleged that shcherbakovskiy helped organize independent power technologies ipt,a russian limited company.he now serves as chairman and is a minority shareholder of ipt.the conversion counterclaim alleged that ipt wrongfully took control of zetek russia assets,including its employees,goodwill,and contract with energia.
shcherbakovskiy moved to dismiss the conversion counterclaim.the motion argued that zetek russia was a organization and,under russian law,could not have legally transferred its assets to dc al fine.therefore,the argument went,because dc al fine had no claim of ownership of zetek russia assets,dc al fine could not assert a claim for conversion of them.the motion also sought to have shcherbakovskiy own complaint deemed to conform to the factual claim that zetek russia was a organization or to give appellant an opportunity to amend the complaint.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss the conversion counterclaim in a order dated october.it read in full 
the within pleading motion doc.serves no useful purpose and is denied.the counterclaims pleaded in the answer are sufficient to satisfy rule a.it is not necessary at this time to determine choice of law with finality,however,the court understands that the counterclaims are based on breach of an agreement which is regulated by the laws of the united kingdom or new york,not russia.
while this court agrees that,were traditional common law pleading required,a partner or joint venturer can not commit the tort of conversion of firm property,the pleading gives adequate notice of defendant decapo claim that plaintiff got away with some or all of the property in russia in which dacapo had some interest,in violation of the agreement of the parties,resulting in a triable fact issue.
at the heart of the present dispute is a discovery request by seitz and dc al fine to shcherbakovskiy for documents relating to the technology which ipt is offering in america and other places throughout the world.shcherbakovskiy,by way of affidavit and deposition testimony,stated that he had no access to the documents because he was only the chairman of ipt and,under russian law and a confidentiality agreement with zetek russia,could not overrule the decision of zetek russia board to deny access to the documents.appellees argue that appellant position was at odds with a letter he had written suggesting his absolute control of the company.shcherbakovskiy has also produced a letter from russian counsel suggesting that disclosure by him of some or all of the materials sought,which may involve sensitive technology,might cause russian authorities to bring criminal proceedings against him,including one for treason.
at a december,conference,the district court took a dim at length shcherbakovskiy explanation and,in a december,order,ordered shcherbakovskiy to produce the documents in question.the order warned that i f plaintiff fails to produce documents responsive to the order on or before january,the court will dismiss the complaint,with prejudice and with costs,against the plaintiff and will grant the counterclaims of da capo.shcherbakovskiy did not produce the documents,and on january,the court dismissed his complaint and granted default judgment to dc al fine and seitz on their counterclaims.
sometime in january,seitz realized that the conversion counterclaim properly belonged to dc fuel cell,a.seitz then prepared an assignment transferring the claim from dc fuel cell to dc al fine.that assignment,although drafted in january,was dated effective as of april.
shcherbakovskiy filed another motion to dismiss the conversion counterclaim,arguing that the assignment was a sham created merely to give dc al fine standing.the district court referred this motion,along with the question of damages on the counterclaim judgment,to magistrate judge fox.
in his report and recommendation,the magistrate judge concluded that seitz assignment of the conversion counterclaim was valid,even though executed after the commencement of litigation.the district court adopted that report over shcherbakovskiy objection.
the magistrate judge issued a second report concluding that dc al fine was entitled to a jury trial on the issue of damages on the counterclaims.the district court adopted the conclusions of that report.
a jury trial to determine damages on the conversion counterclaim ensued.the jury found that dc al fine was entitled to in compensatory damages for shcherbakovskiy breach of contract and for his conversion of zetek russia property.dc al fine was awarded only the larger of those two amounts the district court held that the damages for the breach of contract were included in the award for conversion and that combining the awards would therefore lead to a double recovery.shcherbakovskiy has appealed from the entry of the default judgment and from the denial of his motions to dismiss the conversion counterclaim.dc al fine and seitz from the damages award.
discussion 
shcherbakovskiy argues on appeal that i the default judgment dismissing shcherbakovskiy complaint and granting da capo counterclaims was an abuse of discretion ii shcherbakovskiy motions to dismiss the conversion counterclaim should have been granted both because zetek russia was a company powerless to transfer its assets and because dc al fine claim to the assets in question was based on an invalid assignment from dc fuel cell and iii we should reassign the case to a different judge on remand.dc al fine argues on the that the special verdict form misstated the law when it characterized the breach of contract and conversion damages as duplicative.
a default judgment 
we review the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with discovery orders for abuse of discretion.jones niagara frontier transp,cir.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx,d.
rule b provides that a court may impose sanctions as are just on a party for disobedience of a discovery order.b.we have noted that district courts possess wide discretion in imposing sanctions under rule.daval steel prods.fakredine,cir.however,t he sanction of dismissal should not be imposed under rule unless the failure to comply with a pretrial production order is due to willfulness,bad faith,or any fault of the deponent.salahuddin harris,cir quoting societe internationale pour participations industrielles et commerciales rogers,d.
neither the december,order nor the january,judgment contain factual findings or legal reasoning underlying and explaining the default judgment.these are contained entirely in a transcript of a hearing held on december.
during appellee argument for the production of documents,the court repeatedly asked why the issue could not be left in the status quo,with appellant claiming a lack of access subject to impeachment based on his position in the company,size of investment,and inconsistent statements in a letter.in the court view,no jury is going to believe he has no documents.
appellant counsel then stated his position in a colloquy that we set out in pertinent part 
weinstein good morning.first of all,i just want to briefly address some of the factual statements that my adversary made.
the court you free to do that.i assume that you not agreeing with his factual statements.but i have the problem of today.my problem today is why these documents do have to be produced under some kind of protective order,if necessary,so i have to resolve these issues and get the case ready for trial.i do want you to misunderstand.we have a felony trial ongoing here this morning and a violation of probation coming in.we have other business besides somebody who does want to produce documents.
weinstein i address that directly.shcherbakovskiy is the nonexecutive chairman of itp.he stated under oath that he does have any documents himself.
the court you do believe that he has no control over the documents,do you 
weinstein yes,i do.
the court i think a jury is going to be very incredulous when they confronted with that,and you buy the farm around here.if you going to take a bad position in discovery like that or allow your client to take it,you not going to come in and blow hot and cold at the trial.you not going to take a different position with me,because if you are,your adversary is going to ask for a jury instruction.
weinstein our position,we been informed under russian law 
the court do give me that.
weinstein he has no control.
the court you a plaintiff here in westchester county,new york.you under my discovery rules.if you do abide by my discovery rules,two things are going to happen.either you going to lose your case on the merits with the jury because they going to figure your client is lying,or you going to get dismissed on the merits by the court for failing to honor my directions.i do care about russian law.i believe that the average juror will think that he has constructive possession of these records and he can get to them if he really wants to.
weinstein with all due respect,your honor,this court does have power to order the company to turn over the documents.
the court but i have power to dismiss your case with prejudice and costs.i do that right now.
weinstein these documents,first of all,are not for our case,they for defense 
the court no,no.do give me that.
weinstein but it true.
the court it not true.you going to produce them under a protective order or i going to toss your case and you explain to the second circuit.it that simple truth with me.i do have time to listen to a lot of drivel.this is ordinary discovery.your client sought out this forum.
weinstein my client is suing individually.he being counterclaimed individually.itp is not a party to this.if they want these documents,they could have sued 
the court i going to order their production within days.i going to have a precise enough order so i can make it stick.if you do comply,i going to drop the case for the plaintiff,dismiss it with prejudice and costs and i going to take an inquest on the counterclaims and you can go your merry way.i do have to listen to this kind of nonsense and i take a dim view of this fellow saying he ca,that he has no access to these records.he what,the chairman of the board,is that what he is 
weinstein he chairman of the board.he does control the board.he not the majority shareholder.he asked the board to produce the documents at a recent meeting following the letter i got from callaghy 
the court i do believe it.i telling you right now i do believe it.why do the two of you confer and get a protective order and take days to go get these records and after that,if you do comply with united states discovery,out you go.do you want to do that 
weinstein i have no choice.
the court you have no choice except to call my bluff,which is not a bluff,and go to the circuit,because you not going to do this,you not going to access a federal forum in the united states and come in here and tell this court and tell a jury,oh,i suing individually.i only the chairman of the board and i ca produce any of these allegedly relevant documents,and then tell him also they do exist.they laugh at you.you done enough trial work to know that.these jurors will be smirking.
weinstein they wo be smirking because they ca even establish a prima facie case.they.
the court all i know is this 
weinstein he ca identify a single asset of zetek moscow.
the court you not going to split his identity.he here and he going out the window unless he complies with united states discovery.that it.if you want to confer with each other and see if you can find a fair way to resolve this,do it 
weinstein i would need to consult with my client.but i believe that since he has no control over itp 
the court i do believe it.i told you that.
weinstein he may be unable to comply with the order.
the court and maybe the moon will fall onto the earth.lots of things can happen in the future.i wo put up with this nonsense,i telling you right now.if you want to stick to your position,them i going to ask callaghy to draft a proper order ordering precisely what to be produced,setting a reasonable time to do it,giving you a return date to come in here and produce it here in court.i want him to add into that proposed order any protective provisions that you need to preserve your trade secrets or whatever.and then if he does do it,out you go and i hold an inquest on the counterclaims.if you want to gamble on whether the circuit will uphold that,you can gamble.your client can gamble.i do care.
weinstein all right.i consult with callaghy and with my client.i believe that we going to have to go to the second circuit on this.
the court that fine with me.i not going to allow anybody to come in here as a plaintiff and lie like that or take the position that i only here individually and i ca access these russian records because i do control the board,i only the chairman.
weinstein what is the purpose,what is the purpose of corporate structure and laws if 
the court it not to be used as a method of fraud.
weinstein it not a method of fraud.
the court you have your opinion and i have my opinion.i told you what to do.you either going to do it or not.i do care.why do you try to be sensible.why do you not lead your client down the primrose path because you think you right and try to be sensible 
it very wrong to test the court resolve to preserve the sovereignty of the united states and the integrity of our pretrial discovery.that very wrong and it going to get your client into a bad situation.
weinstein i unaware of any caselaw where a person has been sued individually and has been forced to produce documents from a foreign corporation.
the court one of us is wrong.
turning to the legal issues first,a party is not obliged to produce,at the risk of sanctions,documents that it does not possess or can not obtain see.a any may serve on any other party a request to produce documents which a
