indicted as a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,melvin mcgregor moved to suppress evidence taken from a warrantless car search.after the district judge denied the motion,mcgregor conditionally pled guilty,reserving his right to challenge the ruling on appeal.this is that appeal.we affirm,though our reasoning differs from the judge on one issue.
consistent with our usual practice,we take the facts from the judge decision and from the hearing on the motion,presenting them in the light most compatible with his ruling.see,united states dancy,wl,at,cir.
a shooting in dorchester 
just before midnight,on july,officer brian smigielski and sergeant detective john fitzgerald of the boston police youth violence strike force a specialized unit tasked with monitoring gang activity heard about a shooting at a housing development in the dorchester section of boston.after driving to the scene in an unmarked car,smigielski spotted two men riddled with bullets slumped in a parked auto still alive,but not for long.he knew both men were members of the notoriously violent magnolia street gang actually,he recognized one of them as a founding member.he helped emergency medical personnel put the two in an ambulance,which then took off for boston medical center with the officers in tow.
suspicious activities 
it was now around on july.smigielski and fitzgerald parked in a driveway near a lot across from the hospital entrance.staking out a hospital after a shooting is a great way to collect intelligence about gangs,smigielski later said.and smigielski was not disappointed on this night.two men soon got out of a silver sedan.smigielski recognized one of them as antonio duncan,a magnolia street gang member who had been arrested on gun charges in the past.the men made a beeline for a group of people hanging out near the entrance.within seconds,the duo left with two other men,one of whom was mcgregor.they all piled into a gray honda accord with tinted windows and sped off mcgregor was no stranger to the criminal justice system.based on reports and talks with colleagues,smigielski knew that mcgregor was a magnolia street gang founder and that he was out on parole after serving time for firearms offenses.smigielski also knew that mcgregor had had a couple of with the police since his release.the first involved his fleeing the scene when stopped for a traffic infraction.the second also involved a traffic stop with a twist.pulled over by boston police,mcgregor was chauffeuring another magnolia street gang member,christian miranda,who gave officers a fake name when arrested for disorderly conduct during the encounter.and,it turned out,miranda was wanted for murder in north carolina.
fearing that the foursome might try to avenge the shooting of their comrades in crime,smigielski and fitzgerald tailed the honda.smigielski radioed for backup.boston police officer mark freire and his partner quickly joined in,driving an unmarked car equipped with flashing blue lights something smigielski and fitzgerald car lacked.smigielski determined that the honda was going at least in a zone.freire also saw the honda run a flashing red light,and he radioed that news to smigielski.
acting on smigielski order,freire turned his car blue lights on and pulled the honda over.freire approached the car with his gun holstered.smigielski and fitzgerald parked farther back and converged on the honda too.smigielski saw mcgregor in the honda driver seat,duncan in the front passenger seat,and antwan green a known magnolia street gang member out on bail pending trial on a firearms charge in the seat directly behind mcgregor.smigielski did not recognize the fourth person later identified as dominique jean pierre in the honda.
as the officers closed in,some of the occupants became noticeably nervous.watch the person in the back seat,driver side of the car,freire told smigielski.he leaning forward,and his chest is pounding,freire added.mcgregor had opened the driver door,which concerned smigielski because drivers do not usually do that during traffic stops.but with the door open,smigielski could see mcgregor left leg shaking,his chest heaving up and down,and his heart pounding through his.
incriminating evidence 
given what he knew about the shooting,the magnolia street gang,and mcgregor,smigielski feared that the car contained a gun.concerned about officer safety,he and his colleagues removed the men from the honda and patted them down for weapons.they came up empty,so they moved the men to the curb and focused their attention on the car.by this time other officers had showed up to help secure the scene.among those arriving was scott,an officer specially trained in how to detect hidden compartments,commonly called hides.
smigielski got into the car and started looking for easily accessible weapons.smigielski asked if he recognized any of the men.and did he knew green from an earlier firearms arrest.scotty,smigielski then said to,there got to be a gun in this car.
from the start,saw telltale signs of a hide in the honda where one could stash a gun.almost immediately,his eye was caught by an object on the dashboard just below the car stereo.it was only a couple of inches long and looked like a lego piece.smig,what that said to smigielski.but already knew it was an alarm magnet,which he knew from extensive training and experience could be used as a magnetic switch to activate an electronic hide rubbing the magnet over a specific area will complete a circuit that will open the hide.and,as far as he knew,magnets like this one played no part in the normal workings of a car.his instructors had drilled into him to always be on the lookout for magnets in situations like this.in any event,smigielski grabbed the magnet and gave it to.
his interest piqued,looked underneath the honda to see what he could see.and he saw plenty an exhaust pipe that had been tinkered with suspiciously it was and lower than usual and a piece of metal that had more rust on it than the rest of the undercarriage,with a considerable amount of bondo a substance used in work around the edges to help seal the piece in place both dead giveaways that the car had a false bottom.crawled under the honda and tapped the area with his flashlight,and he heard a hollow rather than a solid sound.
convinced more than ever that the honda had a hide,got into the car and focused his attention on the area the very area where he thought the hide would be.he started with the cup holder,which was next to the console.normally cup holders are removable so people can clean them more easily.but could not lift this one.it had been glued down,a sure sign that someone did not want others to get at that area.then lifted up the lid to the console and removed the cds that were there.he wanted to open the access panel something most cars have so persons can get to and work on the cables that run underneath.but this panel had glue around it,so put a knife in the panel latch and with little effort popped the panel open.peering inside,found a handgun,which turned out to be loaded,and some crack cocaine.only about five minutes passed between the time the officers sat mcgregor and the others on the curb and the time found the damning evidence.
the police arrested mcgregor and his companions and had the honda towed to a secure location.the next day sergeant detective william feeney of the boston police executed a warrant to search the car.usually when officers suspect that an auto has a hide,feeney gets involved.intimately familiar with automotive systems mechanical and electrical,feeney is considered the department foremost expert on hides.he has studied them for years and has taught other officers including fbi and dea personnel all about them.he had even trained.look for magnets inside cars,he tells his students.see if the center console or dashboard is loose or in a manner that is out of the norm.look under the car and see if anything has been modified suspiciously inspecting the exhaust system is a good place to start.
feeney knew that had found a hide in the honda center console.and he knew too that had come across a magnet near the dashboard.so he looked there to see if anyone had rejiggered the wiring in a way necessary to run an electric hide.and he saw exactly that.he then figured out how the system worked put the key in the ignition,fasten a seatbelt,switch on the cruise control,turn on the defroster,tug on the emergency brake,move the switch to the middle position,move a magnet around a spot on the dashboard which would trigger a magnetic switch behind the dashboard,and press the sunroof button doing this activates a series of switches,which starts up a motor under the center console,which opens up the hide so one can reach right through the bottom of the console and into a secret compartment.these steps can be done in any order,and it takes about seconds to run through them from start to finish.but you could speed up the process considerably if,say,you did of the steps first and left only one for later then it would take less than seconds to open the hide.feeney did the steps and found among other things another round of ammo tucked inside the hide.
proceedings 
a federal grand jury charged mcgregor with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.see g.he later moved to suppress the evidence on two principal fourth amendment grounds the stop based on traffic violations was a pretext because the officers really wanted to check for weapons an ulterior motive that invalidated the stop.also,the warrantless search of the honda was unreasonable both because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion that the car contained weapons and because the scope and intrusiveness of the search surpassed what was reasonably needed to ensure their safety.see,michigan long,requiring that a protective search of an auto be brief,limited in scope,and based on articulable suspicion that a person could gain immediate access to weapons.
smigielski,freire,and feeney testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress.jean pierre one of the honda passengers did too.mcgregor did not.in denying mcgregor motion,the judge reasoning ran like this.the traffic violations gave the officers probable cause to stop the honda,which immunized the stop from attack even if their true aim was to look for weapons.see whren united states,holding that s ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary,fourth amendment analysis.also,the totality of the circumstances showed that the officers actually and reasonably suspected that the honda passengers might be armed,so they could not only the men but also the car compartment area for possible weapons that might endanger them and they did nothing more than long and its successors authorized them to do.and finally,what learned during this limited protective search gave him probable cause to pop open the center console access panel.mcgregor conditional guilty plea followed,which preserved the suppression issue for appellate review.see.a.the judge then sentenced mcgregor to months in prison and years of supervised release.this appeal ensued.
standard of review 
we review the district judge denial of mcgregor suppression motion under a standard,evaluating legal and constitutional conclusions de novo,and factual and credibility findings for clear error.see,dancy,wl,at.review is highly deferential,requiring us to let the judge conclusions and credibility calls stand unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the judge made a mistake.see,united states woodbury,cir.and,ultimately,we must affirm if the judge ruling is supported by any grounds fairly presented by the record.see,united states bater,cir united states owens,cir united states soule,cir.
first principles 
the basics are familiar.the fourth amendment bans only unreasonable searches and seizures,see,terry ohio,and a search done without a warrant supported by probable cause is presumptively unreasonable unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies,see,united states lopez,cir.so we jump directly to the exception that applies here.an officer can stop a car if he sees a driver commit a traffic offense,even if the stop is just an excuse to investigate something else.see,whren,at.he can then order the occupants out of the auto.see,maryland wilson.and if he has some articulable,reasonable suspicion that the persons stopped may be dangerous,he can pat them down and search the car interior including closed compartments for weapons that they could quickly lay their hands on.see,long,at,permitting a patdown under the car seats and dashboard and in the glove where persons could place or hide weapons and reach right away.but the scope of the search must be limited to this protective purpose.see,id.at united states lott,cir.
in sorting out the reasonableness of an officer actions in this context,we typically ask two questions was he justified in making the stop and,if yes,was the protective search reasonably related to the events justifying the stop,factoring in what happened and what he learned during the encounter see,united states ivery,cir united states chhien,cir.to answer the second question,we must ask two more was there an objectively reasonable basis to suspect that weapons were present and assuming lott is still good law more on this later did the officer in fact entertain such a suspicion see,ivery,at discussing lott,at.of course,the officer must work purposefully to confirm or dispel his suspicions promptly.but there are no hard time limits.see,united states sharpe,owens,at.obviously,then,context matters,and we must take a practical approach to all of this,keeping in mind the totality of the circumstances as seen and interpreted by the police at the scene.see,united states arvizu,united states soares,cir.
in something of an,mcgregor no longer questions the legality of the traffic stop.instead,he trains his sights on the second step in the analysis,complaining that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion needed to justify a limited protective search of the car a search that he insists was too long and too intrusive to boot.we see things quite differently,however.
reasonable suspicion 
no simple,mechanical formula tells us what reasonable suspicion is,though we know that it is less than probable cause and more than a naked hunch.see,chhien,at.and no template exists to sketch out whether an officer acted with reasonable suspicion.see,united states espinoza,cir.rather,courts must gauge its presence in a commonsense,way,taking in the whole picture.see,chhien,at.so let us go over what the police knew and saw before the protective search took place.a someone had gunned down two in the magnolia street gang,a brutal cartel conspicuous for its and.b two men drove up to the hospital where the victims were,grabbed two others,and then it to the honda with their compatriots in tow.c the men hightailed it out of there,exceeding the speed limit and running a flashing red light.d three of the four duncan,green,and,most importantly for our purposes,mcgregor stood out as magnolia street gang members who had had serial scrapes with the law,including arrests and in mcgregor case,conviction for firearms offenses.and e some of the men seemed suspiciously nervous breathing hard,shaking,as the officers approached the car.given facts a d,smigielski worried that the men thirsted for revenge against the shooter.add fact e to the mix,and smigielski feared his word,not ours that they had a gun in the car too.on this record,we can not fault the judge finding that the police actually and reasonably suspected that the men might be armed a suspicion resting on rational reasons,rather than pure gut feelings which,we agree,justified a limited weapons search under the long line of decisions.
mcgregor musters multiple aimed at persuading us otherwise.none can carry the day,however.
mcgregor protests that the judge botched the case from the by framing the legal question inexactly.quoting lott,mcgregor claims that a search can not measure up to long high demands if the officers did not actually fear for their safety.see at.and,he says,the judge slipped by focusing on whether the officers had objectively reasonable suspicion that the men posed a danger rather than on whether they had actual safety concerns.on top of that,the officers had no ac
