after a trial,a jury in the district of massachusetts convicted efraín matías of attempted possession of at least five kilograms of cocaine with the intent to distribute he was sentenced to twenty years in prison and ten years of supervised release.matias presses two claims on appeal.first,he argues that the district court erroneously allowed the prosecution to introduce evidence that after his arrest,law enforcement agents discovered roughly in a storage locker that he rented.second,he asserts that the prosecutor closing argument contained improper comments that added up to a violation of his right to a fair trial.finding no error,we affirm.
factual background 
we recount the facts surrounding matías arrest and conviction,which are largely undisputed,in the light most consistent with the jury verdict.united states valerio,cir.
in late,drug enforcement administration dea agents in massachusetts received word from fellow agents in california that matías wanted to buy a large quantity of cocaine to sell in the worcester area.this information came from a cooperating witness in san diego,josé luis ruiz.the agents in worcester already had information that matías was a marijuana trafficker ruiz had been involved in many of matías marijuana deals.
beginning in december,dea agents monitored telephone conversations between matías and ruiz,during which the two discussed details of a plan for matías to purchase cocaine.in march,ruiz introduced matías to dea undercover agent anthony roberto known to matías only as tony who was posing as ruiz drug courier.tony and matías eventually agreed that tony would deliver ten kilograms of cocaine to matías in massachusetts.
after an aborted attempt at consummating the deal in march,tony and matías agreed to meet on april,at the greendale mall in worcester,not far from matías house.tony told matías that he and another man undercover dea agent paul gazzara would bring nineteen kilograms of cocaine,with an asking price of per kilogram.dea agents conducting surveillance saw matías drive into the mall parking lot and then briefly meet with tony inside the mall.gazzara arrived in an undercover dea van to meet the pair after they emerged from inside the mall.the van contained ersatz cocaine that was packaged to look authentic and stored in a hidden compartment.matías looked inside the van,and,apparently satisfied,told tony that he was going to get the money to make the purchase later that day at the same mall.a few hours later,matías returned to the greendale mall,albeit in a different vehicle.upon meeting up with tony,matías told him that he only wanted to buy one kilogram of cocaine,test it,and then purchase the remaining eighteen kilos if he liked the test results.tony refused those terms and the deal was,for the time being,scrapped.
despite the uncompleted april deal,matías continued discussions with ruiz about buying cocaine.eventually,ruiz agreed to drive from california to massachusetts with cocaine to make the deal personally with matías.on june,ruiz,along with his supplier in reality undercover dea agent raphael romero met with matías in an auburn,massachusetts,restaurant.matías agreed to buy kilograms of cocaine.he was to pay per kilogram for the first ten kilograms,and each for the remaining twelve.romero agreed to a cash payment for the first ten kilograms,and to front matías the rest,with payment to be made within three days.matías told romero that he would likely pay the remainder sooner,because he expected to the cocaine quickly.he also spoke of future deals with romero.they agreed to complete the deal later that day at a nearby hotel where ruiz and romero were staying.
after the meeting,matías switched into a different car and drove home.he eventually drove to a clothing store that he owned,later emerging with two plastic bags that each contained a shoebox full of cash.he then met ruiz and romero at a starbucks café near their hotel.matías gave romero a suitcase that he had retrieved from his car,which contained over,considerably more than the that romero was expecting to receive.matías explained that he preferred to pay for twelve kilograms immediately,so that he would only owe romero for the remaining ten kilograms.upon seeing the money,romero signaled to other dea agents,who promptly arrested matías.
following the arrest,dea agents executed search warrants at matías clothing store and at a storage locker that matías rented in sterling,massachusetts,a town roughly fifteen miles from worcester.they found approximately in cash in the storage locker.matías has never disputed that he rented the locker and that the cash belonged to him.
prior to trial,matías gave notice that he would assert an entrapment defense.matías claimed that he only got involved in a cocaine deal as opposed to his usual practice of dealing only marijuana because ruiz had plied him with a story that ruiz and his family faced violent retribution from a drug associate after a robbery.
ii.the cash in the storage locker 
at trial,in addition to the government evidence about the seizure of cash from the storage locker,matías testified in his own defense,and conceded that the money seized from the storage locker was his.he also admitted that cash had been seized from him before,and that he used storage lockers to hide drug proceeds from law enforcement.
at the close of evidence,the trial judge ruled that the evidence of matías marijuana dealing including the storage locker cash was relevant to rebut the entrapment defense,as it was probative of matías predisposition to engage in the charged crime.see united states djokich,cir after the defendant has made a threshold showing,the burden shifts to the government to prove that either the defendant was not wrongfully induced or the defendant had a predisposition to engage in such conduct absent the inducement.
on appeal,matías first argues that the seized money was not relevant to the charged cocaine crime.we review this evidentiary claim for abuse of discretion.united states polanco,cir relevant evidence is that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.there was no abuse of discretion in the district court observation that the large sum of cash secreted in the storage locker was relevant to his ability to consummate the transaction.given that matías seemingly owed ruiz to complete the cocaine deal,the large sum of money stored in the locker was probative of the charged crime because it reflected matías ability to engage in substantial cash transactions.this evidence of his capacity to engage in drug transactions,in combination with the other evidence of his familiarity with and participation in drug trafficking,was thus relevant,at a minimum,to the government meeting its burden of establishing predisposition.in addition,the storage of the cash,which fit with matías admission that,as a trafficker he used storage lockers to hide drug proceeds,undercuts matías argument that the district court reasoning opens the door to the government relying on a defendant possession of any large sum of money as evidence of guilt 
next,although he does not cite to federal rule of evidence and did not do so below matías also argues that the admission of the storage locker evidence unfairly prejudiced him because it left the jury to speculate that he was a drug dealer based on his past,without proof of the pending cocaine charges against him.this argument fails because the proof of matías involvement in the charged crime was overwhelming,with recorded phone conversations and meetings between the defendant and ruiz,roberto,gazzara and romero.moreover,matías conceded during his own testimony that he was a drug dealer.in light of this evidence,there was little risk of unfair prejudice in the admission of the cash seized from matías storage locker.
iii.prosecutor closing argument 
matías claims on appeal that several statements within the government closing argument were improperly prejudicial and violated his right to a fair
