on march,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of rhode island charged joseph benedetti with being a felon in possession of a firearm.see g.the appellant evaded arrest until july,when he was finally found in florida.
following the appellant enforced return to rhode island,a trial ensued.the jury found the appellant guilty.the district court,over the appellant contemporaneous blakely objection,see blakely washington,d,sentenced him in accordance with the federal sentencing guidelines.
in this timely appeal,the appellant asserts that a pair of errors marred the proceedings below i the district court abused its discretion when it allowed the government to introduce evidence of his flight to florida and ii the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,vindicated his blakely objection and entitles him to resentencing.
we conclude that the district court committed no trial error and that the booker error,even though preserved by the appellant blakely objection,was harmless.accordingly,we affirm the appellant conviction and sentence.
background 
we rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the verdict.united states mercado,cir.
on the night of november,five rhode island state police troopers arrived at the appellant small apartment,search warrant in hand,and knocked on the door.the appellant began to open the portal,but quickly slammed it shut when he learned who was on the other side.the troopers forced entry,subdued the appellant,ascertained that no one else was on the premises,and executed the warrant.
the search revealed a number of utility bills bearing the appellant name and address and no evidence suggesting that any other person was living in the apartment.when the search extended to the top drawer of a dresser in the apartment lone bedroom,the troopers found,among the usual haberdashery underwear,socks,and the like,a loaded caliber handgun,small amounts of cocaine and marijuana,and some pills.no underwear or socks were found in any other location within the apartment.
after reading the appellant his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,a trooper confronted him regarding the fruits of the search.at that point,the appellant admitted everything in the apartment is mine.the trooper then inquired specifically as to the ownership of the gun.the appellant replied t he gun mine too.he further acknowledged that he was the only person residing in the apartment.
the discovery of the handgun resulted in a referral of the case to federal law enforcement authorities.on wednesday,march,the grand jury handed up a indictment charging the appellant as a felon in possession of a firearm.see g.two days later,attorney paul dimaio telephoned waing chau,an agent of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms.after identifying himself as the appellant lawyer,dimaio inquired as to whether the district court had issued an arrest warrant for his client.chau replied in the affirmative and assented to dimaio subsequent request that the appellant be permitted to on monday,march.
monday arrived,but the appellant did not.instead,dimaio called chau and informed him that benedetti would not be surrendering because he was gone.the appellant remained at large for over four years.he was eventually arrested on july,when government agents found him living in florida under an assumed name.he was then returned to rhode island to face the pending indictment.
as the parties geared up for trial,the government indicated that it planned to introduce evidence of the appellant abscondment.nonplussed by this prospect,the appellant filed a pretrial motion in limine.following a hearing,the district court,ruling ore sponte,concluded that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice,the time that would be consumed in exploring it,and the risk that the jury may be confused as to the real issue in the case.the court found it plausible that the appellant,although innocent,might have fled because he feared that he would be unjustly convicted.given this possibility,the chance that the jury might be tempted to convict the appellant simply because he fled created what seemed to the court at that time to be an unacceptable risk of unfair prejudice.hence,the court excluded the flight evidence pursuant to federal rule of evidence providing in pertinent part that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by waste of time.
even though the court granted the motion in limine,it apparently was cognizant that it did not have a full picture of the factual scenario.accordingly,the court confined its exclusionary ruling to the government case in chief.the court took pains to remind the parties that the ruling was subject to change and that the matter could be revisited if the evidence at trial unfolded in a manner that altered the variables inherent in the rule algorithm.
the appellant stipulated that he had a prior felony record and that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce.thus,the only triable issue was whether the appellant possessed the caliber handgun.during the government case in chief,two of the troopers who participated in the search testified anent their findings and the appellant admissions.in these officers,defense counsel made repeated references to the fact that the events to which they testified had occurred almost five years prior to the time of trial.in his opening statement,made at the start of the defense case,counsel reiterated that point.
the defense case was built on the premise that the gun found in the apartment did not belong to the appellant but,rather,to the appellant friend,kenneth bellucci.bellucci testified that the appellant had allowed him to live in the apartment temporarily,that all the items discovered in the top dresser drawer were his,and that the appellant was not aware of the presence of the handgun.bellucci explained that,by coincidence,he had moved out of the apartment on the very day that the troopers arrived.although he took most of his possessions with him,he left behind his underwear,socks,drugs,and gun.
the defense then called linda dibona,the appellant.dibona testified that bellucci moved in with her after departing from the appellant hearth and that she overheard a telephone call between the two men in which bellucci admitted that the gun was his.in that same call,bellucci apologized profusely to the appellant and promised to make it right.
during dibona direct examination,the government sought permission to dibona regarding her knowledge of the appellant flight.noting that the in limine ruling only precluded the government from introducing evidence of flight in its case in chief,the court recalibrated the scales.in doing so,it identified three material sets of circumstances that had changed subsequent to the time of its original in limine ruling.first,defense counsel repeated references to the lengthy interval between the discovery of the weapon and the time of trial had created an inference of trumped up charges that the government should be allowed to rebut.second,the fact that the appellant presumably knew from the outset that bellucci and dibona were prepared to exonerate him strengthened the inference that his flight indicated a consciousness of guilt.third,witnesses close to a defendant who possessed exculpatory evidence normally would come forward immediately if they knew that their friend had been falsely accused.because bellucci and dibona had not,the court believed that their knowledge of the appellant flight would be relevant to an assessment of their credibility.emphasizing these new insights,the court ruled that the government could present flight evidence to impeach defense witnesses and,as part of its rebuttal case,to establish a consciousness of guilt.
in announcing this ruling,the court made clear that the witnesses were free to deny knowledge of the appellant flight and that the appellant was free to adduce evidence suggesting an innocent purpose for his abrupt departure.the significance of the flight evidence,the court said,w
