defendant jerry was charged,along with others,with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of more than five kilograms of cocaine and one kilogram of heroin.he was convicted following a jury trial and sentenced to months,the applicable statutory mandatory minimum,pursuant to b a.he appeals,claiming that the district court plainly erred in admitting testimony to which did not object at trial,and challenging the sufficiency of the evidence linking him to the conspiracy.after a thorough review of the record,we affirm the conviction.
in light of sufficiency challenge,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states,cir.the evidence introduced at trial described as a seller and a weapons handler for a drug trafficking organization in santa isabel,puerto rico.the organization,run by luis enrique,controlled all of the drug sales in santa isabel beginning in about.it operated nine drug points,including rincón taíno and cemí,two locations near the area where lived.the sale of drugs within santa isabel required permission.those who sold drugs without his permission were killed.
each of the drug points sold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine each week.some of the drug points also distributed heroin,crack,and marijuana.the rincón taíno drug point,for example,sold an eighth of a kilogram of cocaine and heroin each week over the course of the conspiracy.
at trial,xiomi,a cooperating witness for the government,testified that she had seen selling cocaine at rincón taíno and cemí.she operated her own drug point,known as lala café,and testified that when she did not have drugs to sell she would send her customers to.her customers would report back that they had purchased cocaine from him.she stated that was always armed.she also saw him at the coco bongo bar,a place frequented by members of the organization.she reported that he had placed his pistol on top of the bar,as the other members of the organization did when they gathered to discuss how much money had been made at the drug points during that week.
david,another cooperating witness,testified that he had purchased cocaine from on to occasions between and.he also described as always armed,who stored drugs and weapons for the organization,recounted that one day had arrived at his house and told him that he had been sent by and another member of the organization to pick up a shotgun.wrapped the shotgun in a jacket and gave it to 
the government also introduced at trial a recorded telephone conversation in which arranged to meet a confidential informant to sell him two firearms,a pistol and a magnum revolver.although the confidential informant did not testify at trial,special agent,the dea agent investigating the organization,testified that he had arranged for the informant to make the call and listened in as it was being recorded.he testified that the voice on the tape was that of.on the recording,agreed to meet with the informant to consummate the sale.came to the informant residence as planned.however,he told the informant that he could not sell him the weapons because they were being used at the time.this encounter was also recorded,but the recording was inaudible because had arrived at the meeting driving a diesel cement truck.
in addition,the government called michael,the defendant uncle and a local police officer,to testify.explained that he had become familiar with the organization through his work as a police officer and that he had been involved with two separate investigations related to the organization activities.on the basis of these investigations and general familiarity with the organization,he testified that his nephew was a seller at the drug point at rincón taíno and that he also transported weapons for the organization.on,admitted that he had never seen his nephew sell drugs or transport weapons and that he had never arrested him.
counsel did not object to any of the testimony described above.at the close of the government case,moved for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the government had failed to introduce evidence directly linking him to the conspiracy.see.the district court denied the motion.
then testified in his own defense and denied any involvement with the organization.he denied ever selling drugs or weapons and denied that it was his voice on the recording.he also called his father,an indicted coconspirator who had pled guilty to the conspiracy,to testify on his behalf.his father stated that he had no knowledge of his son being a member of the organization or engaging in any criminal activity.then renewed his rule motion and the district court again denied it.
following the jury guilty verdict,filed a final,written rule motion.the district court denied this motion during sentencing hearing,after hearing from both sides.
at sentencing,the district court found that guideline range was to months.however,this range was trumped by the statutory minimum of ten years in prison,b a,which was applicable because the jury had specifically found,by means of a special verdict form,that was responsible for more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than five kilograms of heroin accordingly,the district court sentenced to months in prison this appeal followed.
argues that the district court plainly erred in admitting certain testimony from xiomi and.we review properly preserved objections to the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states rodriguez,cir.however,where,as here,the appellant did not assert a timely objection at trial,we review only for plain error.id.this standard requires the appellant to show that there was error,that the error was plain,and that it prejudiced the defendant.id.the appellant may demonstrate prejudice by showing a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.id.quoting united states epstein,cir see also united states dominguez benitez,d.when these three requirements are met,we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting epstein,at see also united states olano,d.
xiomi testimony 
challenges as hearsay the admission of testimony that her customers had confirmed that they had purchased cocaine from when she did not have any available.the challenged exchange was as follows 
government let take it one by one.rincón taíno,what did jerry famania sell in rincón taíno 
he sold cocaine.well,i know for a fact because when i did have material i would send my customers to him to buy from him and they would say to me that he was the one that had sold them the drugs that day.
government okay.now,let talk about cemí,what did jerry famania sell in cemí 
cocaine.also told to me by my customers.
government okay.by your customers,you mean people who bought cocaine from you is that correct 
exactly.yes,when i did have any i would send my customers to their drug points.
federal rule of evidence d e provides that statement s by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy are not hearsay.the predicate for admitting testimony under this rule is a conclusion by the trial court that it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made,and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states petrozziello,cir.this determination is referred to in our circuit as a petrozziello ruling.united states newton,cir.when a timely objection is made,the trial court makes a provisional petrozziello ruling,subject to a final ruling as to whether the coconspirator requirement is satisfied at the close of all the evidence.id.whether customers were members of the conspiracy,along with,is a question of fact.united states hurley,cir whether a conspiracy customers are also members of the conspiracy is a question.
because did not object to the testimony at trial,the district court did not make a petrozziello ruling and did not make a factual finding as to whether the customers were coconspirators.when first raised hearsay concerns in his rule motion,the district court responded 
the problem is that rulings that i made are in the context of the objections that are presented there was no issue ever raised as to the preliminary rulings that must be made in those cases,nothing of that sort.but even if i had made preliminary rulings,i would have said now that the evidence allowed me to do the change the conditional admission to an actual admission.
as the district court aptly noted,failure to object at trial explains the inadequacy of the record.there is no evidence of who the customers were,how often they purchased drugs,and for what purpose those purchases were made.without this information,we can not determine whether customers were coconspirators.
in any event,has failed to meet any of the prongs of the plain error test.aside from the conclusory assertion that customers were not part of the conspiracy,does not muster any evidence,or even argue,that the predicate for admitting the testimony was not satisfied here.he also does not explain how the admission of this testimony prejudiced him.testified that she had seen him selling drugs at both rincón taíno and cemí and that she would send her customers to him when she did not have cocaine available.there is no hearsay involved in this testimony.the confirmation offered by her customers that they had successfully purchased cocaine from him adds little to this account.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in admitting testimony.
also challenges the admission of testimony that controlled the cemí drug point and her description of the quantities of drugs sold at the various drug points on a weekly basis he claims that this testimony lacked a foundation in personal knowledge.see.we perceive no such weakness in the testimony.operated her own drug point and explained that she was present at the coco bongo bar where members of the conspiracy regularly gathered to discuss the quantities of drugs they had sold at the various drug points.she also testified that she had personally seen selling drugs and sent her customers to him.no more foundation was required to show that her testimony was based on personal knowledge of the of the conspiracy of which she was a member 
also challenges the admission of testimony by his uncle,michael,a local police officer.testified that he had been involved in investigating the organization.the following colloquy then occurred 
government sir,as part of your investigation,knowledge and per your intervention and investigation,do you know if jerry famania was involved in this gang 
government in what capacity 
he operated the drug point at the rincón taíno housing project at the midpoint as a seller.
government and what else,if you know 
with trafficking and transportation of weapons at different points.
government are you related in some form with famania 
government what is the relation 
he is my nephew.
on,admitted that he had never arrested his nephew and had never seen him transporting weapons or selling drugs.
on appeal,characterizes the evidentiary flaw in his uncle testimony by stating that it lacked any probative value,evid,yet presented the danger of unfair prejudice.it is difficult to know what his argument is.taking a generous view,the appellant may be arguing that his uncle testimony about his nephew involvement in the conspiracy had no probative value because,in the absence of any personal knowledge of his nephew involvement,there was no foundation for his testimony.
the government brief on appeal did not understand this to be the argument.even if that is the argument is making,the record is unclear whether or not had personally observed his nephew conduct in relation to the conspiracy.it may be that his testimony was based entirely on statements that he had heard from others during the course of his investigation.we have no idea whether the informants who testified at trial,or informants who did not testify,or other investigators may have passed along the information regarding role.thus we have no way to determine whether,for example,the information may be admissible under federal rule of evidence d e as coconspirator statements.it would have been preferable for the government to have laid a proper foundation.united states,cir hearsay does not become admissible merely because it is provided by a government agent in the form of an overview of the evidence.there is a risk here that this was improper testimony for some of the same reasons we have condemned the use of improper overview testimony.see rodriguez,at collecting cases.
nonetheless,did not object to the testimony at trial and,thus,he must demonstrate plain error.he can not meet the prejudice prong of the plain error test.testimony was entirely cumulative of the testimony of the government other three witnesses.see united states de la cruz,cir i t is difficult to imagine how the district court failure to strike what,in essence,amounted to cumulative testimony could have prejudiced defendant.the uncle testimony offered no additional specificity or detail.given the strength of the government case,which we further discuss in our sufficiency analysis below,and the limited impact of generalized statements,we are convinced that the verdict was not affected by any error in admitting this testimony.see rodriguez,at.
we review challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states boulerice,cir.in conducting our analysis,we consider the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,determine whether a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states,cir.
to prove a conspiracy to distribute drugs,the government was required to show that a conspiracy existed,that the defendant had knowledge of it,and that the defendant participated voluntarily in it.united states llinas,cir.
more specifically,to establish that a defendant belonged to and participated in a conspiracy,the government must prove two kinds of intent intent to agree with her and intent to commit the substantive offense.such proof may consist of circumstantial evidence,including inferences from surrounding circumstances,such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy purposes.the government need not prove that a knew all of the details or participated in all of the objectives of the plan.
id.quoting united states,cir see also united states boylan,cir the conspiratorial agreement need not be express so long as its existence can plausibly be inferred from the defendants words and actions and the interdependence of activities and persons involved.
relying on our decision in united states delutis,cir,where we stated that a single sale of drugs without more does not establish a conspiracy,argues that the evidence in this case proves no more than mere simple sale of drugs.we disagree.
this clearly is not a case involving a single sale of drugs by the defendant.moreover,it is not a case where the evidence shows only a relationship between and,where the latter was some kind of independent operator.testified that he had purchased drugs on many occasions from at the rincón taíno drug point.the testimony at trial further established that controlled drug sales in the town,and at rincón taíno in particular,and that without his permission,those who sold drugs within the town would be killed.testified that rincón taíno and cemí,where she had seen selling drugs,were drug points within the organization.she explained that she sent her customers to buy from when she did not have cocaine available.she also described placing his gun on the bar at the coco bongo,as was customary for members of the drug organization.this evidence is sufficient to establish role as a drug seller within the conspiracy.
there was also ample evidence of role as a weapons handler for the organization.stated that had once picked up a shotgun,on orders of and another leader of the conspiracy,from house,where the weapon had been stored by the organization.agent also testified regarding agreeme
