in this appeal we consider whether state law enforcement investigators failure properly to record and seal digital pager electronic interceptions,as prescribed by a state eavesdropping warrant and federal statute,should result in suppression of the pager interceptions and the evidence derived from them this case comes to us on the government interlocutory appeal of the november,and february,decisions of the united states district court for the western district of new york charles siragusa,judge which granted motions to suppress all evidence derived from the new york state pager eavesdropping warrant.in granting the motion to suppress,the district court found that the investigators failure to record electronically and to seal the pager interceptions rose to the level of a constitutional violation.although we agree with the district court that federal rather than state law governs,we disagree with the court disposition of the motion to suppress.the failure properly to record and seal these electronic interceptions is not a constitutional violation that merits suppression under c.rather,the appropriate remedy for a violation of this type is found in the exclusionary remedy contained in a.
background 
on march,state police investigators tracking a suspected cocaine distribution conspiracy in rochester,new york,obtained a eavesdropping warrant from monroe county court judge patricia marks.the warrant authorized the interception of a digital pager belonging to joseph amanuel and used by donald minni.the terms of the warrant required that the interceptions will be captured on a computer maintained by the n ew york state police,and the computer system shall make a record of every digital message intercepted from the target pager and all such records will be kept and stored by computer.the warrant further ordered that any and all electronic communications or fragments thereof which are intercepted and monitored shall be fully and completely listed and recorded in a manner which will protect the records from editing and alteration.the warrant also authorized the monitoring of communications via a duplicate or clone paging device,which would display the same information as that shown on the device being monitored.on april,monroe county court judge richard keenan continued the order of authorization for an additional thirty days.
contrary to the specific electronic recording requirements stated in the eavesdropping warrant,investigators did not record electronically intercepted pager communications on a computer.instead,an investigator visually monitored the clone pager and entered the intercepted information in a handwritten log.the state submitted pages of handwritten logs to judge keenan for sealing when the pager interception warrant continuation order expired.
the state then made an ex parte application for a wiretap warrant to monitor and record three different cellular phones used by minni and amanuel.in support of this request,the state presented judge keenan with information obtained during its ongoing investigation,including information obtained from visually monitoring the clone pager.judge keenan granted the wiretap application on may,and renewed it on june.in turn,these wiretaps provided information used to support the issuance of search warrants whose execution ultimately resulted in the seizure of incriminating physical evidence.
on november,after the conclusion of the investigation,a monroe county grand jury returned an indictment charging rodrique amanuel,minni,scott demeyer,and others with various offenses.during the state court proceedings,the defendants each moved to suppress the evidence derived from the improperly recorded pager interceptions.in response,the state explained that an electronic pager recording device had not been available in the monroe county area at the time of the investigation.the state conceded,however,that such a device had been available in albany,new york.it offered no explanation as to why the investigators had not used the albany pager recorder.
new york state supreme court justice kenneth fisher granted the defendants motions to suppress evidence from the pager interceptions because the visual monitoring and handwritten logs of the pager interception warrant violated the recording requirements of of new york criminal procedure law,which requires that the interceptions if possible,be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device.proc.law mckinney justice fisher then dismissed the indictments against all of the defendants,because all of the evidence in the state case derived either directly or indirectly from the pager interception warrant.
following dismissal of the state indictment,federal prosecutors assumed control of the case.on may,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging amanuel,minni,and demeyer with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than five hundred grams of a substance containing cocaine,in violation of and.in the district court,the defendants moved,as they had previously done in state court,to suppress all evidence derived from the march,pager interception warrant.
in november,the district court granted the defendants motion to suppress both the interceptions and all evidence derived therefrom.united states amanuel,d.in granting the defendants motion,the district court held as an initial matter that in federal court,the use of state wiretap warrants is controlled by federal rather than state law.in applying federal law,the district court ruled that handwritten logs can not qualify as sealed in compliance with a.id.at.the district court further held that the wholesale disregard of the recording requirement amounted to a violation of constitutional magnitude under.c and,therefore,required suppression of all evidence derived from the march,warrant.id.at.
the court then considered the government motion for reconsideration based on the good faith exception.united states amanuel,wl,see generally illinois krull,holding that the exclusionary rule did not apply to a violation of the fourth amendment by police officers united states leon,same.it held that the exception did not apply because the government willful improper and wrong violation of the pager interception warrant left the government without clean hands.amanuel,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the government contends that although the district court correctly decided to apply federal rather than state law,the court erred in concluding that the failure properly to record and seal the intercepted electronic communications rose to the level of a constitutional violation.according to the government,because no constitutional violation occurred,that evidence can not be suppressed under c.in the alternative,the government argues that even if the evidence from the march pager interception warrant is suppressed,information obtained from the subsequent warrants is admissible under a good faith exception.appellees counter that the failure to record and seal the intercepted electronic communications rises to the level of a constitutional violation,and as such,the evidence must be suppressed.they further contend that the good faith exception can not be relied on to save the subsequent warrants in light of the investigators willful violation of the requirements of the initial pager interception warrant.
in addition to the arguments raised by the other appellees,amanuel contends that this court prior rulings require that where state law provides greater protection of privacy rights than does federal law,state law governs the use of warrants in federal court.because resolving this issue determines which law we will apply to analyze the issues in this case,we address this argument first.
in united states sotomayor,cir,this court noted in dicta that a federal court,in determining the admissibility of the fruits of warrants,need apply only those more stringent state statutory requirements or standards that are designed to protect an individual right of privacy.id.at.that conclusion,however,was later rejected by this court in united states miller,cir.in declining to apply state law to the use made of the wiretap warrant at issue in miller,we found that the interpretive dicta in sotomayor have never been applied to bar the introduction of wiretap evidence.id.at.accordingly,we agree with the district court determination that in this federal case,federal law governs the use of a eavesdropping warrant.
in reviewing a district court ruling on a motion to suppress,this court reviews the district courts conclusions of law de novo.united states gotti,cir.
federal recording and sealing requirements 
pager eavesdropping warrants are controlled by title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,which was amended by title i of the electronic communications privacy act of the ecpa to extend title iii coverage to electronic communications.the procedures for lawful interception of electronic communications are codified at,which requires that 
t he contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall,if possible,be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device.the recording of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication under this subsection shall be done in such a way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations.immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order,or extensions thereof,such recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.custody of the recordings shall be wherever the judge orders.they shall not be destroyed except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge and in any event shall be kept for ten years.duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure pursuant to the provisions of subsections and of section of this chapter for investigations.the presence of the seal provided for by this subsection,or a satisfactory explanation for the absence thereof,shall be a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication or evidence derived therefrom under subsection of section.
a.although the statute permits recordings on tape or wire or other comparable device,it also states that regardless of the means of recording,it shall be conducted in a way that safeguards the recorded communications from editing or alterations.id.
we have not yet considered whether the method of recording at issue in this handwritten transcription in a log the recording requirement of a.the fourth and the ninth circuits,however,have determined that it does not.see united states suarez,cir t ranscribing by hand in a log book the images appearing on a display pager is not recording on a comparable device within the meaning of a.united states hermanek,cir citing suarez and holding the same.in suarez,the fourth circuit explained that the reliability of intercepted electronic communications is guaranteed in two ways mechanical recordation as received and relatively prompt sealing.suarez,at.the mechanical means of recording required by the statute minimize human involvement and limit the opportunity for intentional alteration and human error.hermanek,at.these protections,inherent in mechanical recordings,safeguard the integrity of the records and can not be replaced by handwritten logs.based on that same rationale,we join the fourth and ninth circuits in holding that the handwritten transcription in a log book of images appearing on a display pager is not sufficient to meet the recording requirement of a.
having determined that handwritten transcription fails to meet the recording requirement set out in a,we must now consider whether it was possible for the state police to have utilized a proper recording method.as noted earlier,the state conceded that a pager recorder,which would have satisfied the requirements of a,was available in albany,new few hours away from monroe county by car.additionally,as noted above,the state offered no explanation for why the investigators had not used the albany pager recorder.in light of the fact that the investigators could have obtained a proper recording device and have supplied no reason why it was not used,we conclude that it was,indeed,possible to record the interceptions on tape or wire or other comparable device as required by a,and the investigators failure to do so can not be excused.
in reviewing the requirements of a,we are left to assess whether,after failing to meet the recording requirement of the statute,the investigators met the statute sealing requirement,in light of the fact that they submitted their handwritten notes to judge keenan for sealing on may.here,we note that a requires that interceptions shall,if possible,be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order,or extensions thereof,such recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.a emphasis added.based upon the plain language of the statute,records that do not comply with the recording requirements of the statute are not susceptible to sealing.in other words,a determination that handwritten transcriptions do not meet the recording requirement requires the further conclusion that the sealing contemplated by the statute simply was not possible.see hermanek,at section a requires recordation,where possible,and requires sealing only of such recordings the handwritten logs were not recordings thus,sealing was not required.
our reading of the statute is informed by the very purpose of the sealing requirement of a.as the supreme court stated in united states ojeda rios,the seal is a means of ensuring that subsequent to its placement on a tape,the government has no opportunity to tamper with,alter,or edit the conversations that have been recorded.a seal is,in essence,a verification of the integrity of the underlying recordings once those recordings have been submitted to a judge.because it is already possible that handwritten documents lack integrity because of errors introduced in transcription,or because of intentional alteration,the sealing of such documents is of little purpose.as the fourth circuit stated in suarez 
section a whole premise is that the evidentiary reliability of particular electronic communications can be ensured by two means their mechanical recordation as received,which ensures their original integrity followed by the relatively prompt sealing of the mechanical recordation.in this way,the opportunity for human alterations is completely avoided at the point of interception and minimized thereafter.that premise,hence the statute intended application,is completely undercut where simultaneous mechanical recordation is impossible,and human alteration made possible in the very act of manual recordation.the complete futility of any sealing requirement is the best indication that the statute imposes none.
suarez,at emphasis added.accordingly,if handwritten documents do not meet the recording requirement of a,they simply can not be sealed in accordance with the statute sealing requirement.
ii.limitations on suppression of electronic communications 
having determined that the telephone numbers obtained from the interception of the pager have been preserved in a way that does not meet federal requirements,we next consider whether suppression of that evidence and the evidence subsequently obtained from the search warrants that relied in part on that evidence is the appropriate remedy for such a violation.
we note that although the ecpa extends many of title iii regulations and protections to electronic communications,electronic communications are not covered by title iii general statutory suppression remedy.see a.indeed,c specifically provides that t he remedies and sanctions described in this chapter with respect to the interception of electronic communications are the only judicial remedies and sanctions for nonconstitutional violations of this chapter involving such communications.as noted in the legislative history of the ecpa,congress sought to limit suppression of electronic communications to those instances in which the fourth amendment has been violated,except where the statute provides an exclusionary remedy in specific circumsta
