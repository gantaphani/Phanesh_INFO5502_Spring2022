opinion of the court 
years after the murder of nicoletta caserta,the case of henry fahy returns to this court,and possibly not for the last time.the commonwealth of pennsylvania commonwealth appeals from the order of the district court granting fahy petition for writ of habeas corpus,which vacated his death sentence.fahy from the district court denial of his guilt phase claims.today,we vacate the judgment of the district court to the extent that the writ was granted on the basis of mills maryland,d and we remand the matter to the district court to consider issues which that court did not address at the time it granted habeas relief.we affirm the district court determination that the guilt phase claims do not warrant habeas relief.
the factual background and procedural history that follow are lengthy and complex.
the body of nicky caserta was found by her stepfather on the late afternoon of january.the was found sprawled across the floor of her basement with a and an electrical cord wrapped tightly around her neck,multiple tears to the vagina and rectum,and eighteen stab wounds to the chest area.a medical examiner confirmed these findings and ruled her death a homicide.
on january,police interviewed fahy girlfriend,rosemarie kelleher,who lived across the street from nicky caserta and was also her aunt.fahy lived with kelleher.the interview of kelleher concerned an alleged sexual assault by fahy upon her old son.she called fahy and requested that he come down to the station for questioning.he arrived shortly thereafter.police then questioned fahy and advised him that they had two warrants for his arrest on charges of rape.he was subsequently placed under arrest.after his arrest,fahy was questioned regarding the rape and murder of nicky caserta.he ultimately gave the police a detailed confession and led them to the sewer where he had disposed of the knife used to kill her.fahy subsequently denied making statements to the police,but his motion to suppress those statements was denied.
on january,fahy was tried by a jury for the rape and murder of nicky caserta,with the honorable albert sabo,court of common pleas of philadelphia county,presiding.during the guilt phase of the proceeding,the jury heard evidence that led to guilty verdicts on all murder,rape,burglary,and possession of an instrument of crime.
the proceedings then entered the penalty phase.the prosecution,in seeking the death penalty,presented evidence intended to support three aggravating circumstances under pennsylvania death penalty statute the defendant committed a killing during the perpetration of a felony.d the defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person.d and the offense was committed by means of torture.d.the jury determined that all three aggravating circumstances were present.the defense presented evidence of four mitigating circumstances and the jury found that two were present the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.e and the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.e.the jury determined that fahy should receive a sentence of death,and on november,judge sabo formally imposed the death sentence for the murder conviction on direct appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court upheld the convictions and sentences.commonwealth fahy,fahy.
on march,fahy filed a pro se petition under the post conviction hearing act pcha.superseded and replaced by the post conviction relief act pcra in concerning his murder conviction as well as his conviction in an unrelated rape case pcra.as a result,the petition was procedurally defective.it was transferred to judge sabo,who dismissed it without prejudice to fahy right to refile separate petitions.fahy took no action for four years.
the governor issued a warrant of execution for fahy on november.judge sabo denied fahy application for a stay.on appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court granted a stay of execution and remanded to judge sabo pursuant to the pcra for a hearing to determine whether trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to object to a jury instruction regarding the aggravating circumstance of the killing of another committed by means of torture,which did not provide a definition of the term torture.judge sabo denied the pcra petition pcra and upheld the sentence of death.fahy appealed.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the denial of fahy petition on july.
on june,the governor issued a second death warrant.on july,the pennsylvania supreme court granted a stay of execution to allow fahy to file another pcra petition pcra this third pcra petition was filed on august,with a supplemental petition filed on september.judge sabo held an evidentiary hearing on the claims raised in pcra and thereafter denied the petition.fahy appealed to the pennsylvania supreme court.
while this appeal was pending,fahy filed a handwritten pro se motion on december,asking the pcra court to allow him to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings so that his death sentence could be carried out because the pennsylvania supreme court then had jurisdiction over pcra,judge sabo forwarded the letter to that court.on july,the supreme court remanded the appeal for a colloquy to determine whether petitioner fully understands the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings.pursuant to the remand,on august,judge sabo purported to conduct a hearing consistent with the direction from the supreme court.at that time,fahy told judge sabo that he desired an additional week to consider his request to waive all collateral proceedings.judge sabo granted fahy the extra time,and during that week fahy signed a sworn affidavit,prepared by his counsel,stating that he no longer wished to waive his appellate rights,that he wanted to proceed with his appeal,and that he desired continued representation by counsel.however,when fahy appeared before judge sabo on august,he stated that he had again changed his mind,that he did not want to be represented by his attorneys and that he did not want to pursue any further appeals.after asking fahy several questions,judge sabo declared,all right,fahy,i will inform the supreme court of pennsylvania that you were knowingly waiving all your appellate rights and all your pcra rights.
twelve days later,fahy attorneys advised the pennsylvania supreme court that fahy was again pursuing his appeal of the denial of pcra because the alleged waiver was involuntary.on september,the pennsylvania supreme court unanimously affirmed judge sabo determination that fahy had validly waived his right to all appellate and collateral proceedings.the court never reached the merits of his appeal from the denial of pcra.commonwealth fahy,fahy.
thereafter,on november,fahy filed a fourth pcra petition pcra.judge sabo dismissed the petition on two grounds failing to set forth a prima facie case that a miscarriage of justice had occurred and timeliness.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed judge sabo order dismissing pcra.commonwealth fahy,fahy 
fahy then filed a motion for a stay of execution,together with an amended habeas petition in the district court.on october,the district court stayed the execution for a period of days and determined that the amended petition should be treated as a first,and not a successive,habeas petition because the first application was dismissed without prejudice.judge giles,acting as emergency motions judge,determined that despite the statute of limitations under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the habeas petition was timely by virtue of both statutory and equitable tolling.see fahy horn,cir.he further stated that his decision would be subject to modification by district judge shapiro she later agreed that fahy amended habeas petition was properly filed.the commonwealth appealed.on appeal,this court rejected statutory tolling but affirmed the application of equitable tolling.id.at.the case then returned to the district court.
district court decision 
in light of the stay and the equitable tolling,fahy federal habeas case was assigned to judge shapiro.she found that fahy was competent when he waived his right to appellate and collateral review during the state court proceedings,but that the evidence established that fahy either was,or believed he was,improperly induced to waive his rights.she also concluded that fahy claims were not otherwise procedurally defaulted.upon reaching the merits,the district court ruled that fahy fourth claim,a mills claim,was meritorious,and she therefore vacated his death sentence.as a result,the district court did not reach the remainder of fahy claims alleging constitutional error in the sentencing phase of his trial the district court denied the petition in all other respects.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to and.we apply a plenary standard of review when a district court dismisses a habeas petition based on a review of the state court record without holding an evidentiary hearing.duncan morton,cir citing zilich reid,cir our review is also plenary as to a district court determinations regarding exhaustion,procedural default,and nonretroactivity.albrecht horn,cir.
fahy raised claims for relief in his amended habeas petition,four of which were later withdrawn.prior to reaching any of the claims on the merits,the district court addressed threshold,the validity of fahy state court waiver,and second,whether his claims were otherwise procedurally defaulted.
the commonwealth argued that fahy state court waiver prohibited consideration of the merits of his habeas claims because fahy had waived his rights to appellate and collateral review and was not free to change his mind at will.the commonwealth further argued that d required the district court to accord deference to the state court determination that fahy waiver was valid.fahy countered by arguing that he was coerced into waiving his rights and,as such,the waiver was invalid.
the district court acknowledged that aedpa heightened the level of deference accorded to state court determinations however,it found that d was inapplicable to the waiver issue.it recognized that d pertained to any claim by the habeas petitioner that was adjudicated on the merits d.following this court precedent,the district court defined the term claim in d as a substantive request for habeas relief.see cristin brennan,cir.the district court concluded that because the waiver issue did not entitle fahy to relief on the merits of his habeas petition,it was not required to accord deference to the state court conclusion under d.
we agree with the district court assessment that it need not defer under d to the state court determination that fahy waiver was valid.cristin instructs that a claim is that which,if granted,provides entitlement to relief on the merits.at.because resolution of the question as to whether fahy waiver was valid will not entitle him to relief on the merits of his habeas petition,the waiver question is not a claim.therefore,the state court determination that the waiver was valid is not entitled to deference under d.
the commonwealth additionally argued that the state court finding that fahy waiver was knowing and voluntary should be presumed correct under e because it was litigated,considered,and unequivocally rejected the district court considered whether the factual determinations made in the waiver proceeding were entitled to deference under e,which reads in relevant part 
in a proceeding instituted by an application for writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
id.the district court acknowledged that a federal habeas court must afford a state court factual findings a presumption of correctness and that the presumption applies to the factual determinations of state trial and appellate courts.see duncan morton,cir.however,it determined that deference could not be accorded to the finding that fahy waiver was knowing and voluntary.the district court identified that a valid waiver of relief requires that a court determine both that the petitioner has an ability to understand,competency,and that the petitioner understands and freely chooses to waive.see gilmore utah,d.the district court then found that a competency determination had not been made,and therefore no deference under e need be given to the state court finding of competency or finding that fahy waiver was knowing,intelligent and voluntary.
we disagree with the district court position that no competency determination was made.in this case,judge sabo explicitly concluded that fahy was competent.at the end of the waiver colloquy judge sabo stated i am making the decision he fully competent,he knows what he doing.here,the state court explicit factual finding that fahy was competent is presumed correct,unless fahy rebuts the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
the district court suggests that fahy rebutted this presumption because no real competency determination was undertaken.however,not every case calls for such a determination.see godinez moran,d.the supreme court has stated that a court is not required to make a competency determination in every case as in any criminal case,a competency determination is necessary only when a court has reason to doubt the defendant competence.id.here,the record reveals insufficient indicia of incompetency to compel the pcra court to hold a competency hearing and we are not aware of any requirement that mandates the pcra court to set forth the specific factual findings that give rise to a determination of is particularly true given our position on implicit factual findings.see taylor,at see also supra note.
in addition to our disagreement with the district court position that no competency determination was made,we believe godinez makes the district court reliance on the absence of a competency determination problematic.when the district court used the supposed absence of a competency determination as the standard for determining that the finding of knowing and voluntary waiver was not entitled to e deference,it erred.because the district court applied the wrong standard,this court exercises plenary review over what deference is to be accorded the state court voluntariness determination 
unlike the framework,the district court recognized that the current e read literally,eliminates the requirement that findings must be in writing,and drops federal standards relevant to the state court process and evidentiary record,including evidentiary hearing requirements.our court has already acknowledged as much.in lambert blackwell,we noted that the habeas statute no longer explicitly conditions federal deference to state court factual findings on whether the state court held a hearing,cir.however,we have declined to conclude that state court procedures are entirely irrelevant in a federal court habeas review of state court determinations.id.as one commentator has noted 
bluntly stated,it appears that the federal habeas courts must accept state court findings at face questions asked.a change of that kind would be dramatic and not something that anyone would lightly read into the new law i read e to drop the specific procedural and substantive standards contained in the former d.but i do not read it to dispense with a federal court rudimentary responsibility to ensure that it is deciding a constitutional claim based on factual findings that were forged in a procedurally adequate way and were anchored in a sufficient evidentiary record.in this sense,e departs from prior law,but only to substitute general notions of procedural regularity and substantive accuracy for detailed statutory standards.
larry yackle,federal evidentiary hearings under the new habeas corpus statute,pub.int.we agree with this view.we have already held that the extent to which a state court afforded a defendant adequate procedural means to develop a factual record might be a consideration while applying deference under e.lambert,at.today we hold that when a state court waiver colloquy fails to reveal whether the requirements of a valid waiver have been met due to procedural infirmities,substantive deficiencies,and an insufficient probing into a defendant knowledge of the rights he is waiving,the findings by that court concerning the waiver are too unreliable to be considered factual determinations.they are not,therefore,entitled to the presumption of correctness 
while it is not difficult to discern the factual determinations made by judge sabo,we find the circumstances surrounding these determinations problematic.fahy waiver of his collateral and appellate rights resulted from a colloquy that was procedurally infirm.judge sabo did not allow fahy counsel to develop a factual record and the manner in which he conducted the proceedings constructively denied fahy the assistance of his counsel importantly,judge sabo refused to allow fahy counsel to ask questions of fahy about his own waiver,his own request in his letter to the court.as the exchange below demonstrates,judge sabo refused to allow fahy to explain why the conditions of his incarceration were coercive and were prompting his request to waive all appellate and collateral proceedings 
counsel for fahy explain the conditions of your incarceration right now 
counsel for government it is objected to,your honor.
the court come on,counselor.
counsel for fahy for the record,your honor,fahy 
the court that is not the purpose of what he is down here for.now cut this out.if you want to argue that,argue it to the supreme court.
counsel for fahy your honor,i have a list of other questions i am going to ask him.are you denying me the right to do that 
the court yes,i am.
counsel for fahy all right.may i make a proffer of those questions 
the court well,what 
counsel for fahy i want to talk about the conditions of his incarceration,your honor.
the court what that got to do with this the supreme court did send him down here for me to find out what the conditions are.
counsel for fahy the conditions of his incarceration are what is causing him to make this decision.
the court maybe it is,i do know,but he is making the decision on his own.
counsel for fahy i think if you would allow me to ask the questions that he would answer that the conditions of his incarceration cause him 
counsel for government i would object to that.
counsel for fahy and if i may,your honor as to that purpose,the conditions 
the court counselor.
counsel for fahy two sentences,judge,so you could listen to me for just a moment.
the court i do want to remove you from the case.i do know why i let you in.
counsel for fahy all we are asking is a chance to either ask fahy the question or make a proffer.
the court okay,you made the proffer.i am not concerned about the conditions at greene.
counsel for fahy but the conditions in greene are causing psychological hardship and have created this problem.
the court argue that to the supreme court and if the supreme court wants me to go into these psychological things,fine.but they did send it down for that purpose.
counsel for fahy but,your honor 
the court for one purpose only they sent it down and that is all i am interested in.
counsel for fahy all i am saying,your honor,if the conditions of incarceration cause psychological problems,your honor should hear about it.
the court look,i know what greene county is like.it is a institution,state institution.
counsel for fahy natali asked fahy the conditions of his incarceration.he fell apart and started crying on the stand.it is causing psychological hardship.
counsel for fahy and,your honor,just so we are clear we ask for permission to either ask the questions or make a proffer.
the court and i said you will take it up with the supreme court.
counsel for fahy okay.and just so it is clear your honor is denying both of those requests is that correct 
the court i am denying anything.
in analyzing a defendant waiver of constitutional rights,the united states supreme court has said that the purpose of the knowing and voluntary inquiry is to determine whether the defendant actually does understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.godinez,at.second emphasis added.here,we are loathe to accord a presumption of correctness to a determination of voluntariness where the judge explicitly refused to consider any evidence of coercion.
in addition,the colloquy failed to adequately probe into fahy knowledge of the rights that judge sabo asserted he was waiving.this omission is especially egregious given that fahy told the court he had not spoken about federal appeals with his attorneys and judge sabo blatantly disregarded his counsel objections to the questioning.
the court are you telling me that you wish to withdraw your appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court and to the federal courts 
fahy yes,i am.
counsel for fahy there is no federal court proceeding,your honor.
the court well,he could have that opportunity,counselor.
counsel for fahy well.
the court and that what he is giving up.
counsel for fahy well,i would object to that.
the court i do care if you object.
counsel for fahy may i state 
the court you are not here to or anything.this is between fahy and myself,who was sent down for me to decide.
counsel for fahy yes,to 
the court to let him know what he is giving up.he knows he is giving up his rights in both the state courts and the federal courts.and that the net result will be that he would be executed.he knows that.
counsel for fahy all i am asking for,your honor,is permission to state my objection.
the court to say what 
counsel for fahy to state my objection,the grounds for the objection.
the court i do care what your objections are 
counsel for fahy the only thing i am requesting,your honor,is permission to state my objection.if your honor thinks 
the court well,you could state it to the supreme court if you wish.
counsel for government and by waiving your right to further appeals do you understand all those courts i told you about will not review your case 
fahy yes,i am aware of it.
counsel for government and you have discussed this case and all of these issues with all the attorneys that represent you 
fahy no,i have not.
counsel you have discussed it with,you have discussed the issues with some of your attorneys 
fahy no,i have not.i am aware of it my own self.i mean they have,we have spoken simply about this period of time we are in,we have spoken about federal courts and so on and so on and other appeals.we have simply spoken about this recent area we are in,this first stage.
based on this inadequate colloquy,we are not prepared to say that fahy knowingly waived his federal habeas rights.indeed,in the context of,for example,the waiver of miranda rights,the supreme court has required that the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.moran burbine,d.while the colloquy does reveal that fahy may have understood that the decision to waive his federal habeas rights could ultimately lead to his execution,it does not reveal that he had any knowledge whatsoever of the purpose of federal habeas corpus or its procedures.in a capital case,where the consequences are so grave,we are particularly wary of accepting a waiver of federal habeas rights when we are not convinced that the defendant was aware of the nature and scope of those rights.
fahy equivocation as to whether to waive all appellate and collateral proceedings further compels our conclusion that the waiver was neither knowing nor voluntary.on december,fahy filed a handwritten pro se motion to the pcra court requesting permission to waive all collateral proceedings and to withdraw his appeal that was currently pending before the pennsylvania supreme court.on july,the pennsylvania supreme court remanded for a colloquy to determine whether petitioner fully understands the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings.pursuant to this instruction,fahy went before the pcra court for a waiver colloquy on august.at that time,he stated that he desired an additional week to consider his request.during that week,fahy signed a sworn affidavit stating that he no longer wished to waive his appellate rights,that he wanted to proceed with his appeal,and that he desired continued representation by counsel.however,two days after signing this affidavit,fahy again appeared before the pcra court and stated that he had again changed his mind and desired once more to waive his appeals.it was at this time that the waiver colloquy was hastily and peremptorily conducted and that judge sabo determined that fahy had validly waived his rights.
we are in full agreement with the commonwealth that if a defendant who has participated in a waiver proceeding is then allowed,without exception,to change his mind whenever he chooses,the doctrine of waiver will be rendered purposeless.moreover,such an indulgence would be bad judicial policy resulting in frequent hearings and the expenditure of untold judicial resources.it is the rule in this circuit that we will not review the merits of a defendant appeal if we conclude that she knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to appeal unless the result would work a miscarriage of justice.united states shedrick,cir citations omitted.accordingly,if we were to conclude that fahy knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal to this court,we would not allow him to change his mind unless the result would work a miscarriage of justice.here,however,we have concluded that fahy purported waiver was not knowing and voluntary.what we have before us is a record of equivocation.it does not support an enforceable waiver,which would deny fahy federal review of his claims,including his sentence to death.see united states khattak,cir endorsing consideration of multiple factors in deciding whether to relieve the defendant of an otherwise valid waiver,including the impact of the error on the defendant.
thus,we conclude that fahy state court waiver was invalid and is not a procedural obstacle to the exercise of our jurisdiction over his habeas petition.
procedural default 
the commonwealth also argues that we are precluded from reviewing the merits of fahy habeas petition because his claims are procedurally defaulted.we reject this argument.
the doctrine of procedural default prohibits federal courts from reviewing a state court decision involving a federal question if the state court decision is based on a rule of state law that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.nara frank,cir citations omitted.procedural default occurs when a state court declined to address a prisoner federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.coleman thompson,d.for a federal habeas claim to be barred by procedural default,however,the state rule must have been announced prior to its application in the petitioner case and must have been firmly established and regularly followed.ford georgia,d.this court has declared why this requirement is important 
first,the test ensures that federal review is not barred unless a habeas petitioner had fair notice of the need to follow the state procedural rule.as we said in cabrera barbo,a petitioner should be on notice of how to present his claims in the state courts if his failure to present them is to bar him from advancing them in a federal court.
second,the firmly established and regularly followed test prevents discrimination.novelty in procedural requirements can be used as a means of defeating claims that are disfavored on the merits.if inconsistently applied procedural rules sufficed as adequate grounds of decision,they could provide a convenient pretext for state courts to scuttle federal claims without federal review.the requirement of regular application ensures that review is foreclosed by what may honestly be called rules directions of general than by whim or prejudice against a claim or claimant.
bronshtein horn,cir internal citations omitted.consequently,whether the rule was firmly established and regularly followed is determined as of the date the default occurred,not the date the state court relied on it,because a petitioner is entitled to notice of how to present a claim in state court.taylor,at internal citations omitted.
as the district court succinctly summarized,the commonwealth argument is that all of the claims asserted in fahy pcra are procedurally defaulted because they were raised and waived and never exhausted and those in pcra were raised out of time under the pcra.essentially,the commonwealth argues that default by waiver and the pcra are adequate state grounds to prohibit federal habeas review.we disagree and adopt the district court conclusion that neither default by waiver nor the pcra was firmly established or regularly followed rules as of the date fahy default occurred.they can not,therefore,be considered adequate state procedural rules barring consideration of fahy claims.
first,the commonwealth argues that fahy waived the claims raised in pcra when he withdrew his appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court.we have already concluded that the waiver was not effective and does not bar our review of his claims.even if this were not the case,at the time of fahy august waiver,the supreme court of pennsylvania applied the relaxed waiver doctrine to reach the merits of claims brought by capital defendants that would otherwise be barred by waiver.this rule was in recognition of the fact that the imposition of the death penalty is irrevocable in its finality.commonwealth zettlemoyer.although the pennsylvania supreme court later abrogated the doctrine of relaxed waiver,see commonwealth albrecht,explicitly abandoning the practice of relaxed waiver in pcra appeals,at the time of fahy purported waiver the court practice was to address all issues arising in a death penalty case even if the issue had been waived.thus,in,default by waiver was not a rule that was firmly established and regularly followed.it can not be a ground for procedural default.
fahy counsel filed pcra in november of.the state court dismissed this petition as untimely pursuant to pennsylvania pcra statute of limitations.ann.b thus,the commonwealth argues that fahy claims raised in pcra are procedurally defaulted because they are.
this court has held that b was not firmly established or regularly applied until november,at the earliest,when the supreme court of pennsylvania decided albrecht.see bronshtein,at recognizing that petitioner,whose second pcra petition was untimely under b,had not defaulted federal review because pennsylvania previously applied a relaxed waiver rule,under which a claim of constitutional error in a capital case would not be waived by a failure to preserve it.thus,the district court was correct in determining that fahy claims raised for the first time in pcra are not barred by procedural default.see taylor,at.
because there are no procedural barriers to our exercise of jurisdiction,we proceed to the merits of fahy habeas petition.
there are six claims presented to this court for review.our standard of review over each claim varies depending on how that claim was disposed of in the pennsylvania courts.some of the claims were addressed on direct appeal in the state system,some were adjudicated on the merits by judge sabo following fahy third pcra petition,and others were raised for the first time in fahy fourth pcra petition that was 
failure to preserve voir dire transcripts as violative of due process 
fahy argues that the failure to prepare preserve the transcripts of his voir dire proceedings violated his rights to due process and a meaningful appeal because he was not afforded a fair and meaningful opportunity to raise jury selection errors.he raised this claim in pcra,which was dismissed as untimely.because the pcra court never reached the merits of this claim,our review is de novo.
it is indisputably true that a criminal defendant has the right to an adequate review of his conviction,a sufficiently complete record.mayer city of chicago,d.however,as the district court aptly pointed out,neither the supreme court,nor our court,has held that due process requires a verbatim transcript of the entire proceedings or that an incomplete record confers automatic entitlement to relief this court has recognized a defendant request for a complete transcript only when the defendant has shown a colorable need for the transcript.karabin petsock,cir citing mayer,at.specifically,a criminal defendant must first show a colorable need for a complete transcript before the state must meet its burden of showing that something less will suffice.id.because fahy has not shown a colorable need for the voir dire transcript,we will deny relief on this claim.
with the exception of a batson claim fahy alleges no other specific instance of wrongdoing arising out of the voir dire tellingly,fahy does not even submit an affidavit from trial counsel,daniel greene,alleging the possibility that error occurred during the voir dire this court in karabin found the fact that the defendant had not shown that trial counsel w as unavailable to appellate counsel when and if needed relevant to the colorable claim inquiry.karabin,at holding that karabin had not shown a colorable need for the transcripts of opening and closing statements,and thereby rejecting his contention of a due process violation.
simply stated,fahy has not provided this court with any concrete claims of error occurring during the jury selection process that would justify a reconstruction of the record of that voir dire proceeding almost years later.
batson claim 
fahy alleges that the prosecution used its peremptory strikes to challenge jurors in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of the supreme court holding in batson kentucky,d.this claim was raised in pcra and is subject to de novo review.
in batson,the supreme court held that a defendant could make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the prosecution use of peremptory challenges by using proof adduced solely from his own case,as opposed to the systematic showing of exclusion required by swain alabama,d.batson further held that if the facts establish,prima facie,purposeful discrimination and the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation for his action,the petitioner conviction must be reversed.batson,at.citing whitus georgia,d hernandez texas.patton mississippi.establishing a prima facie case explicitly required the defendant to show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group,and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant race.batson,at.internal citation omitted emphasis added.
in,the supreme court decided powers ohio and held that a defendant race is irrelevant to his standing to object to the prosecutor racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges,d.
there is no question that batson would apply to fahy was decided in april of and fahy case did not become final until january of.however,fahy is white and he is objecting to the exclusion of from his jury.because powers was decided in,we must decide whether we can apply it retroactively to fahy claim.the answer to this question lies in the resolution of whether powers is a new rule.
we will not apply a new rule to cases on collateral review unless it falls within one of the exceptions set forth in teague lane,d fahy does not argue that powers falls within one of the two teague exceptions rather,he argues that the holding in powers is not a new rule and thus,there is no barrier to it being applied to his case on collateral review.
in teague,the court explained that a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the states or the federal government a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.at.the supreme court has indicated that if the outcome is susceptible to debate among reasonable minds,a new rule has been announced.see butler mckellar,d.the court reiterated this principle in williams taylor when it explained that a rule is not dictated by precedent unless it would be apparent to all reasonable jurists,d quoting lambrix singletary,d.the new rule principle,then,lends itself to validating reasonable,interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions.id.united states leon,d deciding not to apply the exclusionary rule when officers acted in the objectively reasonable belief that their conduct did not violate the fourth amendment,even if it was later determined that their actions did violate the fourth amendment.
fahy argues that the rule in powers is not a new rule because it was dictated by batson and the supreme court jurisprudence on standing.he argues that,at the time his conviction became final,any state court not extending batson to a white defendant challenging the exclusion of jurors would have been objectively unreasonabl e.see netherland,d.we reject this argument.batson explicitly required,as part of the prima facie showing,that the defendant be of the same race as the excluded juror.clearly then,it was not objectively unreasonable for a court prior to powers to refuse to extend batson to a white defendant challenging the exclusion of jurors.tellingly,four courts of batson was decided but before that the defendant and the excluded juror be of the same race in order to assert a batson claim.united states,cir united states angiulo,cir united states townsley,cir en banc united states vaccaro,cir.
we recognize that the powers court cited batson to support its holding.specifically,it noted that batson was not limited to the harm caused to the defendant when members of his own race were excluded from the jury.powers,at.citing batson,at.rather,batson was designed to serve multiple ends,only one of which was to protect individual defendants from discrimination in the selection of jurors.batson recognized that a prosecutor discriminatory use of peremptory challenges harms the excluded jurors and the community at large.id.citing batson,at.internal citations omitted.
we do not dispute that batson arguably presages powers.however,even assuming that to be true,it does not follow that the rule in powers was dictated by the rule in batson,such that the outcome in powers was not susceptible to debate among reasonable minds.indeed,the dissent in powers itself makes clear the extent to which just such a debate was taking place at the time.
the powers dissent characterized the majority opinion as a clear departure from prior law.id.at.two justices dissented from the powers decision because they believed that batson challenges should proceed only when there is racial identity between the defendant and the excluded jurors.id.at.scalia,dissenting,joined by rehnquist,b oth before and after batson,and right down to the release of today opinion,our jurisprudence contained neither a case holding,nor even a dictum suggesting,that a defendant could raise an challenge based upon the exclusion of a juror of another race and our opinions contained a vast body of clear statement to the contrary.additionally,after powers,five courts of appeals addressed whether powers applies retroactively and each has held that it does not.echlin lecureux,cir we agree that powers announced a new rule insofar as it extended batson to cover challenges by a white defendant to the prosecutor exclusion of black jurors.holland mcginnis,cir jones gomez,cir nguyen reynolds,cir farrell davis,cir.
accordingly,we are persuaded that batson did not dictate the result in powers.therefore,fahy batson claim fails because powers was a new rule decided after judgment was final in his case.
confession claim 
fahy alleges that his confession was involuntary and the product of an unconstitutional waiver.accordingly,he contends that its admission at trial violated his rights under the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution fahy further argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly present evidence of his mental health problems to the suppression court to show the involuntary nature of his confession.
involuntary confession 
fahy raised the issue of the voluntariness of his confession on direct appeal from his conviction and capital sentence the suppression court found,and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed,that the evidence supported the finding that fahy confession had been voluntary and that fahy had knowingly and intelligently waived his miranda rights.fahy,at our review of the conflicting testimony illustrates that appellant,in fact,was informed of the charges against him,advised of the nature of the questioning,and cognizant of his constitutional rights.because this claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court,it is entitled to deference under aedpa in order for fahy to succeed on the merits of his confession claim,he must demonstrate,and this court must accept,that the state court determination was contrary to clearly established federal law or reflected an unreasonable application of that law.d.in doing so,the appropriate focus of habeas corpus review is the suppression hearing conducted in the state trial court and the findings of fact made by the court before denying the motion to suppress.schmidt hewitt,cir.
our first task is to identify the relevant federal law,as determined by the supreme court.for purposes of d,clearly established law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of th e court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d.we must identify the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision.lockyer andrade,d.
miranda itself held that t he defendant may waive effectuation of the rights conveyed in the warnings provided the waiver is made voluntarily,knowingly and intelligently.miranda arizona,d.the inquiry has two distinct dimensions 
first,the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.second,the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.only if the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the miranda rights have been waived.
moran burbine,d.the ultimate question in the voluntariness calculus is whether,under the totality of the circumstances,the challenged confession was obtained in a manner compatible with the requirements of the constitution.miller fenton,d.
consistent with schmidt instruction,we look to the suppression hearing and that court findings of fact to determine whether the pennsylvania supreme court adjudication of the confession claim was contrary to this applicable federal law or reflected an unreasonable application of the law.
after reviewing the transcript of the suppression hearing and that court findings of fact we are satisfied that they are accurately reflected in the pennsylvania supreme court analysis of the confession claim.the pennsylvania supreme court discussion of the confession is as follows 
when faced with conflicting testimony,a suppression court,as factfinder,may pass upon credibility,and these findings will not be disturbed when supported by the record.commonwealth guest,commonwealth firth.the record reveals and the suppression court found that the evidence introduced by the prosecution was more credible than that of appellant,and,therefore,the court refused to grant the motion to suppress.
at the suppression hearing,detectives chitwood and rosenstein testified to the events surrounding the arrest and subsequent confession.their testimony established that appellant voluntarily appeared at the philadelphia police sex crimes unit and was taken to the police administration building for questioning regarding two warrants for rape.detective chitwood proceeded to inform appellant that he was the prime suspect in the rape and murder of nicky caserta.the detective advised appellant of his constitutional rights by placing a standard police form containing the miranda rights in front of him and at the same time reading the warnings to him aloud.appellant indicated his decision to waive his rights by initialing a standard police form containing both the warnings and questions regarding his understanding of his rights.at first,appellant denied his involvement in the caserta killing.however,after being shown pictures of the victim body,appellant exclaimed,i did it,i did it.appellant then confessed to the crimes,giving a detailed description of how he raped and killed young nicky caserta.appellant also gave the exact location of where he disposed of the murder weapon and later guided the police officers to the sewer where the knife was hidden.
after reading the statement,appellant affixed his signature to each individual page of the ten page document.detective chitwood testified that during the interview and confession appellant was alert and responsive.throughout the questioning,appellant was neither threatened nor coerced by the police,and denied being under the influence of drugs.the complete interview lasted approximately one and hours.
appellant testimony at the suppression hearing was totally contradicted by the testimony of the commonwealth witnesses.appellant claimed his confession was not voluntarily obtained.appellant also claims his confession was not properly extracted,in that during the police questioning he experienced fatigue and the effects of his seizure and depression medication.we stated in commonwealth jones,intoxication is a factor to be considered,but it is not sufficient,in and of itself to render a confession involuntary.the test is whether there was sufficient mental capacity for the defendant to know what he was saying and to have voluntarily intended to say it.commonwealth culberson.see also commonwealth manning,commonwealth smith.
the duty of the suppression court is to determine whether the commonwealth has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession was voluntary and that the waiver of constitutional rights was knowing and intelligent.jones,id.our responsibility on review is to determine whether the record supports the factual findings of the trial court and to determine the legitimacy of the inferences and legal conclusions drawn from those findings.commonwealth kichline,commonwealth goodwin.reviewing appellant arguments in light of the previously espoused standard,we are convinced the suppression court was correct in ruling that appellant statements were admissible.our review of the conflicting testimony illustrates that appellant,in fact,was informed of the charges against him,advised of the nature of the questioning,and cognizant of his constitutional rights.
on direct appeal,as the district court recognized,the supreme court of pennsylvania did not cite to any united states supreme court precedent or use totality of the circumstances language in reviewing the merits of fahy confession claim.instead,the supreme court of pennsylvania appropriately relied on its own state court cases,which articulated the proper standard 
because the state court applied the correct rule,fahy entitlement to relief depends on whether application of that rule was contrary to established federal law or an unreasonable application of that law.based on the principles already articulated,we conclude that the state court decision complies with the supreme court mandate to consider the totality of the circumstances and is therefore not contrary to the applicable body of supreme court law existing at the time.the decision was also not an unreasonable application of that precedent.the suppression court was entitled to make the credibility determination that it did in the face of conflicting testimony,and it applied the correct law to its findings of fact and came to a reasonable conclusion.on review,the supreme court of pennsylvania applied the proper standard and was reasonable in affirming the suppression court legal conclusions in light of the evidence presented and the applicable law.
ineffective assistance 
fahy argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mental health evidence in support of the motion to suppress his confession.we infer that fahy believes we should review this claim de novo,as he asserts there was no adjudication on the merits of this claim in state court.we disagree.fahy first raised this claim in pcra,and we agree with the district court that there was an adjudication on the merits by the pcra court in judge sabo october,findings of fact and conclusions of law opinion 
fahy argues that the ineffective assistance claim presented in pcra and on review in this habeas petition is distinct from the claim presented in pcra and decided upon by judge sabo.his actual claim,he alleges,is that effective counsel would have presented mental health evidence to support the contention that his confession was not voluntary,knowing and intelligent.this claim,he argues,is different from that which judge sabo effective counsel would have presented mental health evidence to support the claim that he was tricked into making the statement.
in the context of fahy testimony at the suppression hearing,we are convinced that this is a distinction without a difference.fahy testified that he never confessed to the murder of nicky caserta.his contention during the entirety of the suppression hearing was that at no point during the interrogation did he ever admit to having anything to do with her death.he testified that he never signed a confession and that he consistently denied all involvement to the detectives.we fail to see how mental health testimony during this hearing would have brought anything to bear on whether his confession was knowing,intelligent and voluntary.fahy does not contend that he was psychologically coerced into giving a confession,or that the detectives intimidated or tricked him into giving a confession,or even that he was unable to understand and comprehend the situation due to mental health deficiencies rather,he testified that he made no confession at all.
thus,we agree with the district court that there was an adjudication on the merits in state court when judge sabo held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to present expert psychiatric testimony.therefore,in order for fahy to succeed on this claim,he must convince this court that the state court determination was contrary to clearly established federal law,or reflected an unreasonable application of that law.d.
in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance,fahy must show that the state court decision is either contrary to,or involves an unreasonable application of,the standard set forth in strickland washington,d.thus,to prevail,fahy must show that his counsel failed to perform adequately and that actual prejudice occurred as a result.strickland,at.the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.alternatively,fahy must show that the state court applied strickland unreasonably to the facts of his case.
as previously stated,fahy testified at the suppression hearing and at trial that he did not give the police a detailed confession he argued that he signed blank forms.at no point does he contend that he would have given the completely contradictory testimony of admitting to making the confession if trial counsel had investigated and raised issues of his mental health with respect to the voluntariness of the confession.moreover,fahy admitted at the suppression hearing that he was aware of what was occurring at the time he was questioned.
even assuming that fahy counsel introduced mental health reports,we fail to see how the result would have been different.while fahy points to conclusions from psychiatric reports before and after trial,he does not explain how the conclusions in those reports would make him more susceptible to coercion,much less bear on his denial of making any confession at all.thus,trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to introduce such evidence.further,given the facts,we can only conclude that the state court trial counsel could not have advanced his claim with expert psychiatric testimony such that his failure to introduce such testimony did not constitute deficient reasonable.
finally,we agree with the district court that fahy has not presented evidence of a reasonable probability that,despite the strength of the other evidence including his admission at trial that he told the police,his mother,and his girlfriend that he had killed nicky caserta,the exclusion of the confession would have altered the results of the trial.see fahy horn,wl.fahy is not entitled to relief on this claim.
prosecutorial misconduct 
fahy asserts four instances of prosecutorial misconduct which he contends were so prejudicial as to entitle him to relief from his conviction.in evaluating such claims,we consider whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d citation omitted.the supreme court further instructs that,for due process to have been offended,the prosecutorial misconduct must be of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant right to a fair trial.greer miller,d citing united states bagley,d quoting united states agurs,d.see also ramseur beyer,cir holding that our review of a prosecutor conduct in a state trial in a federal habeas proceeding is limited to determining whether the prosecution conduct so infect ed the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.quoting greer,at.this determination requires us to distinguish between ordinary trial error and that sort of egregious misconduct which amounts to a denial of constitutional due process.ramseur,at quoting united states ex rel.perry mulligan,cir.because we are satisfied that the prosecutor comments,considered both individually and cumulatively,did not amount to a denial of due process,we reject fahy claim of prosecutorial misconduct.
the prosecutor comment about incest 
fahy alleges that the prosecutor suggested in her closing argument that he had an incestuous relationship with nicky caserta.fahy raised this claim as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in pcra and it was rejected.the district court was correct in concluding that the claim was adjudicated on the merits and entitled to d deference.
fahy contends that his case had nothing to do with incest and that the prosecutor comments were simply an attempt to inflame the passions of the jury.the pcra court concluded that the prosecutor did not suggest that fahy himself committed incest but was instead responding to the defense argument that fahy could not have raped and murdered the victim because he loved her.according to the pcra court,trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to assert a baseless objection.we agree with the district court conclusion that this decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of united states supreme court precedent.again,the pcra court did not cite to supreme court precedent however,it appropriately relied on its own state court cases,which articulate the proper standard 
a significant part of fahy defense strategy was to persuade the jury that he had a close,loving relationship with nicky caserta,and therefore,could not have killed her.in her closing argument,the prosecutor noted that the only witness who testified to a close relationship between fahy and his victim was fahy himself.the prosecutor argued that 
n ot one other person that took that stand,except the defendant,ever said that nicky used to come over and kiss the defendant.was that part of their little scenario to have you believe that they were so close and loving and ladies and gentlemen,even if they were close,which the evidence would not indicate,it would simply indicate that she knew him because he was her aunt boyfriend.she saw him because he lived with her aunt when she went to visit her young cousin.but,ladies and gentlemen,you heard of incest.and incest occurs even when it your natural child,unfortunately,in this society and other societies.in this case,it not a natural relationship,it was not a blood relationship.so the fact that she knew the defendant is only one more little piece of the puzzle.
the prosecutor argument was simply this if sexual abuse can occur in a blood relationship,then a fortiori,it can occur in a relationship,albeit a loving one.this argument was proper and logical when responding to the defense argument that fahy could not have raped and murdered nicky caserta because he loved her.therefore,such a comment did not render fahy trial fundamentally unfair,and the state court decision that fahy right to due process had not been violated was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
prior incarceration comment 
the second allegation is that the prosecutor intentionally and improperly elicited testimony of a prior incarceration from fahy.on direct appeal,the supreme court of pennsylvania noted that fahy answer was unsolicited and promptly stricken.fahy,at.it further observed that the answer did not indicate that he was convicted of a crime or the nature of the crime,and the comment was not exploited later in the trial or during closing arguments.id.thus,the court concluded that the single,unintentional reference did not inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury to the extent that appellant was denied a fair trial.id.the district court concluded that the state court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.we agree.
the questioning by the prosecutor proceeded as follows 
q.fahy,approximately how long did you live at east rush street 
for about two years.
and how often did you during that two year period did you live there 
very often.
for approximately how many months in the year of did you live there months 
yes.how many of the months in did you live there 
a.as far as i know,all of them.
q.you were never living anywhere else besides in 
not that i can remember no.
q.in,how many months did you live there 
there was a long extended pause.
i not sure.i think i was pause i think i could have been locked up for 
greene objection.
the court strike from the record the witness last answer to that question as not being responsive.fahy,would you please answer specific questions do volunteer,or go into 
the witness i trying to,your honor.
the court the question was,how many months and you can tell us how many months.now,you ca 
the witness well,i believe that me and cookie fahy got in a few arguments and i was away from the,for maybe about a day or two,at my mother or different places until cookie cooled down.but,i do believe i was ever away from the house in for any month at all.
fahy argues that the prosecutor knew or should have known that probing repeatedly into fahy whereabouts at the time in question would likely lead to his prior incarceration being revealed.in fact,that was the manifest purpose of the line of questioning.the record fails to support this argument.
as the district court pointed out,the question posed called for no more than a simple numerical answer.the prosecutor asked fahy directly how many months during he lived across the street from nicky caserta.as for any wrongful purpose behind the question,the prosecutor clarified at that fahy lied on direct examination when he said that he lived at the house across the street from the victim for two years,because for most of those years he was in and out of jail.it was permissible,therefore,for the prosecutor to ask a question designed to place the defendant credibility in question,and to undermine his contention that he had a close relationship with his victim.this claim provides no basis for a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.and assuming,arguendo,that there was improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor,the pennsylvania supreme court correctly identified that the applicable test is ultimately whether that conduct denied the defendant a fair trial.fahy,at.that court conclusion that fahy was not denied a fair trial is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of united states supreme court precedent.
representative of satan comment 
fahy alleges that the prosecutor improperly referred to fahy as a representative of satan.he raised this claim in pcra,which was dismissed as untimely without a review of the merits.we review this claim de novo.
in his closing argument,defense counsel suggested to the jury that whoever killed nicky caserta was some representative of lucifer or satan,a reprobate and a profligate.in response,the prosecutor used defense counsel own words to argue that the evidence demonstrated that fahy committed the killing,and thus,fahy was the representative of satan.specifically,at the start of her closing argument,the prosecutor stated 
and if there is a reprobate,profligate,and a representative of satan who committed this act,the evidence in this case indicates that the representative of satan in this case is seated right over there.indicating to the defendant.and,it is the defendant in this case because all of the evidence in this case so indicates.
fahy argues that the prosecutor response was unmistakably a religious argument,which asserted that fahy must be convicted and put to death because he was literally the devil.we disagree.
we do not condone the characterization of fahy as demonic,nor consider it a proper form of argument.however,the objectionable content was invited by or was responsive to the closing summation of the defense.see wainwright,at.the supreme court in united states young explained that the idea of invited response is used not to excuse improper comments,but to determine their effect on the trial as a whole,d.specifically,the supreme court has instructed that 
i nappropriate prosecutorial comments,standing alone,would not justify a reviewing court to reverse a criminal conviction obtained in an otherwise fair proceeding.instead the remarks must be examined within the context of the trial to determine whether the prosecutor behavior amounted to prejudicial error.in other words,the court must consider the probable effect the prosecutor response would have on the jury ability to judge the evidence fairly.in this context,defense counsel conduct,as well as the nature of the prosecutor response,is relevant.
young,at.citing lawn united states,d.
to put it another way,the fact that a prosecutor comment was invited may have a mitigating effect on the impact that comment might otherwise have on the jury.
here,it is not enough that the prosecutor comments were inadvisable or even objectionable.see id.rather,the appropriate standard of review for such a habeas claim is the narrow one of due process to determine whether the prosecutor comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.donnelly dechristoforo,d.
in light of defense counsel closing comments,which first introduced the notion of satan criminal responsibility into the proceedings,we are confident that the jury could not have believed that the prosecutor was arguing that fahy was literally the that the evidence indicated that he committed the murder,and thus was the representative of satan that defense counsel had initially referred to.thus,we reject fahy contention that this comment so tainted the trial that he was denied due process.
comments on fahy credibility 
fahy argues that the prosecutor repeatedly expressed her personal opinion that fahy had testified falsely.he raised this claim in pcra and it was rejected despite this,the district court concluded that there was no adjudication on the merits under chadwick janecka,cir,and therefore,it is not entitled to deference.we disagree with the district court and conclude that the state court decision is entitled to d deference.in chadwick,this court noted that the supreme court clearly held that the d standards apply when a state supreme court rejects a claim without giving any indication of how it reached its decision.id.citing weeks angelone,d affirming state supreme court rejection of a claim without explanation,concluding that the adjudication was neither contrary to,nor involved an unreasonable application of,any of its decisions at all events,we agree with the district court with regard to the merits of the claim.
the first allegedly improper statement occurred while the prosecutor was fahy 
q did you just say that you were seeing her 
a i was said i used to.i was seeing no one at the time.i was with cookie.i went with cookie for good,so if you want to try to get a few things into my mind and get them twisted,you know,it up to you.
q why do you just answer questions 
a i trying to answer the question as best i can.you want me to tell you what you want.
q all i want from you,fahy,is the truth,if you know what that is.
defense counsel objected to this last statement and asked for a mistrial.the trial court denied the request but instructed the jury to disregard the remark.defense counsel later objected to statements made during the prosecution closing argument.the prosecutor,in discussing fahy testimony and credibility,stated 
defense counsel said that there is a scenario that was presented.well,from the evidence in this case,the scenario that was the defendant version of what happened was a scenario.fahy would have you believe that he only talked to his lawyer about his testimony once or twice.is that believeable the way defense counsel prepared this case,that he only talked to his client once or twice 
fahy took the stand and went through an entire day,minute by minute,practically.he told you exactly where he placed battery cables and what he did.but,when it came to,he could remember the lies he told on direct examination.and all of a sudden,he gives a completely different answer from the morning to the afternoon session.he could remember which lies he was supposed to tell.
defense counsel objected to the use of the word lies and the trial court instructed the prosecutor to rephrase her statement.the prosecutor then pointed to a specific instance of fahy inconsistent testimony.
fahy argues that the prosecutor comments in the above instances were improper statements of her personal belief about his credibility and thereby prejudiced the jury.if a defendant testifies on his own behalf,as occurred here,a prosecutor may attack his credibility to the same extent as any other witness.see fitzpatrick united states.this does not mean,however,that a prosecutor may express his personal belief in the credibility of a witness or the guilt of a defendant.see,berger united states.when the claim is that a prosecutor remark at trial so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process,we must examine the comment in light of the entire proceedings.dechristoforo,at.we do not think that the state court decision here is an unreasonable application of this law.see supra note.
here,the prosecutor explained to the jury at the beginning of her closing argument that she could not give her personal opinion of fahy guilt.she then proceeded during her closing to point out the inconsistencies in fahy testimony.her comments on fahy preparation for his testimony served as a suggestion that the jury consider the detailed nature of his testimony in contrast to his claims that he had discussed it only once or twice with his counsel.the record supports this argument,in that fahy testimony regarding his whereabouts on the day of the murder was given in considerable detail.while the prosecutor conclusory use of the word lies was unfortunate,it did not infect the proceedings with unfairness.
fahy attempts to argue that while the record supported the assertion that he made inconsistent statements,it did not support an inference that both statements were lies.this is sophistry.either fahy signed his miranda warnings or he did not only one statement could be true.
because the prosecutor made it clear that she was not expressing her personal opinion but was relying on the facts in the case,we do not believe that her use of the word lies or her comment about fahy credibility made the resulting conviction a denial of due process.therefore,we reject fahy claim.
cumulative effect of prosecutorial comments 
fahy argues that cumulatively these comments had a substantial prejudicial effect on the defense.as noted above,the comments fahy recites were either not improper,or if they were improper,not prejudicial.taken together,their cumulative effect could not have deprived fahy of a fair trial.
all prior counsel rendered ineffective assistance 
in fashion,fahy asserts that,to the extent that prior trial and direct appeal counsel failed to properly investigate and failed to make certain objections at trial,as alleged throughout his brief,he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.he raised this issue for the first time in pcra,and we therefore review the claim de novo.
we must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance.berryman morton,cir citing strickland,at.that is to say,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland,at.quoting michel louisiana.indulging this presumption after reviewing each of counsel claims,we are satisfied that prior trial and direct appeal counsel here,the same counsel in both instances provided reasonable professional assistance.even assuming error by counsel,fahy has failed to show that any alleged deficient performance actually prejudiced his defense.berryman,at.that would require a showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial the result of which is reliable.id.fahy has failed to convince us that he was deprived of a fair trial,and we deny this claim.
cumulative effect of all errors 
fahy also argues that the cumulative effect of all of the errors at trial entitle him to relief.individual errors that do not entitle a petitioner to relief may do so when combined,if cumulatively the prejudice resulting from them undermined the fundamental fairness of his trial and denied him his constitutional right to due process.albrecht horn,cir.cumulative errors are not harmless if they had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,which means that a habeas petitioner is not entitled to relief based on cumulative errors unless he can establish actual prejudice.id.citing brecht abrahamson,d.
we have already concluded that the admission of fahy confession was not error,and that at least two out of the four challenged prosecutorial remarks were proper comment.however,even if we were to combine all of the prosecutor allegedly improper remarks with the admission of fahy detailed confession,there is still weighty evidence of fahy guilt in the record.the testimony of the commonwealth witnesses established that the person who killed nicky caserta entered the house between,when the child mother left,and when the child was supposed to meet a schoolmate.the door was locked,so it was unlikely the victim would have let anyone in the house whom she did not know.fahy had told a coworker at that he would pick him up in five minutes,but then arrived over an hour later looking pale.fahy later took a bath and washed his long underwear.fahy girlfriend testified that he confessed to her,and fahy himself testified that he confessed to the killing when speaking with his mother.the verdict was not,therefore,unreliable.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we will vacate the judgment of the district court entered on august,to the extent that the writ was granted on the mills issue.the matter will be remanded to the district court.on remand,the district court should apply teague in conjunction with beard and deny relief on the mills claim.the district court should consider whether trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to object to and litigate the mills violation.the court should consider the remaining issues,which it initially denied as moot.the court determination that the guilt phase issues do not warrant habeas relief will be affirmed.
in mills maryland,the supreme court announced that the constitution prohibits a state from requiring jurors to agree unanimously that a particular mitigating circumstance exists before they can consider that circumstance in their determination of whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment.mills,d.fahy alleged that the jury instructions at the penalty phase of his proceeding,as well as the verdict sheet,unconstitutionally led the jury to believe that they had to find any mitigating circumstance unanimously before they could give effect to that circumstance.fahy now concedes that in light of beard banks,d,which held that mills was not retroactively applicable on collateral review,he can not obtain relief under light of beard banks,this court will vacate the judgment of the district court to the extent that the writ was granted on the mills claim.
judge sabo imposed ten to twenty years for the rape conviction,ten to twenty years for the burglary conviction,and two and to five years for the weapons conviction.judge sabo ordered the burglary and rape convictions to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the murder conviction.the weapons conviction was to run consecutively to the burglary and rape convictions.
in the wake of the pennsylvania supreme court remand,fahy counsel,apparently mindful that all claims not raised in the first petition are waived,filed a motion on april,with the supreme court asking that it clarify its order to expressly encompass claims in addition to the torture issue.the court denied the motion.
fahy also requested that the district court stay his execution to permit him to file a habeas corpus petition.because the state court had already issued a stay of execution,district judge shapiro dismissed the habeas petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies.
on march,upon learning of fahy pro se motion,his counsel gelman and natali filed a motion for the pcra court to determine fahy competency to waive his rights.on october,the pcra court denied the motion.
the supreme court specifically declined to address the issues of whether fahy attorneys had authority to file the fourth pcra petition for collateral relief or whether fahy did withdraw,or even could withdraw,his waiver of collateral and appellate proceedings.the court assumed arguendo that fahy had renounced his waiver,but that he was still not entitled to relief because his petition was untimely.fahy,at.
both parties to this appeal agree that,if this court finds fahy waiver to be invalid and his claims not otherwise procedurally barred,this matter should be remanded to the district court to consider the remaining claims in light of our vacatur of relief on the mills claim.the remaining claims are as follows claim iii.ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing penalty phase of trial for a failure to develop and present mitigating evidence b failure to contemporaneously object or request an instruction in response to prosecutor suggestion that fahy was a serial pedophile c failure to contemporaneously object or request an instruction in response to prosecutor suggestion that fahy was involved in an incestuous relationship with the victim and,d discussion of the possibility of parole and failure to contemporaneously object or request an instruction in response to prosecutor arguments concerning fahy future dangerousness and his possibility of vii.prosecutorial misconduct during phase of the trial for a improperly interjecting unadjudicated criminal conduct b improperly arguing fahy future dangerousness to jury by asking,how many more people does he have to kill and,c improperly denigrating fahy mitigating viii.prosecutor comment no sentence is final until it appealed,diminished the jury sense of responsibility for imposing sentence in violation of fahy rights under caldwell mississippi,d.claim ix.jury was unconstitutionally instructed on the torture aggravating no definitive proof that the jury found the torture aggravating xi.the proportionality review performed by the supreme court of pennsylvania did not provide fahy meaningful appellate review as mandated by pennsylvania and federal xiii.trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on mitigating xiv.jury was not permitted to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence that was xv.trial court violated simmons south carolina,d,in failing to accurately instruct the sentencing jury that,if sentenced to life,fahy would be parole xvi.aggravating circumstance instruction d,significant history of felony convictions involving the use of or threat of violence to the person,is unconstitutionally horn,wl.
