on september,members of the montgomery county police department mcpd gang unit,including officer richard webster and officer casey doherty,set up surveillance of the area around montgomery blair high school bhs on university boulevard in silver spring,maryland.the gang unit chose to deploy near the school in response to a stabbing incident that had taken place the previous day in a giant food parking lot located approximately two miles from the high school.officer webster knew that the stabbing victim was a member of the vatos locos,a latino gang.additionally,witnesses told police that members of other latino gangs,including the little vatos locos lvl and the latin locos,had been present at the altercation.one witness to the incident came to the police station and reported that she had seen a leader of the latin locos waving a gun around.because bhs had a history of incidents and because some lvl and latin locos members were students at bhs,the mcpd gang unit decided to set up surveillance in the school vicinity the following day in the hope of forestalling any attempt at retaliation for the stabbing.
while stationed outside the school,the officers observed four hispanic youths standing under a tree across the street from the school.another group of three hispanic males and one hispanic female,later identified as,soon joined the group under the tree,arriving from the direction of the woodmoor neighborhood north of the high school.police observed that the males stood in a group around a young male with a red shirt and pony tail,who appeared to be conducting a discussion or meeting.occasionally,one of the males would turn to look toward the front of the school.
though stood somewhat apart from the rest of the group,one of the males soon went over and spoke to her,after which began walking back toward the woodmoor neighborhood from where she had recently come.officer casey doherty was directed to locate her and keep her in view.doherty located sitting under a tree,out of sight of the males.
just before the school day ended,officer webster called for uniformed officers in marked cars to make contact with the group of males.when the marked car arrived,the males split up,three walking toward bhs and three walking north toward woodmoor.the male in the red shirt took off at a dead sprint.consequently,officer webster decided to stop everyone in the group.the males were detained,frisked for weapons,and told to sit on the curb.
officer webster requested that officer doherty detain doherty approached her,showed his badge,and requested that she sit on the curb.she complied.officer doherty then escorted back to where the other officers had detained the males,advising officer webster that he had checked neither hernandezmendez person nor her purse.
officer webster asked for her name,which she provided.in response to officer webster asking whether she knew the male in the red shirt who had run off,replied that she did not know anybody.officer webster then asked for identification.in addition to her purse,was holding a wallet in her hand,from which she removed a credit card in the name of hernandez.officer webster requested further identification and asked to look in the wallet.handed officer webster the wallet,in which he found several other credit cards in the same name and a checkbook,but no photo identification.
officer webster then asked if she had photo identification in her purse.as he asked the question,he reached out to take possession of the purse simultaneously said no and pulled away.immediately upon touching the exterior of the purse,officer webster felt a solid,heavy object that he recognized to be the barrel of a semiautomatic pistol.at this point,officer webster retrieved and opened the purse and found a smith wesson semiautomatic pistol with unchambered ammunition.he then handcuffed and arrested and performed a full search of the purse,recovering her montgomery county public school photo id and her passport.
in a careful and thorough memorandum opinion issued after the evidentiary hearing followed by further briefing,the district court found that the police officers had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk and denied her motion to suppress the weapon seized from her purse.following a bench trial,the district court found guilty of possession of a firearm by an alien in violation of g a and guilty of possession of a firearm in a school zone in violation of q.this timely appeal followed.
for more than forty years,the law has sanctioned a brief,investigatory stop of a person where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot.terry ohio.an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch is not a permissible basis for a terry stop.id.at illinois wardlow.though the facts need not give rise to probable cause,the officer must be able to articulate an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.see,united states arvizu,united states mccoy,cir united states sprinkle,cir.
courts assess reasonable suspicion by examining the totality of the circumstances in order to determine whether officers had a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.united states cortez,see also arvizu,at sprinkle,at.the reasonable suspicion inquiry is,but individual facts and observations can not be evaluated in isolation from each other.see arvizu,at finding that,even if the individual facts of a case may be susceptible to innocent explanation,they may be considered collectively to warrant a terry stop.moreover,the supreme court has recognized that this inquiry allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.id.at quoting cortez,at.in light of this emphasis on officer experience,this court has stressed the importance of giving due weight to the factual inferences drawn by police officers as they investigate crime.mccoy,at internal citations omitted see also united states perkins,cir.
here,the parties agree that was seized when officer doherty asked her to sit on the curb at the direction of officer webster.officer webster relied on his knowledge of hispanic gangs in the area,his experience responding to incidents at bhs,and his observations during the surveillance to find reasonable suspicion to stop the group of eight young hispanic people gathered across from the school that afternoon.
contends that the objective facts known to the officers,which she does not dispute,are too tenuous to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.she attempts to distinguish this case from others where courts have upheld the reasonableness of a terry detention,relying on two primary arguments.first,she contends that here,unlike many of those cases in which courts have upheld the reasonableness of a terry stop,her detention did not take place in a area or among known criminals.her argument mistakenly relies on these factors,however,and fails to account for the broader context,which includes officer knowledge and experience.second,contends that reasonable suspicion was not sufficiently individualized with respect to her.this argument also fails in light of her actions connecting her to the group of males.
first,argues that there was not reasonable suspicion to support her detention because she neither associated with known criminals nor lingered in a area.though we have emphasized that neither of these factors is dispositive,in some cases,we have examined both as part of the totality of the circumstances.see,sprinkle,at finding that officer knowledge of prior criminal activity may be coupled with other factors to create reasonable suspicion united states lender,cir noting that an area propensity toward criminal activity may be considered as one factor united states moore,cir same.
presses us to compare the facts in her case with those in sprinkle,where the court found reasonable suspicion lacking when the defendant was stopped after huddling in a car with a known drug offender in a high area.at.argues that her actions were even less suspicious,as she was merely observed in the company of suspected gang members.moreover,she contends that the area around bhs had a crime rate below the national average in nearly every category she urges us to find significance in the weakness of these factors in her case.however,emphasis on these factors is misplaced instead,reasonable suspicion in this case is justified by the officer articulation of objective facts which provided information probative of a likelihood of criminal activity.moreover,he obtained much of the information through his own observations,which,when coupled with his accumulated experience and relevant background knowledge,formed the basis for a reasonable suspicion that was engaged in or was about to become engaged in criminal activity.
in mccoy,we credited an officer finding of reasonable suspicion based on his experience and familiarity with habits and patterns of local drug traffickers.at.in that case,the officer,who had years of experience on the vice narcotics unit,knew from experience that a large number of drug transactions in the county took place in grocery store parking lots and followed a fairly similar pattern.id.at.thus,he found it suspicious when he observed the defendant in a safeway parking lot,sitting in his car,then driving to a food lion parking lot,where he got into a truck cab.id.at.similarly,in cortez,the supreme court found it was reasonable for officers to infer that criminal activity might be afoot based on observations that demonstrated a particular pattern of operations.at by piecing together the information at their disposal,the officers tentatively concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that a vehicle would attempt to pick up a group of unlawful aliens on a particular night.
here,officer webster knew that several hispanic gangs were represented at bhs,had responded to a half dozen incidents at the school personally,and was aware that a stabbing incident involving some of the gangs active at bhs had taken place the night before.his concern that the previous night stabbing might result in retaliation near the school led him to set up a surveillance team the following afternoon.
the gathering of seven hispanic males and one hispanic female across the street from the high school,shortly before the end of the school day,the day following a stabbing,alerted him to the possibility that the group might be planning some sort of retaliatory action officer webster noted that,while some in the group looked to be,several looked to be older.the males,who were gathered around a male wearing a red shirt,appeared to be having a meeting or discussion,while occasionally looking toward the school entrance.
stood apart from the group of males and did not appear to participate in their discussion.after several minutes,however,officer webster observed that a male in a blue shirt went over and spoke to her,after which she began to walk back in the direction from which she had come.officer webster directed officer doherty to follow,who located her at rest part way up the block.officer webster ordered to be followed in part because of her connection with the males.in addition to his observations of,he was motivated by his knowledge that female gang members were often responsible for holding weapons or other contraband in order to minimize the potential for discovery by police,who were perceived to be more likely to frisk male gang members.the district court credited this expertise,noting that case,where the males were frisked far sooner than she was,supported the perception.
close to the end of the school day,officer webster called in marked police cars and uniformed officers to approach the group.on seeing the marked cars,the group of males split up,moving in several directions,with the male in the red shirt running off quickly and escaping detention.it was at this point that officer webster decided to stop everyone in the group and directed officer doherty to detain officer webster observations that afternoon,in addition to his knowledge of and experience in responding to gang incidents in the immediate area,provided reasonable suspicion that the group was involved in or was about to become involved in criminal activity,and he acted reasonably in drawing the inference that the group was planning to retaliate against rival gang members leaving bhs.in light of these reasonable inferences,arguments regarding the absence of known criminals and lack of criminal propensity of the area are not persuasive.
also argues that,even if we credit officer webster experience and knowledge,he lacked individualized suspicion with respect to her.in particular,she seems to contend that the government relies solely on the actions and behavior of the males in the group to justify stopping her.manifestly,this is not so.
urges us to find the facts here similar to those in united states patterson,cir.in that case,police stopped a group of males gathered near a street corner several hours after receiving an anonymous tip about drug activity on that corner.id.at.police had seen one of the group not patterson throw something in the bushes as police approached.id.police attempted to justify the stop of patterson in part on that act,but the court rejected that evidence as inapplicable to patterson.id.at in order to search patterson,the officers only could factor in patterson actions and the circumstances surrounding him alone in order to constitute reasonable suspicion.argues that here the police attempt to justify stopping her by relying on the acts of the males in the group and the evasive behavior of the male in the red shirt,in particular.reliance on the acts of others,argues,can not contribute to a finding of individualized suspicion.this argument misses the mark.
here,the course of the law enforcement investigation,coupled with the telling background knowledge of the police who were present at the scene,yielded factual information rising to the level of reasonable suspicion to detain all of the members of the group the seven males as well as.in light of this collective stop,the relevant question is whether the officers reasonably inferred that was potentially a knowing and willing participant in whatever incipient criminal activity the group of males gathered across from the school might have been contemplating.if such an inference was reasonable,then the police were justified in detaining her when they stopped the others.as the district court found,the facts which does not dispute suggest that she was such a likely participant.
along with three hispanic males,joined the group of four hispanic males gathered across the street from the school near the end of the school day.though she stood slightly apart from the rest of the group,she spoke briefly with one of the males with whom she had arrived.immediately following that conversation,walked back in the direction from which she had just come.notably,she did not leave the area rather,she stopped to sit under a tree further
