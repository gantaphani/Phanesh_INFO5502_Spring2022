richard castellini castellini,a married man with three children and no prior criminal record,was convicted of the crime of money laundering the proceeds of a bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to money launder.a,c d,h.in fact,the fraud was part of a sting operation by the government which ensnared at least six people.all were associated with anderson ark and associates aaa,a costa rican company which moved money offshore through trusts in several countries before returning the cleansed but diminished funds to investors.
at trial,castellini testified and portrayed himself as an innocent and naive dupe,not a criminal,who was misled by michael gonet gonet,the architect of the money laundering scheme and chief malefactor.in fact,castellini testified that he had been victimized by aaa and gonet,who fleeced him of his own money.it was gonet who introduced castellini to his troubled friend jim mitchell,and asked him to do two financial transactions for mitchell.unfortunately for castellini,mitchell was in fact james dowling dowling or agent dowling,an undercover agent in a sting operation mounted by the internal revenue service irs against gonet.
the two financial transactions castellini was asked to,and did in fact,engineer involved multiple offshore transfers of mitchell money mitchell told castellini the monies were being hidden from the bankruptcy court.
castellini was tried alone.gonet pled guilty but did not testify for the government.a properly instructed jury found that castellini had engaged in money laundering by conducting financial transactions involving property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,with the intent to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.a.
on appeal,castellini attacks his conviction and sentence first,he argues that the guilty verdicts on counts one for conspiracy to launder,five,and six for the two instances of actual laundering should be reversed for insufficiency of evidence.second,he argues that he is entitled to a new trial for errors in the admission of coconspirator statements not meeting the requirements of united states petrozziello,cir.
the insufficiency argument is premised on the correct principle that the proceeds used for money laundering must be proceeds from a different illegal activity than the illegal activity of money laundering itself.united states mankarious,cir.the argument is that the agent did not explicitly or implicitly represent that the money castellini laundered was the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity,but rather left castellini with the sense that at most he was helping in the commission of a bankruptcy fraud,not that he was laundering the money derived from an ongoing bankruptcy fraud.while skillfully presented,existing case law dooms the argument.the petrozziello arguments are also far from frivolous but they,too,do not prevail,because the statements were admissible on other grounds or their admission was harmless.
castellini was sentenced to months imprisonment he was not ordered to pay a fine.castellini attacks this sentence.he argues that the district court wrongly concluded that it did not have authority to consider granting him a downward departure for aberrant conduct.the record reflects that the district court knew it had the authority but did not think castellini qualified to receive the reduction given that more than one transaction was involved.we have no jurisdiction to review that determination.castellini also argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence violated blakely washington,d.we reject that challenge because there was no plain error.
we set out the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states glaum,cir.
this case involves one of two prosecutions of the leaders of and persons associated with aaa aaa is a costa rican company which was the central marketing instrumentality for money laundering schemes to move the proceeds of illegal activity out of the united states via entities such as offshore trusts and then to repatriate such funds back to the united states so as to make the proceeds appear to be from legitimate sources.the conspiracy involved individuals spanning the continent from california to massachusetts and from washington to costa rica.
in december of,after months of investigations,the criminal investigation division of the irs began a sting operation targeted at michael gonet,a massachusetts resident who had been promoting and marketing offshore trusts.gonet did not work for aaa but ended up leading the sting operation to the leaders of aaa.
agent dowling first contacted gonet by telephone on december.as jim mitchell,agent dowling told gonet a cover story that he ran a company named pyramid financial and owned three burger king restaurants in the phoenix,arizona area.he said he had been sued for sexual harassment and was at risk of being forced into personal and corporate bankruptcy.as a result,he said he wanted to conceal some of his assets,namely,in cash in a safe deposit box and in a corporate bank account,from the bankruptcy court.agent dowling asked gonet for help in concealing the funds from the bankruptcy court gonet responded affirmatively.dowling then asked,as a way to move the money,whether gonet,who had a company in the bahamas,could send dowling invoices and dowling could pay the invoices.gonet told dowling that this was possible.in a second phone call on december,gonet and agent dowling discussed in some detail how they might move the funds.gonet told dowling,i have a consulting company that i can bill it through,you know,however much you want me to bill it.
on january,gonet and agent dowling met in person for the first time.agent dowling gave gonet in cash,which he told gonet he wanted to conceal from the bankruptcy court.gonet moved the cash in installments to an offshore trust account and then back to an undercover bank account designated by dowling at lasalle bank in chicago in the name of century marketing.gonet kept as his fee for assisting dowling.castellini visibly entered the picture around march or.
castellini testified that he first met gonet in,when gonet tried to sell castellini an offshore trust.castellini explained to gonet that he already had the use of an offshore structure through a complex business organization cbo set up for him by aaa.castellini had been involved with aaa since,when he began to buy tapes and attend seminars offered by aaa purporting to teach strategies for minimizing taxes.in,as a way to reduce taxes from his own business,castellini paid to have the cbo set up for him by the head of aaa,anderson,and aaa head accountant,drummer,an unindicted coconspirator who also became castellini accountant.in late,in accordance with drummer advice,castellini moved about of his own money,listed as a bogus management fee,through the cbo in order to reduce his taxes.for this service,aaa charged him a fee.these were the only times that castellini used the cbo prior to his involvement in the activities in this case.castellini also invested in various schemes offered by aaa members,but he lost money on all of them.
castellini testified that gonet called him on either march or march,to ask him whether he still had his cbo and whether a third party would be allowed to use it.gonet also explained dowling situation to castellini.after castellini consulted drummer,he called gonet back on march,and told gonet that it was okay to use his cbo for somebody else money.
gonet and agent dowling spoke twice on march.gonet told dowling that he did not have the ability to move the money in the corporate bank account and he was concerned about the paper trail.gonet did suggest to dowling a way that the funds could be moved.he explained that he knew of a management company that could generate an invoice for management consult ing work.after dowling paid the invoice with a check drawn on his corporate bank account,the management company would take the funds,deposit them,and then move the funds offshore,and then ultimately back to wherever dowling want s them.gonet explained that the management company could move anything over and still raise no suspicion for the high amount charged on the invoice because it did this as a matter of business on a daily basis.gonet said that the management company,a nevada corporation connected with a huge offshore conglomerate,would charge a fee of of the funds moved in this way,and that gonet own fee would come out of that.gonet also assured dowling that there would be no problems if the bankruptcy court questioned the management company because they deal with this everyday.it not like they coming up with a new defense they do it all the time.
two days later,on march,gonet and dowling met in florida.during this meeting,which was videotaped,dowling gave gonet another in cash for gonet to move offshore and then back into the lasalle bank account as before.gonet also agreed to see if someone from the management company would speak with agent dowling directly about moving the funds in his corporate bank account.
on march,gonet called castellini,explained dowling situation in more detail,and asked castellini to help dowling move his money.gonet in turn told agent dowling to expect a call from someone in the management company which they had been discussing.
the next day,castellini called agent dowling and told him that gonet had explained his situation to him.castellini said that he could help agent dowling to retain control of and hide from the bankruptcy court the in the corporate bank account by using castellini management company,rlc management.rlc management is a nevada company which castellini controlled as part of his cbo.castellini suggested that agent dowling give rlc management checks drawn on pyramid financial corporate account rlc management would then move the funds through its majority shareholder,a domestic trust,offshore into a foreign trust,and thence through a series of offshore bank accounts under castellini and gonet direction until the funds were deposited back in the united states into a bank account controlled by agent dowling.castellini later explained that rlc management is actually a nevada partnership,and the domestic trust is a partner in the partnership.castellini told dowling that this whole structure was set up by an attorney and a former irs agent as a way to use the laws that are in place to the fullest extent.agent dowling asked castellini,h ow do i get the money offshore back then castellini responded,t here different vehicles for you to use such as business corporations or trusts.castellini also said,a s far as you getting use of the funds afterwards,you talk to mike on sic that regard.
consistent with what gonet had said earlier,castellini said he would invoice pyramid financial,agent dowling company,for bogus management consulting fee s so that the check would look like a legitimate business expense even though no consulting work would be done for dowling.agent dowling asked castellini,a ll i do is just do tell anyone about the transaction then castellini replied,a s far as you know,you hired us to do some consulting a s the rest of it goes,you do know anything.castellini told dowling that he should not tell the attorney about the transaction because then dowling would be told by the bankruptcy counsel to list the funds on the bankruptcy petition.castellini confirmed that he could handle transactions between and,and that the fee would be,with castellini taking care of gonet share.agent dowling consented to the pretty steep fee.
castellini urged dowling to delay the bankruptcy filing as long as possible because the trustee looks pretty heavily at transactions during the last days and they did not want to raise a red flag.in order to lessen the likelihood that the bogus transaction would be scrutinized,castellini suggested that the invoices be backdated to february and advised dowling to backdate the checks to rlc to be from the same time as the most recent group of checks he had written subsequent to the invoice date so that the false checks would not stick out like a sore thumb.castellini also offered to generate some paperwork,such as a management report or proposal,as supporting documentation for the false invoices.
when agent dowling said he was a little nervous about the transactions because his attorney might,as he had in the past,jump up and down about,you know,bankruptcy fraud,castellini told him,y ou not committing fraud if you hire a company to come in and provide a service.but castellini also acknowledged that no services would actually be provided.agent dowling asked castellini,t he only one knows sic about the service will be you and me castellini replied,right.they do know,they do have to know what happened to it.agent dowling asked castellini,h ave you ever done this before castellini replied,i never had anyone come back and ask i t never been questioned.
on april,castellini called dowling to initiate their plan,or,in his words,do that invoice thing.castellini told dowling that he would make out an invoice in the amount of dated february,and instructed dowling to write out a check dated the same as the last time in february when dowling thought he wrote out other checks.this invoice was sent on april.
on april,castellini and agent dowling met at a restaurant in new jersey,where dowling gave castellini a check for,dated february,and made out to rlc management,in payment for the false consulting invoice castellini had sent to agent dowling.after a lunch,the two engaged in the following conversation to justify the false invoice 
agent dowling so,and on this thing here,you chosen percent.is there anything,if something ever happens,you be on my team,and that what the kind of high.
castellini if something ever happens,whatever happens,they call me.and i can verify that we consulted.i mean,it as simple as that.i not hiding anything.did you and i just consult over business ventures and strategies 
agent dowling we been talking sic hiding my money.
castellini did we discuss business strategies 
agent dowling sure.
castellini yes.we not lying,are we hiding your money is a business strategy,is it 
agent dowling you got a point.that a great point.
castellini deposited the check into the rlc management account and then transferred the money to the account of sawtooth enterprises,another aaa account available to castellini.from the sawtooth account,the the fee for castellini and through banks in vienna,austria,costa rica,the isle of man,the bahamas,and ultimately,back to agent dowling century market account in lasalle bank,chicago.castellini and gonet both took part in directing the money transfers,and some of the accounts belonged to gonet.
a few days later,during a telephone conversation on may,castellini told dowling that he had made up another false invoice for dated march,which he was going to send out to dowling.he asked dowling to trash the envelope when he got the invoice because it will have a postmark much later than the false date of the invoice on it and stuff like that.agent dowling did receive such an invoice.however,due to a conversation that dowling later had with castellini accountant,drummer,nothing further was done with this false invoice.
in september of,castellini sent dowling another invoice for consulting services backdated july,for,and agent dowling made out a check in that amount,backdated july,to rlc management the money went on the same tour as the first.ultimately,representing the balance after the fee,was deposited in the century market account.
having himself successfully transferred for dowling,castellini referred dowling to richard marks marks,another coconspirator ultimately indicted along with castellini,for further money transfers.marks controlled sawtooth enterprises,which was one of the entities through which the castellini helped dowling hide had moved.during a telephone conversation on october,castellini told dowling that he would give richard marks the whole overview of what your situation is and,you know,what we done so far.on november,castellini told dowling that marks had agreed to speak with dowling directly.
thereafter,marks helped agent dowling hide before referring agent dowling to wayne anderson.wayne anderson was the brother of keith anderson,and was himself also a leader in aaa.ultimately,wayne anderson helped dowling hide.
in late,pyramid financial,agent dowling fictitious company,filed its bankruptcy petition the bankruptcy court was informed ahead of time that the petition was fictitious and the petition was ultimately dismissed.agent dowling and another irs agent posing as his fiancée met castellini and his wife in february to let castellini know that bankruptcy had been filed and to thank him for his help.eight days after this dinner meeting,castellini was arrested.
castellini testified that he made no money from the transactions he conducted for dowling because,out of the fee,gonet took and left each for aaa and castellini,but aaa refused to send castellini his share.
on march,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts indicted richard castellini and codefendants keith anderson,wayne anderson,karolyn grosnickle,richard marks,and michael gonet count one of the indictment charged castellini with conspiracy to launder money in violation of h counts five and six charged castellini with money laundering in violation of a based on the two separate transactions.all of the charges were premised on the fictional specified unlawful activity of bankruptcy fraud in violation of the relevant portion of the money laundering sting statute,a,provides that 
whoever,with the intent 
a to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity or 
b to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity 
conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction involving property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than years,or both.for purposes of this paragraph,the term represented means any representation made by a law enforcement officer or by another person at the direction of,or with the approval of,a federal official authorized to investigate or prosecute violations of this section.
castellini jury trial began on july.the government elected to proceed only on counts one,five,and six.the trial lasted seven days.
during trial,the government played excerpts of recorded conversations between agent dowling and members of the conspiracy.of these,five conversations were with gonet,thirteen were with castellini,four were with marks,and the last one was with grosnickle.one of the conversations involving gonet was the march,meeting in a florida hotel room between agent dowling and gonet,and the government played a videotape recording of the meeting.
at the outset of the government case,the district court allowed the defense to lodge a continuing hearsay objection to the admission of each of these recordings of conversations between agent dowling and the alleged coconspirators.the defense renewed this objection on the third day of the trial.the objections were overruled by the trial court but preserved for appeal.the defense also moved for a mistrial on the basis of the admission of this evidence after the government rested,at the close of all the evidence,and after the verdict.these motions were denied.
on july,the jury found castellini guilty on all three counts.at his august,sentencing hearing,castellini moved for a downward departure for aberrant behavior under sentencing guidelines manual.castellini argued that the charged conduct was an lapse in a life of good citizenship.the district court denied the motion,saying,i think that this is a departure in terms of his behavior.you know,that period is like a black hole in an otherwise reasonable life.but i do believe that it adds up to the downward departure that you are talking about.the court sentenced castellini to months imprisonment but did not impose a fine and stayed castellini sentence pending appeal.
castellini timely filed his notice of appeal on august.
we address in turn each of castellini claims on appeal.
sufficiency of the evidence 
on challenges to sufficiency of the evidence,we take all the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict and ask whether a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.jackson virginia,d united states,cir.
the essential elements of the money laundering sting statute are 
whoever,with the intent 
a to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity or 
b to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity 
conducts or attempts to conduct a financial transaction involving property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than years,or both.
a emphasis added.the statute further defines the term represented as any representation made by a law enforcement officer or by another person at the direction of,or with the approval of,a federal official authorized to investigate or prosecute violations of this section.id.
a money laundering defendant must act with a certain type of intent.one sort of requisite intent is the intent to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of property believed to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.id.emphasis added.the intent requirement is bolstered by the requirement that the financial transactions in question must involve property represented to be the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.id.emphasis added.
on first read,it might seem odd to refer to money laundering of proceeds from a bankruptcy fraud.after all,bankruptcy fraud involves hiding the debtor own money from the bankruptcy court,and unlike other types of fraud does not involve wrongfully taking money proceeds from others by deception.proceeds are usually defined as t he value of land,goods,or investments when converted into money or the amount of money received from a sale.black law dictionary ed.nonetheless,congress expressly included bankruptcy fraud as one of the predicate crimes producing proceeds which could be money laundered.c d.it is not difficult to think of bankruptcy fraud in terms similar to the other types of which is hidden from the bankruptcy court is,in a sense,taken from the creditors.in any event,the case law as well as the statute establishes that bankruptcy fraud can produce proceeds.see united states richard,cir.the sting portion of the money laundering statute means that the proceeds can be part of a fiction the government creates.
castellini argues that the agent never represented the money to be the proceeds of unlawful activity,and so no rational jury could conclude that element of the crime was proven.the argument is based on the general rule that the money laundering statute is meant to punish a separate offense from the underlying specified unlawful activity,and thus,it criminalizes separate financial transactions involving the funds derived from such illegal activity.see united states mankarious,cir money laundering requires proceeds of a discrete predicate crime.that predicate crime must have produced proceeds in acts distinct from the conduct that constitutes money laundering.united states leblanc,cir money laundering is a separate crime distinct from the underlying offense that generated the money.
in the analogous context of,which criminalizes money laundering of criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity,a,we have reversed convictions when the government did not prove that the money involved in the alleged laundering transactions was the proceeds of a separate specified unlawful activity.see united states carucci,cir conviction under can not be upheld because government failed to introduce sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude that defendant laundered money which was proceeds from gambling,extortion,or drug trafficking,the underlying specified unlawful activities.
the two issues of the agent representation and the nature of the proceeds are connected.we understand castellini to argue that if the representations had been nothing more than that the agent wanted castellini to take property and hide it from the bankruptcy court,then that would not be a representation that property was the proceeds of bankruptcy fraud.castellini argues that the representation then would be only about property,the concealment of which constituted the bankruptcy fraud,but not about property which was itself the proceeds of bankruptcy fraud.
castellini supports his position with two types of arguments.first,he argues that all of agent dowling representations were that the funds were from legitimate business activities,and castellini had no reason to infer otherwise.he cites the rule that the government must at least prove that an enforcement officer or authorized person made the defendant aware of circumstances from which a reasonable person would infer that the property was illegal proceeds.united states kaufmann,cir.the government agent need not expressly state that the funds are proceeds of illegal activity if that is the natural inference to be drawn.see,united states puche,cir united states jensen,cir see also kaufmann,at agent representation to defendant that the purchaser was a marijuana dealer,interested only in paying cash for a car,and wanted the car to be registered in another person name was sufficient to satisfy the represented and proceeds elements of money laundering even absent express statements that the cash was drug proceeds united states marbelt,d,representation need only be specific enough to lead reasonable person in defendant position to infer funds derived from specified unlawful activity.
castellini has a second argument as well.he argues that he could not have violated the bankruptcy fraud statute because the statute criminalizes the act of not merely the intention of transferring or concealing funds,and at the time agent dowling gave castellini money,there had been no specified unlawful activity which produced the requisite proceeds of an illegal activity for money laundering.in other words,castellini argues,his actions were nothing more than aiding and abetting the commission of the underlying bankruptcy fraud those actions could not simultaneously have constituted money laundering.
we start with the representations argument.a representation is the manifestation to another that a fact exists.black law dictionary ed.it is true that the initial representation made was that agent dowling wanted to hide from the bankruptcy court his legitimately earned money.specifically,that castellini would receive the money in a legitimate manner.agent dowling approached castellini and said that he had a successful business and wanted castellini to help him hide money from the bankruptcy court and then gave the money to castellini to hide from the bankruptcy court,itself a fraud.
agent dowling representations also went far beyond the initial transfer of money to an agreement that there would be a series of steps taken after castellini received the funds.the steps discussed in the conversations were classic money laundering.in their conversations,castellini described to agent dowling in detail the steps that would be taken to siphon the funds offshore and move them around before they would be made available again to agent dowling.dowling represented that this was acceptable.castellini explained the division of work between himself and gonet in the scheme,and the fee that he and gonet would charge.dowling represented that he understood and agreed to the scheme and the pretty steep fee.
indeed,the evidence shows that castellini did conclude,from the representations,that he would be handling the proceeds of an illegal activity.for example,castellini acknowledged to agent dowling,within their first conversation,that exchanging a check for a false invoice while providing no actual consulting service would be fraud.castellini told agent dowling that the money dowling was going to give to castellini would not have to be listed in the bankruptcy petition because o nce you give it to me,it no longer yours.furthermore,in a later conversation on june,castellini demonstrated his awareness that he was handling tainted money by telling agent dowling,y ou not going to use the word laundering are you it just makes it sound so dirty.i mean,but what we do.
secondly,castellini argues that even if he transferred funds around the world,what he did was simply aiding and abetting bankruptcy fraud and could not simultaneously be money laundering.the argument has some attraction,particularly in light of the doctrine,broadly stated,that money laundering requires there to be proceeds of illegal activity and can not be the same as the illegal activity which produces the proceeds.the money laundering statutes interdict only the financial transactions,not the anterior criminal conduct that yielded the funds allegedly laundered.united states cabrales,d see also mankarious,at a money launderer must obtain proceeds before laundering can take place.emphasis in original.castellini relies on the fact that the indictment allegations can be read to mean that agent dowling delivery of the two checks to him initiated the money laundering,from which castellini argues that it is a logical necessity that the same acts can not simultaneously have completed the underlying bankruptcy fraud necessary for money laundering to have occurred.
castellini uses the concept of.the concept,though,hides a distinction,one which was pointed out in mankarious.the strict emphasis on time should not obscure the real principle of these cases.it is not a requirement that the underlying crime must be fully completed before any money laundering can begin.it is simply that the principle means that money laundering criminalizes a transaction in proceeds,not the transaction that creates the proceeds.mankarious,at.the cases cited by castellini stand for the rule that the predicate offenses must produce proceeds before anyone can launder those proceeds,but that does not require the two crimes involved to be entirely separate in time.id.
proceeds of an illegal activity may be created before the completion of an underlying crime.id.here,proceeds of bankruptcy fraud were created as of the time castellini accepted the checks from the agent in order to hide them from the bankruptcy court.there are variations on the theme.some types of fraud,like bank and wire fraud,usually create proceeds only on execution of the first scheme,while mail fraud can create proceeds before a mailing takes place.id.similarly,the first of multiple efforts to hide a series of assets from the bankruptcy court may create proceeds of illegal activity.see richard,at proceeds laundered in money laundering may result from a completed phase of an ongoing offense quoting united states conley,cir emphasis in richard united states butler,cir bankruptcy fraud committed and funds became criminally derived property when debtor gave check to innocent third party so that funds would be held on debtor behalf and concealed from the bankruptcy court money laundering occurred when funds were used to purchase cashier checks a year later,even if these acts were also a further phase of bankruptcy fraud.from that point of view,the fact that castellini additional actions after initially receiving the funds moving the funds around,and so forth could have been charged as either money laundering or aiding and abetting an bankruptcy fraud could be thought to be irrelevant.once the basic elements of the underlying crime are sufficiently far along to create proceeds,the logic goes,the money becomes proceeds of illegal activities and it can be laundered.
there may be a case in which the line between bankruptcy fraud and money laundering is so close that the element of showing that the funds are proceeds of an illegal activity or the element of representation is not met.arguably,a case where a defendant merely received money to be hidden from the bankruptcy court in his account and did nothing more with it might be such a situation.that is not this case.here the further activities castellini discussed and engaged in after initially receiving the money were archetypal money laundering.while the classic money laundering case involves a drug trafficker acting with the complicity of a banker or other person in a financial institution and deposit ing the drug proceeds in a bank under the guise of conducting a legitimate business transaction,united states johnson,cir,the money laundering control act of,which enacted,prohibits a much broader range of conduct than just the classic example of money laundering.johnson,at.the definitions and language of the statute indicate that congress intended to criminalize a broad array of transactions designed to facilitate numerous federal crimes,leblanc,at,including bankruptcy fraud.see c d.it is clear from the legislative history that congress purpose in enacting was to close the gap in the criminal law with respect to the hiding of the ill gotten gains.johnson,at quoting united states edgmon,cir.congress had reason to be concerned.the money laundering of the proceeds of an underlying illegal activity may make the underlying crime more difficult to detect or to prove.and congress wanted to curtail the separate market of criminal activity which money laundering represents.
the transactions here were within the full contemplation of congress when it enacted.leblanc,at.castellini asked dowling to start out with a smaller check to avoid arousing the suspicion of the bankruptcy court he invoiced dowling for fictitious management consulting work he received the checks and he then negotiated the checks obtained from the bankruptcy fraud,sending the money,minus their fee,to tour the world under his and gonet guidance.id.defendant asked gamblers to structure their checks in amounts less than he asked that the gamblers make the checks payable to fictitious payees he received the checks and he then negotiated the checks.his conduct was at the heart of what congress sought to criminalize.at least on these facts,where a reasonable listener could easily infer the proceeds were from a bankruptcy fraud,which produced proceeds at the time,and the further activities contemplated and actuated were typical of money laundering,a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty of money laundering beyond a reasonable doubt.
castellini points to united states anderson,cir,which reversed the conviction of wayne anderson,a coconspirator indicted and charged along with castellini in the same sting operation but tried separately in the eastern district of california.anderson does not provide support for castellini.anderson involved convictions on two counts one count of conspiracy to launder money premised on the underlying unlawful activity of bankruptcy fraud which was based on the same cover story that agent dowling used on castellini,and a second count of money laundering premised on the underlying unlawful activity of bank fraud in violation of.anderson,at.the anderson court affirmed the conviction for the conspiracy to commit money laundering count based on bankruptcy fraud but reversed on the other money laundering count based on bank fraud.id.at.anderson supports the conclusion here indeed,it affirmed the money laundering conviction based on bankruptcy fraud.id.at.
the reversal in anderson of the money laundering conviction based on bank fraud does not help castellini.unlike bankruptcy fraud,bank fraud has as an element that the money be attained from a federally chartered or insured financial institution.id.at.anderson held that no such representation had been made or could be inferred from the agent very different representation that the funds had been fraudulently received from individual clients.id.noting that the government could easily have structured the sting to make the needed representation,the court held that the government had failed to meet its burden of proof.id.here,the prosecution did not make such a mistake.
admission of coconspirator statements 
castellini also argues that a new trial is necessary because the district court erred by admitting prejudicial coconspirator statements made by gonet in taped conversations.more specifically,the claims are that the district court never made explicit findings regarding the existence of the conspiracy and whether the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy,and admitted numerous statements by gonet that were not made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.see united states petrozziello,cir.
federal rule of evidence d e provides that a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay evidence and is admissible for the truth of the matter asserted.in this circuit,coconspirator statements are only admissible under rule d e if the trial court finds it more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.petrozziello,at 
we will sustain a trial court determination of admissibility under rule d e unless the ruling is clearly erroneous.united states portela,cir.
this deferential standard of review places a heavy burden on a defendant seeking to overturn a trial court petrozziello ruling a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.
united states newton,cir.
castellini limits his challenge to those statements by gonet which were made before march.his challenge is thus confined to the following five conversations between gonet and agent dowling the december,telephone call the december,telephone call the two telephone calls on march,and the videotaped meeting in florida on march.
we dispose of the procedural aspect of castellini challenge quickly.the record shows that the district court did,in fact,make petrozziello rulings,though not as explicitly as castellini would like.in accordance with the procedures set out in united states ciampaglia,cir,at the start of the government presentation of evidence,castellini requested and was allowed a continuing objection to the admission of gonet statements.castellini renewed his objection at the start of the next day of the trial,and the district court replied,that is on the record.i think there is plenty to justify the conversations coming in the district court also reminded the defendant to renew the objection at the close of the government case.at the close of all evidence,castellini asked the district court to make the petrozziello findings.the district court responded,i make those findings for the record.castellini did not ask the court to be more specific.after the charge to the jury,castellini again asked the court to make the petrozziello findings,and the district court said,i did.i told you at the end of the case,just consider them made.castellini counsel said,okay,and made no other comment,request,or objection.
the district court petrozziello findings,though not explicitly separated out,necessarily entail that the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that there was an existing conspiracy at the time gonet made the statements,that castellini was involved in the conspiracy at some point,and that the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.see petrozziello,at.this conclusion is also supported by other rulings made by the district court.castellini twice moved for a mistrial on the ground that there was no conspiracy at all until castellini joined on march,and that thus gonet statements before that date were inadmissible hearsay which was prejudicial to castellini.the government countered that the record indicated,by inference,that castellini and gonet had been talking about agent dowling situation before march,and at the time the challenged statements were made,a conspiracy involving gonet and castellini did exist the trial judge accepted the government arguments and denied the motions.
the government argument that there was a conspiracy between gonet and castellini before march,is based on several components.when castellini first spoke to dowling on march,castellini already knew what dowling had told gonet earlier.that,by itself,does not establish a conspiracy between gonet and castellini on each of the earlier dates.the government also relies on the corroboration given to gonet statements about the management company and the methods by which the money would be laundered by agent dowling later conversations with castellini about the transactions and the subsequent transactions themselves the entire scheme was carried out by castellini essentially as gonet had explained it to agent dowling on march.also on march,gonet mentioned a third party,a nevada corporation,and the evidence showed that rlc management,castellini company,turned out to be a nevada partnership.further,castellini admitted that he had told gonet of his cbo in,and gonet asked castellini on march or of whether his cbo could be used for a third party.castellini counters that there is no evidence that there was any agreement between castellini and gonet at the time of these conversations gonet might have come up with the plan on his own and simply instructed castellini later to carry it out.also,castellini argues,there were material differences in the transactions described by gonet and those carried out by castellini.
indeed,castellini argues,in gonet december and december conversations with agent dowling,gonet said he owned the company which might be used to produce the false invoices and did not say a third party was involved.in the march conversation,gonet mentioned a nevada corporation but also stated he had not yet involved anyone from the corporation and hoped to talk with someone that night.further,on march,gonet said that he still had not obtained agreement from anyone at the corporation.
the government case is strongest as to the existence of the conspiracy as of the march and conversations,but hardly compelling even as to those.on this record,whether the district court ruling that there was a conspiracy on the dates before march constituted clear error is a close call.we need not decide that question for several reasons.
first,some of the statements are admissible on grounds other than the coconspirator exception under rule d e.for example,the december,conversation was admissible for a purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein and thus would not be hearsay.this conversation simply showed the initial contact between gonet and agent dowling,and provided background and context for understanding the subsequent transactions and investigative steps targeted at gonet and castellini.see united states cintolo,cir statements regarding conversation between fbi agents and a witness were admissible to provide context and background even though defendant did not ask for a limiting instruction.the same applies to the conversation of december,during which gonet said,i have a company that i can bill it through.this also provided context and background to understand subsequent references to the company you talked about as the laundering scheme was discussed in subsequent conversations.
second,even if there were error in admitting some of the later conversations,any error was harmless.the essential inquiry in harmless error review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely affected the outcome of trial.united states,cir.a harmlessness determination demands a panoramic,inquiry considering,among other things,the centrality of the tainted material,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the uses to which it was put during the trial,the relative strengths of the parties cases,and any telltales that furnish clues to the likelihood that the error affected the factfinder resolution of a material issue.united states sepulveda,cir.
castellini does argue he was prejudiced.for example,castellini contends that he was prejudiced by two references gonet made to money laundering during the march,meeting.gonet first reference was to his own scheme for sending money via ups around the country as documents and has nothing to do with castellini.second,gonet said in the conversation that accepting agent dowling money and depositing it into an offshore account could be considered money laundering.against this is the fact that the evidence of castellini own illicit transactions was overwhelming.and the second reference is no more prejudicial to castellini than castellini own statement you not going to use the word laundering are you it just makes it sound so dirty at most,gonet earlier conversations were cumulative and the weight of the additional evidence overwhelming.united states licausi,cir.
castellini next argues that he was prejudiced because the content of some of gonet statements at the march,meeting was shocking in comparison to the gentler tone of the other testimony and gave rise to the negative impression that castellini was a hard core criminal.in order to assure agent dowling that his funds would be safe with castellini,gonet told agent dowling at the march meeting that these people who would be handling dowling money at the management company were more hard core,more hard line,and a lot tougher than gonet,and that these people could stand the heat.the jury could evaluate castellini themselves castellini testified at length and told the jury that he was very naive and gullible,and he elicited laughter for his portrayal of himself as a c abana boy because everyone at work asked him to do things.
finally,castellini argues that gonet statements only inculpated castellini,not other conspirators,so that castellini appeared to be more important to the conspiracy than he actually was.the prosecution in this case is of castellini,not other conspirators,and the jury in this trial heard evidence about others involved in the money laundering.there is no basis for a new trial 
sentencing downward departure for aberrant behavior 
castellini also charges the district court with error in sentencing him,asserting that the court ruled as a matter of law that it had no discretion to grant castellini request for a downward departure pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual.we reject this claim.
when a district court exercises its discretion to refuse to grant a downward departure,that decision is not reviewable.united states mejia,cir.appellate review is available for refusal to depart if the district court misunderstood the scope of its authority under the guidelines and mistakenly believed that it lacked the discretion to depart.united states,cir.
the departure was sought under the november,version of,which states,in relevant part,a sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted in an extraordinary case if the defendant criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior.the commentary to the guideline defines aberrant behavior as a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction that a was committed without significant planning b was of limited duration and c represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise life.sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court made its initial ruling on castellini aberrant behavior departure motion by stating 
i do think there is sufficient evidence for me to give a downward departure for aberrant behavior,although i think that the conduct involved was an extraordinary departure from what had been this man life.
my concern is that that is not enough to permit me to find him having committed something because of aberrant behavior.
castellini then argued that the court should grant the departure because it had found castellini behavior to be an extraordinary departure.the district court responded 
what i said to you is that i think that this is a departure in terms of his behavior.you know,that period,you know,is like a black hole in an otherwise reasonable life.but i do believe that it adds up to the downward departure that you are talking about.
i do think this really is a single criminal offense.i think that it is an episode.
h ere we had,at least arguably,two offenses eight months apart,both for.so it is one.it is not a single.
from the quoted passages,it is clear that the district court understood that it had the authority to depart,but decided that departure was not warranted because there was
