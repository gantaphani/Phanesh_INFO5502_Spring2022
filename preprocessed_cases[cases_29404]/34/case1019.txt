this is an appeal by plaintiff prl usa holdings,holder of the ralph lauren trademarks for clothing,from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,denying plaintiff claims of trademark infringement.prl has for many years used as a mark on ralph lauren clothing a famous logo showing in silhouette a mounted polo player with polo mallet raised.prl brought this action against the united states polo association uspa and its licensee,jordache,alleging that four logos used by the defendants on a clothing line,each showing a pair of mounted polo double horsemen marks infringed the ralph lauren polo player logo.
the four disputed marks include a solid silhouette of the two horsemen,the same solid silhouette with the letters uspa added underneath,an outline of the two horsemen,and the same outline with uspa added underneath.
after trial,the jury found that the first solid double horsemen silhouette without the plaintiff trademarks.however,as for the three other marks,the jury found no likelihood of confusion and hence no infringement.the district court entered judgment accordingly.
prl appeals from the part of the judgment in favor of the defendants on three grounds.first,prl argues that the district court erred when it allowed the defendants to present evidence of discussions at settlement negotiations between prl and the uspa.second,prl argues that the district court erred by failing to give the jury an instruction that the defendants,as past infringers,were required to maintain a safe distance from prl mark.third,prl contends that the district court erred when it excluded a document the ralph document,which arguably demonstrated intent to compete unfairly by using a confusing trademark.we reject prl contentions and affirm the judgment.
background 
plaintiff prl designs,markets,and distributes apparel,home furnishings,fragrances,and accessories under the name ralph lauren.it frequently employs as a trademark the polo player symbol,which has appeared on ralph lauren clothing since.
defendant uspa,founded in,is the governing body of the sport of polo in the united states.the uspa promulgates the rules of the sport,sponsors tournaments,and assigns handicaps.through its subsidiary,united states polo association properties,the uspa registers trademarks and licenses them to be used for the sale of products.since,united states polo association properties,has licensed the right to produce clothing bearing the uspa trademarks to jordache,a manufacturer of clothing.
prl and the uspa have been in conflict since the,when the uspa first entered the retail clothing business.as the uspa admits,in the early it acted irresponsibly in licensing its logos.as a result,in prl obtained a judgment in the united states district court for the southern district of new york sand,enjoining the uspa from the use of certain marks that infringed prl trademarks.the judgment made clear,however,that the uspa remained free to conduct a retail licensing program utilizing a mounted polo player or equestrian or equine symbol which is distinctive from the ralph lauren polo player symbol 
the uspa presented evidence at trial supporting its argument that,while the uspa and prl were engaged in settlement discussions regarding various contested marks in,prl assured the uspa that it would not object to the uspa use of a version of the double horsemen mark.according to the uspa,this assurance prompted it to develop and license a version of the double horsemen mark for use jordache subsequently spent over million developing a clothing line bearing the mark.prl witness,its former general counsel,lee sporn,denied that prl had consented to the uspa use of a double horsemen mark.
in march,prl filed this suit against the uspa,jordache,and related defendants for trademark infringement.in september,after three years of litigation,the parties settled a number of their disputes.the settlement agreement left unresolved whether the defendants four double horsemen marks infringed prl trademarks.the parties stipulated in the settlement agreement that this claim would be resolved by a jury trial.
the jury trial began on october,and ended on october.at trial,prl presented evidence that consumers were likely to confuse all four double horsemen marks with ralph lauren polo player symbol.the defendants presented contrary evidence and also attempted to prove the affirmative defense of estoppel by acquiescence by presenting evidence that prl had affirmatively consented to the uspa use of a version of the double horsemen mark.
prl objected to this latter evidence of consent on the ground that it consisted of statements made in compromise negotiations,offered to prove the invalidity of its claims,and therefore should be excluded under federal rule of evidence.the district court overruled prl objection and admitted the evidence.
using a special verdict form,the jury rendered the following special verdicts the jury rejected the defendants claim of estoppel by acquiescence.it found that the defendants solid double horsemen mark infringed prl registered trademarks.on the other hand,the jury found that the defendants three other double horsemen solid double horsemen with uspa subscript,the outline double horsemen,and the outline double horsemen with uspa not infringe prl trademarks.the district court entered judgment accordingly.this appeal followed.
discussion 
evidence of compromise negotiations 
the defendants offered the testimony of a former uspa employee,merle jenkins,and some corroborating evidence,that during the course of their settlement discussions,prl gave the uspa consent to use a version of the double horsemen mark and implied that it was not offensive to prl.prl objected both before and during trial to all such evidence,citing federal rule of evidence.
under rule,in its version evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of a claim or its amount.the rule,however,explicitly provided an exception.it does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose.
the district court ruled that the evidence was admissible to prove the defendants assertion that prl was estopped to claim infringement after it led the defendants to believe no claim of infringement would be brought,and the defendants spent millions in developing the marks in reliance on that assurance.prl contends the receipt of this evidence violated rule.
prl contends the defense of estoppel was a pretext for introducing evidence disputing likelihood of confusion.prl first argument is that the defendants reliance on rule exception,as authority allowing evidence from settlement negotiations to prove estoppel,was a mere pretext.prl contends the defendants true purpose in offering evidence that prl expressed agreement to the uspa use of a double horsemen logo was to suggest to the jury that if prl did not object to the uspa use of a double horsemen logo,it must have been because prl did not believe the mark was confusingly similar to its own,and if prl did not believe the two marks were confusingly similar,that must be because they in fact were not confusingly similar.accordingly,prl contends,the evidence was used for a purpose expressly prohibited by rule,and not for another purpose.
there is of course a likely logical overlap between the two issues.a trademark owner assurance to one it later accuses of infringing that the owner will not object to the use of a certain mark may well suggest to a jury that the owner of the mark did not believe the mark in question was likely to cause confusion.
on the other hand,it is well established that if a trademark owner tells a potential defendant that it will not assert a claim of infringement based on the use of a particular mark,and the recipient of that assurance relies on the assurance to its substantial detriment,as by spending substantial sums in the development of the mark on which it received the assurance,estoppel will bar the trademark owner from subsequently claiming infringement.see times mirror magazines,field stream licenses,cir describing the affirmative defense of acquiescence thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.the uspa presented evidence that it had received such assurances from prl with respect to a version of a double horsemen mark.the only way it could place its entitlement to estoppel in contention was by offering that evidence.while we recognize that in some instances a defendant could employ a claim of estoppel pretextually and abusively as a ploy to suggest impermissible inferences derived from settlement discussions,this was not such a case 
prl contends that proving the defense of estoppel is barred by rule because it would establish the invalidity of prl claim.prl second contention with respect to the evidence of its conduct during the settlement negotiations is that rule by its literal terms prohibited its receipt,even when offered to prove an estoppel defense.the rule provides that conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations are not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of a claim.without doubt,the evidence was of conduct and statements made in compromise negotiations.in addition,it was,in a sense,offered to demonstrate the invalidity of prl claim of trademark infringement.if the defendants claim of estoppel would succeed,prl claim of infringement would fail.it follows,according to prl argument,that the evidence was offered for the prohibited purpose of proving the invalidity of its claim,and was thus prohibited by rule.
the problem with prl clever argument is that it would deprive rule exception of all meaning.the exception to the rule asserts that the rule does not require exclusion of settlement evidence when the evidence is offered for another purpose than those expressly prohibited.it goes on to offer as examples of permissible purposes proving bias or prejudice of a witness,and negativing a contention of undue delay.the purpose of proving the bias or prejudice of one adversary witness would be to defeat the adversary claims or contentions.such evidence would be offered by a plaintiff to help establish its claim,by showing the unreliability of a defense witness,or by a defendant to show the invalidity of the plaintiff claim,by showing the unreliability of a plaintiff witness.similarly,for a plaintiff to offer evidence of the defendant conduct during settlement negotiations to negativ e the defendant contention of undue delay on plaintiff part,would ultimately seek to establish the plaintiff claim by defeating the defendant affirmative defense.if we accepted prl reading of the rule,it would forbid use of the very examples given in the rule as an exception to its prohibition.all of the evidence a party offers at trial is intended to help establish its own position and defeat the adversary position.in a sense,all evidence offered seeks either to prove liability for or invalidity of a claim or its amount.if we accepted prl contention of the meaning of the rule,there would be no evidence falling within the category whose exclusion is not require d because it is offered for another purpose.the exception would be meaningless.
the exception clearly intends to exempt from the absolute prohibition of the rule evidence focused on issues different from the elements of the primary claim in dispute.the second example offered,involving a contention of undue delay,is very like the present issue of estoppel by acquiescence.a defendant might seek to defeat a plaintiff claim by contending that plaintiff forfeited the claim by undue delay in bringing it,to the defendant detriment.that would be an affirmative defense.the defense,whether advancing it or negativing it,would involve issues different from the elements of the plaintiff claim.similarly,estoppel by acquiescence is an affirmative defense,which raises issues different from the elements of a claim of infringement.see starter converse,cir affirming district court decision to admit settlement evidence to prove an estoppel claim,and noting that the basic elements of estoppel do not overlap with factors used to determine likelihood of confusion between trademarks.
while we have no need in this case to determine the full range of accommodation between rule prohibition and its exception,it seems clear that the firm prohibition should not apply to the affirmative defense of estoppel by acquiescence,which depended on issues distinct from the elements of the claim of infringement.to prevent a defendant from proving an estoppel by acquiescence that arose during settlement negotiations would unfairly curtail a defendant ability to rely on that defense.a discussion between a trademark owner and a potential user of a similar mark in which the owner gives assurance that it will not sue for infringement may well be characterized as compromise negotiations.to construe rule as barring such evidence would substantially limit the opportunity of defendants to rely on the defense of estoppel,even when well substantiated.see bankcard,universal bancard,cir it would be an abuse of rule to allow one party during compromise negotiations to lead his opponent to believe that he will not enforce applicable time limitations and then object when the opponent attempts to prove the waiver of time limitations.similarly,it would be an abuse of rule to let bankcard lull universal into breaching the contract and then prevent universal from explaining its actions because the lulling took place around the settlement table.citing charles alan wright kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure,at.
prl cites our decision in trebor sportswear,v.the limited stores,cir,in support of its contention that the evidence was barred by rule.in trebor,the plaintiffs sued for breach of contract and offered settlement evidence for the purpose of disproving the defendant statute of frauds defense.the district court excluded the evidence under rule,and we affirmed.we noted that while the evidence might have been useful to satisfy the statute of frauds,it was also the necessary first step to proving,ultimately,the validity of the plaintiffs claims of breach of contract.id.at.we wrote that,s ince the two questions were so closely intertwined,admission of the documents even initially for the purpose of meeting the statute of frauds requirement would,under the circumstances of this case,militate against the public policy considerations which favor settlement negotiations and which underlie rule.id.
trebor is quite different from this case.first,in trebor,the purpose for which the settlement evidence was arguably compliance with the statute of significant overlap with the purpose for which the evidence was clearly excluded by rule the plaintiffs breach of contract claim.proving compliance with the statute of frauds by presenting a signed writing evidencing an agreement is also,in effect,proving the necessary element of the plaintiffs breach of contract claim.that evidence lay close to the rule categorical prohibition of evidence proving liability.here,by contrast,the elements of the uspa claim of estoppel are distinct from the elements of prl claim of infringement.
second,prl misunderstands our ruling in trebor.we did not rule that the exclusion of the evidence was mandated.we said only that the district court decision to exclude it was not an abuse of discretion.id.at.although rule speaks categorically of the inadmissibility of settlement evidence to prove the validity or invalidity of a claim,the terms of the exception are less categorical.the exception says only that t his rule does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose.emphasis added,leaving the court wide discretion whether to admit or exclude.our conclusion in trebor that the district court had discretion to exclude the evidence of compromise negotiations did not mean that the district court in trebor was required to exclude that evidence,and in no way supports prl contention in this case that the district court was required by rule to exclude it.
prl contends it suffered spillover prejudice.prl third contention is that,notwithstanding admissibility of the settlement evidence to prove estoppel,prl suffered spillover prejudice resulting from the jur
