opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the district court on july,and from an order entered in the district court on april,denying defendant eric shields motion to suppress evidence the fbi obtained from a search of his home pursuant to a search warrant and to suppress statements that he made at his home following the search.shields asserts that the warrant was based on an affidavit containing intentionally or recklessly false statements and that,purged of these statements,the affidavit does not supply probable cause for the warrant.the district court denied shields request for a hearing on his motion pursuant to franks delaware,d,as it concluded that the affidavit supports a finding of probable cause even with the purportedly false statements excised.for the following reasons,we will affirm the judgment and order of the district court.
ii.factual and procedural history 
on january,fbi special agent geoffrey binney,working in an undercover capacity,subscribed online to an entity called the candyman the candyman was a free website to which one could subscribe by providing an address.the purpose of the candyman,as stated on its own website,was as follows 
this group is for people who love kids.you can post any type of messages you like too sic or any type of pics and vids you like too sic.if we all work together we will have the best group on the net.
app.at.as this pronouncement suggests,members of the candyman could discuss their shared interests,as well as exchange images and video files.the website also provided a polls feature,which allowed members to participate in surveys a links section,which allowed members to share website addresses for websites containing similar content and a chat section,which allowed members to engage in realtime conversations with other members online.in particular,agent binney was interested in investigating the use of the candyman to transmit child pornography in violation of as a member of the candyman,agent binney received containing hundreds of images and video clips depicting children engaged in sexual activities.
through his membership in the candyman,agent binney learned of another called girls,the purpose of which it stated on its website as follows 
hi all,this group is for all those ho sic appreciate the young female in here sic finest form.watching her develop and grow is like poetry in motioon sic,to an age where she takes an interest in the joys and pleasures of sex.there is probably nothing more stimulating than watching a young teen girl discover the pleasures of the orgasm.the joy of feeling like she is actually coming into womanhood.its sic an age where they have no preconditions about anything,just pure opennes sic.what a joy to be part of that wonderful experience and to watch the development of this perfect form.this is the place to be if you love to yr olds.you can share experiences with others.sic share your views and opinions quite freely without censorship.sic you sic can share all kinds of other information as well current model if you are a photographer.where the best place to meet gitls sic is.the difficulties you experience in your quest.the best ways to chat up.good places to pick up girls.girls you would like to share with others.the choice is all yours.welcome home post videos and photographs and how about your true life experiences with them so other viewers can paint a mental picture andin sic some ways share the experience with you.you could connect with others from the same country as you and get together sociall sic if you wish.the choice is all yours.how about a model resource for photographers it all up to you and is only limited by your own imaginations.membership is open to anyone but you will need to post something first.mybe sic a little bit about your interests are specifically,what your age looking for specifically,your age,location and a pic or vid would be a good to sic.by doing this,other members or potential members with the same interest may then contact you if you wish them to.
app.at.as with the candyman,agent binney was interested in investigating the use of the girls to transmit child pornography in violation of.to this end,agent binney joined the girls from february,through february,and during this time he received numerous containing images of child pornography.
in the course of his investigation,agent binney served a federal grand jury subpoena on yahoo services yahoo,said to be the owner and operator of the,directing yahoo to divulge information regarding the members of the under investigation.on february,yahoo shut down the candyman and provided the fbi with a list of approximately members addresses.with this information,the fbi issued subpoenas to the providers requesting identifying information,including the members names,addresses,and phone numbers.the fbi then transmitted this information to local fbi offices,which were assigned to investigate individual members as part of a national investigation dubbed operation candyman.
to assist the local offices with their investigations,agent binney provided a template for a search warrant affidavit containing general information obtained during the course of his investigation.of particular importance,agent binney explained how he purportedly joined the and the workings of them,including in pertinent part 
as a result of sa binney investigation,the fbi determined the following about the candyman egroup 
a voluntary egroup membership in order to join the egroup,a person had to visit the url and send an email to the group moderator requesting permission to join.the moderator would then send a confirmation notice to the requestor email account,advising him that he now had access to the egroup 
b website features the candyman egroup website had several different features.first,the files section provided an area for members to post images or video files for others to download second,all new members of the egroup were immediately added to the candyman list.every sent to the group was distributed to every member automatically.therefore,when an individual uploaded and transmitted child pornography to the candyman group,those images were transmitted to every one of the group members 
c images posted on the the primary feature of the candyman egroup website was the files section.this allowed members to upload and download images directly to the website w hen someone uploaded a file to the website,the moderator sent a notice via to all members advising them of the nature of the file,the date and time the file was posted,which folder it had been posted in,and the address of the person who posted it.
the other egroups were set up in very much the same format as the candyman egroup.each including the girls egroup contained the same group list feature so that each member received any child pornography or erotica that was transmitted to the group.
app.at,emphases added.these statements were significant because they represented to any judge from whom the fbi sought a search warrant that all members of the candyman and girls automatically received all and that therefore all members must have received that contained child pornography.
special agent keith cutri of the fbi philadelphia division used agent binney template to investigate certain members,including shields,who signed up for the candyman and girls using the address in addition to the representations contained in agent binney template,the search warrant affidavit agent cutri submitted contained certain particularized representations with regard to shields.the affidavit explained that information obtained from aol revealed that the littlelolitalove address was registered to shields.also,the affidavit explained that the littlelolitalove address appeared on both the candyman and girls member lists obtained from yahoo,and the affidavit further specified the membership registration dates.as a member of the two in question,shields had access to downloadable images of child pornography for a period exceeding one month until yahoo shut down the groups.finally,the affidavit stated the following with regard to shields 
from through,received containing images of nude children engaged in sexual activity posing in provocative positions.
app.at.paragraph of the affidavit included examples by file name and description.see,app.at,little boy simulating intercourse with little girl,both nude.this representation apparently derived from the general representation made in agent binney template affidavit that every sent to the group was distributed to every member automatically.app.at,b.
the search warrant affidavit agent cutri submitted also included statements regarding the methods and habits of child pornographers,which described certain usual or typical behaviors of such persons,see app.at,and explained the specialized meaning of the term lolitas in the vernacular of child pornographers.app.at,a.agent cutri affidavit concluded with a statement concerning the highly technical expertise needed to search computer systems,which necessitated the need to seize shields computer equipment.
agent cutri submitted the search warrant affidavit to a magistrate judge,who in turn determined that there was probable cause to search shields home.on november,fbi agents executed the search warrant at shields residence and seized computer equipment belonging to shields.at the time of the search,agents had an opportunity to speak with shields,who waived his rights and agreed to an interview.significantly,shields provided a handwritten statement acknowledging that he had viewed,obtained,received and possessed child pornography from the internet with his computer.shields statement was consistent with the results of a subsequent search of his computer which contained hundreds of images of child pornography,including images that reflected cruel sexual abuse and mistreatment of minors,and numerous saved evidencing his receipt of the child pornography.fbi agents also discovered a cache of binders and notebooks containing child pornography.
on december,a federal grand jury returned a single count indictment against shields charging him with possession of computer disks and other material containing images of child pornography in violation of a b and b shields entered a plea of guilty on february.
following shields guilty plea,the prosecution notified defense counsel of certain erroneous factual assertions made in the search warrant affidavit.most notably,in a letter dated july,the prosecution advised defense counsel that the statement in the affidavit that e very sent to the group was distributed to every member automatically was apparently not accurate.app.at.in fact,the prosecution explained,members could select from three delivery options receiving all,receiving only a daily digest of,or receiving no at all.thus,the government representation that mere membership in the equated with receipt of child pornography by every member automatically was false.indeed,an individual could have been a member of the without receiving any transmitting images of child pornography.as an analytical matter,this revelation also undermined both the statement in paragraph that received containing images of nude children engaged in sexual activity posing in provocative positions,and the list of specific examples of files received.without specifying which delivery option shields chose,the government would not have been able to make this particularized representation in the affidavit.
by letter to defense counsel dated october,the prosecution wrote to provide counsel further information regarding the inaccuracies in the affidavit.app.at.the prosecution explained that during a hearing in another district court pursuant to franks delaware,d,certain evidence provide d a basis for challenging agent binney testimony regarding his registration with the candyman,on which he purportedly based statements in the affidavit.app.at.in particular,yahoo produced evidence demonstrating that a person could register in either of two ways as an member via the website,in which case agent binney would have automatically been presented with delivery options and via to the moderator,in which case the delivery options would not have been presented automatically.app.at.the prosecution explained that,although agent binney testified that he subscribed via and thus was not presented with the email delivery options,yahoo produced contradictory evidence demonstrating that agent binney,in fact,registered via the website,thus providing him with the delivery options.in closing its letter,however,the prosecution cautioned that it believed there was reason to question the accuracy of yahoo records based on past experience.app.at.
any reason to question yahoo records vanished,however,after an internal fbi investigation verified the accuracy of yahoo records and thus confirmed that agent binney testimony was false.by letter to defense counsel dated january,the prosecution revealed the specifics of the fbi investigation and explained its ramifications 
o n december,representatives of the fbi cyber operation deployment unit special technologies applications section traveled to headquarters to review the source code for the website.as a result of this review,the fbi concluded that special agent binney subscription to thecandyman was generated as a direct result of special agent binney clicking on a button on a subscription web page that displayed delivery options.as a result,special agent binney would have been confronted by delivery options.
app.at.in sum,contrary to agent binney statements in his template affidavit,he had various delivery options when he joined the candyman,one of which would have resulted in him not receiving any.thus,contrary to his subsequent testimony at the district court hearing in another case,he did have the delivery options when he registered.
in light of the emerging factual inaccuracies in the search warrant affidavit,shields moved to revise his guilty plea to a conditional plea pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a,which preserved his right to appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress and the district court granted his request.on february,shields filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant as well as the statements he made after the search.shields claimed that because of the false statements in the affidavit,the court should suppress the evidence the fbi obtained from his home,and he further claimed that the court should suppress his subsequent statements to the fbi as fruit of the illegal search.shields requested a hearing pursuant to franks delaware in order to test the veracity of the search warrant affidavit.
in an order entered april,the district court denied his request for a franks hearing and denied his motion to suppress.the court assumed for purposes of its decision that the affidavit contained intentionally or recklessly false statements but held that even purged of the offending material the affidavit supported a finding of probable cause.app.at.specifically,the court concluded 
the affidavit,even after being purged of inaccurate statements,contains several asserted facts that combine to support a finding of probable cause.those facts show that the purpose of the candyman and girls websites clearly was to share child pornography,that shields voluntarily became a member of the websites,and that images containing child pornography were available to all members.the affidavit contains extensive background information regarding subscribers to such websites and the proclivity of members to use such websites to collect,trade and retain images of child pornography.it is also clear that shields subscribed or joined the websites.
the affidavit in this case directly tied shields to two child pornography websites and documented the distribution of more than images of child pornography from those sites while shields participated in the websites.the affidavit then tied shields residence to this activity through the email address used by shields,an email address which was itself strongly suggestive of pornographic activity,and was directly connected through billing records to shields home.read in a commonsense fashion,these facts clearly link shields home to criminal activity.
app.at footnote omitted.
the court ultimately entered a judgment of conviction against shields on july,which included,inter alia,an custodial term.shields timely filed this appeal on july.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.in reviewing the district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review its factual findings for clear error and exercise plenary review over its legal determinations.see united states ritter,cir.where,as here,a district court,in reviewing a magistrate determination of probable cause,bases its probable cause ruling on facts contained in an affidavit,we exercise plenary review over the district court decision.id.citing united states conley,cir see also united states martin,cir whether the untainted portions of the affidavit suffice to support a probable cause finding is a legal question,and we review the district court ruling on that question de novo.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
iv.discussion 
we note at the outset of our discussion that while this case seems to be the only one that has come before this court arising from operation candyman,numerous other courts have addressed similar challenges.with over three thousand members linked to the in question,agent binney misrepresentations have spawned a veritable cottage industry of franks challenges by candyman defendants across the country see,martin,united states ramsburg.cir united states froman,cir united states hutto.cir united states kunen,d united states bailey,d united states strauser,d united states perez,d.
the rule governing allegedly misleading search warrant affidavits is well established.see united states frost,cir following franks delaware,d.where a defendant demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,and that the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause,the fourth amendment requires that the fruits of the search be excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.franks,at.at.accordingly,in order to void the warrant and suppress the evidence,the defendant must show both that bad faith or reckless disregard existed on the part of the affiant,and that there would have been no probable cause but for the incorrect statement.frost,at see also united states harvey,cir.
intentional or reckless falsehood 
in denying shields request for a franks hearing,the district court did not make any findings with regard to the first element of the franks test and instead assumed for purposes of its decision that the affidavit contained intentionally or recklessly made false statements.in this regard we point out that it is beyond question that the police can not insulate a deliberate falsehood from a franks inquiry simply by laundering the falsehood through an unwitting affiant who is ignorant of the falsehood.franks,at.at united states calisto,cir holding that conduct of officers who relayed facts to the affiant was relevant to franks inquiry.to this end,shields cites two cases in which district courts conducted evidentiary hearings on the affidavit of agent binney that agent cutri utilized in this case as a portion of cutri affidavit,and determined that it contained false statements made with reckless disregard for the truth.appellant br.at citing perez,d at strauser,d at.shields asserts that these factual findings are binding on the government as a matter of offensive collateral estoppel.appellant br.at see also united states coreas,cir these factual findings from perez and strauser,which the government chose not to appeal,are therefore binding on the government.we,however,need not address the application of nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel inasmuch as we agree with the district court that cutri affidavit even purged of the offending material supports a finding of probable cause.
probable cause 
in illinois gates,the supreme court enunciated the principles that animate a probable cause determination 
the task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical commonsense decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.and the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.
d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.probable cause is a fluid on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.id.at.at.the fourth amendment,however,generally bars officials from undertaking a search or seizure absent individualized suspicion.chandler miller,d.it is well established that a search must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person,and that mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,without more,give rise to probable cause to search that person.ybarra illinois,d.
shields asserts that the excised affidavit does not include sufficient particularized information to support a finding that there was probable cause for issuance of the warrant in his case and that his mere propinquity to other members is an insufficient basis on which to establish probable cause per ybarra.in addition,shields asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the websites fairly can be characterized as having wholly illegal purposes and that,in any event,nothing in the affidavit links the generic profile of child pornography collectors to him.the prosecution counters by arguing that shields premises his challenge on one narrow aspect of the affidavit,appellee br.at,namely,the assertion that every member,including shields,automatically received every containing images of child pornography.
to be sure,the prosecution understates the import of this narrow aspect.although the prosecution states that the error was not recognized,thus resulting in submission of the affidavit without further clarification on this point,it is hard to conceive what clarification it believes could remedy the unquestionably false representation and which several courts,after full evidentiary hearings,concluded was made with reckless disregard for its truth.see perez,d at strauser,d at.considering that the investigation targeted potentially thousands of members,inclusion of the false statements in the template affidavit was a blunder of great proportion.what is more,the representation that every member received every that contained images of child pornography was perhaps the strongest and most direct link between shields and the suspected illegal activity,and its inclusion is troubling.indeed,the government deduced from this misrepresentation that shields,as a member,received images of child pornography via.in the circumstances,we are satisfied that these misrepresentations were important in establishing probable cause.
yet,despite their importance,these misrepresentations were not necessary to a finding of probable cause inasmuch as without them other,unchallenged portions of cutri affidavit support a finding of probable cause.we find significant,among other facts tying shields to the in question,that shields voluntarily registered for two that were devoted principally to sharing and collecting child pornography and in doing so used an address strongly suggestive of an interest in collecting child pornography.
registration with multiple 
inasmuch as unchallenged portions of the search warrant affidavit demonstrated that shields subscribed to not one,but two devoted largely to exchanging child pornography,this case is distinguishable from those on which he principally relies,perez and strauser,as in those cases the affidavits alleged that the putative defendant belonged only to the candyman.see perez,d at,strauser,d at.moreover,this difference is not merely quantitative but also qualitative inas
