sterling merchandising,sued nestlé puerto rico,nestlé pr,and a group of nestlé corporations including nestlé,nestlé holdings,and payco foods corporation payco.the suit alleges various federal clayton act,and sherman act,antitrust violations and pendent puerto rico law claims stemming from nestlé pr merger with payco and later activities.payco had been both sterling and nestlé pr competitor in the puerto rico ice cream distribution market.
the district court granted summary judgment on all of the federal antitrust claims on the grounds that sterling lacked standing because its evidence failed to demonstrate,inter alia,that it had suffered a cognizable antitrust injury.see sterling,nestlé,d.as an alternative holding,the district court also granted summary judgment on the merits of sterling antitrust causes of action.id.the pendent claims were then dismissed.sterling appeals.we affirm on the ground of sterling lack of standing,particularly its failure to show antitrust injury.
nestlé,is the largest ice cream manufacturer in the world and operates in puerto rico through its sales and marketing subsidiary,nestlé pr.nestlé pr entered the ice cream distribution market in.after nestlé pr merged with payco,another ice cream distributor,in june,nestlé pr and sterling were the two largest ice cream distributors in puerto rico,though there were several other distributors and some retailers bypassed puerto rico distributors altogether.
sterling,the smaller distributor,sued the larger,nestlé pr,alleging nestlé pr engaged in practices from june through at least october,when the evidence closed.
a.the pre merger ice cream distribution market in puerto rico 
sterling was founded in as a puerto rico ice cream distributor.it immediately became the exclusive distributor of edy brand ice cream,the most popular brand in puerto rico.other distributors in the ice cream market included payco foods corporation,and mantecados nevada.in,five years after sterling formation,nestlé pr joined the distribution market by buying mantecados nevada assets.
from until the merger of payco and nestlé pr,the ice cream distribution market in puerto rico was competitive,and neither payco,nestlé pr,nor sterling dominated the market.sterling maintained edy as its flagship brand,which sterling received from the dreyer ice cream manufacturing company.in the late,dreyer began giving sterling a discount,tying the discount to sterling sales.before the merger at issue,sterling and dreyer negotiated a per unit promotional support for edy.sterling says this was done to improve its position in competing with payco and nestlé.in,dreyer also assigned to sterling its new skinny cow products.despite the competitive market and its exclusive distribution rights to edy,sterling financial performance declined from until.during that period,sterling sales dropped from million to million.
nestlé pr also suffered from poor financial performance before its merger.it had roughly million in losses as of may,and sought ways to improve its financial outlook.it contemplated merger,including with sterling,as a route to profitability,and eventually did merge with payco.
b.the nestlé merger and the separate nestlé acquisition of dreyer 
in june,nestlé pr acquired percent of payco,which was only in the distribution business.nestlé did not acquire the remaining percent of payco shares until september.the merger was reviewed by the puerto rico office of monopolistic affairs proma,which approved the merger conditioned on particular stipulations,none of which is alleged to have been subsequently breached,and which continue to be effective.for example,one stipulation is that nestlé may not transfer edy to another distributor without the approval of proma unless sterling has,in the interim,acquired distribution rights to either breyer or blue bunny ice cream.
separately,but also in june,nestlé,nestlé pr parent,acquired a controlling interest in dreyer,the manufacturer of edy brand ice cream products.nestlé,acquired percent ownership of dreyer in january.sterling has remained edy exclusive distributor despite nestlé,acquisition of dreyer.the end result is that nestlé,manufactures edy,which is the most lucrative of sterling distribution products and its flagship brand,while nestlé pr,nestlé,subsidiary,is sterling largest competitor at the distribution level.
c.the post merger market 
the merger of nestlé pr and payco appears to have had significant costs to the defendant merged companies.immediately after the merger,the merged nestlé pr including payco had an percent market share in the ice cream distribution market that share fell to percent by.the merged entities have also lost a number of their major exclusive arrangement retail customers to sterling.
shortly after the merger,for example,sterling acquired exclusive rights to distribute ice cream products to puerto rico retail customers grande and pitusa,both of which were payco customers prior to the merger.in,supermercados econo,the largest retail seller of ice cream in puerto rico and formerly a retail customer of payco,also signed exclusivity agreements with sterling and others.supermercados econo agreements have resulted in the merged nestlé pr losing its sales with econo stores.further,the merger itself caused at least one of payco product lines,wells dairy blue bunny brand,to terminate its distribution agreement with the merged nestlé on the grounds that the merger constituted a material breach of the blue bunny distribution agreement and would,in wells dairy view,negatively affect the distribution of blue bunny products.
as the district court found,some products distributed by nestlé lost market share and access to important locations,and during the first six months of joint nestlé operations the merged company lost million in revenue to sterling and other competitors.id.at.that trend has continued beyond the initial period following the merger.
by contrast,sterling market share and sales,which were stagnant before the nestlé merger,have significantly improved since the merger.before the merger,sterling net sales had declined from million in to million in,and to million in.after the merger of its competitors,sterling sales rose year over year from through,at an average of percent a year.sterling profits and operating revenue rose commensurately with sales.
both before and after the merger,sterling acquired distribution rights to other retailers and rights to distribute other brands,including good humor,j j snacks,rich ice cream,and turkey hill.puerto rico is not a market where only a small number of brands are sold.rather,as sterling acquisitions of distribution rights to new brands demonstrate,there are a number of manufacturers of ice cream available to distributors in puerto rico.and during this period,on sterling own evidence,the overall sales of ice cream products in dollar terms increased in puerto rico.
sterling put only limited evidence into the record of its market share,but its expert did acknowledge that i t grown over the to the present time period.the record evidence shows that sterling share of the market has risen from percent in to more than percent in.this data also shows a steady increase in sterling market share during the entire period of alleged monopolistic behavior by defendants.
sterling strong financial performance has led it to increase the size of its facilities and upgrade.since the nestlé merger,it has constructed a new warehouse with twice the square footage of its previous warehouse.due both to the increased size of the facility and to technology upgrades,the new warehouse could increase sterling distribution capacity by as much as eight times over the previous warehouse.
sterling has maintained its exclusive distribution agreement with edy after both nestlé pr merger with payco,and nestlé,acquisition of dreyer,edy manufacturer.in,dreyer already having been acquired by nestlé,reduced sterling discount from to,citing increased costs of raw materials.also in,dreyer took the line of skinny cow products from sterling,but not the edy brand,and now distributes the skinny cow line through nestlé pr.
faced with the obvious problem that its growing success after the merger makes it difficult to show injury to itself,sterling alleged that in a but for merger world,it would have thrived even more than it did.sterling presented a injury and damages theory to explain how it would have been even better off absent nestlé pr allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
first,it alleged that nestlé pr exclusivity agreements with a large number of grocery stores,by foreclosing sterling from those stores,cost it million in sales it otherwise would have made.second,sterling argued that absent this market foreclosure,it would have earned higher profits on those sales it actually made because its increased market share would have allowed it to be a more efficient operation.sterling also alleged it lost sales when dreyer took the skinny cow product line away from sterling and assigned it to payco a year after the nestlé merger,and lost profits on actual sales when dreyer reduced its discount on edy products.these allegations are not supported by sterling expert damages model,which does not specifically discuss damages from these alleged violations.
the district court granted summary judgment on all counts largely because it found sterling,on the undisputed evidence,had not demonstrated any antitrust injury.
as to injury to competition during the period,the district court concluded the puerto rico ice cream distribution market had in fact expanded.id.the court found no evidence that the nestlé merger or the merged companies activities had resulted in restricted output.nor did the court find any evidence that prices to consumers had in fact been raised in this period,much less that the raise could be tied to illegal anticompetitive behavior.id.the court noted that no price study had been done by sterling experts,and that what little information there was available regarding pricing showed that consumer prices on some products had in fact decreased during the relevant period.id.
the district court found that sterling claims of any injury to itself either by nestlé pr exclusives or by product price increases were severely undermined by its increased profits,sales,and market share in the period.id.at.
the court concluded that in light of these facts,sterling could not show that any antitrust injury resulted from nestlé behavior.
the district court also rejected sterling damages model.id.at.that model attempted to extrapolate from sterling percent market share in two small slivers of the market to the conclusion that sterling would have had a percent market share throughout puerto rico absent nestlé pr purportedly anticompetitive actions.the court held that the model failed to meet sterling burden of proving damages for two reasons.first,the model adopted with no exclusive agreements whatsoever as the benchmark for comparison,but this was an inaccurate point of comparison as exclusivity agreements are not per se illegal and have long been a lawful part of the ice cream distribution market in puerto rico.id.at.second,sterling market share was not anywhere near percent before the merger,and it is unrealistic to posit that the company sales and market presence would have grown had the nestlé merger never occurred.id.at.
the court further concluded that even had sterling shown any injury to itself,it had not shown any antitrust injury,that is,that it was injured by anticompetitive activity and that its injury was sufficiently direct,nonspeculative,and measurable to the extent that causality is not in doubt.id.at.the court found that sterling failed to demonstrate that any of the allegedly anticompetitive activity charged by sterling purportedly illegal use of exclusivity agreements to excessively foreclose the market,a price squeeze from reducing dreyer discount to sterling,and allegedly illegal foreclosure from distribution contracts for new dreyer been proven to injure sterling.
as to exclusivity contracts,the district court found that they had been used in puerto rico since the,that nestlé pr reliance on them had actually decreased in the years after the merger and that the agreements themselves did not have any anticompetitive hallmarks such as long duration,pricing,or excessive foreclosure of the market.id.at.the court noted that in the period,sterling had acquired new distribution rights to new retail markets to which,before the merger,either nestlé pr or payco had exclusive access.the court also observed that the entry of additional distributors to the market since the merger indicated that nestlé pr exclusivity contracts have not served to impair the competitive structure of the market.id.at.
as to sterling claims of a price squeeze after nestlé pr acquired dreyer,the manufacturer of edy,the district court found that while sterling concerns were legitimate from a business point of view,they do not involve any overt act because the cost to sterling had not significantly increased.id.at.it further reasoned that sales volume had increased and consumer prices stayed stable,strongly suggesting that the competitive structure of the market has not been harmed,thus precluding antitrust injury.id.
as to the allegations that new nestlé products had been denied to sterling,the district court found sterling could not show any tangible damages because it had expanded its sales and increased its market share following the merger despite the fact that it was not in rapid expansion before the merger.id.the court further reasoned that,in any event,nestlé pr had no legal duty to offer its brands,such as the skinny cow line,to sterling.id.at.it also observed that sterling had not been terminated as a distributor of edy brand ice cream even after nestlé pr acquired dreyer and became edy manufacturer.id.at.nor had nestlé pr taken any steps to make distributing edy unprofitable for sterling.id.at.
finally,the court also rejected sterling monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under of the sherman act on the merits because sterling had failed to show,as it must,either that nestlé pr wielded monopoly power,or that there was a dangerous probability that nestlé pr would acquire such power.id.at.
our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo,taking all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to sterling,the nonmoving party.see white packer,cir.
sterling argues that its evidence sufficed to show that nestlé pr has put a stranglehold on the puerto rico ice cream distribution market by acquiring its former competitor,payco entering into strategically deployed exclusivity contracts that lock up lucrative and geographically efficient grocery stores albeit without foreclosing more than percent of the market and acquiring dreyer,the manufacturer of sterling star product line,and causing dreyer to reduce from cents to cents the discount it once gave sterling on its wholesale price.sterling argues these practices have harmed interbrand competition and also injured sterling by foreclosing it from sales it would have made in the absence of exclusive dealing contracts and increasing sterling input and operational costs by reducing the wholesale discount it once received and forcing route structure inefficiencies.
sterling insists it has demonstrated antitrust injury because it would have done even better for itself than it has were it not for the merger,the removal of a portion of dreyer wholesale discounts on edy products,and nestlé pr exclusivity arrangements.sterling argues that in such a world,purchasers would have been offered more choices in more locations at more competitive prices,and sterling would have gained more market share.sterling also argues that it would have been able to use more efficient delivery routes,thereby lowering its costs sterling attributes its actual increased sales to the fact that wells dairy blue bunny product and distribution line was driven out of the market after the nestlé merger,which has benefitted sterling in the short term 
nestlé pr responds that sterling has failed to show either that it had suffered any injury or that nestlé pr allegedly anticompetitive actions had caused such injury.nestlé pr cites the lack of evidence of injury to competition or consumers,sterling post financial performance,the evidence of sterling entry into outlets previously controlled by payco,the merged nestlé pr declining use of exclusivity agreements,and the unrealistic and speculative economic forecast sterling used as its scenario.
nestlé pr also argues that whatever sterling might show about the effect of nestlé pr actions on sterling,the case law requires sterling to show that its loss comes from acts that reduce output raise prices to consumers.sullivan football league,cir.nestlé pr points out that while sterling claims in its amended complaint that consumers saw increased retail prices and constricted retail options,it never actually produced evidence to support either reduced output or increased prices to consumers.sterling expert,overstreet,acknowledged in testimony that he had done no analysis of consumer pricing,or of any potential causes of any increased prices,preventing sterling from proving that any increased price either existed or resulted from anticompetitive conduct by nestlé pr.nor did sterling produce any evidence of reduced output.in fact,nestlé argues,there was evidence to the contrary of increased output and reduced prices.
the supreme court has articulated a test that governs whether a plaintiff has standing to bring an antitrust action.the relevant factors are 
the causal connection between the alleged antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff an improper motive the nature of the plaintiff alleged injury and whether the injury was of a type that congress sought to redress with the antitrust laws antitrust injury the directness with which the alleged market restraint caused the asserted injury the speculative nature of the damages and the risk of duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages.
rsa media,ak media,cir quoting serpa mcwane,cir see also associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters.although we technically balance the six factors to determine if standing is appropriate,this court has emphasized the causation requirement.rsa media,at citation omitted.additionally,the absence of antitrust injury will generally defeat standing.id.sterling has not satisfied these tests and particularly has not shown antitrust injury.
the plaintiff bears the burden of proving antitrust injury.brunswick pueblo bowl o mat.antitrust injury is injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.id.the injury should be the type of loss that the claimed violations would be likely to cause,id.alteration in original quoting zenith radio hazeltine research,and should therefore reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation,id.plaintiffs must show not only that they were injured as a result of the defendant actions and that those actions constituted an antitrust violation,but also that their injury is the type of injury the antitrust violation would cause to competition.
a competitor may suffer injury even when there is no injury to competition or to consumers,and so lack standing.even if a competitor is hurt because the merger of its rivals makes them more efficient or able to compete more aggressively,that harm is not an antitrust violation,and the competitor lacks standing.see areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at.ed.further,unlike consumers,competitors have incentives to bring antitrust suits for purposes which are,for example to induce the defendant competitor to moderate their competition.id.as a result,there is reason for courts to be properly skeptical of many rivals suits,particularly when the practices are not obviously exclusionary.id.
injury to competition is usually measured by a reduction in output and an increase in prices in the relevant market.sullivan,at emphasis in original see also stamatakis,king,cir the supreme court antitrust injury doctrine requires every plaintiff to show that its loss comes from acts that reduce output or raise prices to consumers.quoting chi.prof l sports.basketball ass n,cir.
the overriding theme of sterling case is that,as a result of its merger with payco,nestlé pr has monopoly power in the puerto rico ice cream distribution market,and has exercised that power.what the undisputed facts demonstrate is that,together,payco and nestlé pr had an percent share of the distribution market at the time of their merger,but that the market share of the merged entity has since fallen to percent.this was not surprising nestlé pr ice cream distribution division had been suffering heavy losses,and hoped the merger would give it viable ice cream distribution business.still,a percent market share is considerable.nonetheless,we conclude,as did the district court,that sterling has not shown the market has suffered a reduction in output or an increase in consumer prices.it has not shown an impairment of competition or antitrust injury from the sum of its theories.
sterling failed to provide evidence that consumer prices increased during the relevant period.its main economic expert,overstreet,asserted,without evidentiary support,that nestlé pr acquisition of payco allowed it to maintain prices above levels that likely would be found in a more competitive market.overstreet testified,however,that he did not undertake an analysis of consumer ice cream prices in puerto rico,and he stated that there is probably some dearth of consistent and reliable information about it.sterling attempt to show increased prices to consumers was unsupported by basic evidence such as price studies for the puerto rico ice cream market,and is unavailing 
in fact,the evidence suggests that,if anything,consumer prices decreased during the relevant period.evidence suggests that both sterling and blue bunny adopted a strategy of reducing prices in order to entice retailers to break away from nestlé pr exclusive contracts.while there was no evidence offered of what happened to retail prices islandwide,there is reason to believe consumers benefitted from these price wars.and independent evidence at least shows that,in some supermarkets,the retail cost of edy was lowered.further,the evidence is that,while inflation in puerto rico averaged percent annually between and,the consumer prices for both blue bunny and edy ice cream were lower in than they were in.
the evidence regarding output is similar.sterling did not set forth any evidence from which an inference can be drawn that there was a reduction in output within the relevant market during the relevant period,let alone a reduction attributable to nestlé pr alleged violations,or that sterling consumers were forced to choose between less preferred brands or visit another store as a result of actions.
the lack of evidence of antitrust injury in the form of either increased consumer prices or reduced output is consistent with the lack of evidence that sterling itself has been negatively affected by nestlé pr purported violations.it is axiomatic that antitrust laws are concerned with protecting against impairments to a market competitiveness and not impairments to any one market actor.see brooke grp.brown williamson tobacco.it is also true that an antitrust plaintiff successes do not necessarily preclude compensation for damages proximately caused by an antitrust violation.pierce ramsey winch,cir.nonetheless,that sterling sales,profits,and market share have increased during the relevant period provides further indication that no antitrust injury exists here 
sterling tries to sidestep these deficiencies by arguing that the types of harm it alleges suffice as alternatives to the classic evidence of antitrust injuries.however,the cases sterling cites as recognizing alternate types of antitrust injuries actually discuss behavior that would obviously result in higher prices and lower output.see jtc petroleum piasa motor fuels,cir total denial of an essential input,in service of a cartel that would raise prices and reduce output engine specialties,bombardier,cir termination of an exclusive distributorship by competitors who had conspired to divide a retail market between them,which is per se illegal behavior designed to raise prices and reduce output.this case is nothing like the cases cited.
even had sterling made an adequate showing of harms to competition through increased consumer prices or reduced output,sterling would have to show those market impairments were the result of antitrust violations in order to demonstrate antitrust injury.but sterling has failed to show that any of nestlé pr conduct violates antitrust provisions.
we first reject sterling argument that nestlé pr exclusive dealing agreements have impaired competition in the market or caused any injury to sterling.because vertical exclusive dealing agreements can achieve legitimate economic benefits reduced cost,stable supply,predictable prices,no presumption against such agreements exists today.stop shop supermarket blue cross blue shield of,cir.given their capacity to enable markets to operate more efficiently and benefit consumers,such agreements are not subject to per se treatment,but are instead subject to rule of reason analysis.tampa nashville coal,stop shop supermarket,at areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law.ed.indeed,courts tend to be skeptical of such claims because it is not in the interest of the company that grants the exclusive deal to drive out of business competitors of the grantee.stop shop supermarket,at.
the rule of reason calculus requires that sterling make a burdensome showing that the agreements in question involved the exercise of power in a particular economic market,that this exercise impaired the competitiveness of the market,and that those impairments outweighed efficiencies or other economic benefits.id.at.sterling argument fails under this test for a number of reasons.
as a practical matter,in applying the rule of reason calculus to exclusive dealing arrangements,foreclosure levels are unlikely to be of concern where they are less than or percent,and while high numbers do not guarantee success for an antitrust claim,low numbers make dismissal easy.id.at.it is undisputed that nestlé rates of market foreclosure through exclusivity arrangements with puerto rico retailers rose to a high of percent for a single year,and have otherwise remained below percent.
significantly,the nestlé agreements are almost all of one or two year duration,and there is turnover.short contract terms and low switching costs generally allay most fears of injury to competition.areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at.sterling points to nestlé pr,percent exclusive contract with ralph as support for its claim.but that agreement is not entirely exclusive it allows other distributors at least limited access.in any event,its duration is aberrational,and is on its own insufficient to sustain sterling claim.
it is not easy to think of a rule of reason analysis that does not depend on showing adverse effects on competition in a properly defined relevant market.stop shop supermarket,at.sterling has not shown that nestlé pr exclusive agreements have yielded adverse effects on competition.sterling and nestlé pr and other distributors compete to obtain such exclusivity agreements with retail vendors such agreements have been present in the puerto rico market since at least the.sterling was able to win over several of nestlé pr largest customers,including the large chains grande and pitusa,and in,the largest retail seller of ice cream,supermercados econo,switched distributors and defendants lost all of their sales in those stores.it is also significant that there are other avenues of distribution available,and new competitors entering the market.and,as noted,sterling own market share has increased during the relevant market period.
there is no evidence that the challenged exclusivity agreements impair competition,nor that any such impairment outweighs gained market efficiencies.see food,pontifical catholic.servs.ass n,cir rejecting distributor antitrust claim regarding competitor exclusive agreements because distributor failed to show that so many potential outlets are foreclosed to it or other competitors by exclusive dealing contracts or other tactics that survival or new entry is infeasible.
as to dreyer price support for edy,sterling provides no authority supporting its argument that dreyer was required to maintain sterling discount in perpetuity simply because dreyer had been purchased by nestlé.there is no basis to conclude that dreyer would have continued the discount in perpetuity,whether or not it was acquired by nestlé.sterling attempts to analogize its case to jtc petroleum to impose a stricter duty on dreyer now that it is a nestlé subsidiary.but in that case the defendant successfully prevented the plaintiff suppliers from selling it any of the needed input.see jtc petroleum,at.the reduction in sterling discount is hardly analogous.dreyer stated legitimate business reasons not to continue this temporary arrangement.and as the district court pointed out,the net present price of edy to sterling is percent less than it was in,despite an annual inflation rate that averaged percent between and.
further,we have previously noted that once a firm like nestlé pr has integrated vertically into distribution by acquiring one or more existing distributors like payco,it may reduce costs by dealing only with its distributors.a distributor terminated for this reason might certainly suffer,but it would not suffer antitrust injury as long as there were alternative sources of the product.serpa corp,at.quoting areeda hovenkamp,antitrust law,at supp internal quotation marks omitted.given that,it is difficult to conceive how it could be illegal for dreyer to reduce a negotiated discount to.this rationale disposes of sterling next argument as well there is no antitrust violation lurking in nestlé,reassignment of certain dreyer product lines from sterling to nestlé pr.
our conclusion that sterling has failed to show it has suffered the requisite injury to maintain this suit also encompasses its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under of the sherman act.
to prevail on its monopolization claim,sterling must show that nestlé pr has monopoly power in the puerto rico ice cream distribution market,and has engaged in impermissible exclusionary practices with the design or effect of protecting or enhancing its monopoly position.coastal fuels of,caribbean petroleum,cir quoting hovenkamp,federal antitrust a internal quotation marks omitted.
whether a defendant has monopoly power depends on the defendant ability to lessen or destroy competition in the relevant market.id.at quoting spectrum sports,mcquillan.despite nestlé pr significant market share,sterling has failed to demonstrate nestlé pr has such an ability,or that it has engaged in impermissible practices causing the required injury.if anything,the undisputed facts that nestlé pr own market share is decreasing,that sterling market share is steadily on the rise,and that consumer prices have not increased evidence the opposite conclusion.
sterling nonetheless argues there are high barriers to entry which enhance nestlé pr ability to engage in market foreclosure.although distribution businesses do not commonly involve high barriers to entry,sterling says many exist here,including the cost of establishing a direct store delivery system the substantial capital required to purchase trucks and freezers,particularly because ice cream products must be kept at minus degrees fahrenheit and the difficulty of establishing route density.sterling acknowledges that there have been new entries to distribution of ice cream in puerto rico,but says the new businesses,such as palm industries,are not successful.
however,there is other evidence of successful new entries.as the district court noted,gianni new york,llc,has entered the market since nestlé pr merger with payco,distributing to supermercados amigo,one of the largest supermarket chains in puerto rico,as well as to two other large chains,wal mart and supermercados supermax.also,retailers can import ice cream products directly from the united states,bypassing distributors.both the united states military bases
