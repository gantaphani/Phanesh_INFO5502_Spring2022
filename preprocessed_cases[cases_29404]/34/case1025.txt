natalie beyer beyer contends that she was subjected to gender discrimination in her place of employment,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,and the new york state human rights law,exec.law,when her requests for a transfer to a different unit were repeatedly denied.by order dated september,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york irizarry,granted summary judgment in favor of county of nassau,nassau county police department the department,herbert faust,scott wanlass,and william willet collectively,defendants.beyer now appeals,arguing that the district court used an incorrect standard of law to evaluate her claim and that the district court erred in finding that no adverse employment action had occurred.for the reasons explained below,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the alleged adverse employment actions 
construed in the light most favorable to beyer,the facts in the record are as follows 
natalie beyer,a police detective,has a strong scientific background a in chemistry and an in forensic science.accordingly,in,the year after she joined the nassau county police department,beyer was assigned to the serology section,where she analyzed blood and other bodily fluids recovered from crime scenes.
over the course of the next fourteen years,beyer observed a progressive outsourcing of the serology section work,as well as a failure to update the section with current equipment and modern technology.in or,she noticed that the department had begun sending out the dna analysis that the serology section had previously performed.by,the department stopped accepting new dna casework and by or,the department was sending rape kits and urine stains for outside analysis.defendants do not dispute this decline in the scientific work of the serology section.rather,they confirm it.an affidavit from chief of detectives paul tully explains that outsourcing was necessary because,by,the serology section was out of step with federal testing protocols and found it prohibitively costly to stay current with changes in dna technology and methods.by november,beyer heard rumors and discussions about the possible closure of the section.apparently,these rumors had their origins in an agreement between the detective union and the department,which,in allowing for the elimination of ten detective positions,specifically referenced the serology section.meanwhile,another section of the department,the latent fingerprint section lfs,was becoming an increasingly attractive assignment for officers interested in scientific police work lfs detectives were using rapidly advancing scientific techniques and working with state of the art computer systems none of the fingerprint work was being outsourced.
in november,beyer applied for a posted job opening in the lfs,for which she was indisputably qualified.moving to the lfs would have been a lateral transfer,involving the same pay and title nevertheless,beyer points to various reasons why a factfinder could conclude that,by that time,the lfs position was more prestigious and highly desirable.it would have gotten an officer out of a section that was languishing,and it offered opportunities for advanced training in forensic science,as well as access to new technology and techniques.beyer direct supervisor interviewed her for the position and highly recommended her.captain scott wanlass,who was in charge of hiring,firing,and granting promotions at the department,also interviewed her and recommended that she be given the position,so long as a suitable replacement could be found for her in serology.nonetheless,the department denied beyer request and gave the position to a male.
in november,beyer applied for another posted job opening in the lfs.again,she was indisputably qualified for the job.and as before,she was highly recommended by her direct supervisor and endorsed by captain wanlass,who told her that this time he would approve her transfer without requesting a suitable replacement for her in her current section.beyer also interviewed with lieutenant james granelle,the supervisor of the lfs.lieutenant granelle indicated that the opening in the lfs likely included between three and five positions.but,when beyer subsequently asked lieutenant granelle about her chances,he told her that she was w ay on the bottom of the list t here we re people more qualified.lieutenant granelle further told her,when she objected to his characterization of her qualifications,that qualifications are everything w e have to take care of the boys w e need to take care of the guys that did the right thing for the job for the last ten years.a month later,beyer learned that four males and no females had been given the lfs positions.
in or around may,beyer applied a third time for a posted opening in the lfs,but the department did not process her paperwork.
b.the complaint and subsequent events 
on june,beyer filed the complaint that is the basis for this action,alleging that defendants discriminated against her on the basis of her sex.about six months later,the department notified beyer that it intended to close the serology section and outsource its work completely.beyer asked to be placed in the lfs,but was instead assigned to a squad in the seventh precinct,where she performs arrests,takes statements,interviews witnesses and complainants,and processes paperwork.she claims that she now has no occasion to utilize her scientific knowledge and background.
c.the grant of summary judgment 
after discovery concluded,defendants moved for summary judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,on the ground that beyer failed to show an adverse employment action.adopting the report and recommendation of magistrate judge arlene lindsay mj lindsay,the district court granted defendants request and dismissed this action in its entirety.see beyer county of nassau,wl.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a dispute about a genuine issue exists for summary judgment purposes where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the favor.guilbert gardner,cir.a court reviewing a motion for summary judgment must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.dallas aerospace,cis air,cir.
beyer title vii claim 
the governing law 
title vii of the civil rights act prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual with respect to her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of her sex.a.a plaintiff seeking relief under title vii has the burden of making out a prima facie case of discrimination.collins city transit,cir.this requires her to show that she is a member of a protected class she applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants she suffered an adverse employment action and the circumstances surrounding that action permit an inference of discrimination.williams donnelley,cir citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.we have characterized this burden as de minimis it is neither onerous,nor intended to be rigid,mechanized or ritualistic.delta air lines,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.nonetheless,a plaintiff case must fail if she can not carry this preliminary burden.williams,at.
defendants have not disputed,for the purposes of summary judgment,that beyer has established the first,second,and fourth prongs of her prima facie case.indeed,they concede that the facts alleged,if credited,would permit a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that gender bias was the reason that beyer was repeatedly denied transfers to lfs.nevertheless,they maintain that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that these denials constituted an adv
