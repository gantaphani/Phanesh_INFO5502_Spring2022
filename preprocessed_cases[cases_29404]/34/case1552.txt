john mclean,an interventional cardiologist,appeals his convictions and sentence for health care fraud and making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care services.the convictions arise from a scheme to defraud insurers by submitting claims for medically unnecessary stent procedures.among other arguments,mclean contends that there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions.although proof of a physician failure to meet medical standards,by itself,could not sustain a conviction for the federal offense of health care fraud,we find that here the evidence supports the jury verdict.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
during the relevant time period,mclean was in private practice in salisbury,maryland,and held privileges at peninsula regional medical center prmc,where he performed cardiac catheterizations and coronary stent procedures.in the summer of,prmc began investigating mclean stenting practices after a quality control review revealed he had placed a stent in a coronary artery with no significant blockage,or stenosis.an initial review showed that mclean had performed inappropriate stent procedures in cases.after an outside contractor confirmed those findings,the hospital asked mclean to submit to a concurrent review procedure pending further investigation.mclean agreed,but subsequently violated the procedure in three cases.near the end of,the outside contractor confirmed that mclean had performed inappropriate stents in approximately half of randomly selected cases.shortly thereafter,mclean resigned his hospital privileges after informing prmc that he had developed an eye condition causing vision loss in one eye.in the ensuing months,mclean continued to see patients and review diagnostic test results in his office.
in the spring of,the united states subpoenaed patient files from mclean practice.after receiving information that the files were in peril,the government obtained a warrant to secure the records.when the fbi agents arrived at mclean office,they found subpoenaed files stacked on mclean desk and a shred bin nearby.mclean admitted that he was removing documents from the files for shredding.
following the conclusion of the government investigation,mclean was indicted on one count of health care fraud in violation of count,and six counts of knowingly and willfully making false statements in connection with the delivery of and payment for health care services in violation of a counts in the health care fraud charge,the government alleged that mclean executed a scheme to defraud medicare,medicaid,and private insurers by submitting claims for medically unnecessary procedures and testing.the false statement charges related to specific records in which mclean was alleged to have willfully misrepresented the level of stenosis in patient arteries.
at trial,the government supported its allegations with testimony from two expert cardiologists,prmc staff who worked with mclean,and several of his former employees and patients.both experts testified that during the relevant time period it was generally accepted in the medical community that coronary stents were not medically necessary absent a diagnosis of at least stenosis and symptoms of blockage such as chest pain or a positive stress test.one of the experts,ian gilchrist,explained that although coronary artery disease is considered significant when an artery is blocked by,stents are not medically necessary until the threshold because that is the point when the body can no longer compensate for reduced blood flow to the heart gilchrist testified that mclean had grossly overstated the level of blockage in the patient files he reviewed.a summary of cases prepared by gilchrist showed mclean often recorded stenosis of to for lesions of no more than to.gilchrist testified specifically about cases,explaining in detail how the stenosis shown in the angiograms was overstated in mclean records.gilchrist further testified that in at least one case,mclean placed an appropriate stent,showing reasonable technique and the ability to distinguish what should be done.
the other expert,joseph cinderella,director of the prmc cardiac catheterization laboratory,testified that he had reviewed the stent procedures mclean performed between and and ranked each procedure on a scale of one to five,where one meant medically appropriate and five meant inappropriate.cinderella testified that the fours and fives were pretty black and white four meant most physicians would not proceed,and five meant the consensus for pretty much anyone would be not to proceed.out of the procedures he reviewed,cinderella categorized procedures as fives and as fours.nonetheless,the evidence showed that mclean certified to insurers that these procedures were reasonable and medically necessary in order to obtain reimbursement.
in addition,the jury heard testimony from prmc staff who had seen mclean overstate the stenosis shown in angiograms.nurse paul kenlon testified that on multiple occasions he disagreed with the percentage mclean recorded and that he remembered a couple of times when mclean said there were blockages and kenlon just simply could not see a lesion in the vessel.according to kenlon,hospital staff used to sarcastically refer to healthy lesions that did not need intervention as mclean percenter s.another nurse,charlene shellenberger,testified that mclean had placed stents in patients she had a very difficult time being able to say had a lesion that needed to be stented.in one case,after mclean stated that an artery had stenosis,shellenberger turned to his assistant and asked,how can you ethically write that when you and i both know that is not a lesion 
the jury also heard testimony from patients who had received medically unnecessary stents from mclean.patient testified that he never experienced the chest discomfort mclean recorded in his medical records.another patient,testified that mclean gave her a picture of her artery,which purported to show blockage cleared by the stent.later learned that she never had any blockage.her angiogram,which gilchrist played for the jury,showed that the apparent blockage was actually a spasm of the artery,which subsided after mclean injected nitroglycerin.
witnesses also testified about mclean reaction to the investigation.in an early letter to prmc,mclean acknowledged that although t here is subjectivity reading the degree of stenosis,standard practice is a lesion above is felt to be significant and does receive intervention,but objected to the hospital review,quoting another doctor comment that you do not the cardiologist who makes a decision in the cath lab at the time of the procedure.according to thomas lawrence,vice president of medical affairs at prmc,mclean later called the investigation a joke and a witch hunt.carol hales,a former employee of mclean,testified that mclean had blamed the investigation on other cardiologists at the hospital who were o ut to get him.another former employee,candace klopp,testified that mclean told his employees the hospital held a gun to his head to force him to resign his privileges.patient testified that when she confronted mclean and asked him why he placed a stent in an artery with no blockage,mclean responded,b ecause it was easy,why not and an fbi agent who executed the warrant at mclean office provided detail about his attempt to shred subpoenaed records.
in addition,jeffrey weiland,chief of the division of cardiology at prmc,testified that prior to resigning from prmc,mclean told him that the issues he was having may have been caused by his vision problems.however,neil miller,an expert,testified that mclean vision loss in one eye was caused by a stroke of the optic nerve that occurred in october and would not have affected his vision prior to that time.miller also testified that although mclean had another condition called drusen,which caused a minimal defect in his field vision,it was highly unlikely to have significantly impacted his ability to see because his central vision was normal.at the same time,numerous witnesses testified that mclean had claimed to have no trouble seeing.for instance,patient testified that mclean told her his eye condition did affect what he did to her,and he could see just fine,and klopp testified that in spring mclean said to another employee,i sit and watch and look at the cardio scans with you have i ever read a scan wrong 
the government also offered peer comparison data,which showed that although a smaller proportion of mclean medicare patients received stents as compared to his peers,the patients mclean chose to stent received nearly twice as many stents on average as the patients of his peers the evidence also showed that the number of stent reimbursement claims mclean submitted to medicare increased dramatically in,around the same time he purchased a million condominium in addition,the government introduced a document from mclean office showing that patients generally were scheduled for stress tests every four to six weeks,three months,six months,and months after stent interventions,a pattern confirmed by mclean billing data and testimony from his former employees and patients.gilchrist testified that regular diagnostic testing of this kind is not medically necessary after a stent and that stress tests should only be ordered when a patient has symptoms such as chest pain.
in his defense,mclean argued that the medical standard for coronary stents alleged by the government was incorrect,that the process of evaluating angiograms is highly subjective,that mclean alleged error rate was not much higher than the rate shown in a recent study,and that mclean attempt to shred documents was not inculpatory because the documents in the shred bin including records from other physicians,fax cover sheets,prescription refills,and test results were not material to the investigation.the defense expert witness,jonathan marmur,testified that between and elective stents were considered medically appropriate if a patient had at least stenosis and evidence of ischemia or angina.marmur testified that out of the cases named in the indictment met that standard of care.further,although marmur did not agree with the percentage of stenosis mclean recorded,he testified that some of the angiogram slides in those cases could support a higher percentage.the defense also offered testimony from former patients,including several named in the indictment,that mclean treatments relieved their symptoms,as well as testimony from former employees that mclean was an attentive doctor who cared about his patients.
following ten days of trial,the jury convicted mclean on all counts.mclean subsequently moved for a judgment of acquittal and a new trial,which the district court denied.during sentencing,the district court applied a level enhancement under united states sentencing guidelines b i after calculating the total losses to be more than million.the district court sentenced mclean to months imprisonment and three years supervised release,and entered forfeiture and restitution orders of.
on appeal,mclean challenges his convictions on several grounds,arguing that the health care fraud statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on all counts and that his trial was prejudiced by the government failure to disclose impeachment evidence and certain erroneous evidentiary rulings committed by the district court.he also contends that the case should be remanded for resentencing because his sentence is procedurally unreasonable.
mclean first argues that the health care fraud statute,is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because no clear standard of medical necessity governed the use of coronary artery stents during the relevant time period.we review the constitutionality of a statute de novo.united states williams,cir.
a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,or if it authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado,d.here,we ask whether an ordinary person would understand that the health care fraud statute prohibited mclean charged conduct.see united states passaro,cir explaining that vagueness challenges that lie outside of the first amendment context must be evaluated based on the facts of the defendant case.
the health care fraud statute makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully execute a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain,by means of false or fraudulent representations any of the money of any health care benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services.mclean argues that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied because no government standard or professional guideline defined the stenosis level needed to justify a coronary stent during the relevant time period,and the reading of angiograms is inherently subjective.as such,he claims he had no way of knowing in advance whether his conduct was prohibited.we disagree.
the health care fraud statute is not a medical malpractice statute,it is a simple fraud statute.as applied here,it prohibited mclean from knowingly and willfully defrauding insurers by falsely certifying that the stents he placed in arteries with little to no blockage were reasonable and medically necessary in order to obtain reimbursement.although the statute does not enumerate every possible fraud scheme,an average person would understand that this kind of conduct is prohibited.see united states franklin el,cir rejecting an analogous vagueness challenge to premised on complexity in medicaid regulations because the statute is simply a fraud statute further,the statute mens rea requirement mitigates any ambiguity arising from the lack of clear medical guidance mclean alleges.see united states jaensch,cir rejecting vagueness challenge to federal statute prohibiting the production of false government identification documents based on statute scienter requirement.mclean could only be convicted if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted knowingly and willfully to defraud insurers,which necessarily entails proof that he knew the stent procedures were unnecessary.this requirement of proof eliminates the fair notice concerns he raises.as a result,the health care fraud statute is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to mclean 
mclean next argues that his convictions on all counts are unsupported by sufficient evidence.we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states ryan webster,cir.a defendant bringing a sufficiency challenge must overcome a heavy burden,and reversal for insufficiency must be confined to cases where the prosecution failure is clear.united states engle,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.our review is limited to determining whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence,that is,evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states burgos,cir en banc.we are mindful that the jury,not the reviewing court,weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented,and if the evidence supports different,reasonable interpretations,the jury decides which interpretation to believe.id.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted.
mclean first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to the health care fraud charge count.to sustain a conviction under,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mclean knowingly and willfully executed a scheme to defraud insurers by billing for medically unnecessary procedures.t he specific intent to defraud may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances and need not be proven by direct evidence.united states harvey,cir internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted.after carefully reviewing the record,we conclude that substantial evidence supports mclean conviction.
to begin,mclean pattern of overstating blockage by a wide margin and placing unnecessary stents in a large number of cases was direct evidence of a fraudulent scheme.according to cinderella,over of mclean cases involved blockage of or less.and gilchrist testified that mclean grossly overstated blockage in the procedures he reviewed.for example,patient aw had blockage,and mclean recorded it as to.similarly,patient dd had blockage,and mclean recorded it as.mclean subsequently sought reimbursement from insurers,certifying that the procedures were reasonable and medically necessary based on the falsely recorded stenosis levels.the stark disparity between what mclean recorded and what the angiogram showed strongly suggests he intentionally committed fraud.
there was also sufficient evidence to rule out explanations for mclean overstatements.gilchrist testified that the skill mclean displayed in an appropriate stent procedure demonstrated reasonable technique and the ability to discern appropriate treatment,undermining the possibility that mclean was simply a negligent physician.miller,the expert,testified that the optic stroke mclean suffered in his left eye in october would not have affected his vision in years prior and that his preexisting drusen was highly unlikely to have significantly affected his ability to see because it caused only a minor field defect and did not affect his central vision based on his testimony,a rational juror could exclude mclean eye conditions as an explanation for his blockage overstatements.finally,although gilchrist admitted that angiogram reading is subjective,he testified that physicians should be in the same ballpark and variability should not exceed to.both gilchrist and cinderella testified that the cases at issue were not borderline cases where variability would come into play.and the jury viewed many of the angiograms themselves,providing them an opportunity to determine whether they were within the borderline area where subjectivity could account for mclean overstatements.based on this evidence,the jury could reasonably exclude the phenomenon of variability as an explanation for mclean conduct.
mclean nonetheless argues that the government pattern evidence is not probative of fraud because a study published in the journal of the american medical association found that of stents performed nationwide were medically unnecessary.he argues that his own error rate was not much higher,as the cinderella fives constituted only of the total stent procedures he performed between and.we are not persuaded that this study undermines the government pattern evidence.first,if the cinderella fours are included,mclean error rate was approximately,not.but more importantly,the import of the pattern evidence is not simply that mclean repeatedly performed medically unnecessary stents,but rather that he repeatedly overstated blockage by a wide margin.indeed,we do not believe that pattern evidence showing that a physician placed more unnecessary stents than the national average necessarily would be probative of fraud,for such a pattern might only suggest negligence.the distinction here is that mclean repeatedly overstated blockage by a margin well beyond the normal variation between observers.mclean cites nothing from the study showing that his pattern of misrepresentation was comparable to the conduct of other physicians nationwide.as a result,the study does not undermine the weight of the pattern evidence described above.
moreover,even assuming the study mclean cites calls into question the strength of the government pattern evidence,separate evidence of fraud provided a substantial basis for the conviction.tellingly,mclean told patient that he placed a stent in an artery with no blockage because it was easy,not because he saw blockage.that statement implies he knew the stent was unnecessary and the blockage he recorded was false.additionally,the evidence indicates mclean made other misrepresentations to create the illusion of medical necessity.he gave patients misleading pictures purporting to show cleared blockage when the angiogram,viewed in full,showed no significant blockage.in case,the apparent blockage was actually a spasm of the artery,which mclean knew occurred because he treated it.mclean also recorded symptoms patients did not experience.for instance,patient testified that he never experienced the chest discomfort mclean recorded.and in two of the cases named in the indictment,medical records showed that patients had previously denied symptoms,such as chest pain,which mclean nevertheless recorded after the stent procedures were completed.mclean also gave inconsistent explanations for his conduct,suggesting on at least one occasion to weiland that his eye condition had caused the inappropriate stents,but insisting on many other occasions to patients and employees that his vision was fine.these inconsistencies reasonably suggest that mclean falsely blamed his conduct on his eye condition to cover up his true fraudulent intent.see united states hughes,cir noting that a defendant inconsistent alibi statements can be probative of illicit intent.finally,mclean attempted to shred patient files subpoenaed by the united states.mclean argues that this incident was not probative of fraud because he was honest about what he was doing,and the documents found in the shred bin were not material to the investigation.however,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,as we must,a reasonable juror could conclude mclean had something to hide,even if his motives for selecting particular documents are unclear.
there was also sufficient evidence to prove mclean had a financial motive for the fraudulent scheme.mclean received reimbursement for each stent procedure he performed,as well as for a series of regularly scheduled diagnostic tests after the procedure,which were administered to patients at his office pursuant to standing orders this evidence showed that stenting provided a significant source of reimbursement for mclean private practice,and thus,that he had a financial motive for executing the fraudulent scheme.
based on the direct evidence that mclean overstated blockage in numerous cases,his pattern of misleading patients and making other misrepresentations in patient files,his admission to that he placed an unnecessary stent because it was easy,his inconsistent explanations for his conduct,his attempt to shred patient files,and the circumstantial evidence of a financial motive,we hold that mclean health care fraud conviction is supported by substantial evidence.
mclean two remaining challenges to the evidence do not persuade us otherwise.first,mclean argues that the government peer comparison evidence was actually exculpatory.the government used the evidence to show that mclean placed twice as many stents on average in each patient he chose to stent as his peers.as mclean notes,however,the evidence also showed that mclean only stented out of patients in his practice,a rate lower than the average of his peers.we are not persuaded that this evidence is exculpatory.the peer comparison evidence simply compared the number of stent procedures mclean performed to the average of his peers it said nothing about the necessity of those procedures.as such,its probative value was marginal at best.even construing the evidence as mclean urges,proof that he stented less patients on average than his peers does not undermine the other evidence of fraud outlined above.
second,mclean argues that the evidence of his condominium purchase was not adequate to prove a financial motive because the funds he received from stent procedures constituted a small fraction of the purchase price.we agree with mclean that this evidence is not particularly probative.a condominium purchase is hardly evidence of a financial motive to commit fraud it is a personal financial decision that falls well within the bounds of conduct.however,as explained above,there was separate evidence showing that mclean benefitted financially from the unnecessary stent procedures and diagnostic tests he performed.thus,even setting aside the condominium purchase,there was sufficient evidence to show mclean had a financial motive to commit fraud.
for these reasons,we hold that mclean health care fraud conviction is supported by substantial evidence.
mclean next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to the false statement charges counts.to sustain a conviction under,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mclean knowingly and willfully ma de materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services.the specific intent to defraud may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances,and need not be proven by direct evidence.harvey,at.
gilchrist testified about the cases cited in the indictment and explained to the jury how mclean overstated the level of stenosis in each case.even mclean own expert,marmur,disagreed with the stenosis diagnoses mclean recorded,although he testified that some slides could support a higher reading.given the sheer disparity between the stenosis mclean recorded and what the angiograms showed,and the other evidence of fraud outlined above,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that mclean intentionally overstated stenosis levels in the patient files named in the indictment.further,the evidence showed that these misrepresentations were material insofar as they were necessary for mclean to justify the stents and obtain reimbursement from insurers.
mclean challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on these counts is based on the same arguments he raises with respect to the health care fraud charge.he argues that the government failed to prove that his misrepresentations were intentional and that he was not simply a negligent physician,and that the phenomenon of variability and his vision problems could explain his overstatements.as discussed above,however,there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could rule out these explanations for his conduct.
for these reasons,we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the false statement convictions.
lastly,mclean argues that the evidence was insufficient as to all counts because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an objective standard of medical necessity existed.there was ample evidence,however,that a standard existed.both government experts testified that stents are not justified unless there is or more stenosis in an artery and the patient suffers from symptoms of blockage.mclean was aware of this standard because he referenced it in a letter to the hospital.although marmur disagreed with the minimum threshold of stenosis required to justify a stent,he agreed with the government experts that stents are contraindicated in cases of less than stenosis.at a minimum,the evidence clearly showed that stents are objectively unnecessary in cases of less than stenosis 
mclean next argues that his trial was prejudiced by the government failure to disclose impeachment evidence and by certain evidentiary and discovery rulings committed by the district court.we do not believe a new trial is warranted based on these assertions of error for the reasons stated below.
shortly after mclean trial,the government issued a press release stating that it had reached an agreement with prmc to settle a civil fraud investigation of the hospital for being aware of and failing to take action to prevent mclean medically unnecessary procedures.subsequent disclosures revealed that the parties had reached a handshake settlement months before.mclean argues that the government failure to disclose this information to him before trial violated his due process rights because he could have used the information to impeach the prmc witnesses.in particular,he argues that the evidence would have allowed him to explore cinderella motivations for testifying and to probe bias,thereby undermining the credibility of a key witness.
the due process clause of the fifth amendment requires the government to disclose favorable impeachment evidence to the defendant.see brady maryland,d holding that due process requires the disclosure of evidence favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment giglio united states,d including impeachment evidence within the scope of materials that brady requires prosecutors to disclose.a due process violation occurs when the evidence is favorable to the accused because it is exculpatory or impeaching the evidence was suppressed by the government,either willfully or inadvertently and the evidence is material.united states moussaoui,cir.to be material,there must be a reasonable probability that disclosure of the evidence would have produced a different outcome.kyles whitley,d.
we find no due process violation here because the settlement information had little impeachment value,and there was no reasonable probability it would have affected the jury verdict.neither cinderella nor any other prmc witness was a party to the settlement,and they did not agree to testify in exchange for the release of the government claims against the hospital the impeachment value of the information was therefore minimal.if anything,disclosure of the settlement to the jury likely would have bolstered the government case,for the hospital liability was based entirely on its failure to prevent mclean misconduct.finally,even assuming the settlement had some impeachment value,the jury verdict could have rested on the testimony from gilchrist and the many other former employees and patients who testified at trial.we can not say there is a reasonable probability that disclosure of the settlement would have altered the jury verdict.
the day before mclean expert was scheduled to testify,the district court allowed the government to conduct voir dire on him to remedy mclean failure to provide adequate disclosures under federal rule of criminal procedure.mclean argues that the court ruling was erroneous and that it deprived him of a fair trial.
we review the district court decision as to the appropriate remedy for a violation of rule for abuse of discretion.united states barile,cir.a court abuses its discretion if its decision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.united states johnson,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.

on june,three weeks before trial,mclean informed the government that marmur would be testifying at trial and provided a rule disclosure describing his testimony.the disclosure stated that marmur would testify that in five cases he had reviewed,mclean stent treatment met the interventional cardiology standard of care.four days later,the government asked mclean to clarify the definition of the interventional cardiology standard of care and the bases and reasons for marmur opinions.mclean did not respond.as a result,on july,the government moved the court to exclude marmur testimony regarding the five cases.on july,the day the defense case began,the court considered the government motion.rather than excluding marmur testimony,the court gave the government the option to conduct voir dire of marmur the next morning.
