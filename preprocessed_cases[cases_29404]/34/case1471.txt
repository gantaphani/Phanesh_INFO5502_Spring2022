opinion of the court 
albert lopez,a federal prisoner,was convicted of possession of heroin,in violation of a,and possession of contraband by an inmate,in violation of a.on appeal,lopez challenges two evidentiary rulings of the district court,as well as the district court ruling that the government voir dire peremptory challenge of a black jury panelist was not keyed to the impermissible factor of race.
because we agree with appellant lopez that the statements of two government witnesses that they had received information that lopez possessed heroin constituted inadmissible hearsay,and that the district court erroneous admission of those statements was not harmless,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
in,lopez began serving a sentence for participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.after periods of confinement in federal penitentiaries in leavenworth,kansas,and lompoc,california,lopez in was transferred to the federal correctional institution schuylkill fci schuylkill,in minersville,pennsylvania,where the events leading to the criminal conviction now under review took place.
on june,prison officials received information that inmate lopez was in possession of heroin.based on that information,prison officials conducted a search of lopez cell,during which they recovered twenty small packets of heroin from inside a sock,which was inside a laundry bag located on the floor near lopez bunk.a drug screen submitted by lopez later that day tested positive for morphine,which is consistent with,though not conclusive of,the use of heroin.
prison officials referred the matter to the fbi,and on june,a federal agent arrived at fci schuylkill and read lopez his miranda rights.lopez declined to waive his rights or to be interviewed.on march,a grand jury returned a indictment against lopez,alleging that he had possessed heroin in violation of a,and that he had possessed contraband in violation of a.
after a trial that began on august,a jury convicted lopez on both counts.on november,the court sentenced lopez to months imprisonment,followed by two years of supervised release.
lopez presents three issues on appeal.the first concerns the district court ruling admitting,under federal rule of evidence b,lopez federal conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.we review a trial court decision to admit evidence of a prior conviction for abuse of discretion.see united states saada,cir.for the reasons stated below,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of lopez conviction.the second issue concerns the district court ruling that the statements of two prison officials that they had received information that lopez possessed heroin did not constitute inadmissible hearsay.whether the challenged statements were hearsay is a question of law subject to plenary review.united states sallins,cir.we conclude that those statements constituted hearsay and that the district court erred in admitting them.we further conclude that the district court error was not harmless.we therefore remand the case for a new trial.in light of our resolution of the second issue,we find it unnecessary to address the third,whether the district court erred in deciding that the government peremptory strike of a black jury panelist did not contravene the supreme court constitutional directive,in batson kentucky,d,prohibiting the exercise of peremptory challenges on the basis of race.
prior to trial,lopez filed a motion in limine urging that his conviction for participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine be excluded from evidence.specifically,lopez contended that the conviction was irrelevant,that any marginal relevance that it might possess was outweighed by the potential for prejudice,and that it constituted inadmissible character evidence under rule b.after defense counsel,patrick casey,raised the issue at a conference immediately preceding trial,the following exchange occurred 
the court why are you objecting to that 
casey that is,again,b evidence.if he testifies,he will be open game for that conviction,but the fact that he not 
the court they not offering it to impeach.they are offering it to show general intent,knowledge,absence of act of mistake and opportunity to obtain.
casey its simply prejudicial.
the court a lot of relevance,i suppose,could be called prejudicial.
the court then overruled lopez motion to exclude the evidence.later in the conference,the court put on the record that it had concluded that the conviction,along with other contested evidence,is relevant and the probative value of the issue of intent,knowledge,absence of incident or mistake and opportunity to obtain.furthermore,i conclude that the probative value is not substantially outweighed by prejudice to the defendant.
the upshot of the court ruling was that an fbi agent was permitted to testify that,at the time the heroin was discovered in his cell,lopez was serving a sentence for participating in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
rule b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.b.for evidence of past bad acts to be admissible,the evidence must have a proper purpose under rule b it must be relevant under rule its probative value must outweigh its potential for unfair prejudicial effect under rule and the court must charge the jury to consider the evidence only for the limited purpose for which it is admitted.united states vega,cir citing huddleston united states,d.resolution of the present case turns on the first prong of this admissibility lopez prior conviction had a proper purpose under rule b 
lopez relies chiefly on this court decision in united states sampson,cir,the facts of which are similar to those in the case at bar.at issue in sampson was the district court decision permitting the government to introduce evidence of the defendant prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine,for the purpose of proving that the defendant,who was in state prison at the time,was guilty of possessing marijuana.prison officials had found several balloons filled with marijuana in the defendant coat pocket,and although defendant admitted that he owned the coat,he denied knowledge of the balloons.in finding the prior conviction admissible,the district court noted only that it was inclined to think that this is the kind of incident which does fall within the purview of the exceptions listed in b.id.at.
as the sampson court observed,t here is no question that,given a proper purpose and reasoning,drug convictions are admissible in a trial where the defendant is charged with a drug offense.id.at.w here the evidence only goes to show character,or that the defendant had a propensity to commit the crime,it must be excluded.where,however,the evidence also tends to prove some fact besides character,admissibility depends upon whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.id.for prior offense evidence to be admissible,however,the government must clearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences,no link of which can be the inference that because the defendant committed drug offenses before,he therefore is more likely to have committed this one.id.further,t he district court must in the first instance articulate reasons why the evidence also goes to show something other than character.unless the reason is apparent from the record,a mere list of the purposes found in rule b is insufficient.id.at.based on this standard,the sampson court concluded that because the district court had neglected to construct the requisite chain of merely noting that the challenged evidence fell within the purview of the b admission of the prior conviction amounted to an abuse of discretion.
although we agree with lopez that the district court in the present case could have been more explicit in articulating the chain of logical inferences warranting the admission of lopez pri
