courts have long acknowledged that a person has the right to establish a private sanctum in a shared home,a place to which he alone may admit or refuse to admit visitors.yet,with the recurrence of domestic violence in our society,we are loath to assume that a man may readily threaten his girlfriend,take her belongings,lock her out of part of his house,and then invoke the fourth amendment to shield his actions.deputies joseph andreno and kurt palmer,responding to an emergency call,were faced with reconciling these two competing interests.while they misapplied the relevant constitutional calculus,they are police officers,not lawyers or mathematicians.and thus,because the law governing the authority of a third party to consent to the search of an area under the predominant control of another is unsettled,and because deputies andreno and palmer made a reasonable mistake in applying that law to the situation with which they were confronted,the district court erred in denying them summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.
background 
richard moore and ruth sines were,lovers they lived together in moore home for a period of time in and again in.sines had a key to moore home her furniture was there and she paid some of the bills.however,sines was subject to certain restrictions her children lived with their fathers and moore study was off limits to her,and it was undisputed that moore,as she put it,always kept it locked.
on or about april,while traveling to new york from tennessee,moore and sines had an argument,and moore threatened to kill sines.shortly after their return two days later to moore home in delaware county,new york,sines decided to move out and had begun to pack her belongings when she discovered that her helmet and snorkeling equipment were missing.sines went upstairs to see what had been going on upstairs in the last two days,suspecting that moore had moved her effects.upstairs,she noticed two new locks on the door to moore study.thinking that her missing equipment might be in moore study,sines cut the locks with a bolt cutter.
sometime thereafter,sines received a telephone call from an unidentified caller.fearing that it might be moore and that he could be en route to his home and bent on violence,sines called the delaware county sheriff department.the sheriff department dispatched deputies andreno and palmer to the scene.
upon their arrival,a hysterical sines requested the deputies assistance in retrieving her belongings from moore study she explained that she feared that moore might return at any moment.she also informed the deputies that she was allowed in th e study unless moore was there and that she had cut the locks off the door.she may also have informed them that the deputies were likely to find marijuana in the study.
in the company of the deputies,sines entered the study and searched it,including by opening a desk drawer and rummaging in a closet.in both places,sines discovered drugs and drug paraphernalia the deputies then seized the drugs.
on may,a state grand jury indicted moore on two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree and one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.on february,the county court,after suppressing the evidence taken from the scene,dismissed the indictment.
moore then filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of new york against,principally deputies andreno and palmer,asserting claims under,and state law.the gravamen of his complaint is that the deputies entry into his study and seizure of his drugs violated the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.moore does not dispute the legality of the deputies entry into his home he contests only the narrower,and more nettlesome,question of their entry into and search of his study.united states karo,d,concurring.
defendants andreno and palmer moved for summary judgment,arguing in the alternative that their search of the study was not unconstitutional or,if it was,that they were nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity.
the district court thomas mcavoy,judge first considered whether moore had properly alleged a constitutional violation.the district court inquired whether sines had actual or apparent authority to consent to a search of the study,or whether other exigent circumstances justified the search.the district court noted that a third party may validly grant the requisite consent if she has joint access or control of the property for most purposes,moore andreno,wl,at july,and acknowledged that generally when are residing together not as mere roommates,but as part of an intimate relationship,social expectations are that the of the home enjoy full access to the entire home,id.at.the district court nevertheless concluded that a trier of fact could reasonably conclude that moore maintained exclusive control over the study and that sines did not have actual,apparent,or implied authority to consent to entry into that room.id.at.the district court likewise held that exigent circumstances could not justify the deputies entry into the study.although sines had complained to the sheriff department of possible domestic violence,her allegations,the district court explained,were stale they pertained to conduct that occurred several days earlier there was nothing urgent or imminent.id.at.the district court therefore held that moore had established a colorable claim of a constitutional violation.id.at.
the district court next considered whether the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity,and denied it.the district court held that i t was clearly established at all times relevant hereto that consent is valid only under certain,circumstances.id.at.without extended discussion,the district court also held that no reasonable officer could have believed that exigent circumstances justified the search.id.at.the deputies appealed.
discussion 
the deputies argue that the district court misapplied the law governing consent searches and searches predicated upon exigent circumstances.first,the deputies contend that the lower court erred when it concluded that the deputies could not reasonably have believed that sines had the authority to enter into moore study.appellants br.at.second,they liken their behavior to that of the officers in united states miller,cir,who believed that the area they searched harbored an individual posing a danger to others on the scene on the basis of this comparison,they urge us to reverse the district court conclusion that exigent circumstances did not justify the search of moore study.
the deputies also argue that the district court improperly denied them qualified immunity.whether or not the search of moore study was unconstitutional,they say,it was not so egregious a constitutional violation that reasonable minds could not differ as to its putative legality,especially in light of the confusion in the law surrounding the scope of authority to consent to searches of shared premises.
as a general rule,the denial of summary judgment is not immediately appealable.see.under the collateral order doctrine,however,we will review the denial of a motion for summary judgment to the extent that the district court has denied the motion as a matter of law.ex rel.estate of vargo,cir.unlike in most such appeals,however,the plaintiff here has not filed a statement of material facts,and so,like the district court,we are unable to accept his facts for purposes of deciding whether the deputies may properly invoke qualified immunity.salim proulx,cir permitting immediate appeal when defendants accepted plaintiff version of the facts.
nevertheless,our appellate jurisdiction over this case is not in doubt.the district court holding that the law governing consent searches was clearly established is a conclusion of law and is thus immediately appealable.see proulx,at noting that the collateral order rule is easy to apply when a defendant challenges a denial of qualified immunity on the argument that the district court erred in ruling that the law the defendant is alleged to have violated was clearly established.moreover,while we think it a closer question,the district court conclusion that it can not be said that the deputies acted reasonably under the circumstances is also immediately appealable.moore,wl,at.the district court determination on that score did not require resolution of disputed facts rather,the district court came to its decision on the basis of the uncontroverted,albeit,record before it.in light of the plaintiff counsel failure to oppose the defendants motion,the only version of facts that the court had before therefore the undisputed version of the that proffered by the defendants.
and so,we now turn to the inquiry into the merits of a qualified immunity defense 
the first step in a qualified immunity inquiry is to determine whether the alleged facts demonstrate that a defendant violated a constitutional right.if the allegations show that a defendant violated a constitutional right,the next step is to determine whether that right was clearly established at the time of the challenged is,whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.a defendant will be entitled to qualified immunity if either his actions did not violate clearly established law or it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his actions did not violate clearly established law.

i.the constitutional violation 
the fourth amendment forbids unreasonable searches and seizures.this constitutional bulwark against government intrusion into the lives of private citizens is made up of an interlacing web of standards and rules.for instance,w e must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion,united states place,d,under the totality of the circumstances,united states knights,d internal quotation marks omitted.yet the supreme court has also admonished that a warrantless search is per se unreasonable subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.schneckloth bustamonte,d omission in original internal quotation marks omitted.
in united states matlock,the supreme court explicated one such exception that pertaining to search es of property,without warrant and without probable cause,but with proper consent voluntarily given,d.such consent may be given by a third party.as the court has explained,
the authority which justifies the consent rests on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes,so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the has the right to permit the inspection in his own right 
we have refined the matlock rule,holding that a third party has authority to consent to a search of a home when that person has access to the area searched and has either a common authority over the area,b a substantial interest in the area,or c permission to gain access to the area.united states davis,cir see also united states gradowski,cir per curiam 
despite the stringency of these rules concerning consent searches,we also ask whether a police officer objectively reasonable belief that he has obtained consent,even if in fact he has not,renders a search constitutional.see illinois rodriguez,d holding a search constitutional when the facts available to the officer s would warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises internal quotation marks omitted see also florida jimeno,d.that is,even if a third party lacks actual authority to consent to a search of a particular area,he still may have apparent authority to consent to the search.see,united states buckner,cir.however,the rodriguez apparent authority rule applies only to mistakes of fact and not mistakes of law.wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment g,at ed see,united states brown,cir per curiam rodriguez would not validate,however,a search premised upon an erroneous view of the law.for example,an investigator erroneous belief that landladies are generally authorized to consent to a search of a tenant premises could not provide the authorization necessary for a warrantless search.citation omitted see also koch town of brattleboro,nn.cir.
such,then,was the state of the law when deputies andreno and palmer accompanied sines into moore study,permitted her to forage in his desk and closet for her belongings,and discovered the drugs.four years later,however,the supreme court decided georgia randolph,d.in randolph,the court held that a search conducted on the basis of one consent is unreasonable as to a physically present and objecting.id.at.in doing so,however,randolph emphasized that the reasonableness of a consent search is informed by widely shared social expectations.id.at.for example,a person on the scene who identifies himself,say,as a landlord or a hotel manager calls up no customary understanding of authority to admit guests without the consent of the current occupant.id.at.see also id.at.when someone comes to the door of a domestic dwelling with a baby at her hip,she shows that she belongs there,and that fact standing alone is enough to tell a law enforcement officer or any other visitor that if she occupies the place along with others,she probably lives there subject to the assumption tenants usually make about their common authority when they share quarters.the court thus subtly elided the existing distinction between a third party actual authority to consent,matlock and his apparent authority to consent,rodriguez.id.at.noting an instance in which even a person clearly belonging on premises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to consent emphasis added.
while the ramifications of randolph for the davis rule are not clear,we need not strive to discern them.under either davis or randolph,we see no basis to disturb the district court conclusion that sines lacked sufficient actual authority to consent to the deputies search of moore study.first,under davis,the law in effect at the time of the search,sines lacked actual authority to consent to the search of moore study because,though she had obtained physical access to the room by the time the deputies arrived,she did not have control over the premises.davis reads matlock to require that one who asserts that a third party has authority to consent to a search of an area satisfy a conjunctive test the third party must have both access to and some measure of control or right to exert control over the area.see davis,at united states whitfield,interpreting matlock as asking whether a third party has access to and makes mutual use of an area.but see united states rith,cir t he test is disjunctive a third party has authority to consent to a search of property if that third party has either mutual use of the property by virtue of joint access,or control for most purposes over it.
as a preliminary matter,we note that no case in this circuit has delimited the requisite access necessary to satisfy the first prong of the davis test.ehrlich town of glastonbury,cir.in the instant case,it is arguable whether sines possessed the requisite access to moore study.on the one hand,by the time the deputies arrived,she had already cut the locks on the study door and therefore had physical access to the room.on the other hand,sines access was acquired by force,and we stated in ehrlich that we have never adopted as the clear law of this circuit the view that access must mean physical access and not legal access.id.at see also id.at noting our lack of clear precedential guidance on whether some amount of physical force is permissible under the access prong of davis.thus,while she had physical access to the study,sines may have lacked legal access.in other cases,we have found the access requirement to be satisfied when the party who consented to the search had a key to the searched area,see united states,cir,or was the owner of the searched container and could get into it whenever he wanted despite not having the key,see davis,at.these were not the circumstances under which sines acted.
regardless of whether sines forced access to the study was enough to satisfy the first prong of davis,she lacked authority to consent to the search because she failed to satisfy the second prong sines did not have any real measure of control over the study.first,she had no common authority over the area as she and moore were not married and did not share ownership of the house.see davis,at cleare ownership and actual possession of the trunk in his bedroom,coupled with his ready access to it,indicate that,at the very least,he retained common authority over it.see also united states backus,cir holding that an estranged wife who was a domestic violence victim and of a home could consent to a search even though her husband had changed the locks united states duran,cir a spouse presumptively has authority to consent to a search of all areas united states brannan,cir affirming a wife actual authority to consent to a search of her home,despite the fact that her husband had changed the locks,when she had left the home due to fear of her husband united states long,cir same.
second,sines did not have a substantial interest in the study,as required by davis.her only interest in that room came from her personal belief that some of her belongings were being kept there.sines intuition,standing alone,did not give her a substantial interest in the study.while no case in this circuit has yet defined what constitutes a substantial interest for purposes of the davis test,the supreme court has stated that 
c ommon authority is not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property.the authority which justifies the consent does not rest upon the law of property,with its attendant historical and legal refinements,but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes,so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.
matlock,at.citations omitted.it would be inconsistent with these principles to define substantial interest in terms of a property interest alone,particularly in a case in which the third party lacked common authority and joint access,and in which the property interest itself was purely speculative 
in davis,the court determined that cleare,the consenting party,had a substantial interest in the searched container based on the fact that it was his trunk and he kept personal items of some importance in it.at.but in addition to cleare property interest in the trunk and in the items contained consistent with the spirit of elements of mutual use,joint access,control,and assumption of risk were also present 
cleare testified that he owned the footlocker,that he could open it at any time he wished if he had to,and that he kept various personal items in it,including photographs of present and former girlfriends.cleare also testified that content never asked him not to look inside the containers that content had placed in the footlocker,and that nothing could have stopped him from inspecting them.he added that content never forbade him to show the footlocker or its contents to others.
id.at alteration in original footnote omitted.while we do not mean to say that all of these factors must be present for the substantial interest requirement to be met,the fact that none of them was present in this case strongly indicates that sines did not have a substantial interest in moore study.
finally,sines did not have permission to gain access to the searched area,as moore expressly forbade her to enter the study.see davis,at finding valid consent when the consenting party was never asked not to look inside the searched containers and never forbidden to show them to others united states,cir per curiam concluding that a host may consent to a search of his guest bag when the guest failed to show that the bag was obviously his,at t o perform his laboratory duties,macris was authorized to enter any part of the laboratory and to open any jars of chemicals found there.united states perez,noting that the defendant never prohibited his father from examining the contents of the storage bins kept in the closet and the armoire of his bedroom.having failed to satisfy both parts of the davis test,sines was without authority to consent to a search of the study,and the deputies therefore can not rely on consent to argue that the search was reasonable.
under randolph,the constitutional calculus of determining whether the search was unreasonable might be somewhat different.see at.t he reasonableness of a search is in significant part a function of commonly held understanding about the authority that may exercise in ways that affect each other interests.but we see no common understanding of social practices,as randolph uses that concept,that could have led the officers to believe that sines,who admitted to the officers that she had broken the locks on moore study and lacked permission to enter it,had authority to consent to a search of the room.id.at.matlock relied on what was usual and placed no burden on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements,in the absence of reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.emphasis added.
a study is commonly thought to be a private place.see lloyd weinreb,generalities of the fourth amendment,chi,w ithout special information one might suppose that husband and wife have independent authority to admit persons to the living room and the kitchen,and probably to the bathroom and bedroom neither would have authority to admit persons to the other study.moore,moreover,locked the door to his study,see united states andrus,cir the inquiry into whether the owner has indicated a subjective expectation of privacy traditionally focuses on whether the subject is physically locked.united states kinney,cir united states block,cir and refused sines permission to enter,see rith,at noting that an agreement or understanding between the defendant and the third party that the latter must have permission to enter the defendant room would vitiate consent.
as chief justice roberts has explained,at a bare minimum,a person who wants to ensure that his possessions will be subject to a consent search only due to his own consent,may place these items in an area over which others do not share access and control,like a private room.randolph,at.roberts,dissenting third emphasis added united states morning,cir a defendant can not expect sole exclusionary authority unless he has a special and private space within the joint residence,abrogated by randolph,at,at united states robinson,cir upholding consent when the defendant did not claim exclusive dominion and control over a specific room or portion of a room or particular area of the apartment.that is precisely what moore did,and his ability to do so is unaffected by his decision otherwise to share his home with another.
with these social expectations operating in the background,and with the specific knowledge that sines was not permitted to enter the study and had used force to gain access,the deputies could not validate their warrantless search of moore study on the basis of consent.
exigent circumstances 
the deputies also argue that their entry into the study was justified because they worried that moore might arrive and wish to or already be on the premises prepared to do violence to sines.we need not tarry long on this argument.the exigency of a situation may insulate a warrantless search from constitutional attack if law enforcement agents were confronted with an urgent need to render aid or take action.united states macdonald,cir en banc quoting dorman united states,en banc.see generally brigham city stuart,d one exigency obviating the requirement of a warrant is the need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.we have explained that the urgen
