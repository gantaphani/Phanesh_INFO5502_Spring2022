this case requires us to determine whether the public safety exception to the requirement of miranda warnings an exception that the united states supreme court first recognized in new york quarles,d applies where police officers have reason to believe that a suspect may have left a gun in a public place,but where interrogation occurs an hour or more after the suspect arrest.defendant appellant lamont ferguson appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on september,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york swain,after a bench trial.for the reasons set forth below,principally that police officers had an immediate and objectively reasonable need to protect the public from a realistic threat,we hold that the public safety exception applies,and thus we affirm ferguson conviction.
background 
ferguson arrest and interrogation 
on the evening of july,ferguson had a verbal and physical altercation with two women.when ferguson left the place where the altercation had begun,the two women followed him.after one woman threatened ferguson with a bottle,he brandished a pistol and fired it into the air,hoping to scare the women away.at approximately pm,someone called and informed police officers that an individual named lamot had fired two shots in the vicinity of west street in the bronx,new york.during the call,the operator learned that lamot lived at west street on the twelfth floor.

sergeant rule testified that,on the evening of july,he was working in the precinct as a field intelligence officer.according to sergeant rule,field intelligence officers gather intelligence about criminal activity from arrestees,but generally do not try to develop the evidence necessary to prosecute the arrestees whom they question.during his shift on july,sergeant rule read a transcription of the call that reported that lamot had fired two shots near west street.several months earlier,sergeant rule had received information that an individual named lamont,who lived at west street on the twelfth floor,possessed and had access to firearms.after consulting an arresting officer,sergeant rule learned that officers had not recovered the weapon ferguson reportedly had fired when they arrested him earlier on the evening of july in connection with the call.
sergeant rule testified that,based on reports of the arrest and the prior information he had received about ferguson,he began to feel 
a sense of urgency because it became more clear to me that there was a firearm possibly out there that we did not did know where it was and the location where this incident happened,west,or right across the street from it,it in very close proximity to a playground and ball fields and also there a church across the street,so i felt that possibly the weapon could have been out there for anyone to get,to grab,maybe a child or some kid or something like that,so i wanted to make sure that we could try and find out where this gun was as soon as possible.
