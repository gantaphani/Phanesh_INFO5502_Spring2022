opinion of the court 
robert alston entered a conditional plea of guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,g,and was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of years incarceration,id.e.on appeal,he contends the district court erred by precluding him from presenting evidence in support of a justification defense had he gone to trial we will affirm.
alston admitted to possessing a firearm but he claimed it was necessary for.the uncontested facts are these.alston was arrested on september,at approximately,as a result of coordinated police efforts involving police helicopter surveillance responding to a report of gunshots in the area of and tasker streets in philadelphia,pennsylvania.when arrested,alston was wearing a bulletproof vest.officers recovered a caliber revolver in a nearby alley where alston had thrown it a minute earlier.alston told an arresting officer the gun was his and the gun and vest were necessary for.alston was fearful because earlier that day he had seen a man who shot him one year earlier in.
alston was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.g.before this incident,alston had been convicted of two violent felony offenses and one serious drug offense as defined in e a b.
the government filed a motion in limine to preclude alston from presenting a justification defense at trial.at the evidentiary hearing,alston testified that in june,he was robbed and shot five times at and sansom streets in philadelphia.after returning home from the hospital,philadelphia police officers asked him to prosecute.on the basis of alston identification,two men were arrested and tried.alston testified against the men at the preliminary hearing and at trial,having received police assurances of protection.the two defendants were acquitted of all charges.
after the acquittal,various people told alston to watch his back because they heard the defendants were out looking for him,to get revenge from him getting them arrested.nevertheless,alston did not change his address and eventually returned to work after recovering from his injuries.
on the day he was arrested,september,around,alston was transporting his daughter home on his mountain bike and rode past louis bentley,one of the acquitted suspects against whom he had testified.according to alston i was riding past with my daughter but bentley was talking to somebody and i heard him,he said he gon na get me,he said that the dude that got me arrested in,he said he was gon na get me.alston immediately took his daughter home then secured a revolver from his mother house,in order,he said,to protect himself from bentley.alston left his mother house on his bicycle,carrying the gun and wearing a bulletproof vest as noted,alston was arrested around that same night.
at the evidentiary hearing,the district court granted the government motion in limine to preclude alston from offering a justification defense.alston entered a conditional guilty plea and timely appealed.
g does not provide for a justification defense.although the supreme court has questioned whether federal courts ever have authority to recognize a necessity defense not provided by statute,united states oakland cannabis buyers,d several courts of appeals,including our own,have recognized that justification is a valid defense to a charge under g see generally paolello,at united states dodd,cir.
in paolello,we carefully traced the history of the justification defense,finding it available under this statute.at.nevertheless we followed other courts finding the justification defense should be construed narrowly see id.at the restrictive approach is sound.congress wrote section g in absolute terms,banning any possession of firearms by all convicted felons.the defendant has the burden of proving this affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.dodd,at.
in paolello,we incorporated a test for justification that had been adopted by other courts of appeals 
he was under unlawful and present threat of death or serious bodily injury 
he did not recklessly place himself in a situation where he would be forced to engage in criminal conduct 
he had no reasonable legal alternative to both the criminal act and the avoidance of the threatened harm and 
there is a direct causal relationship between the criminal action and the avoidance of the threatened harm.
paolello,at footnote added.the district court found bentley statement could reasonably be perceived to be a threat,but occurring four to five hours before alston arrest,it was not a present threat.the court also found alston failed to exhaust his legal the police.
crediting his testimony,it is difficult to second guess or to ignore alston fear of bentley,one of the persons who robbed and shot him five times,and against whom he pressed charges that eventually resulted in an acquittal,and who apparently lived in sufficient proximity that total avoidance was impossible or at least unlikely.it may be argued that alston should have pulled up stakes and moved to a location where he would be unlikely to encounter bentley.but economic or family circumstances may foreclose such an option.in any event,a victim should not have to relocate because of fear of possible retaliation.and so,crediting his testimony,we can not find alston had an unreasonable fear of retaliation from bentley,perhaps even deadly retaliation.nor would it appear that riding his bicycle in his neighborhood was reckless action although we see no evidence that would force him to engage in criminal conduct.id.
although alston may have been under an unlawful threat of death or serious bodily injury,it is clear that at the time he was arrested,there was no evidence that alston was under a present threat,that is,it was not an imminent threat furthermore,there was no direct causal relationship between the criminal action possession of a firearm and avoidance of the threatened harm retaliation by bentley.the causal relationship in these circumstances is attenuated at best.the avoidance of the threatened harm lacks the requisite imminence.to hold otherwise would immunize a convicted felon from prosecution for carrying a firearm solely based on a legitimate fear for life or limb.someone in alston circumstances must show more than a legitimate fear of life and limb,as possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in the hope of deterring an assault is unlawful.congress has not allowed it,and courts have only allowed the defense where the immediacy and specificity of the threat is compelling,and other conditions are met see,paolello,at newcomb,at,defendant briefly possessed shotgun and shells after disarming a dangerous person panter,at defendant,while pinned to the floor after being stabbed in the stomach,reached for a club but instead grabbed a gun.other cases have rejected the defense where the threat is diminished.see,united states parker,cir defendant retained possession of a gun for thirty minutes after being attacked in his home united states wofford,cir most recent specific threat had occurred five months before possession of gun perrin,at last threat came two days prior to possession of gun holliday,at defendant wrestled firearm out of a police officer hands but failed to renounc e the gun as soon as any danger to his life had passed.
alston faced no immediate danger.bentley was speaking to a third party when he said he was going to get alston,and alston was able to safely ride away.alston obtained the firearm from his mother house based on a generalized threat of future danger.the immediacy of the threat is also undermined by alston actions in the months prior to his arrest.alston testified that he would often carry the same firearm whenever he went to an area where bentley or the other acquitted suspect might frequent.his possession of the firearm on the night in question appears to be another instance of his reliance on the weapon when faced with the possibility of danger.we must take care not to transform the narrow,justification exception to the federal law into something permitting a felon to possess a weapon for extended periods of time in reliance on some vague fear of street violence.butler,at.the
