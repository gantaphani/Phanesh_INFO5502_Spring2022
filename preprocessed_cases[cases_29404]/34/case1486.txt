opinion of the court 
bruce watson watson appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence for distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base also known as crack cocaine or crack in violation of a.he was convicted and sentenced to months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment.watson argues that the district court should not have permitted narcotics agents to testify about general drug culture practices on substantive and foundational grounds in violation of fed.evid,and that the district court erred in allowing expert testimony concerning his mental state under fed.evid.b.we reject watson first argument.however,we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the district court because the government experts improperly testified that watson mental state was to distribute the cocaine base rather than to use the narcotics personally.
background 
in,pennsylvania law enforcement officers received information that watson was traveling on a susquehanna trailways bus to williamsport,pennsylvania to purchase drugs.law enforcement officers ronald paret and kirk schwartz met the bus in lehighton,boarded the bus,publicly announced that they were law enforcement officers conducting a drug investigation,and that passenger cooperation would be appreciated but was not required.
watson was sitting by himself.the officers asked him some routine questions,watson denied having a ticket,and he denied having identification.watson picked up a bag lying on the seat next to him,began removing items from the bag,and a marijuana cigarette fell out.watson admitted possession,a brief scuffle ensued,and watson resisted arrest.after the officers restrained watson they noticed a crumpled piece of paper on the floor next to him.the crumpled paper,which was from the lycoming county public assistance office in williamsport,had watson name on it,and it contained crack.
the officers transported watson to the pennsylvania state police barracks in lehighton.during processing investigators recovered four packages of marijuana and approximately small plastic bags.watson explained that he took his bus trip to attend a funeral and that the plastic bags were for a friend.laboratory tests revealed a total of grams of crack cocaine and grams of marijuana.
during the trial,officer schwartz provided testimony concerning the plastic bags found on watson 
rocktashel now,based on your experience and training of purchasing drugs and working as a narcotics investigator,have you formed an opinion,as to whether or not the substance contained in government exhibit was possess sic with the intent to distribute,transfer or deliver or the intent to personally use that drug 
casey objection.this witness is not competent to testify as to the mental state of the defendant.that the jury prerogative,and federal rule of evidence b specifically precludes it.
the court overruled.
rocktashel you may answer the question,sir.
schwartz i believe it was possess sic with the intent to distribute to somebody else.
later,officer gordon mincer testified that the crack found on watson was consistent with someone selling cocaine rather than using it for personal consumption.mincer also testified about the plastic bags found on watson.before mincer provided his testimony,the district court overruled watson objection under fed.evid.b.mincer provided the following testimony 
rocktashel now,you had a chance to look at government exhibit and government exhibit.and i ask,having reviewed those,have you formed an opinion,as to whether or not the substance contained in government exhibit was possessed with the intent to distribute,transfer or deliver versus the intent to personally consume that substance 
mincer yes,sir.based on my experience,through my undercover investigations,i seen,on numerous occasions,subjects that have amounts of crack cocaine like this,as well as these packaging bags,which they were cutting off and packaging in these bags for resale,which i also purchased.
and that would be consistent with someone who is selling cocaine versus someone who would be using it for their personal use.
the government also called agent paret as a rebuttal witness to testify concerning the nature of watson bus travel itinerary.agent paret provided the following testimony 
rocktashel with respect to the particular trip taken here,by bruce watson,have you formed an opinion as to whether or not that particular trip was taken for the purpose of distribution,transfer and delivery of drugs,as opposed to procurement of drugs for personal use 
casey objection.again,that calls for a reading of the mind of the defendant,as to the purpose of the trip.again,the court has instructed that could be consistent with experiences in the past,but the question,as posed,it goes beyond the competence of the witness.
rocktashel your honor,we not proposing that he render an opinion,as to the defendant intent,but we asking him to testify,with regard to particular circumstances and facts of the trip,the destination point.
the court i overrule the objection.the testimony will be allowed for that limited purpose.
paret generally,a trip of a short nature like that,a hour trip to philadelphia,spending four hours there,on my experience,has been that they gone into the city to purchase drugs to,ultimately,take back and resell at their starting point.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.watson notice of appeal was timely filed.
we review the district court ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.united states bennett,cir,cert.denied,d.
watson argues that the government experts testimony was inadmissible because knowledge of the operations of narcotics dealers is not a proper field of expertise.because watson did not raise a contemporaneous rule objection to the expert testimony we review the admission of expert testimony for plain error,looking for errors that are obvious,or otherwise seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.government of the virgin islands parrilla,cir internal quotations omitted quoting united states atkinson.
under rule,a witness may offer an expert opinion if he or she is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education.fed.evid.see also in re paoli yard pcb,cir.we have interpreted rule qualifications requirement liberally.paoli,at.w here such testimony factual basis,data,principles,methods,or their application are called sufficiently into question the trial judge must determine whether the testimony has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.kumho tire carmichael,d internal citation omitted.
although rule does not mention any qualifying specific fields of expertise,the advisory committee notes indicate that a wide variety of expert testimony is contemplated by the rule 
the rule is broadly phrased.the fields of knowledge which may be drawn upon are not limited merely to the scientific and technical but extend to all specialized knowledge.similarly,the expert is viewed,not in a narrow sense,but as a person qualified by knowledge,skill,experience,training or education.thus within the scope of the rule are not only experts in the strictest sense of the word,physicians,physicists,and architects,but also the large group sometimes called skilled witnesses,such as bankers or landowners testifying to land values.
fed.evid,advisory committee notes to proposed rule.
