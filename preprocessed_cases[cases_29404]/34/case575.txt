background 
in early,cormier met with his friend david finch finch and began to discuss plans to rob drug dealers and purchase guns.cormier also met with stephen depka depka,with whom he discussed a proposal to transport marijuana from maine to massachusetts.depka refused the proposal.cormier nevertheless began investigating potential robbery targets.
the darragh robbery 
finch,tracy paquette paquette,suggested to cormier that he rob michael darragh darragh,whom she believed to be a drug dealer and whose house was located in maine.paquette called a friend,winston hanson hanson,to verify that darragh had drugs in his house.hanson confirmed that darragh did,in fact,possess drugs.cormier later decided to include hanson in the robbery plans.
around midnight on march,cormier,finch,and hanson robbed darragh house.finch and cormier put on ski masks and gloves and broke into darragh house hanson stayed in the car as a lookout.cormier and finch found darragh inside his house.when confronted with a gun,darragh told cormier and finch that his drugs were in his jacket pocket.finch removed to oxycontin pills,some percocet pills,and knives from the jacket.finch also took in cash.after the robbery,cormier,finch,and hanson returned to hanson home.there was general agreement among witnesses at trial that cormier took all of the money.in addition,finch testified at trial that cormier traded pills to hanson for marijuana,whereas hanson testified that cormier paid for the marijuana in cash.after the darragh robbery,cormier had an acquaintance purchase a ruger magnum gun for him.
the kane robbery 
the second robbery took place on june,also in maine,at the house of steve kane,a drug dealer known to cormier.cormier and finch obtained the help of michael gleason gleason for the robbery hanson was no longer involved.paquette drove gleason and cormier to kane house,armed with the ruger magnum,ski masks,gloves,and zip ties,as well as,which were to be used to contact finch at the conclusion of the robbery.cormier and gleason entered kane house,but found nobody at home.gleason searched the house and discovered a rifle and a handgun,which he took.cormier and gleason then waited for kane to come home.kane arrived at his house carrying a duffel bag.cormier and gleason confronted kane,and told him that they wanted his money and marijuana.gleason took five pounds of marijuana from kane duffel bag and from kane truck.cormier and gleason then fled.finch picked up cormier and gleason in a cemetery near kane home.upon returning to finch home,the proceeds of the robbery were divided.cormier allocated to finch and paquette one pound of the stolen marijuana to share and divided the remainder between himself and gleason.cormier,finch,and gleason then proceeded to smoke some of the marijuana.
the dyer robbery 
the third robbery took place a few hours after the kane robbery.cormier had heard that tom dyer dyer had previously been arrested for possession of large amounts of marijuana and believed that dyer would likely have drugs at his house.finch drove cormier and gleason in paquette car to dyer home.upon arriving,cormier,finch,and gleason congregated in front of dyer house discussing their plans.dyer awoke and went to investigate.cormier broke the front window with his gun,reached in to unlock the door,and entered the house.dyer yelled that he was going to call the police.the police arrived,and cormier,gleason and finch scattered.
gleason was apprehended shortly after police arrived.finch spent the night in the woods by dyer house,but was apprehended the next morning.paquette car was discovered near dyer home after paquette consented to a search of it,wallets belonging to gleason and finch,as well as gloves and were found therein.cormier escaped by stealing a canoe,paddling across a lake,and walking to a donut shop,where he called his girlfriend to pick him up.cormier called paquette the morning following the attempted robbery of dyer and instructed her to give finch,gleason,and himself their respective shares of marijuana as per their discussion the previous night,and that gleason share should go to jeff simpson simpson to pay for gleason bail.cormier also instructed paquette that a man would come to collect his share of the marijuana and guns,which were left in a bag.five days after the robbery,vincent andrews andrews,an acquaintance of cormier,arrived at paquette house to collect cormier bag.andrews testified at trial that cormier had paid him to retrieve the bag,but that he never looked inside it.a year after the attempted dyer robbery,cormier was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute,conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance,possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking offense,and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
motion to exclude the atf agent testimony 
prior to trial,the government notified cormier that it would offer brent mcsweyn mcsweyn,an alcohol tobacco and firearms agent,to testify as an expert regarding whether the guns used in the crimes had passed through interstate commerce cormier made a motion in limine to exclude mcsweyn testimony.in response,the government explained that mcsweyn had testified before as an interstate nexus expert,and had toured gun manufacturing facilities,spoken with manufacturers,and consulted reference materials.mcsweyn submitted a written interstate nexus statement in response to cormier motion,in which mcsweyn stated that the firearms charged in the indictment were manufactured outside of maine and thus had traveled in interstate commerce.the statement indicated that mcsweyn had inspected the ruger magnum and compared it with manufacturing records,two reference texts,and his observations in manufacturing plants.the statement further indicated that mcsweyn had compared a written description of the rifle,including model,caliber,and serial number,with manufacturing reports and reference texts.lastly,the statement indicated that mcsweyn had compared a written description of the handgun with manufacturing reports,reference texts,observations in manufacturing plants,and a firearms trace report.the court tentatively overruled cormier objections to mcsweyn testimony,but allowed cormier to voir dire him.during voir dire,mcsweyn testified that the gun manufacturer records he relied upon were not available to the public.after cormier concluded the voir dire,the court reaffirmed its denial of cormier motion,noting that the public could percent of the time receive information as to manufacturer and location from the public record,but that of course,does not take away from the ability to offer expert testimony on a particular issue.
the opening statement 
the trial began in march.during her opening statement,the prosecutor said 
you will hear from michael gleason and mike darragh and jody darragh,and from the start they admitted they were drug dealers and told the truth and you will also hear from tracy paquette and from david finch and it will be up to you to determine whether they are telling the truth.
cormier objected the court sustained the objection,noting,that is for closing.the prosecutor continued,stating 
and you will hear from travis sawyer who bought the,and victims of the bucksport robbery.he had to admit that he was dealing marijuana before he could come in and testify in court and you will hear from meg donelan,cormier girlfriend,who drove him home and covered for him when the police came for interview.these people are not people who want to help the police,they are not people who volunteer information and not people who by any means who would choose to be on the stand testifying.
cormier objected again,and the court sustained the objection,cautioning,it not argument.this is opening in terms of what you expect to show for evidence.the prosecutor continued,stating 
the other point i wanted to make,and understanding that the key witnesses might have credibility problems,is that the government has taken every step it could to corroborate as many of the details these witnesses will testify to as possible describing some of the corroboration while the first line of witnesses may be impeachable,this second line of witnesses and evidence is not.
cormier again objected,and the court sustained the objection,warning the prosecutor not to indicate argument as to what is impeachable or not.present the evidence you going to present.cormier then moved for a mistrial.the court denied the motion,stating 
i think there were instances where the prosecutor came close to vouching for witnesses or indicating the witnesses were telling the truth.i do know that you stepped over that line.i was uncomfortable as to the degree of closeness.i will give the jury a cautionary instruction.i think in terms of this case,i do think it has poisoned the well.this is a long trial,i not sure that the jury will remember anything about openings by the time they get this case.i will give them cautionary instructions and we move on.i do think they have been poisoned by what they heard.
the court then cautioned the jury 
i told you earlier statements by counsel are not evidence and therefore you have not heard any evidence in this case.what they told you is not evidence.number two.to the degree counsel has indicated to you that they believe a particular witness is telling the truth or not telling the truth,disregard that entirely,it is not for counsel to indicate,it up to you to determine.in addition,counsel is not permitted to indicate to you that they believe someone is telling the truth or they are likely telling the truth.there again,it is for you to understand and determine and not for anyone else to tell you or to determine.so you are to ignore entirely such statements.
the trial proceeded,and the government witnesses,including finch,paquette,and gleason testified to the foregoing facts.in particular,atf agent mcsweyn testified in accordance with the interstate nexus report he had offered in response to cormier motion.agent mcsweyn testified that the ruger magnum was manufactured in new hampshire and shipped to a distributor in massachusetts,and then was shipped to a retailer in maine where it was purchased.agent mcsweyn further testified that the handgun was manufactured in arizona or new hampshire and that the rifle was manufactured in connecticut.cormier objected every time agent mcsweyn testified about the origin of a firearm.
cormier chose not to testify in his own defense.on,finch admitted that he had lied about the robberies in his testimony before a grand jury.finch,paquette,and gleason all admitted that they cooperated with the police in exchange for more lenient sentences.in addition,finch and gleason admitted to having prior criminal records.
the closing argument 
during her closing argument,the prosecutor stated 
so when you make your credibility determinations,ladies and gentlemen,bear in mind that it not just what the witnesses said that you can consider to determine whether they are telling the truth.all of that evidence that i just gone over in some detail bolsters what they said here on the stand.
the ultimate decision on credibility is yours but the government suggests that it took a lot of honor and courage for those witnesses to testify,to stare cormier in the face and tell their stories and that they are worthy of their belief.
i said during my opening that one of the things you will need to consider in this case is cormier own words and actions,because what else better is there to tell what a person is thinking than by watching what they are saying what they are doing.i would like you to review one last point on the issue of cormier own credibility ladies and gentlemen,it is said you can tell a lot about a person by the company he keeps.this week you have seen on the witness stand the company that lionel cormier keeps.they were robbers.they were drug dealers.they were felons.they were drug addicts.the government sure did not choose the witnesses in this case,in fact in a very real sense cormier did.because until cormier was charged with this crime,these people were his trusted associates,his long time friends,even the woman with whom he shared his home.
the witnesses may not be model citizens,and they may not be people you want your children to marry,but their testimony is worthy of your belief,especially when considered in the light of all the other evidence you will have before you in your deliberations.
cormier moved for a mistrial,arguing,cormier credibility is not an issue in this trial.the court denied the motion,replying 
g overnment counsel has come perilously close on closing to comment ing on the defendant non testimony,including the statements with regard to the what only evidence in the case is and the comments on his credibility the government also came perilously close by vouching for certain witness testimony i do think that the closing stepped over the line and i not going to declare a mistrial.
the court then offered to give additional instructions to the jury if the defense so requested,but cormier declined to do so.
the jury instructions 
at the conclusion of the trial,cormier requested a jury instruction based on his reading of the holding of the second circuit in united states swiderski,cir.cormier proposed jury instruction stated,in part i f you find that individuals jointly and simultaneously possessed the drugs with the intent to share them amongst themselves as users,you may not find the defendant guilty of distribution,aiding and abetting distribution,or possession with intent to distribute.
the court instructed the jury w hen individuals come into joint actual possession of a quantity of drugs that they intend to keep for their own personal use,there is no intent to distribute under the law emphasis added.cormier objected to the jury instruction on the grounds that it included the word actual when describing joint possession.the court overruled cormier objection.
the court further instructed the jury 
the defendant has a constitutional right not to testify and no inference of guilt or anything else may be drawn from the fact that the defendant did not testify f or any of you to draw such an inference against this defendant would be wrong,indeed,it would be a violation of your oath as a juror y ou do not have to accept the testimony of any witness if you believe that the witness was not credible arguments and statements by lawyers are not evidence.
the jury convicted cormier on all counts.cormier was sentenced to a total of months imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release.cormier now appeals his conviction.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
cormier begins by arguing that the jury had insufficient evidence to find that he intended to distribute the drugs he obtained during the robberies.we review cormier challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states hall,cir.
taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,it appears that cormier gave some of the stolen drugs to finch,who was not physically present when the kane robbery occurred,and paquette,who was only tangentially involved in the robberies there was also testimony that cormier traded pills to hanson to purchase marijuana.in addition,cormier directed that some of the stolen marijuana be given to simpson,who did not participate in the robberies,to pay for gleason bail.furthermore,the evidence shows that cormier requested the help of another person depka in distributing drugs.even though depka later refused to help,that refusal does not negate cormier intent to distribute the drugs.united states dixon,cir holding that a sentencing guidelines enhancement turns on a defendant subjective intent,without regard to factual impossibility.the quantity of marijuana retained by least two not dispositive,at least suggests that it ma
