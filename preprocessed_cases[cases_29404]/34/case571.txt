during its last term,the supreme court held that a violation of the knock and announce rule in the course of executing a search warrant did not justify the suppression of evidence subsequently discovered.see hudson michigan,d.this appeal requires us to determine whether hudson should be extended to a knock and announce violation committed in the course of executing an arrest warrant.we conclude that the hudson court reasoning mandates such an extension.that conclusion,coupled with our conclusion that the defendant other arguments are unavailing,prompts us to affirm the judgment below.
background 
the relevant facts are assembled in the magistrate judge recommended decision,see united states pelletier,no.crim,wl,at.july,which the district court adopted in denying the motion to suppress.we assume the reader familiarity with this exegetic account and rehearse here only those facts that are needed to place the appeal in perspective.
on december,the united states parole commission issued an arrest warrant for multiple parole violations all involving the use of controlled substances directed at joseph pelletier.around the same time,the maine drug enforcement agency and the topsham police department,having come to suspect that the defendant was dealing drugs,obtained a state warrant authorizing the search of the defendant home on augusta road in bowdoin,maine.deputy united states marshals charged with executing the federal arrest warrant coordinated their efforts with the officers assigned to execute the state search warrant.
at around on the morning of january,a team of law enforcement agents arrived at the augusta road residence.the agents effected an entry by main force.once inside,they encountered the defendant girlfriend,cheryl sprague.as the search progressed,some of the officers questioned sprague and her sister,jennifer sewall who arrived at the house shortly after the entry.both women disclaimed any knowledge of the defendant whereabouts.
officers then repaired to the sewall residence and interviewed jennifer husband.he ruminated that the defendant might be at a motel in augusta,maine.jennifer sewall subsequently confirmed that the defendant was staying in room at the econo lodge motel.
the officers reached the motel at about.they learned that room was registered in jennifer sewall name.when shown a photograph,however,a maintenance man identified the defendant as the occupant.at that juncture,about six to eight officers lined up outside the room.an officer knocked loudly four or five times in rapid succession,eliciting no response.approximately ten to fifteen seconds after the first knock,the officer used a passkey obtained from the maintenance man to open the door.he yelled police while his comrades fanned out into the room.they found the defendant on the bed.
the defendant offered no resistance as the officers handcuffed him.the room contained drug paraphernalia in plain view,including a glass crack pipe,a propane torch,steel wool,glassine baggies,and hypodermic needles.in a partially open drawer,the officers observed a thick wad of cash later determined to aggregate and a plastic container of an unknown substance later determined to be heroin.the marshals arrested the defendant for parole violations and,according to prosecution witnesses,the defendant was informed of his miranda rights.see miranda arizona,d.
in due course,a federal grand jury charged the defendant with a single count of possession of heroin with intent to distribute.see a.in a pretrial motion to suppress,the defendant argued that the officers failure to comply with the knock and announce rule demanded exclusion of all subsequently gathered evidence and statements.see wong sun united states,d outlawing prosecutorial use of fruits of the poisonous tree.as part of this argument,he asserted that the arrest warrant did not justify an entry into his motel room that the authorities needed to have a search warrant before seizing any items and that his statements should be suppressed because they had been obtained involuntarily.
the district court referred the suppression motion to a magistrate judge.following an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge determined that the only preserved issues were i the effect of the officers noncompliance with the knock and announce rule and ii the alleged involuntariness of the defendant statements he resolved both issues in the government favor.although the government conceded the knock and announce violation,the magistrate judge,ruling before the supreme court decided hudson,found that exigent circumstances justified the failure properly to knock and announce.as to the second issue,the magistrate judge found that the police had administered appropriate miranda warnings and that no impermissible promises or threats had been made.
based on these findings,the magistrate judge recommended wholesale denial of the motion to suppress.the defendant objected,but the district court nonetheless embraced the recommendation and denied the motion.see united states pelletier,no.crim,wl,at.the defendant thereafter entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving the right to appeal the suppression rulings.see.a.the district court sentenced the defendant as a career offender to a incarcerative term.this appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,the defendant advances three arguments.his flagship claim is that the officers admitted failure to comply with the knock and announce rule rendered their entry into the motel room unconstitutional and,thus,required suppression of all the evidence that the illegal entry yielded.second,the defendant asseverates that his statements should be suppressed because they were obtained involuntarily.third,and finally,he complains of sentencing error.we consider these contentions sequentially.
knock and announce.
we begin with the government conceded violation of the knock and announce rule.that rule,extant at common law,has been codified in a federal statute that provides 
the officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house,or any part of a house,or anything therein,to execute a search warrant,if,after notice of his authority and purpose,he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.
the rule is not a freestanding expression of policy but,rather,is a command of the fourth amendment.hudson.at.it applies equally to officers wielding arrest warrants and officers wielding search warrants.see united states alejandro,cir.
in terms,the rule requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence and authority prior to effecting a entry into a dwelling.see richards wisconsin,d wilson arkansas,d.it is,however,that in exigent circumstances law enforcement officers may eschew compliance with the rule.see united states ramirez,d richards,at.
during the pendency of this appeal,the hudson court added a further refinement.in that case,the police had obtained a warrant to search for drugs and guns at hudson abode.while executing the warrant,the officers announced their presence,but tarried only three to five seconds before turning the doorknob and entering.see hudson.at.
hudson sought suppression of evidence subsequently gleaned on the ground that the premature entry violated his fourth amendment rights.the court reiterated the interests protected by the knock and announce rule,including the preemption of violent measures,the safeguarding of property,and the respecting of human dignity.id.at.it proceeded to distinguish those interests from the interests protected by,for example,the requirement of a valid search warrant,the core purpose of which is to shield persons,houses,papers,and effects from desultory government scrutiny.id.quoting const.amend.iv.as compared to the latter,exclusion of evidence obtained in the case of a knock and announce violation simpliciter would not serve to vindicate the interests at stake.id.at.weighing the potential deterrent value of applying the exclusionary rule against the potential social costs,the court concluded that the balance did not favor exclusion.id.at.
in the case at hand,the defendant opening brief,filed prior to the hudson court decision,argued that no exigent circumstance justified the officers noncompliance with the knock and announce rule and that,therefore,the entry was illegal.the opinion in hudson makes clear,however,that an inquiring court should undertake an exigent circumstances analysis only to determine whether there has been a knock and announce violation in the first instance,not to determine if,in the face of an acknowledged violation,evidence should be suppressed.see id.at.recognizing the import of this clarification,the defendant shifted gears in his reply brief and attempted to distinguish hudson by arguing that here,unlike in hudson,there was no underlying authority to enter the premises.although the government maintains that the defendant paid insufficient attention to this argument below,the timing of the hudson decision and the ambiguities in the record prompt us to meet the argument.we proceed to that task.
it is law that an arrest warrant carries with it,by implication,a limited grant of authority to enter the target residence so long as there is reason to believe that the target is inside.see payton new york,d.generally speaking,this principle extends to the target hotel or motel room,since such an accommodation is akin to a temporary residence.see stoner california,d united states beaudoin,cir see also united states weems,cir noting in dictum that if the defendant effectively lived where he was found,the arrest warrant itself would be enough to authorize entry to effectuate his arrest.here,however,there are two possible barriers that prevent us from summarily resolving the issue on the basis of these precedents.
first,the defendant suggests that the motel room was not his because it was registered to jennifer sewall.the suggestion is that,at least in the absence of consent or exigent circumstances,even when armed with an arrest warrant,police must generally have a search warrant to enter lawfully a third person home.joyce town of tewksbury,cir en banc per curiam.this potential barrier is easily surmounted.
leaving aside an obvious concern about the defendant standing to raise this point at all,minnesota carter,d holding that defendants had no legitimate expectation of privacy in apartment in which they briefly conducted activities,the joyce pronouncement does not help the defendant.the reason behind the pronouncement is clear a rmed solely with an arrest warrant for a single person,the police could search all the homes of that individual friends and acquaintances.steagald united states,d.
it is readily evident that this reasoning finds no traction in the soil of this case.the record makes manifest that regardless of the name in which the motel room was registered,the only the occupying it.after all,at the suppression hearing the defendant admitted that he had been staying at the motel for a pproximately three weeks.moreover,throughout his appellate briefs the defendant refers to the room as his room or his hotel room.see,appellant br.at.there is no evidence that either jennifer sewall who informed the officers that she lived with her husband,not at the motel or any other individual occupied the room during the relevant time frame.
that gets the grease from the goose.because the defendant was the sole resident of room,the officers entry on the basis of a warrant for the defendant arrest did not jeopardize any cognizable interest.joyce is,therefore,inapposite.
the second potential barrier arises out of the fact that payton authorized an entry of a dwelling pursuant to an arrest warrant founded on probable cause.see payton,at.in this instance,the arresting officers wielded a parole violation warrant,see,which by its terms was issued on the basis of reliable information that the defendant had breached the conditions of his parole.in some cases,such a distinction might make a dispositive difference.skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d except in certain circumstances,a search or seizure is not reasonable unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause.here,however,that is not the case.
although the nature of the instant warrant might appear at first blush to cut against the government,it in fact cuts the other way.it is settled beyond hope of contradiction that parolees are not entitled to the same panoply of fourth amendment protections as are ordinary citizens.see samson california,d see also united states winchenbach,cir explaining that an exception to payton arrest warrant requirement applies in cases of parolees and probationers.thus,a valid parole violation warrant,issued on the basis of reasonable grounds to believe that a parolee has violated the conditions of his parole,is adequate to support an entry into the parolee domicile for the purpose of executing the warrant.see united states cardona,cir.it is immaterial to this fourth amendment analysis that no parole or probation officer is present when law enforcement agents enter the parolee premises to execute the warrant.see id.
here,the magistrate judge supportably found that the defendant had waived any challenge to the validity of the parole violation warrant.see supra note.on appeal the defendant has not attempted to argue that the warrant was issued on the basis of a constitutionally infirm predicate.we must,therefore,treat the parole violation warrant as valid and enforceable.doing so,we conclude that the warrant provided the officers with lawful authority to enter the motel room for the purpose of arresting the defendant.
that ends this aspect of the appeal.because hudson applies with equal force in the context of an arrest warrant,the district court did not err in refusing to order suppression based upon the officers conceded violation of the knock and announce rule.
voluntariness.
next,the defendant maintains that his statements to the authorities should be suppressed because they were obtained in violation of his constitutional rights.he claims that,after administering miranda warnings the officers dangled improper incentives to secure his cooperation,such as offering to ditch certain incriminating says that one of the officers went so far as to stomp on a glass crack pipe,shattering it while promising that,in return for cooperation,w e can forget about this stuff and assuring him that cooperation would make it less likely that he would be classified as a career offender.
the magistrate judge,who saw and heard the witnesses at the suppression hearing,credited the officers testimony that,from the outset,the defendant was cooperative,responsive,and keenly interested in what they might be able to do to make his lot easier.the judge found that no untoward threats or promises had been voiced the officers merely conveyed to the defendant that they would discuss with the prosecution the extent to which he had cooperated.pelletier,wl,at.relatedly,the magistrate judge found that the defendant version of the encounter,including his hyperbolic account of the crack pipe incident,was not credible.id.at.
on appeal,the defendant faces a steep uphill climb.we must accept the lower court findings of fact as long as they are not clearly erroneous and subject its conclusions of law to de novo review.see ornelas united states,d united states coplin,cir.
in this instance,the challenged determination is factbound and,thus,subject to clear error review.see united states,cir.moreover,that determination was largely the product of credibility the trier assessments of witness credibility are treated on appeal with great respect.see,united states laine,cir united states charles,cir.scouring the record,we discern no error,clear or otherwise,in the magistrate judge findings.
to say more on this subject would be to paint the lily.a determination about whether police coercion has taken place inevitably hinges on the totality of the circumstances.united states byram,cir.given the facts as supportably found by the magistrate judge,there is no principled basis for concluding that the defendant statements were involuntary.
sentencing.
the defendant sentencing challenge has two facets.first,he argues that the district court incorrectly classifi
