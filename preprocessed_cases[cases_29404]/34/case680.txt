appellant michael flemmi michael is a retired boston police officer and the brother of gangster stephen flemmi stephen.until stephen arrest in and subsequent incarceration,he and james bulger bulger ran a criminal enterprise in boston the group.
in,michael was indicted and charged with two counts of obstruction of justice,in violation of one count of perjury,in violation of one count of possession of unregistered machine guns,silencers,and shotguns,in violation of,a,d,and one count of transfer and possession of machine guns,in violation of o.the charges were based on allegations that he helped hide a cache of weapons and lied to a grand jury in an attempt to impede an investigation of his brother and other members of the group.
at michael trial,the district court allowed the jury to hear evidence relating to the group and michael interactions with that group.the jury ultimately convicted michael on all counts.at sentencing,the district court,in calculating michael sentence for the perjury and obstruction of justice counts,identified murder as the most serious offense related to his unlawful conduct.on appeal,michael argues that the district court erred in admitting the above mentioned evidence and identifying murder as the relevant offense.we affirm.
background 
in november,kevin weeks weeks,a member of the group,was arrested and indicted the weeks indictment by a grand jury in worcester,massachusetts the grand jury soon after his arrest,weeks agreed to cooperate with the government and disclosed information about crimes committed by the group.weeks stated that bulger and stephen had committed three previously unsolved murders and buried the bodies at a specified location in dorchester,massachusetts weeks also said that the group had an arsenal of weapons guns and ammunition hidden in a structure behind the house of michael and stephen mother,mary flemmi flemmi,in boston,massachusetts.as a result of the information that weeks provided,the grand jury amended the weeks indictment to include bulger and stephen,who were each charged with engaging in violent racketeering activities,including assault and murder 
thereafter,law enforcement agents obtained warrants to search for the weapons and bodies weeks had described.on january,agents searched the structure behind flemmi house for the arsenal and,in a secret compartment within the structure,found a single revolver,along with ammunition and silencers.the hide,however,contained numerous shelves and gun racks and,thus,appeared capable of storing a substantial number of firearms.at the location weeks identified in dorchester,the agents unearthed the skeletal remains of three murder victims,who were subsequently identified as arthur barrett barrett,john mcintyre mcintyre,and deborah hussey hussey,the latter being stephen.
on january,two days before the agents searched the hide,william croix,stephen son,visited stephen in prison.during the visit,stephen asked croix to remove guns stephen had hidden in the structure behind his mother house.croix and his friend,michael allen allen,went to flemmi house that same day.michael was present when they arrived.croix told michael that stephen had asked croix to remove guns from a hide in the structure because he was concerned that weeks,whom he knew to be cooperating with the government,would disclose the existence and location of the hide.michael helped croix locate the hide and load the guns into bags,which croix and allen then transported to allen residence 
michael grand jury testimony 
on june,michael was called to testify before the grand jury,which was still investigating the group.michael was questioned about the structure behind his mother house,the hide,the missing guns,and the bodies unearthed in dorchester.michael told the grand jury that the last time he was in the structure was about three years ago.when michael was asked whether he had ever seen the hide,or the items recovered therefrom,before the january,search,he responded,never.michael also stated that,before january,he did not know about the hide had never conversed with anyone about the hide had never seen any firearms at his mother house did not know whether there were ever rifles in the hide and did not know whose property was recovered from the hide or how it came to be situated there.finally,when michael was asked whether he knew if stephen,hussey,was alive,he answered,i do know.yet,a few months before,in january of,while he and croix were visiting stephen in prison,stephen confessed to killing hussey.
the grand jury subsequently added michael to the weeks indictment.he was charged with obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with the removal of the guns from the hide and his grand jury testimony,and with unlawful possession of firearms.
michael trial 
michael was tried separately from the other indicted parties.at his trial,which began on april,the government called croix and allen to testify that michael had helped them remove guns from the hide.the government also presented evidence that the guns met the statutory requirements for the firearms charges,and it played for the jury a recording of michael grand jury testimony.in addition,the government was permitted to ask croix and weeks about the group,its criminal exploits,and michael contacts with the group.nevertheless,the jury was instructed,on more than one occasion,that michael was not charged with complicity in the crimes carried out by the organization,and it was reminded that it was to confine its deliberations to the crimes with which michael was actually charged.
michael defense at trial was that he had nothing to do with the removal of the guns from the insisted that any testimony on the part of the government witnesses to the contrary was false.the jury ultimately convicted michael on all counts.
michael sentencing 
michael was sentenced on september.in order to determine michael sentence for perjury and obstruction of justice,the district court had to identify the most serious substantive offense related to his unlawful conduct the district court,adopting the position taken in the united states probation office report psr,decided that the relevant offense was murder and sentenced michael accordingly.
present appeal 
on appeal,michael argues that the district court erred in admitting croix and weeks testimony about the group,its criminal activities,and michael interactions with the group.he insists that the testimony pertaining to the group and its criminal exploits was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial and,as such,should have been excluded pursuant to federal rules of evidence,and the testimony describing his interactions with the group was unfairly prejudicial evidence of uncharged misconduct that should have been excluded under federal rules of evidence and b and even if the district court did not err in admitting the challenged evidence for the reasons stated above,the testimony describing statements made by stephen to weeks and croix was hearsay that was erroneously admitted under federal rule of evidence d e.furthermore,michael asserts that the district court,in calculating his sentence for perjury and obstruction of justice,erred in determining that the most serious offense related to those charges was murder.we address these arguments seriatim.
ii.michael evidentiary challenges 
as a general matter,w e review the district court decision to admit the disputed evidence for abuse of discretion.united states mcguire,cir see also richards relentless,cir reviewing relevancy determinations for abuse of discretion united states balsam,cir reviewing rulings pursuant to rules and b for abuse of discretion.if,however,there was no objection to the admission of the evidence at trial,our review is only for plain error see united states duarte,cir.we will not find plain error unless an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected michael substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
evidence of the group and its exploits 
we begin by evaluating the admission of the testimony concerning the group and its criminal exploits.michael argues that because this testimony,which is described in detail below,was only marginally relevant,if at all,to the charged offenses and unfairly prejudicial,it should have been excluded under rules,and.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.generally,a ll relevant evidence is admissible,while e vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.however,even if evidence is relevant,it may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.we note at the outset that o nly in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states sabetta,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
testimony describing persons involved with the group 
michael first questions the admission of croix testimony concerning individuals involved with the group.specifically,he contests the admission of statements that stephen and bulger were partners in a criminal organization the group george kaufman and phil costa were members of,and collected money owed to,that organization and frank salemme was the head of the new england mafia and stephen ally.
the admission of these statements was not an abuse of discretion.michael was charged with obstructing an investigation into the group and these statements were relevant because they provided the jury with useful background introduced individuals associated with the investigation that michael was charged with obstructing.see united states gonzalez,cir to be relevant,evidence need only tend to prove the government case,and evidence that adds context and dimension to the government proof of the charges can have that tendency.relevant evidence is not confined to that which directly establishes an element of the crime.see also united states daly,cir t he trial court may admit evidence that does not directly establish an element of the offense charged,in order to provide background for the events alleged in the indictment.
moreover,the testimony was not unfairly prejudicial to michael,as croix never suggested that michael was a member of the group.and,any prejudice that it may have caused was mitigated by the district court limiting instructions.
testimony about an x fund 
michael next objects to the admission of weeks testimony that the group had an x fund a fund comprised of money that was put aside every time we made a score for expenses that would come up,you know payoffs.the testimony was relevant because it indicated that the members of the group were intent on concealing the group criminal activities,and thus,it tended to support the government theory that stephen recruited croix who,in turn,recruited michael to remove guns from the hide.and,any claim that the testimony was unfairly prejudicial to michael is weak because weeks never indicated that michael had anything to do with the x fund.there was no error in the admission of this testimony.
testimony about the use of coded communications 
michael also asserts that the district court erred in admitting croix testimony that,when possible,croix,weeks,allen,and michael avoided using intercom phones when communicating with stephen in prison they would,for example,hold up signs and gesture with their hands,and weeks testimony that members of the group used nicknames when referring to law enforcement agents in front of michael and that michael understood the coded references.this testimony was highly relevant because it indicated that michael was a trusted ally of the group such that it would not be unreasonable to think that croix would have enlisted his help in moving the guns and that he was aware of,and willing to cover up,the group activities which helped establish his knowledge of the group and his brother unlawful behavior,as well as his intent to commit the crimes with which he was charged.we do not think that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony based on its high probative value.we also note that any danger of unfair prejudice was considerably lessened by the limiting instructions the district court gave.
testimony about the group criminal activities 
in addition,michael attacks the admission of weeks testimony concerning the three,mcintyre,and were murdered in weeks presence and buried in dorchester two others,brian halloran halloran and michael donahue donahue,who were also murdered in weeks presence and the group unlawful acquisition of a liquor store in which weeks was directly involved.with regard to the murder victims,weeks gave a brief account of the circumstances surrounding each murder in terms of the liquor store,weeks stated that he intimidated the owners of the store by brandishing a gun so they would sell the store to the group.
the government defends the admission of this testimony by pointing out that the testimony which brought to the fore weeks extensive criminal history was important to weeks credibility and arguing that such impeachment evidence may be elicited on direct examination there is support for the government position.see united states frappier,cir t he prosecution,having called a witness,may then take the wind out of the sails of the defense by questions eliciting possible bases for impeachment.see also.the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party,including the party calling the witness.michael even concedes that informing a jury of the nature of a witness prior criminal conduct is fair game.nevertheless,he contests the admission of weeks testimony on the ground that the prejudicial effect of permitting the government to delve into the particulars of the group crimes substantially outweighed the testimony probative value.we disagree.although there may be circumstances where a criminal defendant would be wronged if the prosecution were allowed to delve too deeply into the particulars of its witness criminal history on direct,we do not think that this is such a case.here,all but one of the statements had significant probative value and,there was little danger of unfair prejudice there was no suggestion that michael was involved in the crimes that weeks described and the jury was instructed to that effect.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting weeks testimony.see united states dworken,cir it is perhaps true that the government could have made due without so much detail concerning the prior events,but this is essentially a rule balancing decision left to the broad discretion of the trial judge.emphasis in original.
testimony that weeks sought a gun from stephen 
the next challenge concerns weeks testimony that he visited stephen in prison and asked stephen for permission to take one of the guns from the hide so he could act on threats that had been made against him.according to weeks,stephen agreed to the request and stated that stephen,weeks,and bulger were the only ones who knew about the hide.on appeal,michael disputes only the admission of that portion of the testimony where weeks stated that he sought a gun to act on threats made against him.the challenged statement was relevant because it prompted,and provided context to,the unchallenged,and clearly relevant,testimony concerning the hide see sabetta,at recognizing that testimony is relevant if it helps explain the chain of events.although the challenged statement probative value may not have been particularly high,we do not see how its admission caused michael unfair was no indication that michael knew of the conversation between stephen and weeks or weeks plan to act on the threats made against him.consequently,there was no error in the testimony admission.
testimony regarding a bombing in which stephen was implicated 
michael also objects to the admission of croix testimony that he first obtained personal knowledge of stephen criminal activities in when he learned that stephen had been implicated in a bombing.this testimony provided relevant background to the development of the illegal relationship between croix and his father,a relationship that culminated in the concealment conspiracy in question.see united states santana,cir noting that evidence is relevant in a conspiracy case if it explains the background of the illegal relationship.and,the naked reference to a bombing in which stephen was allegedly implicated was not unfairly prejudicial to michael,as there was no allegation that michael was involved in,or knew of,the bombing.moreover,any potential prejudice was counteracted by the limiting instructions.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony.
testimony concerning croix relationship with stephen 
michael further contends that it was an abuse of discretion to allow croix to testify that he and stephen agreed that if croix chose a life of crime,stephen would show him how to do things and croix would tell stephen everything he was involved in to make sure that he did hurt any of stephen friends.we disagree.immediately after croix gave the challenged testimony,he told the jury that he took his father up on his offer and report ed to him on a regular basis.therefore,the testimony was relevant as it established the background and formation of the illegal relationship between croix and stephen,and it explained why stephen would feel comfortable telling croix about the hide and asking him to move the guns.see id.noting that,in a conspiracy case,evidence is relevant if it explains the background and formation of the illegal relationship and help s the jury understand the basis for the relationship of mutual trust internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,it is not clear how the testimony could have caused michael unfair prejudice because there was no suggestion that he was in any way involved in croix life of crime.
michael also finds fault in the admission of croix statements concerning stephen reaction after he learned that croix brother,stephen other son,refused to visit him because he was angry at him.according to croix,stephen said,what the hell has he got to worry about all he had to do was months.i may spend the rest of my life in prison.michael,however,used the testimony pertaining to the length of stephen prison term to his advantage when he later relied on the likelihood that stephen would spend the rest of his life in prison in presenting his defense in his closing argument,michael argued that croix was angry at his father for killing hussey and that,because he could not take direct revenge against his father,who would likely spend the rest of his natural life in prison,he falsely testified against michael as an indirect way to punish stephen.under the circumstances,michael can hardly complain of prejudicial error.see,united states,cir.
in any event,there was no error in the admission of this testimony.the testimony was relevant because it helped establish that croix was upset with his father croix testified that his father cavalier reaction to his brother anger really upset him and thus,it supported michael defense that croix falsely testified against him as a way to punish stephen.see frappier,at stating that the prosecution may elicit possible bases for impeachment on direct.moreover,we do not see how the testimony,which in no way reflected on michael,could have caused michael unfair prejudice.
testimony that stephen confessed to murdering hussey 
michael next disputes the admission of croix testimony that,on january,stephen admitted to killing hussey in front of croix and michael.he did not object to the admission of this testimony below,and we do not find any error,much less plain error,in its admission.the testimony was highly relevant because michael was charged with,among other things,perjuring himself before the grand jury,and on june,subsequent to the conversation in question,he told the grand jury that he had no idea whether hussey was alive although the testimony was certainly damaging to michael,the district court did not err in finding that the danger of unfair prejudice did not outweigh the testimony probative value.
testimony about defense funds 
this brings us to the final piece of testimony pertinent to the group and its criminal exploits that michael challenges on appeal croix testimony about the existence of defense funds for members of the group.despite michael insistence to the contrary,the district court did not err in allowing croix to testify that a portion of the proceeds from the illegal activities in which he was involved were used to pay the legal expenses of stephen and some of his associates.the testimony was relevant for impeachment purposes its admission enabled the government to bring out on direct examination the fact that croix was engaged in illegal activities,see frappier,at,and because it provided insight into the relationship between croix and stephen,see santana,at.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,because the testimony did not implicate michael in croix illegal activities.
evidence of michael interactions with the group 
we now consider whether the district court erred in admitting testimony pertaining to michael interactions with the group.michael argues that this testimony constituted unduly prejudicial evidence of uncharged misconduct that should have been excluded pursuant to rules and b.rule b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.nevertheless,
other bad acts evidence is admissible so long as the following,test is satisfied first,in accordance with rule b,the evidence must have special relevance to an issue in the case such as motive,intent or knowledge,and must not include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain second,consistent with rule,the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
united states mcguire,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we identify,and evaluate michael objections to,the relevant statements below.
testimony concerning michael interactions with weeks 
weeks was permitted to tell the jury that he engaged in loan sharking in michael presence without trepidation because michael was ste phen brother and weeks trusted him.weeks also testified that,after his gun license was revoked,michael saw him with guns and,on two occasions,loaned him a gun.weeks stated that he was not afraid that michael was going to arrest him for carrying a gun without a license.michael objects to the admission of this testimony for the first time on appeal,and as a result,our review is for plain error.
we find no error,and therefore,no plain error,in the admission of this testimony.the government tried michael on the theory that he lied and obstructed justice to shield members of the group from prosecution.thus,the testimony had special relevance in that it demonstrated michael knowledge that members of the group engaged in unlawful activities and evidenced his intent to protect those individuals from facing the legal consequences of their actions moreover,we do not think that the district court abused its discretion in balancing the probative value of this testimony against the danger of unfair prejudice.
testimony that michael handled stephen criminal affairs 
the next challenge involves testimony that michael helped handle stephen affairs while stephen was in prison.croix testified that after phil costa died and weeks was indicted,he and michael were the only people left to handle stephen affairs on the outside.croix also testified that,after stephen arrest,michael was picking up money from various bookmakers owed to stephen.in addition,weeks testified that michael participate d in th e process of picking up proceeds from an extortionate sale.
michael insists that the district court should have excluded the above statements.we disagree.the statements were specially relevant not only to show that michael had knowledge of,and occasionally assisted in,stephen illegal activities which helped establish that he had a motive to engage in the crimes with which he was conceal from the grand jury his and his brother wrongdoing,as well as the intent to do so,but also to demonstrate that while stephen was in prison,croix and michael were among the few people he trusted to help him with his illegal activities.this explains why stephen would feel comfortable telling croix about the hide and asking him to move the guns and why croix would then feel comfortable enlisting michael to help.see santana,at allowing the admission of rule b evidence to explain the trust that existed among the coconspirators.although the testimony may have caused the jury to view michael in a negative light,we do not think that the district court erred in admitting the evidence after balancing its significant probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice.
testimony that michael informed weeks of stephen arrest 
michael also contests the admission of weeks statement that michael told him that stephen had been arrested soon after the arrest.michael claim is unavailing.the statement had special relevance that could reasonably have been found to outweigh any danger of unfair prejudice,as it helped establish michael knowledge of stephen legal troubles and wrongdoing.moreover,the statement was independently admissible as a necessary component of weeks ensuing testimony,the admission of which michael does not contest.weeks testified that he responded to the news about stephen arrest by telling michael,i told stephen to take off,to which michael replied,i know,i know.this exchange is probative of michael knowledge of stephen criminal wrongdoing and intent to obstruct justice michael acknowledged that he was aware that stephen had been told to take off to avoid capture.
coconspirator statements 
having disposed of michael claims involving the testimony of his interactions with the group,we turn our attention to his final evidentiary challenge,which is premised on his assertion that the district court erred in admitting all of the above testimony that describes statements stephen made to weeks and croix because that testimony related inadmissible hearsay michael claims that,despite the district court apparent finding to the contrary,the statements did not satisfy the requirements of rule d e,which provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.as an initial matter,there are only two statements made by stephen that would even arguably constitute hearsay but for the application of rule d e his statement to weeks that only he,weeks,and bulger knew of the hide,and his statement to michael and croix that he killed hussey 
to invoke rule d e,the government bears the burden of establishing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed,and that the declarant uttered the statement s during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states bradshaw,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant who wishes to preserve for appeal a challenge to the admission of statements under rule d e must request,at the close of all the evidence,that the district court make a determination as to whether the government carried its burden.see united states ortiz,cir.a defendant failure to object to the omission of such an express determination bars him from raising the point on appeal in the absence of plain error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.because the district court did not make,and michael did not ask for,an express determination,our review is for plain error.id.
we do not think that michael has demonstrated that the admission of the challenged statements was error and,ergo,he has not shown plain error.the government certainly established that michael was involved in a conspiracy with stephen,weeks,croix,and allen to conceal the illegal activities of the group nevertheless,michael asserts that the statements should have been excluded because there was no evidence that he was a coconspirator at the time they were made.but,whether michael was a coconspirator at the time the statements were made is have held that an individual who joins a conspiracy at a later date,effectively adopt s coconspirator declarations previously made.united states saccoccia,cir.
in addition,michael claims that the statements were not made in furtherance of the conspiracy,but that claim also fails.a coconspirator statement is considered to be in furtherance of the conspiracy as long as it tends to promote one or more of the objects of the conspiracy.united states piper,cir.stephen statement to weeks that stephen,weeks,and bulger were the only people who knew of the hide furthered the conspiracy because it informed a coconspirator weeks of those with knowledge of the hide,which was important to ensure that the knowledge remained contained.likewise,stephen statement to michael and croix in response to a direct question from croix that he killed hussey furthered the conspiracy because it fostered a relationship of trust among the three,and it kept michael and croix abreast of current developments and problems facing the group,united states jefferson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
harmless error 
we conclude our evidentiary discussion by noting that the one error we have identified,see supra note,was harmless and,as such,does not merit reversal of the jury verdict.it is settled that a evidentiary error is harmless and,therefore,does not require a new trial so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.piper,at.here,that standard is met.this is because the jury was presented with ample direct evidence that michael obstructed justice,committed perjury,and possessed guns.moreover,the fact that the jury was instructed that it was to confine its deliberations to the crimes with which michael was actually charged and that g uilt can never be established by the mere fact of association makes it even more unlikely that the error affected the verdict 
iii.michael sentencing challenge 
we now focus on michael sentencing challenge.michael argues that the district court erred in using murder,as opposed to gun possession,as the most serious offense underlying his obstruction of justice and perjury charges the government defends the use of murder and,in the alternative,claims that using the most serious gun possession charge would have yielded the same sentence.we review the sentencing court application of the guidelines de novo and the factual findings underlying that application for clear error.united states,cir.
we find no error in the use of murder as the underlying offense.when michael testified before the grand jury about his knowledge of the group reserve arsenal and hussey whereabouts,the grand jury was investigating,and he had reason to know it was investigating,whether members and associates of that group were involved in violent racketeering activities,such as murder.and,michael was later charged with,and convicted of,perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with that investigation.therefore,the district court was justified in using murder,and not gun possession,as the underlying offense see sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.where there is more than one potential underlying offense,the most serious such offense is to be used.
michael,nevertheless,insists that his sentence should be vacated because the district court,in determining the underlying offense,looked to the indictment,see supra note,an indictment in which he was not charged,rather than to the weeks indictment.michael argument fails because the district court in fact looked to both indictments.at sentencing,the government asserted that michael actions clearly were to benefit the group,whether it was as set forth in the indictment,or in the weeks indictment.and,the district court subsequently stated that it was adopt ing the government position.moreover,even if the district court had looked only to the indictment,michael argument would still fail.the indictment,like the weeks indictme
