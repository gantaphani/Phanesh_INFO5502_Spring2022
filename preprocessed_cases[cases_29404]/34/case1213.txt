donald turner,don wood,was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states in violation of.the district court sentenced turner to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.in addition,it ordered turner to pay in restitution to the government under.turner appeals his conviction and sentence.he asserts that the district court erred in admitting recorded conversations between his and an undercover internal revenue service irs agent and foreign bank documents that the irs seized from his residence and office.turner also argues that the district court erred in requiring him to pay in restitution because it did not make findings regarding his ability to pay.for the reasons discussed below,we will affirm.
factual background 
turner is the author of tax free how the super rich do it a book that instructed readers how to escape federal and state income taxation through the use of common law trust organizations colatos.app.he is also the former director of first american research far,a membership organization that he created to assist members in implementing the colato program described in his book.
in,turner enlisted daniel leveto,the owner of a veterinary clinic,as a new far member,and turner then assisted leveto in implementing the colato program.far created center company,a foreign colato,and appointed leveto as the general manager and turner as a consultant.leveto then sold his clinic to center company,which in turn hired leveto as the clinic manager.
after the sale,leveto continued to control and operate the clinic just as he did when he was the owner.but because the clinic was no longer in his name,leveto stopped reporting the clinic income on his individual tax returns,and consequently paid no taxes on the clinic.center company,which was now responsible for reporting the clinic income,also did not pay the clinic taxes because it distributed the clinic income to other foreign colatos,which according to turner,transformed it to untaxable foreign source income.thus,no one paid the clinic taxes.
although the clinic taxes went unpaid,leveto had full access to the clinic income through various sources,including foreign and domestic bank accounts,nominee foreign and domestic bank accounts,commodity accounts,loans from the colatos,and debit and credit cards opened under the colatos names.
in,leveto and turner executed a written agreement for leveto to market and sell tax free.leveto purchased each book from turner for and agreed to sell the books for at least each.in,the irs began a criminal investigation into leveto to determine whether leveto sale of his veterinary clinic was legitimate,and whether the colato program was valid.as part of the investigation,manuel gonzalez,an undercover irs agent,purchased tax free from leveto.after gonzalez purchased the book,he and leveto spoke about the program several times both in person and on the phone.leveto informed gonzalez about the benefits of the colato program and encouraged him to attend a far membership meeting to better understand how the program worked.several of these conversations were recorded and introduced as evidence at turner trial.
in addition,leveto submitted gonzalez name to turner as a qualified far member,who,in response,sent gonzalez a letter explaining the benefits of far and enclosing a membership application.turner also spoke with gonzalez on the phone about the colato program and far membership.
the investigation into leveto dealings with turner also involved the search of leveto residence and office.irs agents seized a large volume of documents and records from both locations,including from safes inside leveto office.the documents included leveto foreign and domestic bank records,his handwritten notes that referenced far,colatos,and tax free,correspondence with turner,evidence relating to leveto nominee accounts,and correspondence with banks,including wire transfer requests.many of these documents were introduced at turner trial.
procedural history 
in,a federal grand jury charged turner,leveto,and leveto wife,margaret leveto,with conspiracy to defraud the irs by concealing the levetos assets,and thus,preventing the irs from computing and collecting the levetos federal income taxes in violation of.before trial,turner filed a motion in limine to exclude several pieces of evidence,including the recorded conversations between leveto and gonzalez,and the foreign bank records that the irs seized from leveto office and residence.turner argued that both were inadmissible hearsay and that the government failed to properly authenticate the foreign bank documents.the district court disagreed and held them to be admissible.
the district court admitted the recorded conversations under federal rule of evidence d e,which states that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against an opposing party and was made by the party coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.it concluded that there was an unindicted conspiracy between leveto and turner to impede or impair the irs tax collection efforts by recruiting members to far,which worked with members in concealing their income from the irs,and that leveto statements to gonzalez furthered that conspiracy the district court held that the government properly authenticated the foreign bank documents and admitted documents bearing leveto signature or handwriting under federal rule of evidence d e.it admitted the rest of the contested documents under the residual hearsay exception.
the jury convicted turner of conspiracy.the district court sentenced turner to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.in addition,applying,the district court ordered turner to pay in restitution,the full amount of the government loss,without considering turner ability to pay.
turner now appeals.he contends that the district court erred in admitting the recorded conversations under rule d e because there was no evidence of a conspiracy to recruit members to far.in addition,he contends that the district court erred in admitting the foreign bank documents because the government did not properly authenticate the documents and the documents admitted under the residual hearsay exception did not have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to satisfy rule a.finally,he asserts that the district court erred in imposing restitution without making specific findings regarding his ability to pay.
the district court had jurisdiction under.this court has jurisdiction under and.
a.the conversations between leveto and gonzalez 
turner contends that the district court erred in admitting the conversations between leveto and the undercover irs agent,manuel gonzalez,under federal rule of evidence d e because the government failed to prove that a conspiracy existed between turner and leveto to recruit members to far.
federal rule of evidence d e provides that a statement by a party coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay if it is offered against that party.for an statement to be admissible under this rule,the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy existed the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered were members of the conspiracy the statement was made in the course of the conspiracy and the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states ellis,cir.to prove these elements,the government may rely on the statements themselves,if they are corroborated by independent evidence.bourjaily united states,d united states gambino,cir see also.d.statements are admissible under this rule even if the basis for admission is a conspiracy different from the one charged.ellis,at.
when a district court concludes that a conspiracy existed,we review the district court findings as to the elements outlined above for clear error.ellis,at citing united states cruz,cir.clear error exists when giving all due deference to the opportunity of the trial judge to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.commerce.ins,commerce ins.agency,cir.
having reviewed the record,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that a conspiracy existed to impair the irs tax collection efforts by recruiting members to far,which assisted members in implementing turner fraudulent tax avoidance program.the following independent evidence supports the district court decision.first,there was a written agreement between turner and leveto to sell tax free,and tax free directed readers to contact far.this directive is not surprising since turner benefited substantially if his readers joined his organization.the membership fee in was.as recruiting far members was an obvious purpose of the book,and a benefit to turner,it is a reasonable inference that turner and leveto would have also agreed that leveto a far member himself and the person interacting with turner potential clients would encourage interested customers to join far.
second,leveto met with gonzalez several times after he sold gonzalez the book.one of the meetings occurred when gonzalez appeared late and unannounced at leveto house.although leveto and his family were preparing for bed,leveto met with gonzalez for almost an hour in gonzalez car.it is reasonable to infer that leveto,who had never met gonzalez before he sold him tax free,continued meeting with gonzalez after he sold gonzalez the book to recruit him to turner far.
third,gonzalez received a letter from turner stating that leveto had submitted gonzalez name as a qualified candidate for far membership and enclosing a membership application.this supports a finding that leveto was screening and recommending potential members to turner.
finally,leveto own statements provide ample evidence of a conspiracy.for example,leveto repeatedly insisted that gonzalez attend a membership meeting with turner to fully understand the program.he assured gonzalez that turner would do phone consultations and provided gonzalez with turner telephone and fax numbers.he informed gonzalez that when two of his friends joined far that he,his friends,and turner met to discuss how best to implement the program for his friends.and he informed gonzalez that when gonzalez contacted him,he alerted turner.each of these statements suggests that leveto was not simply selling books but was actively recruiting members to far.
based on this evidence,we do not find the district court determination that a conspiracy existed to be clearly erroneous.we will therefore not disturb the district court ruling that the recorded conversations were admissible.
b.the foreign bank documents 
authentication 
turner contends that the district court erred in admitting leveto foreign bank documents because the government can not prove their authenticity.we review a district court ruling that evidence was properly authenticated for abuse of discretion.united states mcglory,cir.
federal rule of evidence a requires the authentication of evidence before a district court may admit it.the standard for authenticating evidence is slight,mcqueeney wilmington trust,cir,and may be satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.a.this court does not require conclusive proof of a document authenticity,but merely a prima facie showing of some competent evidence to support authentication.mcqueeney,at united states goichman,cir per curiam.once a prima facie case is made,the evidence goes to the jury and it is the jury who will ultimately determine the authenticity of the evidence,not the court.goichman,at.
federal rule of evidence b provides examples of appropriate methods of authentication,including reliance on t he appearance,contents,substance,internal patterns,or other distinctive characteristics of the item.b.this list is not exhaustive,however,and it is clear that the government may authenticate documents with other types of circumstantial evidence,including the circumstances surrounding the documents discovery.see mcglory,at considering that notes were found in trash outside of defendant residence as evidence of authenticity mcqueeney,at considering that documents were produced in response to a discovery request as evidence of authenticity citing burgess premier,cir holding that exhibits found in defendant warehouse were adequately authenticated simply by their being found there.we have also considered whether the information included in the evidence is widely known.see mcqueeney,at concluding that small number of people who knew the information in the evidence supported finding of authenticity.
the government easily met its slight burden here.first,the appearance of the documents support their authentication the documents have the official appearance of bank records.they bear the insignia of foreign banks,see,and contain the type of transaction data typically present on bank records,see.the documents are also internally consistent in their appearance.compare with.
second,the contents of the documents provide evidence of their authenticity.the documents were addressed to leveto home and business addresses and post office box.see.several of the documents were responsive to faxes that leveto sent.and the government reconciled many of the foreign bank documents with domestic bank records the authenticity of which turner does not challenge.moreover,the bank records included information that was not,including leveto personal account information and aliases.
third,the irs seized the records from leveto home and office and safes inside leveto office,which strongly supports a finding of authenticity because it is likely that leveto would have stored his bank records there,and his possession of the documents indicates his belief that they were important.
finally,although we agree with turner that it is the government burden to prove authentication,turner has not suggested any reason why the court should doubt the authenticity of the documents.this only bolsters our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the documents were properly authenticated.as such,we will affirm the district court holding that the documents were properly authenticated.
admissibility 
turner argues that the district court erred in admitting the foreign bank documents under federal rule of evidence because the government did not prove that the documents had exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness we review for clear error a district court finding that evidence was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible under rule.united states wright,cir.
the residual hearsay exception permits a district court to admit an statement not covered by rules or if the court determines that 
the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness it is offered as evidence of a material fact it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts and admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.
the exception is to be used only rarely,and in exceptional circumstances and appl ies only when certain exceptional guarantees of trustworthiness exist and when high degrees of probativeness and necessity are present.wright,at quoting united states bailey,cir.the determination of whether a document is sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted under rule is a highly inquiry.id.at.in making this determination,the district court may not rely exclusively on corroborating evidence.see bailey,at.
in united states pelullo,we analyzed whether bank records should be admissible under the residual earsay exception and noted that in general,bank records provide circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness because the banks and their customers rely on their accuracy in the course of their business,cir other courts of appeals have similarly concluded.see united states wilson,cir admitting foreign bank records under the residual hearsay exception,abrogated on other grounds by whitfield united states,d united states nivica,cir same karme comm r,cir same.
the district court concluded that the same evidence that supported the foreign bank docu
