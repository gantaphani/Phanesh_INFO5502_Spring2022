in this opinion,we address several issues with respect to the conviction and sentence of felix for aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation of and.previously,we remanded a portion of this case to the district court we did,however,retain jurisdiction,so that it could determine whether certain prior statements made by lawrence evans,the supervisor of both the victim of the carjacking and the appellant,were discoverable under the jencks act.see united states i,cir per curiam.in addition,we asked the district court,on remand,to augment the record with respect to its handling of a jury note.this note had requested copies of the indictment and the court instructions of law,as well as an explanation of an unspecified issue.see id.at.
now that the district court has provided the information we sought,we proceed to decide the totality of appeal.although the trial leading to the appellant conviction was not free from infirmity,it did not suffer from a crippling malaise.accordingly,we affirm the conviction.the same can not be said about the sentence as the government concedes in its brief,the appellant was not afforded the opportunity to allocute before the district court pronounced sentence.consequently,we vacate the sentence and remand for.
this case began when the appellant who was a employee of essroc san juan,a cement manufacturer,who had ascended from his position as control room operator to process engineer,was passed over for promotion to the position of production manager.as the appellant was the only qualified applicant within the san juan plant who applied for the position,management conducted a broader search and settled on kevin grotheer,who was previously employed at one of essroc plants in canada,to fill the production manager position,who had a history of difficult relations with his colleagues,was displeased with this personnel action,and his relationship with grotheer was strained from the beginning.
at one point,the appellant expressed his anger at and frustration with grotheer to three acquaintances.he concluded this conversation by expressing his wish that someone physically assault grotheer.there was further testimony that met with these three acquaintances to develop a plan to carjack grotheer in the hope of frightening grotheer so thoroughly that he would leave puerto rico,thereby clearing the way for the appellant to ascend to the production manager position.
a plan to effectuate this goal was eventually hatched.as agreed,called to inform his accomplices when grotheer left the plant one evening in november.consistent with their plan,accomplices successfully carjacked grotheer using several firearms,and robbed him of approximately.in addition,the accomplices left grotheer unharmed on the side of the road,and drove off in the jeep that grotheer had been driving.
the next morning,grotheer received a threatening voice message from an unidentified caller,which he relayed to the general manager of essroc san juan,lawrence evans.as a result of receiving this message,grotheer relocated to another part of puerto rico.even after this move grotheer continued to fear for his safety,and in january he left puerto rico due to these safety concerns.
the police commenced an investigation of the carjacking,and in connection therewith interviewed.in the interview,implicated his accomplices and made no secret of his anger and resentment that grotheer was selected to fill the production manager position.in the course of this dialogue,admitted that he hoped that grotheer would suffer physical harm,which would induce him to leave puerto rico.
in due course,a grand jury indicted the appellant on one count of aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation of and,and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a carjacking which is a crime of violence,in violation of c.
the case proceeded to trial,during which lodged challenges to several of the district court rulings,including a challenge to the court conduct of jury selection.in addition,the defendant challenged the district court evidentiary rulings with respect to certain statements testified to by both grotheer and evans.relatedly,asserted that he was entitled to discovery of certain prior statements that evans had made to the fbi,which were allegedly recorded on an form.finally,the appellant objected to the district court handling of the first of several notes the jury sent the judge.specifically,contended that no attempt was made to inform him of this note,and that,in violation of rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure he was given no opportunity to argue for a proposed response.
the jury convicted as to the carjacking count,but acquitted him as to the firearms count.after the preparation of a report and the submission of sentencing memoranda and supporting documents,the district court imposed a sentence of months,which was the lowest sentence within the guidelines range,along with a term of three years supervised release.during the course of sentencing,the appellant was not afforded an opportunity to allocute or a functionally equivalent opportunity to address the court directly and advocate for an appropriate sentence.
this timely appeal followed.in our initial consideration of the case,we noted that the government conceded that the district court had not conducted an independent review of the form,and we remanded the case to permit the district court to conduct such a review.see i,at.since a remand was already required to resolve the jencks act issue,we also invited the district court to augment the record with regard to its handling of the first jury note.see id.at.
on remand,the district court ordered the form disclosed to appellant trial and appellate counsel.in addition,the court clarified that its recollection was that it had independently reviewed the form and concluded that the form was not a discoverable statement,within the meaning of the jencks act.in response to a request from the defendant,on august,the district court held a hearing at which the fbi agent who prepared the form at issue testified that he did not record or transcribe evans statement,nor did evans sign or adopt either the agent notes or the.based on this testimony and its own recollection,the district court concluded that the form was not jencks material.
in addition,in its july,submission to us,the district court explained its recollection of its handling of the first jury note according to the district court,consistent with its routine practice,as well as the minutes of proceedings,it discussed the jury note with counsel and provided the jury with copies of the indictment and the charge.
ii.challenge to jury selection 
with these additions to the record,we now address all remaining issues in the appeal,beginning with appellant challenges to the conduct of jury selection.
in this case,the district court employed the blind strike method of jury selection.under this method,both parties simultaneously,rather than in alternating strikes,exercise their peremptory challenges and thus do not know which jurors the other has struck,united states bermudez,cir,cert.denied.the rules of criminal procedure provide that ordinarily a defendant in a felony case is entitled to ten peremptory challenges,and the prosecution is entitled to six.id.at citing.b see also united states brown,cir.should the district court choose to seat any alternate jurors,see.c,the rules require that each party be given additional peremptory challenges.c.these additional peremptory challenges may only be exercised on alternate jurors.united states brown,cir.to ensure this,the district court is required to designate the alternate jurors at voir dire.brown,at.
here,the district court chose to seat two alternate jurors.consistent with rule c a,it awarded each party an additional peremptory challenge.see rule c a providing that each party is entitled to one additional peremptory challenge when the court empanels two alternates.this gave the defense a total of eleven peremptory challenges ten from rule b and one from rule c a,and the government seven six from rule b and one from rule c a.
at voir dire,however,the court did not designate which jurors would be alternates.instead,it allowed each side to exercise their peremptory strikes against an undesignated pool of jurors.the defendant argues that this jury selection procedure violated rule c explicit command that the additional peremptory challenge conferred by that rule be used only to strike alternate jurors,and consequently,impaired his exercise of his peremptory challenges.our review of this argument,preserved below,is de novo,see united states,cir.
the district court erred when it failed to designate the alternate jurors at voir dire.the mandate in rule c that additional challenges may be used only to remove alternate jurors implies that these alternates must be designated at voir dire,when the parties still have the opportunity to use peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors brown,at united states flaherty,cir see also united states brewer,cir united states love,cir.
argues that this error requires automatic reversal.he relies upon our decision in united states vargas,in which we said that t he denial or impairment of the right to exercise peremptory challenges is reversible error without a showing or prejudice,cir quoting swain alabama.in recent years,however,the supreme court has disavowed the sort of reasoning used in vargas and has indicated that mistaken denials of peremptory challenges do not ordinarily warrant automatic reversal.see rivera illinois,united states.instead,we must ask whether the rule c error affected substantial rights.a.under that approach,we deem errors to be harmless when it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.united states pakala,cir quoting united states,cir.
on two previous occasions,we have held that a violation of rule c did not affect the defendant substantial rights.brown,at flaherty,at.in both of these decisions,we expressed skepticism about the prejudicial impact of a rule c violation.brown,at w hile we regret the district court failure to follow the rule,we can not imagine how brown substantial rights could possibly have been prejudiced.flaherty,at despite the clear transgression of the rule,we do not perceive how defendants exercise of their peremptory challenges was curtailed in any way we do not think that combining the regular and alternate challenges amounts to a violation of defendants substantial rights,however,distinguishes brown and flaherty.unlike in those cases,he observes,in this case an alternate juror was actually seated.thus,he claims,prejudice is readily apparent in his case.
we do not see how that conclusion follows.it is not evident that the composition of the jury would have differed had the district court adhered to rule c.moreover,even if a different venire member would have been selected as the alternate juror,there is no basis in the record for concluding that the alteration in jury composition had an injurious influence on the verdict.therefore,we conclude that the court error was harmless.
iii.evidentiary objections 
we turn next to the appellant evidentiary objections.specifically,he argues that the testimony of evans and grotheer regarding a threatening voice message grotheer received should have been excluded as hearsay or as unduly prejudicial given its limited probative value under rule.a district court evidentiary rulings,particularly those made pursuant to rule,are due considerable deference.united states wyatt,cir,cert.denied.citation omitted,babcock wilcox,cir.
we begin with the hearsay argument.in a single sentence of his brief,asserts that t he testimony of lawrence evans concerning the phone calls made to kevin grotheer outside of his presence was not only hearsay but objectionable under.since their probative value was outweighed by the improper prejudice caused.aside from this,the appellant makes no further argument about hearsay he does not explain whether evan testimony was offered for its truth,offered to show its effect on the speaker,or was subject to any of the exceptions or exclusions to the hearsay rule.indeed,does not so much as cite to the relevant rule of evidence.in these circumstances,the appellant hearsay argument,which does not explain why evans testimony was hearsay,lacks sufficient developed argumentation and is therefore waived.united states,cir,cert.denied.citing united states zannino,cir.
the appellant remaining evidentiary argument is that the testimony about the voice mail was unduly prejudicial in light of its limited probative value.when testifying about the voice mail,neither evans nor grotheer identified who left the voice mail.accordingly,the appellant now claims that this testimony left the jury to speculate that the appellant was somehow responsible for the threatening voice mail.
even assuming that the court erred in admitting the testimony,any error was harmless.see.a the government presented ample evidence regarding the appellant animus towards grotheer.the jury heard testimony that resented grotheer selection as production manager,that he had a hostile relationship with grotheer and other,that he had expressed a desire to harm grotheer,and that he hatched a plan to carjack grotheer with his accomplices.under these circumstances,we do not believe that evidence of this voice mail affected the outcome of the trial,and therefore any error was harmless.see united states adams,cir even if we found a violation of rule,we would regard any error as harmless because the evidentiary ruling could not have affected the outcome.see also united states,cir.
iv.jencks act violation 
on remand,the district court ordered that the appellant trial and appellate counsel be furnished with copies of the form that contained alleged statements of lawrence evans,which purportedly should have been disclosed pursuant to the jencks act.the district court directed the defendant counsel to specify docket entries or trial transcripts relevant to the jencks act issue.identified relevant testimony,but declined to argue the matter because we retained appellate jurisdiction over the case.based on the information before it,the district court concluded that no jencks act violation occurred.in response to the appellant objection to this conclusion,the district court held a hearing to examine this issue in greater detail.
at the hearing,the district court heard testimony from special agent rubn,the fbi agent who prepared the form,as we had suggested in our remand order.morales testified that he did not record or transcribe evans oral statement.rather,morales testified that he took notes on small scraps of paper,on which he relied to create the form.morales further clarified that evans neither signed nor adopted either the or the notes.based on this testimony,the district court reaffirmed its conclusion that the form was not a written statement of a witness,within the meaning of e,and further found that the was not a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a witness,within the meaning of e.see i,at.
review of a district court jencks act determination typically is considered to be for abuse of discretion.see united states femia,cir citing united states foley,cir.when a district court decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion,underlying legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and findings of fact for clear error.see,united states,cir united states guerrier,cir.we will not find clear error unless,after reviewing all of the evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states arbour,cir.
we can not say that the district court conclusion is clearly erroneous.to begin,there are questions as to whether the form was a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a witness within the meaning of e.although the appellant points out that morales acknowledged that the form was a detailed report that contained of what evans told him,morales specifically denied that the was a substantially verbatim recital of evans oral statement and instead called it a summary.morales characterization of the is buttressed by the manner of transcription he employed when interviewing evans.morales took notes on small scraps of paper,relying on those scra
