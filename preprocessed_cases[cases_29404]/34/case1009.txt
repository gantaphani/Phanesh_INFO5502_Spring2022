john iodice appeals from the judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york leonard wexler,judge,entered on june,convicting him after a jury trial of various counts related to three arsons and the robbery of a money courier,and sentencing him principally to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.on appeal,he makes three arguments.first,iodice argues that the federal arson statute,i,is unconstitutional as applied to the arson of a diner that had been unused for approximately two years at the time of the fire.second,he contends that the district court erred in finding credible the arresting agent account of a warrantless search and therefore erred in denying iodice motion to suppress evidence gained as a result of that search.finally,iodice claims that his trial counsel made errors that deprived him of the constitutionally required effective assistance of counsel.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
relevant background 
iodice was convicted of multiple crimes related to three arson fires and the robbery of a money courier.specifically,iodice set fire to his girlfriend home on february.iodice then directed her to submit fraudulent insurance claims and to receive and cash the resulting settlement checks.in september,iodice and three set fire to a boat on the high seas.iodice had previously arranged for the boat to be insured at an inflated value,and eventually received approximately of the insurance proceeds.during the course of an investigation into the boat fire,iodice gave false statements to an fbi agent.on december,iodice and his robbed a money courier in glen cove,new york of approximately.finally,on october,iodice and a set fire to a vacant diner in an attempt to prevent it from opening,as planned,in the spring of.
on april,iodice was arrested by fbi special agent james mccarthy.at the time,iodice was carrying a plastic shopping bag containing the following incriminating evidence documents relating to the insurance of the boat,a newsday article about the boat fire,four loose caliber rounds,a calendar card listing locations for sunrise check cashing,and iodice address book.
on may,the district court held a hearing to hear testimony pertaining to a motion by iodice to suppress this evidence.at the hearing,iodice counsel argued that mccarthy was not a credible witness to testify about the events surrounding iodice arrest because mccarthy had given substantially inconsistent accounts of those events on different occasions.the district court denied iodice motion to suppress evidence without further elaboration.
at trial,the government called lambros rakkas,the owner of the diner burned by iodice and a,to provide evidence on its use in interstate commerce.he testified that the restaurant was a paramount diner,a movable diner which was complete and ready to open when he purchased it in.rakkas further testified that he did not decide to move the diner to a new location until approximately one and a half years after its purchase.the projected opening of the diner was april,but rakkas did not explain what,if any,specific steps he had taken toward that end prior to the arson.regardless of the extent of rakkas efforts to relocate and open the diner,richard cuzzi,iodice in the arson,testified that iodice had been contacted by the greek mafia to destroy the diner in order to prevent competition with another diner already located near the new location.
the jury found iodice guilty of two counts of mail fraud,two counts of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,one count of using fire to commit felonies,one count of making a false statement to the fbi,one count of conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery,and one count of conspiracy to commit arson.iodice was acquitted of one count of mail fraud,one count of using fire to commit felonies,one count of using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a crime,one count of obstructing commerce by robbery,and one count of arson.the jury was deadlocked on one count of arson within the special maritime jurisdiction of the united states.finally,the government successfully moved to dismiss one count of being a felon in possession of ammunition.iodice was principally sentenced to months imprisonment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,iodice argues that the federal arson statute is unconstitutional as applied to the arson of a closed diner,that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion,and that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.we find the first two arguments to be without merit and decline to consider the third claim on direct review,instead preserving it for a petition.
interstate nexus requirement of i 
iodice challenges the jury finding,beyond a reasonable doubt,that rakkas diner was a building used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.i.although iodice explicitly argues that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the arson of the structure at issue in this case,he also appears to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the jury regarding the interstate nexus requirement of i.for purposes of this appeal,we assume that iodice intends to make both challenges to his i conviction.
we first address any argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence related to the i conviction.a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence that was the basis of his conviction at trial bears a heavy burden.united states parkes,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.on such a challenge,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all inferences in the government favor and deferring to the jury assessments of the witnesses credibility.id.we will sustain the jury verdict so long as any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted 
as noted above,section i requires that the object of the arson be a building used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.i.for the purpose of this statute,the supreme court has interpreted the phrase used in to mean active employment for commercial purposes,and not merely a passive,passing,or past connection to commerce.jones united states,d.moreover,the supreme court has instructed that the proper inquiry for a court presented with a i charge is first to determine the function of the building itself,and then to determine whether that function affects interstate commerce.id.at.applying this guidance,we have held that both restaurants and bars have the requisite relationship to interstate commerce under i.see united states joyner,cir extending the per se rule that i covers rental properties,as established in russell united states,d 
iodice does not contend that rakkas diner was permanently unfit to be used as a business which might affect interstate or foreign commerce.rather,he argues that,at the time of the arson,the diner was nothing but a vacant building serving no function that might conceivably affect interstate or foreign commerce because it had been closed for at least one and a half years and would presumably have continued to be closed for at least an additional six months.in iodice view,such a building may not be considered one used in interstate commerce because the supreme court has required active employment in interstate commerce at the time of the arson.see jones,at.
we have observed that it is always hazardous to seize upon a single word or phrase in a judicial opinion and build upon it a rule that was not in issue in the case being decided.howard senkowski,cir.in that vein,we note that jones concluded only that i did not cover a private,residential dwelling that served no commercial purpose whatsoever.at.in doing so,the court rejected the argument that the structure was used in interstate commerce merely due to its receipt of interstate goods like energy and its role in the owner procurement of insurance and financing.see id.at.however,the court did not confront and thus did not address those circumstances that
