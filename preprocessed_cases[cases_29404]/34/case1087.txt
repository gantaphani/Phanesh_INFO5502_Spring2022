the question presented here is whether the district court improperly concluded under aedpa review that the state court application of strickland washington,d,was objectively unreasonable for having rejected a sixth amendment challenge based on various alleged failures of trial counsel.
first deputy superintendent dennis bliden hereinafter the state appeals from a judgment entered september,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york wood,granting the application of the arnold lynn lynn or petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.lynn was convicted for murder in the second degree,pursuant to penal law,and attempted murder in the second degree,pursuant to penal law,in the supreme court of the state of new york,bronx county collins,justice.lynn is serving concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment of twenty years to life and six years to twelve years,respectively.at the time of the commencement of this action,bliden was the acting first deputy superintendent of the green haven correctional facility,the prison where lynn is confined.
the district court found that the state court application of strickland washington,d,was objectively unreasonable,the state court having rejected lynn sixth amendment challenge based on trial counsel failure a to move to reopen a wade hearing after learning that one eyewitness had failed to identify the petitioner when first shown a photo array b to another eyewitness about a previous statement in which the eyewitness claimed that he could recognize the culprit and c to successfully argue for admission,under new york business records exception to the hearsay rule,of those portions of a police report containing the reporting officer own observations.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the state court application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the united states supreme court,was objectively reasonable in this case,and,accordingly,that the application for a writ of habeas corpus should have been denied.
background 
at approximately on february,two men approached jermaine seippio seippio and kendrick chandler chandler outside of their residence at marcy place in the bronx.one of the approaching men argued loudly with seippio and chandler.seippio questioned this man h ow can you tell me i can not sell my drugs around here.who do you think you are after a pushing contest with seippio,the man removed a gun from his coat and fired what sounded like three shots at seippio and chandler.the shooter and his companion ran off.chandler fell dead.seippio,with the help of a neighbor who was present at the scene,toby patterson patterson,limped inside marcy place.seippio later was hospitalized.luis quinones quinones,a resident of the neighborhood,observed the shooting from his mother apartment at marcy place.
at approximately,detective william martinez arrived at the scene and observed a large crowd standing around chandler body.pedro arriaga arriaga soon was arrested as the shooter,apparently based on statements made to the police by two bystanders who claimed to be eyewitnesses.arriaga was apprehended and arrested by detective beers after being assaulted by a crowd and then trying to hide under a car a block or two away from marcy place.detective beers pulled arriaga out from under the rear of the car,while arriaga was being assaulted by the crowd.
neither patterson nor quinones initially told the police what he had observed.patterson was interviewed several times by the police but said that he was initially too scared to come forward with the information until september of.quinones said that he did not want to get involved because he feared for the safety of his family.quinones originally lied to the police about witnessing the crime and told detective martinez on february,that he could not recognize the shooter.
while arriaga case was pending before the grand jury,quinones told a friend of his,who was also a friend of arriaga,that arriaga was innocent.that mutual friend,mark falu falu,implored quinones to report what he saw to the police.it appears that falu brother had been arrested at about the same time as arriaga.at first,quinones refused to go to the police.it was not until arriaga mother visited quinones,at which time he saw that she was suffering,that quinones agreed to contact arriaga lawyer.quinones also spoke with an assistant district attorney and detective martinez.the police reopened the investigation and several witnesses on motion by the people on september,the charges against arriaga were dismissed 
on september,detective martinez held a recorded meeting with patterson in a police car,where he showed patterson an array of six photographs,one of which was of lynn.patterson identified lynn as the shooter,and lynn was arrested two days later.
approximately one week after detective martinez showed patterson the photo array in the police car,detective martinez showed quinones the same photo array that he showed patterson,and quinones also identified lynn as the shooter.on september,patterson and quinones separately viewed lineups at the bronx county district attorney office.each identified lynn as the shooter.
by indictment filed on october,the bronx county grand jury charged lynn with various crimes,including murder in the second degree and attempted murder in the second degree.following the indictment,lynn trial attorney,arthur henriksen henriksen,filed a motion to suppress the identifications made by patterson and quinones.on february,the trial court judge,the honorable john collins,supreme court of new york,judicial district bronx county,conducted a wade hearing.see united states wade,d.at that hearing detective martinez testified,inter alia,about the circumstances surrounding the presentation of the photo array to patterson on september,and to quinones about a week later,as well as the procedure followed during the subsequent on september of that year.the trial judge determined that all of the police procedures were proper and that the identifications were admissible.
a trial jury was selected on february.on friday,february,not a scheduled trial day,the assistant district attorney ada spoke to patterson and reviewed some police reports in preparation for trial.it was then that the prosecutor discovered that patterson had been shown the photo array on two separate occasions.the first time that patterson had been shown a photo a week before the september photo had not identified lynn.detective martinez testified only about the second photo array at the wade hearing the ada immediately contacted henriksen by telephone.
on february,before the jury was called into the courtroom,the ada informed justice collins about the earlier photo array and stated that he had only learned of it on february.the ada stated that,upon learning of the earlier array,he had questioned patterson about it.according to the ada,patterson responded that he had recognized lynn as the shooter in his own mind when he first saw the photo array but did not identify lynn to the police at that time because he was too afraid to say who did it.henriksen said nothing to the trial judge regarding the identifications or the wade hearing opening statements began later that day.
at trial,no physical evidence was offered that linked lynn to the shootings.the only evidence that implicated lynn consisted of the eyewitness accounts of patterson and quinones,both of whom made courtroom identifications of lynn as the shooter.the police never were able to locate seippio,and he did not testify at the trial.the doctor who performed surgery on seippio after the shooting did,however,testify that seippio sustained gunshot wounds to his chest and back and that seippio would have died had he not received immediate medical treatment.
the ada explained to the jury during his opening statement that arriaga initially had been arrested and charged with the shootings but that arriaga was released because the charges against him were unfounded.the state also presented evidence of arriaga initial arrest and subsequent release by way of the testimony of detective martinez.henriksen detective martinez,as well as patterson and quinones,but the defense presented no case of its own.
on march,the jury convicted lynn of murder in the second degree and attempted murder in the second degree.judgment of conviction was rendered march.lynn was sentenced to an indeterminate term of incarceration of twenty years to life on the murder count and years on the attempted murder count.lynn is serving the sentences concurrently.
lynn appealed his conviction.on appeal,lynn argued to the supreme court of the state of new york,appellate division,first department appellate division,that henriksen was ineffective for failing to move to reopen the wade hearing failing to quinones about his statement to detective martinez shortly after the crime that he could recognize the person who committed the crime and failing to properly argue for the admissibility of a portion of detective beers police report to show that,at the time of the shooting,arriaga was pulled out from under a car after being assaulted by a crowd at the scene.
the appellate division affirmed lynn conviction on june.see people lynn,dep t memorandum decision.that decision reads in relevant part 
the existing record,which defendant has not sought to amplify by way of a crim.proc.law motion whereby counsel strategic decisions could have been explored see people love,fails to support defendant claim of ineffective assistance.counsel made appropriate and trial motions and applications,vigorously the people witnesses,and delivered a cogent summation.defendant has not demonstrated that he was deprived of effective assistance by counsel failure to seek a reopened suppression hearing based on the people disclosure at the start of trial,since defendant has not shown that the hearing would have been reopened,or that a reopened hearing would have resulted in suppression of any evidence.likewise,defendant has not shown that counsel purported omissions with respect to of one of the identifying witnesses,and introduction of documentary evidence affected the outcome of the trial.

on december,the new york court of appeals denied lynn request for leave to appeal.see people lynn,memorandum decision.
on june,lynn moved,pro se,in new york supreme court,bronx county,pursuant to.proc.law,to vacate his conviction,alleging that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his claim that he was misidentified and to call two witness who could have testified that someone other than lynn had been the shooter.on january,that motion was denied on procedural grounds as untimely and as having been previously determined on the merits in lynn direct appeal.on july,lynn motion for reargument of his motion was denied.on october,the appellate division denied lynn leave to appeal the order denying his motion.
on may,lynn filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,pursuant to,raising the same claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised in his direct appeal and in his.proc.law motion.district magistrate judge theodore katz,to whom the case was referred for a report and recommendation,ruled that only those claims raised on direct appeal were not subject to procedural bars.that ruling is not challenged.
in his report and recommendation,dated april,the magistrate judge found the essential issue to be whether the appellate division decision involved an unreasonable application of the strickland standard to the facts of lynn case.the magistrate judge found that the state court ruling was not an objectively unreasonable application of the standard.in recommending that the petition be denied as to the claim of failure to reopen the wade hearing,the magistrate judge did not dwell on whether lynn can satisfy the first prong of the strickland test since lynn could not satisfy the second prong of the strickland test in that he 
has not alleged,much less demonstrated,that in the time between patterson first and second viewing of the photo array,that there was anything that the police did that was suggestive t here is no basis to conclude that had the wade hearing been reopened,patterson identification of lynn would have been suppressed or,more pertinently,that the outcome of his trial would have been different.because lynn can not demonstrate that it is likely that the outcome of his trial would have been different had the wade hearing been reopened,his claim of ineffective assistance must fail.
with regard to the issue of henrikson alleged ineffective of quinones,the magistrate judge determined that henriksen did establish and argue that quinones had originally denied knowing anything about the shooting and that his questions to quinones about mark falu,whose brother was arrested with arriaga,were not pointless.finally,regarding the issue of henrikson failure to have portions of the police report received into evidence,the magistrate judge ruled that t here may have been strategic reasons why henriksen chose not to press to have admissible portions of a police report received into evidence but that lynn could not prove prejudice from this failure i n any event.therefore,the magistrate judge concluded that lynn was not denied the effective assistance of counsel and recommended to the district court that the petition be denied.
in an order dated september,the district court wood,although adopting the magistrate judge factual findings in large measure,disagreed with the magistrate judge conclusions and granted the habeas petition.the court observed that none of henriksen challenged omissions at trial could be attributed to a sound trial strategy the district court found that these errors of omission were prejudicial and that,taken together,they seriously undermine d confidence in the outcome.therefore,the district court concluded that the appellate division rejection of lynn ineffective assistance of counsel claim was objectively unreasonable and granted the petition.
the state now appeals the judgment entered by the district court granting lynn petition for habeas corpus.
review under aedpa 
this court reviews the district court grant of habeas relief de novo.see,mcmahon hodges,cir noble kelly,cir.lynn filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,so the standard for review by a district court in the first instance has been established by aedpa,as codified in d.torres berbary,cir see also vasquez strack,cir.
under aedpa,a federal court may grant a petition for habeas corpus notwithstanding a contrary state court adjudication on the merits,in accordance with the following provisions 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
assuming that a claim is not procedurally barred,
w ith respect to the elements of aedpa deferential review set forth in d,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.
torres,at quoting williams taylor,d alteration in original.a n objectively unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.quoting williams,at.second alteration in original.
although it is clear that the question is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable,the precise method for distinguishing objectively unreasonable decisions from merely erroneous ones is less clear.cotto herbert,cir citation omitted see also gilchrist,cir.however,it is in this c ircuit that the objectively unreasonable standard of d means that a petitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.cotto,at internal quotation marks omitted.in lainfiesta artuz,cir,this court,relying principally on williams,explained 
a state court decision falls within the unreasonable application clause if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.the supreme court has thus far offered little guidance as to the meaning of the term unreasonable application,tautologically instructing federal habeas courts to ask whether the state court application was objectively unreasonable.
the supreme court did caution,however,that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.thus,a federal habeas court is not empowered to grant the writ when,in its independent judgment,it determines that the state court incorrectly applied the relevant federal law.the state court application must reflect some additional increment of incorrectness such that it may be said to be unreasonable.however,the increment need not be great otherwise,habeas relief would be limited to state court decisions so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence.
at internal quotation marks and citations omitted alterations in original.
this standard of review applies whenever the state court has adjudicated the federal claim on the merits,regardless of whether the court has alluded to federal law in its decision.as this court stated in sellan kuhlman,cir 
for the purposes of aedpa deference,a state court adjudicate s a state prisoner federal claim on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.when a state court does so,a federal habeas court must defer in the manner prescribed by d to the state court decision on the federal if the state court does not explicitly refer to either the federal claim or to relevant federal case law.

in addition,a state court determination of a factual issue is presumed to be correct,and is unreasonable only where the petitioner meets the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e see also parsad greiner,cir mask mcginnis,cir.moreover,a state court findings of fact will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.cockrell,d.
ii.ineffective assistance of counsel 
an ineffective assistance claim asserted in a habeas petition is analyzed under the unreasonable application clause of aedpa because it is past question that the rule set forth in strickland qualifies as clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.williams,at.internal quotation marks omitted sellan,at see also eze senkowski,cir aparicio artuz,cir.strickland established a test to determine whether counsel has been ineffective.a defendant must prove that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.see wiggins smith,d aparicio,at see also clark stinson,cir.
a criminal defendant has a high burden to overcome to prove the deficiency of his counsel.
to determine whether a counsel conduct is deficient,t he court must determine whether,in light of all of the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.in gauging the deficiency,the court must be highly deferential,must consider all the circumstances,must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,and must operate with a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance 
lindstadt keane,cir quoting strickland,at.alterations and omissions in lindstadt,internal citations omitted.as a general rule,a habeas petitioner will be able to demonstrate that trial counsel decisions were objectively unreasonable only if there was no tactical justification for the course taken.united states luciano,cir per curiam see strickland,at.holding that petitioner must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.
as for prejudice resulting from counsel inadequate performance 
an error by counsel,even if professionally unreasonable,does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.to merit habeas relief,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.the level of prejudice the defendant need demonstrate lies between prejudice that had some conceivable effect and prejudice that more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.thus t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.the court defined reasonable probability as one that undermine s confidence in the outcome.
lindstadt,at alterations in original,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also aparicio,at citing strickland,at.flores demskie,cir.in making the reasonable probability determination 
a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.some of the factual findings will have been unaffected by the errors,and factual findings that were affected will have been affected in different ways.some errors will have had a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence,altering the entire evidentiary picture,and some will have had an isolated,trivial effect.moreover,a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.taking the unaffected findings as a given,and taking due account of the effect of the errors on the remaining findings,a court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.
strickland,at.failure to show either deficient performance or sufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim.id.at.
here,lynn sixth amendment claims revolve around the identification testimony given by quinones and patterson.although these two witnesses,who did not know each other,provided mutually corroborative inculpatory identifications at trial,each had previously told the police that he had not witnessed the shooting or was unable to identify the shooter.the allegations of defense counsel ineffectiveness went to the of quinones,the failure to demand a second wade hearing,and the inability of counsel to secure the admission of a portion of a police report.the appellate division decision rejecting lynn sixth amendment claims was based on the strickland analysis,and therefore our inquiry is whether the appellate division application of federal law was objectively unreasonable.
counsel failure to seek to reopen the wade hearing 
the purpose of a wade hearing is to determine before the trial whether pretrial identification procedures have been so improperly suggestive as to taint an identification.twitty smith,cir citing wade,at.proc.provides 
if after a determination and denial of the motion the court is satisfied,upon a showing by the defendant,that additional pertinent facts have been discovered by the defendant which he could not have discovered with reasonable diligence before the determination of the motion,it may permit him to renew the motion before trial or,if such was not possible owing to the time of the discovery of the alleged new facts,during trial.
the appellate division held that lynn was not entitled to relief on this ground because he could not demonstrate that he was deprived of effective assistance by counsel failure to seek a reopened suppression hearing based on the people disclosure at the start of trial,since he had not shown that the hearing would have been reopened,or that a reopened hearing would have resulted in suppression of any evidence.lynn,at.
lynn makes two arguments here.first,lynn claims that the appellate division applied reasoning contrary to clearly established federal law because it focused on the result of the wade hearing rather than on the outcome of the proceeding as a whole.second,lynn posits that the appellate division decision was based on an objectively unreasonable application of strickland because henriksen rendered ineffective assistance by failing to move to reopen the wade hearing after he learned of the first patterson photo array.
in rejecting the conclusions of the magistrate judge,the district court noted the difficulties in determining why henriksen did not move to reopen the wade hearing,henriksen having passed away before the conviction became final.the district court therefore could not fault lynn for not developing the record further on this point.but see greiner wells,cir a lawyer inability to remember his reasons for conducting the trial in the manner that he did is insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of constitutionally effective counsel where a justification appears on the record.without evidence establishing that counsel strategy arose from the vagaries of ignorance,inattention or ineptitude,strickland strong presumption must stand.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.nevertheless,because the state entire case hinged on the eyewitness testimony of patterson and quinones,the district court found it inconceivable that henriksen did not move to reopen the wade hearing.
under new york law,the trial court has discretion to reopen a wade hearing if additional pertinent facts are discovered that could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence before the wade determination and that go to the issue of official suggestiveness such that they would materially affect or have affected the earlier wade determination.people clark.had the wade hearing been reopened,it would have only been as to patterson identification because quinones did not make two separate identifications.lynn claims that if patterson identification had been ruled inadmissible,quinones identification alone would have been such weak evidence so as to undermine confidence in the outcome.this argument assumes,in the absence of any supporting evidence,that patterson identification would have been excluded.there is nothing in the record before us to suggest that,had the wade hearing been reopened,patterson identification of lynn would have been suppressed due to an improper police procedure regarding the identification procedure the first showing of the photo array to patterson that rendered the array so improperly suggestive as to taint patterson identification.see twitty,at.
moreover,the purpose of a wade hearing is not to determine whether there are inconsistent identifications nor to obtain more fodder for.rather,the purpose of a wade hearing is to examine police procedures surrounding an identification of the defendant for a taint of suggestiveness.
in prior habeas cases in which there were claims of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to request a wade hearing,this court has demanded some showing of the likelihood for success at the hearing.in saltys adams,cir,we held that a failure to request a wade hearing constituted ineffective assistance because there had been a highly viable wade argument for suppression on the basis of tainted eyewitness identifications.id.in united states daniels,cir,we distinguished saltys on the ground that 
u nlike saltys,appellant has not suggested and we do not find any basis for questioning the propriety of the identification procedure.after the government sought to introduce the photographic array from which ingram selected appellant photograph,counsel conducted a voir dire in which he attempted to bring out,before the jury,the fact that ingram had only a short time in which to view daniels and that this was not an adequate opportunity to observe him.under the circumstances,we do not think that daniels was prejudiced by counsel failure to request a suppression hearing on the circumstances underlying the identification.the voir dire conducted by counsel was primarily an attempt to impeach ingram credibility as such,we think it was a matter of trial strategy best left to the discretion of trial counsel and the assessment of the trial judge.
at emphasis added.
based on the record before us,we determine that lynn sixth amendment challenge sounding in claims of ineffective assistance of counsel for the failure of henriksen to move to reopen the wade hearing must fail.there simply is no evidence in the record regarding improper police conduct pertaining to the identification inconsistent statements resulting from the two photo arrays shown to patterson.an inquiry into inconsistent statements regarding identifications is a task for trial counsel on of the identifying witnesses,and henriksen did conduct to establish that patterson previously had indicated to police that he did not witness the shooting.we conclude that the state courts lynn was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel by henriksen failure to move to reopen the wade not objectively unreasonable.
failure to quinones about earlier statements to the police 
quinones told police in february of that he was unable to identify the shooter.at the wade hearing,detective martinez was asked d id quinones tell you at that time that he could make an detective martinez responded that i believe his exact words were that he could recognize the person.at trial,quinones testified that he did not want to get involved at first because he was afraid for himself and his family.lynn contends that henriksen was ineffective because he failed to quinones about the fact that he originally told the police that he was unable to identify the shooter,and he failed to argue this point to the jury.
the state argued that it was a strategic decision by henriksen to forego this line of questioning because,if quinones had been confronted with his statement while being,quinones would have simply testified that at the time he had spoken to the police,he was still concerned about his safety and the safety of his family.the district court,however,reasoned that quinones credibility was central to the defense case,and henriksen failure to quinones about his prior february statement to the police rendered his representation ineffective 
i f henriksen had elicited an admission from quinones that he told detective martinez on february that he was unable to identify the shooter the jury would have heard testimony about a second occasion on which quinones spoke with the police,failed to implicate petitioner,and told the police that he was incapable of making an identification of the shooter.this fact,which was otherwise not presented to the jury at trial,would have impeached quinones subsequent identification,with little or no risk to petitioner defense.
if quinones were to have denied making such a statement to detective martinez on february,the jury would have had an additional basis on which to question quinones credibility because quinones lack of credibility was central to the defense,henriksen failure to attempt to impeach quinones with this line of questioning fell below the objective standard of reasonableness.
the totality of the record does not support this conclusion.although henriksen did not specifically question quinones about his initial statement to police regarding his inability to identify the shooter,he did question quinones about his statement to the pol
