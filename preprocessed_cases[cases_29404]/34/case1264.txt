opinion of the court 
acting on an arrest warrant,police arrested shamone kennedy and impounded a nearby rental car that kennedy girlfriend had lent him a few days earlier.following an inventory search,police found two guns and grams of cocaine inside the car.kennedy moved to suppress the evidence found in the car,contending he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in its contents.the district court denied the motion.because we find that the driver of a rental car whose name is not listed on the rental agreement generally lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in the car,we conclude that kennedy suppression motion was properly denied.accordingly,we will affirm.
following the arrest of two minors in connection with stolen firearms,detective quinn of the coatesville city police department received information indicating that some of those firearms had been sold for money and drugs at a home on first avenue to a man known as tex and later identified as defendant kennedy.police subsequently obtained a warrant and searched the home on first avenue,where they found guns,drugs,and personal effects belonging to kennedy.a federal warrant was issued for kennedy arrest on january.
six days earlier,on january,kennedy girlfriend courtney fields had rented a silver toyota camry from kulp car rental and given the key to kennedy,who used the car until january.kennedy name was not listed on the rental agreement.
on january,a police informant who knew kennedy notified detective chris mcevoy that earlier in the day he had seen kennedy driving a silver toyota camry,the car fields had rented,on chestnut street between and streets.mcevoy then passed this information on to the day and evening shifts of the coatesville police department.later that evening,at approximately,officer john regan,corporal sean knapp,and sergeant martin brice encountered black gloves and carrying in his right hand a rental key inscribed with the kulp car rental insignia and listing the car it belonged to as a silver toyota diagonally across chester avenue and down the hill toward east lincoln highway.the officers placed kennedy under arrest pursuant to the warrant.they then searched kennedy and found on his person in united states currency,a set of keys,and four cell phones.the district court later determined that kennedy was a validly licensed driver.
after kennedy was taken to the police station,officer regan asked him where he lived.kennedy said he lived at east lincoln highway,a house less than a block from the location of the arrest.officer regan went to that location and soon found a silver camry on chester street with a kulp car rental bracket around its license plate.in the meantime,sergeant brice spoke with kulp car rental owner,who requested that the police tow the car to the police station.while officer regan waited for a tow truck,three people approached the car from east lincoln highway,at which time officer regan instructed them to move away from the vehicle.the man and two women continued up the street to a house where they watched officer regan and the car from the front porch and window.one of the three was courtney fields,kennedy girlfriend and the person who had rented the car and given kennedy the key.
following the car impoundment,detective martin quinn directed corporal scott neuhaus to conduct an inventory search of the car pursuant to department policy so that the vehicle could then be picked up by someone from kulp.corporal neuhaus began the inventory search with the trunk,where he found a partially opened duffle bag containing a disassembled rifle in three pieces.he immediately stopped the search and spoke with detective quinn,who then sought a search warrant for the entire vehicle.that same day,at her request,fields attorney informed the police that there could be drugs in the car.
on january,detective mcevoy and detective sean murrin received a federal search warrant for the vehicle.inside,the detectives found a cell phone charger plugged into the dashboard cigarette lighter,and a second cell phone charger in the passenger compartment,each of which fit one of the four phones found on kennedy at the time of arrest.the detectives then opened the locked glove compartment and found a handgun,a magazine containing around rounds of ammunition,and a plastic bag containing smaller bags with an chunky substance later confirmed to be grams of cocaine base.
on august,a grand jury indicted kennedy on two counts of possession of grams or more of cocaine base crack with intent to distribute under a two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime under c and two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under g.one count of each crime related to the evidence obtained at the first avenue address and one count of each crime to the evidence obtained from the silver camry.kennedy filed a motion to suppress both the evidence obtained from the home on first avenue and the evidence obtained from the camry.following a hearing,the district court issued a written opinion denying the motion.see united states kennedy,wl.june.
as to the search of the home on first avenue,the district court held both that kennedy lacked standing to contest the search because he had not shown any connection to the house,and that the search was proper because there was a substantial basis for the magistrate judge determination that there was probable cause to support the issuance of a warrant.id.at.
as to the searches of the silver camry,the district court acknowledged that the third circuit had not yet directly addressed the question of whether an individual who borrows a rental car but is not an authorized driver under the rental agreement has standing to challenge a search of the rental car.the district court cited united states baker,cir,for the proposition that to determin e whether someone who borrowed a car had a reasonable expectation of privacy in it,a court must conduct a inquiry assessing the strength of the driver interest in the car and the nature of his control over it kennedy,wl at quoting baker,at.
relying on baker,the district court found that because kennedy had fields permission to use the car,a driver license,and was in fact driving the car on january,he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car.id.nevertheless,the district court found that under the circumstances,including the absence of an authorized driver to remove the car from the street,it was reasonable for the police to honor the rental company request and impound the car.under settled law,the impoundment made it permissible to conduct an inventory search of the car contents.id.at.accordingly,in light of what it found to be constitutionally valid procedures,the district court denied kennedy motion to suppress in its entirety.
after three days of trial,the district court declared a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict.kennedy was retried on only one count each of a,c,and g,all relating to the evidence found in the car.after a trial,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on those three remaining counts.the district court then sentenced kennedy to a term of imprisonment of months followed by a year period of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.

as previously stated,the district court found that because kennedy had fields permission to use the car she rented,kennedy had a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.the government argues that we should reverse the district court holding that kennedy had standing to challenge the search of his car in the first instance.although the right to challenge a search on fourth amendment grounds is generally referred to as standing,the supreme court has clarified that the definition of that right is more properly placed within the purview of substantive fourth amendment law than within that of standing.rakas illinois.accordingly,standing to challenge a search is not a threshold issue that must be decided before reaching the question of whether a search was or was not constitutional.see,united states varlack ventures,inc,cir assuming,without deciding,that appellant had standing to challenge search but nevertheless reversing district court suppression of evidence.the court may therefore affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record,whether because kennedy lacked standing to challenge the search,or because the officers search did not run afoul of the fourth amendment,united states mussare,cir.
fourth amendment standing requires that the individual challenging the search have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property searched and that he manifest a subjective expectation of privacy in the property searched.united states baker,at citing rakas,at california greenwood.with regard to the objective prong of this test,which is at issue here,a reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy must have a source outside of the fourth amendment,either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.minnesota carter,quoting rakas,at see also,bond united states,our fourth amendment analysis inquire s whether the individual expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.internal quotation and citation omitted carter,at kennedy,concurring the application of the standing rule involves consideration of the kind of place in which the individual claims the privacy interest and what expectations of privacy are traditional and well recognized.
while e xpectations of privacy protected by the fourth amendment need not be based on a interest in real or personal property,by focusing on legitimate expectations of privacy in fourth amendment jurisprudence,the court has not altogether abandoned use of property concepts in determining the presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by that amendment.rakas,at.therefore,one who owns or lawfully possesses or controls property will in all likelihood have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of his right to exclude.see also united states acosta,cir recent cases reflect the supreme court continued consideration of property interests in determining fourth amendment privacy interests.with these considerations in mind,we turn to the record before us.
the district court relied on our decision in united states baker,cir,in reaching its conclusion that kennedy had standing to challenge the search of the car.in baker,the defendant was arrested for driving a car to his parole office,because driving was an express violation of his parole conditions.the parole officers searched the car,which was registered in someone else name,and discovered drug paraphernalia.the officers then conducted a warrantless search of baker home,in which they found weapons and heroin.at.although testimony that baker friend owned and had lent him the car conflicted with the identity of the owner of the car as listed in its title and registration,for purposes of the standing analysis we assumed that the defendant had borrowed it from a friend and had been driving it for four to six weeks.id.at.
in determining whether baker had standing,we stated that whether the driver of a car has the reasonable expectation of privacy necessary to show fourth amendment standing is a question dependent on the strength of his interest in the car and the nature of his control over it.id.at collecting cases.because he had been lent the car by a friend,had been driving it for four to six weeks,and had carried the keys to the car with him into the parole office,we concluded that baker had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car.id.at.baker thus stands for the proposition that,in conducting the inquiry into whether a driver has a legitimate expectation of privacy in a car,a person who lawfully borrows a car from another and exercises substantial control over it may well have a legitimate expectation of privacy.this,however,does not speak to the distinct factual scenario presented here whether someone who has been given permission to drive a vehicle by its renter,without the knowledge of its owner and in contravention of the rental agreement,nevertheless has standing to challenge a search of that vehicle.accordingly,we disagree with kennedy that baker augurs in favor of any particular outcome here.
instead,recognizing that the inquiry must remain,we concur with the majority of circuits that have considered this factual scenario and conclude that,as a general rule,the driver of a rental car who has been tent the car by the renter,but who is not listed on the rental agreement as an authorized driver,lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in the car unless there exist extraordinary circumstances suggesting an expectation of privacy.see,united states seeley,cir per curiam finding that driver of rental car lacked standing where he was not the renter or authorized driver united states wellons,cir holding that unauthorized driver of rental car who had been given permission to drive by,an authorized driver,lacked standing united states roper,cir defendant lacked standing where car he was driving was rented by common law wife and he was not listed as additional driver in rental contract united states smith,cir noting that as a general rule,an unauthorized driver of a rental vehicle does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle but nevertheless finding that the defendant had standing in light of the truly unique facts of that case.
unlike the defendant in baker,an individual who borrows a rental car without the permission or knowledge of the owner not only acts in contravention of the owner property rights,but also deceives the owner of the vehicle while increasing the risk that the property will be harmed or lost.although property law is not controlling,neither is it irrelevant.see rakas,at legitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the fourth amendment,either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.an authorized driver on the rental agreement has lawful possession of the vehicle and,within the scope of the rental agreement,may legitimately exclude others from using it.see,united states walker,cir a person listed as an approved driver on a rental agreement has an objective expectation of privacy in the vehicle due to his possessory and property interest in the vehicle.in contrast,an unauthorized driver has no cognizable property interest in the rental vehicle and therefore no accompanying right to exclude.the lack of such an interest supports the position that it is objectively unreasonable for an unauthorized driver to expect privacy in the vehicle.see rowlings kentucky,blackmun,concurring stating that n ot every concept of ownership or possession is arcane and the right to exclude is an essential element of modern property rights that often may be a principal determinant in the establishment of a legitimate fourth amendment interest.accordingly,we agree with the majority of circuits which have considered this scenario and find that such circumstances will normally take one outside the and shared understandings of privacy in our society.
kennedy urges us instead to follow the decisions of the eighth and ninth circuits,which have held that an unauthorized driver of a rental car has standing where the renter gives him permission to use the vehicle.see united states thomas,cir citing rakas,at,for the proposition that the unauthorized driver of a rental car has standing where given permission by the authorized driver,because arcane distinctions developed in property law ought not control the standing inquiry united states.best,cir stating that if
