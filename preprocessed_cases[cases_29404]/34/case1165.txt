rafael duverge perez hereafter duverge appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence of years imprisonment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york preska,following his plea of guilty to a narcotics offense,in violation of a,b a and.judgment was originally imposed by judge preska in april,and duverge appealed to this court.in december we remanded for reasons set forth below.in april the judge adhered to her prior sentence,and duverge again appealed.we now affirm.
background 
in november,duverge was arrested when he delivered grams of cocaine base crack to an undercover officer.in december,the government filed a indictment,charging duverge with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute grams and more of mixtures containing a detectable amount of crack.shortly thereafter,duverge pleaded guilty to this charge.title,united states code,section b a provides a mandatory minimum sentence for distributing crack.
in september,the district court held a sentencing evidentiary hearing pursuant to united states fatico,cir,to consider duverge argument that the doctrines of sentencing manipulation and sentencing entrapment entitled him to a downward departure.two witnesses,duverge and luis perez hereafter perez,the government cooperating witness,testified at the hearing.duverge claimed that he originally had agreed to sell only powder cocaine to perez,while perez claimed that duverge had agreed to sell him crack.
duverge testified that on november,he received a phone call from a friend,armando duran.duverge had previously worked for duran as a dealer in powder cocaine.duran asked duverge if he could get him grams of powder cocaine for a customer of duran friend,perez.duverge obtained the cocaine from another dealer.according to duverge,on the morning of november,duran and perez came to duverge apartment with a paper bag containing a coffee pot,received the powder cocaine from duverge,and cooked the cocaine into crack in duverge kitchen.duverge claimed he stated at that time that he wanted nothing to do with the cooking and wanted only to be paid.according to duverge,duran and perez then told him that to be paid,he had to deliver the crack,which duverge agreed to do upon a promise of additional payment.when duverge delivered the crack to perez and an undercover officer later that day,duverge was arrested.
perez testified that he had telephoned duverge on november,and had requested grams of crack.he stated that he arrived at duverge apartment alone on november,to inspect the crack,saw the crack sitting in a white plate,and told duverge to keep the crack and deliver it for him later in the day.he denied that he or duran cooked the cocaine powder into crack.
the testimony of these two witnesses at the fatico hearing thus differed primarily as to what drug duverge was originally asked to get for perez customer and what occurred on the morning of november,in duverge apartment.
before the hearing,duverge had moved to call an experienced polygrapher,glenn almas,to testify on the results of two extensive polygraph examinations of duverge in april regarding the events in question.specifically,almas would have testified that the examinations showed that duverge was truthful when he answered no to a number of questions as to whether crack was mentioned in duverge conversations with duran or perez and whether duverge had ever sold crack.
almas also asked duverge two questions during the polygraph examination about whether duran and perez had brought a coffee pot with them when they came to duverge apartment,but almas apparently could draw no conclusion with respect to duverge responses to those questions.
the district court refused to accept the polygraph evidence,stating 
a ssuming that i could hear the testimony of the polygraph expert,i think under.i elect not to.given that we all seem to agree the issue is strictly one of credibility,it seems to me that given the varying views on reliability of polygraph testimony and,therefore,the somewhat limited probative value,that the time it will take to put it in really outweighs its probative value,whereas the attitude and demeanor of the participants is what has all of the probative value.so,for those reasons,i decline to hear the polygraph testimony.
at the end of the fatico hearing,the judge ruled that she credited the testimony of perez over that of duverge.the judge stated 
i do not credit duverge testimony that the folks came into his home with the coffee pot in a paper bag,opened the refrigerator and took out the baking soda and,before his very eyes,cooked the crack.i find that not to be credible testimony.i find more credible the thought that the crack was already cooked as suggested by perez.
the district court also rejected duverge motion for a downward departure on the ground of sentencing manipulation or sentencing entrapment,stating that duverge had not testified truthfully about who cooked the crack and she did not find the necessary level of improper conduct here to meet the definitions of sentencing entrapment or manipulation even if one credits the defendant testimony.
in april,as already indicated,the district court sentenced duverge to the statutory mandatory minimum term of incarceration for years.the district court found that duverge false testimony made him ineligible for a downward departure under the safety valve provisions of,b and f,which allow a court to depart below a statutory minimum sentence if,among other requirements,the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence concerning the offense as a result of duverge false testimony,the district court also applied an offense level enhancement for obstruction of justice,but allowed an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,based on duverge adherence to his story in the face of known dire consequences.
thereafter,duverge appealed his sentence.in october,this panel heard oral argument,and reserved decision.shortly after oral argument,the government learned that cooperating witness perez had been arrested in maine on federal narcotics charges unrelated to the charges against duverge.the government notified duverge attorney about this evidence.with the consent of the government and at the request of duverge,we remanded the case to the district court in december for consideration of that evidence 
in april,the district judge the fatico hearing.at the beginning of the hearing,perez attorney advised the district court that perez would invoke his fifth amendment right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate him regarding his crimes,but that perez would answer questions about duverge case,and about the testimony he gave during the september fatico hearing.duverge called perez to the witness stand for further.perez asserted his fifth amendment right not to answer the questions he believed related to his crimes.following the hearing,duverge moved to strike perez testimony in its entirety,or in the alternative that the district court infer that had perez not invoked his fifth amendment privilege,his answers would have contradicted his testimony given in the september hearing.the government opposed this request.
in october,the district court issued an opinion reaffirming its earlier decision to credit the testimony of perez over that of duverge.the court denied duverge motion to strike perez testimony,stating 
the witness direct testimony need not be stricken,i f a witness asserts the privilege on regarding collateral matters.brooks,at.a witness testimony about other unrelated crimes may be collateral.see dunbar,at 
the court ruled that the questions perez refused to answer concerned collateral matters unrelated to the drug deal at issue in duverge case.
the court also denied duverge request that the court infer that perez answers to the unanswered questions during the april hearing would have contradicted his testimony during the september hearing.the district court held that it 
continue s to credit perez testimony over duverge testimony for two reasons.
first,perez had little or no incentive to lie about the drug deal with duverge.a
