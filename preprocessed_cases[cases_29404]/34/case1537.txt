the day after his twentieth birthday,faisal hashime was convicted of multiple counts related to child pornography and later sentenced to fifteen years in prison.hashime made numerous statements while being interrogated by agents during a search of his home.because the agents did not read hashime his miranda rights until well into what was plainly an extended custodial interrogation,we reverse hashime conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
in november,while monitoring a website used to exchange child pornography,a agent with immigration and customs enforcement homeland security investigations unit hsi discovered a naked picture of a minor boy with the caption email me,in july,the agent sent an email to the address,asking to trade images.the agent eventually received explicit pictures of a naked boy.by tracing the email account associated ip address,hsi concluded that the account was being used by someone in the hashime family home.
based on this information,law enforcement obtained and executed search warrants on both the email account and hashime house.shortly after am on may,a team of state and federal agents equipped with a battering ram descended on hashime home.hashime,at the time a year old student,lived with his parents in suburban northern virginia.the agents banged on the entrance,yelling open the door.
after being let in by hashime aunt,the officers streamed into the house with their guns drawn.an officer entered hashime bedroom and pointed a gun at him.hashime was in bed,naked and asleep,having gone to bed at am that morning.the officer ordered hashime to get up get out of bed,and instructed hashime to show his hands.after hashime put on boxer shorts,the officer held hashime by the arm,issuing orders to him,and marched him out to the front lawn,where officers were corralling the other members of his family.despite the chilly weather,the hashime family members were kept outside,several of them dressed only in their nightclothes.
when law enforcement eventually allowed hashime and his family back into their house,they were kept in the living room while the officers completed their sweep of the home.hashime was not allowed to go to the bathroom until the officers had clear ed it out.hashime was given his clothes but was not provided with shoes or socks.hashime mother,who was recovering from recent brain surgery,and about whose health hashime was concerned,asked to lie down for health reasons but was not allowed to.the hashime family members were not permitted to be alone and were instructed that they had to be accompanied by officers at all times.the agents proceeded to interrogate each of them individually.
hashime was escorted by two officers to the basement for interrogation.the basement was finished,but the officers chose to interrogate hashime in a room that was being used as a storage area.hashime family was not allowed to see hashime until the interrogation was over.hashime mother asked the officers three times for an attorney for hashime,but was told that he was being questioned and that she could not see him or otherwise interrupt the interrogation.according to hashime mother,the officers told her that hashime was under arrest.
the officers secretly recorded the interrogation.when hashime asked them if they were recording it,the lead interrogator,who was not carrying the recording device,told hashime,i can tell you i do have a recorder on during the interrogation,hashime admitted to having child pornography on his computer and told the officers in great detail about how he had obtained the photographs.hashime also gave the officers the password to his computer and told them where the images were located on his hard drive.
at the beginning of the interview,the officers told hashime that he did not have to answer their questions and could leave at any time.however,at one point in the interrogation,one of the officers told hashime,i need to know,and i need you to be completely honest with me here even if you afraid,i do care if you say i do want to answer that or i afraid to answer it,but i need to know the truth.ja.in addition,when one of the interrogators left hashime to go upstairs,he told hashime,l ike i said at the beginning,the search warrant we got to kind of keep an eye on you i ca leave you here with nobody here.ja.
the officers did not read hashime his miranda rights until over two hours into the interrogation.
hashime was arrested three days after the interrogation.in july he was indicted on seven counts of production,distribution,receipt,and possession of child pornography in violation of and.
prior to trial,hashime moved to suppress the statements he made to the agents during the interrogation on the grounds that he was in custody at the time and did not receive the required miranda warning at the beginning of the interrogation.the district court rejected this motion,emphasizing hashime demeanor and tone during his interrogation,his general familiarity with practices,and his apparent lack of concern with any imminent arrest.the court relied in particular on the recording of the interrogation,stating that were it not for the tape,i think you hashime win your case.ja.the court noted that the voice of the defendant expressed no kind of hesitation,no nervousness and that the evidence of hashime was powerful.ja.the court concluded that hashime was free to leave and believed himself to be free to leave.ja.
hashime pled guilty to the receipt and possession charges,the former of which carried a mandatory minimum of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of twenty years.the government nevertheless chose to also prosecute hashime on the production and distribution charges.
at the bench trial,multiple minors testified about their contacts with hashime.together with hashime statements during the interrogation,this evidence established hashime pattern of behavior he would pose as an attractive teenage girl named tracy and make contact with boys on websites used for anonymous chatting or through direct email communication.hashime would offer in many cases successfully to trade nude pictures of tracy for nude pictures of the boys.on occasion,he redistributed the pictures he obtained.the court found hashime guilty of the production and distribution counts.
prior to sentencing,hashime moved to strike the sentences applicable to him on the ground that they violated the eighth amendment.the district court denied the motion,finding proportionality review unavailable for a sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
at sentencing,the district court rejected the government request for a sentence as way more than would be appropriate.ja.the district court emphasized hashime youth and immaturity,and instead sentenced him to a sentence the sentences for the production charges,and a combination of mandatory and sentences on the other charges,all to run concurrently followed by twenty years of supervised release.
hashime first argues that his conviction should be reversed because agents failed to read him his miranda rights at the beginning of the interrogation.we review the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error and the district court legal determinations de novo.when a suppression motion has been denied,this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states davis,cir citations omitted.
the fifth amendment provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.u.const.amend.v.as a prophylactic safeguard for this constitutional guarantee,the supreme court has required law enforcement to inform individuals who are in custody of their fifth amendment rights prior to interrogation.see miranda arizona,d united states parker,cir.without a miranda warning,evidence obtained from the interrogation is generally inadmissible.see see also united states hargrove,cir.
when deciding whether a defendant not under formal arrest was in custody and thus if the miranda requirements apply a court asks whether,under the totality of the circumstances,a suspect freedom of action was curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.parker,at quoting berkemer mccarty,d.this inquiry is an objective one,and asks whether a reasonable man in the suspect position would have understood his situation to be one of custody.united states colonna,cir quoting berkemer,at.in other words,the court considers whether a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.united states jamison,cir alteration in original quoting thompson keohane,d internal quotation marks omitted.
facts relevant to the custodial inquiry include,but are not limited to,the time,place and purpose of the encounter,the words used by the officer,the officer tone of voice and general demeanor,the presence of multiple officers,the potential display of a weapon by an officer,and whether there was any physical contact between the officer and the defendant.united states day,cir quoting united states weaver,cir internal quotation marks omitted.also pertinent are the suspect isolation and separation from family,see united states griffin,cir,and physical restrictions,united states griffin,cir.
the district court ruled,and the government argues,that a miranda warning was not required because hashime was not in custody.there is no question that the officers interrogated hashime and the custody question is the only one remaining the government case rests on two grounds law enforcement conduct toward and statements to hashime prior to and during the interrogation,and hashime tone and demeanor during the interrogation.we address each in turn.
the government argues that the agents behavior establishes that the interrogation was.the government notes that,when the hashime family was gathered in the living room,an agent said that no one was under arrest.furthermore,at the beginning of the interview,one of the interrogators told hashime that most importantly we want you to know that you do have to talk to us that hashime could answer some questions or not answer questions and that he could leave any time.ja.the interrogators also informed hashime,both before and after reading him his miranda rights,that they were not there to arrest anyone but rather to execute a search warrant,and that the ultimate decision about arrest would be made by the prosecutor.the government also emphasizes that the interrogators offered hashime multiple breaks for the bathroom and coffee,all of which hashime declined.the government notes that hashime was not handcuffed during the interrogation,that the door to the room in which he was interrogated was open,and that hashime was sitting in the chair closest to the door.
the government argument is fine as far as it goes,but it wholly ignores the larger setting.first,other statements made by law enforcement undercut the government claim that hashime was consistently told that he could leave at any time and did not need to answer any questions.during the interrogation,one of the officers told hashime that,with respect to his prior sexual history with minors,i need to know,and i need you to be completely honest with me here even if you afraid,i do care if you say i do want to answer that or i afraid to answer it,but i need to know the truth.likewise,when the interrogator left to go upstairs,he told hashime,l ike i said at the beginning,the search warrant we got to kind of keep an eye on you i ca leave you here with nobody here.
second,even to the extent that law enforcement told hashime that he did not have to answer questions and was free to leave,that by itself does not make the interrogation.although a statement that the individual being interrogated is free to leave may be highly probative of whether,in the totality of the circumstances,a reasonable person would have reason to believe he was in custody,such a statement is not talismanic or sufficient in and of itself to show a lack of custody.united states hargrove,cir.the broader setting makes clear why a few isolated statements by law enforcement in the course of a interrogation can not erase its custodial nature.before the interrogation,hashime had awoken at gunpoint to a harrowing scene his house was occupied by a flood of armed officers who proceeded to evict him and his family and restrict their movements once let back inside.throughout the interrogation,hashime was isolated from his family members,with his mother repeated requests to see him denied.it is little wonder that hashime testified that,during the interrogation,i did think i had any chance to leave i felt that i was trapped and had to stay where i was and do what i was told.ja.
we also can not accept the argument that the home setting here rendered the interrogation.while courts are generally less likely to characterize as custodial interrogations in familiar settings like the home,see wayne lafave et,criminal procedure e,at ed,the particular facts of hashime interrogation cut in the other direction.a suspect may not feel that he can successfully terminate the interrogation if he knows that he can not empty his home of his interrogators until they have completed their search.united states craighead,cir.as hashime testified during the suppression hearing,prior to being interrogated he did not feel that he could freely move through the house because the officers had people everywhere and telling us what to do,telling me what to do,and telling me where not to go and where to go.ja.
this case is similar to united states colonna,cir,where we found that an interrogation arising out of a search of the home was custodial for miranda purposes.in colonna,fbi agents executed a search warrant on the defendant home,looking for child pornography.id.at.our analysis in that case focused on many of the same factors that guide our inquiry here the large number of armed agents,the suspect isolation during his interrogation,and the suspect and his family loss of control over their home.see id.at.several of our sister circuits have found interrogations to be custodial in similar circumstances.see united states cavazos,cir craighead,at united states mittel carey,cir.
the government,following the district court,also argues that hashime tone and demeanor during the interrogation demonstrate that it was not custodial.it is true that hashime was cooperative with his interrogators.he admitted he possessed child pornography,explained how he had received it,provided passwords to his computer,and described where the files were located on his hard drive.hashime told the agents that i want to help you,and that i love helping cops.i always loved cops.i always wanted to be a cop.ja.it is also the case that the tone of the interrogation was calm and in some instances almost chatty,with hashime asking the agents whether the investigation would affect his upcoming vacation plans and joking with them about the health hazards of smoking cigarettes.
whatever the nature of hashime tone and demeanor,it is not dispositive here of the custodial inquiry.as the supreme court has emphasized,the test for whether an interrogation was custodial is an objective one t he subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned are irrelevant.the test,in other words,involves no consideration of the actual mindset of the particular suspect subjected to police questioning.north carolina,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also united states parker,cir custody determinations do not depend on the subjective views of either the interrogating law enforcement officers or of the person being questioned,but depend instead on the objective circumstances of the interrogation.
the district court gave primary emphasis to the mannerisms of the defendant,remarking that hashime voice expressed no kind of hesitation,no nervousness,and that his attitude was a cooperative one.but hashime attitude his apparent as the district court put it is more of a subjective factor and goes primarily to the voluntariness of hashime confession.the voluntariness inquiry and the miranda custody inquiry are,however,not one and the same.see yarborough alvarado,d.
in contrast to hashime manner,the conduct of government agen
