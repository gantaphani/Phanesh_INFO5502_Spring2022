in this appeal from a judgment of sentence,we are once again called on to determine whether evidence seized during a street encounter between law enforcement and citizens was properly admitted into evidence during a subsequent criminal prosecution.we conclude that the seizure of the evidence did not comport with settled fourth amendment principles,and we therefore reverse the district court denial of appellant motion to suppress and remand for further proceedings.
responding one night to an anonymous tip that shots were fired in a neighborhood,richmond police encountered four young men,including appellant tyerail massenburg,four blocks from the reported gunfire.when an officer approached them in a marked police car,the men were not evasive they continued walking forward,toward the car,and voluntarily paused to speak with the officer upon the officer request.in fact,they were cooperative one of the men reported that he had heard shots fired from a passing car two blocks away and handed over his identification when asked and at least two of the men consented to voluntary.appellant massenburg stopped with his friends,but he refused to consent to a frisk.as the officer interacting with massenburg testified,he first thought massenburg nervous when he began asking him to consent to a and massenburg was real reluctant to give consent.based on the fact that appellant stood a foot or two away from the other men,who were,and did not make eye contact as the officer renewed his requests for a consensual search,the officer undertook a nonconsensual search.the search produced a firearm and some marijuana,the subjects of the suppression motion at issue here.
charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a drug user under g and one count of possession of marijuana under,massenburg moved to suppress the gun and drugs on the ground that the officer frisk was unlawful.the district court denied that motion,and massenburg entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling.
before an officer can stop and frisk a citizen,she must have reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is engaged in criminal activity.reid georgia.we recently warned against the government proffering whatever facts are present,no matter how innocent,as indicia of suspicious activity and noted that we were deeply troubled by the way in which the government attempts to spin mundane acts into a web of deception.united states foster,cir.this concern is only heightened when the mundane acts emerge from the refusal to consent to a voluntary search.if the important limitations on the stop and frisk regime crafted by terry ohio,are not to become dead letters,refusing to consent to a search can not itself justify a nonconsensual search.
on the night of march,at,richmond city police received an anonymous tip that shots had just been fired.the caller reported eight shots fired possibly two blocks south of and hull streets,a area in which drug activity as well as random gunfire were usual.the caller said nothing more in particular,he or she included no description of a suspect.
officers stephen gaines and eric fries responded to the call and arrived at and hull at.they split up and patrolled the area in marked police cars.fries soon saw four young black men,including appellant massenburg,walking north at the corner of east street and stockton street,four blocks west and two south of the intersection of and hull and thus four blocks from the alleged origin of the shots.they were walking in the direction of fries marked car and did not stop or change course when they saw it.
fries approached in his vehicle and asked,hey guys,can you stop for a second.the men stopped to talk with him.fries asked if they had heard gunfire,and one man reported hearing shots fired from a vehicle on maury street,two blocks south of their present location.gaines arrived,the two officers exited their vehicles,and they began taking the men names.fries then asked if they had weapons on them and if they would consent to a.the four men were now all basically lined up in a row on the sidewalk,with the man who reported hearing gunfire on maury street on the left end of the line and massenburg on the right.according to gaines,the three men were pretty much,and massenburg was kind of offset from the group by a foot or two,give or take.
the man on the left consented to fries request for a,as did the man nearest him.gaines began at the other end of the line,asking massenburg if he would consent to a frisk.gaines testified that massenburg,in reply to the request,was kind of hesitant and,and kind of real reluctant to give consent to a pat down or a search of his person.instead,h e stated he did not have anything.you do need to check me.stood back and kind of himself down,stating,trying to show he did have anything.at this point gaines insisted and patted massenburg down without his consent.
officer fries testified that he had seen a small bulge in the left jacket pocket of massenburg prior to officer gaines frisk,but he did alert gaines to it.officer gaines,asked multiple times about the basis for his suspicion of massenburg,never indicated in his testimony that he saw a sign or signal from fries.
during the frisk of massenburg,gaines felt the handle of a firearm on massenburg waist band not in the jacket,and massenburg fled before gaines could grab it.gaines pursued and directed him to drop the firearm,which massenburg did,dropping it on the grass.massenburg ran another feet before gaines caught up and arrested him.in addition to the firearm,police recovered a small amount of marijuana on massenburg person.
massenburg was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a drug user,in violation of g,and one count of possession of marijuana,in violation of.he filed a motion to suppress the firearm and marijuana,arguing that gaines lacked the reasonable,particularized suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity necessary to authorize a nonconsensual frisk under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.
at the suppression hearing,the government presented few objective bases for particularized suspicion of massenburg.it was only able to point to the following massenburg and his three friends were walking four blocks from the location of the shots reported by the tipster,the only people the responding officers encountered in the vicinity and several observations made by gaines of massenburg allegedly nervous behavior.in particular a massenburg was standing a foot or two from the other three men,who were,b he did not make eye contact with gaines as gaines asked him to consent to a frisk and c he did not consent.gaines testimony on these points is instructive.
officer gaines testified that it was until actually i made contact with him that i noticed nervous behavior from him.he elaborated 
a we questioned if anybody had any weapons on them.the individuals besides massenburg stated,we do have anything,you can check us.and tyerail massenburg was kind of hesitant and,and kind of real reluctant to give consent to a pat down or a search of his person.
q you indicated that massenburg,you said,was acting nervously.what gave you that impression 
a like,i said,he was standing off from the three in the group from being questioned.he was reluctant,did show any eye contact.looked down.once he stood back and stated,i do need to get a.that kind of raised my suspicion a little further.and we were more persistent to find out whether he had weapons on his person.
on,massenburg attorney attempted to clarify gaines ostensible particularized suspicion concerning massenburg.
q and during your conversation with him,he would look you in the eye 
q and he just kept on saying,i do need to be patted down 
q that made you more persistent 
q because he did want to be patted down 
a correct.as i said,the others made statements when asked if they had weapons.said,you can check me.and he was the only one to be reluctant.
q you had no new information to know he was armed and dangerous but for the fact he did want to be patted down 
a i mean the nature of the call and nature of the area.
q you had no new information,did you,officer,other than his repeated statements that he did want to be patted down 
a besides the statements,the area of the call.
q right.nothing new other than the area of the call 
the district court denied massenburg suppression motion,holding that the search was lawful.it found that reasonable suspicion existed on the basis of six factors a vague report of shots fired the four men were encountered roughly two blocks from the location of the reported shooting incident and were the only people in the area this was a,area massenburg was acting nervously,looked down and refused to make eye contact and stood off from the group massenburg continued to act strangely by making a series of two furtive movements that is,he took a step back away from officer gaines,and he then began pantomiming a self search gaines actions were informed by a year worth of practical experience serving as a law enforcement officer.
after the denial of his suppression motion,massenburg entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal the court ruling.judgment was entered and he was sentenced to months in prison.he brought this timely appeal challenging the suppression ruling.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states day,cir.
to comport with the fourth amendment,even a brief investigatory detention must be supported at least by a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person seized is engaged in criminal activity.reid georgia,at see united states foster,cir.considering the totality of the circumstances,we are to determine whether there was a sufficient objective,particularized basis for suspecting the person seized of criminal activity.united states.arvizu.evidence that would support only a mere hunch is insufficient,though a reasonable basis need not establish probable cause and may well fall considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.id.at quoting terry,at united states digiovanni,cir the reasonable suspicion standard is an objective one,so we examine the facts within the knowledge of the officer to determine the presence or nonexistence of reasonable suspicion.
this quantum of suspicion is likewise required prior to a frisk when the officer initial encounter with the citizen is voluntary.see united states burton,cir d uring initially consensual encounters,an officer is not entitled,without additional justification,to conduct a protective search.to conduct such a protective search,an officer must first have reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.see also terry,at harlan,concurring i f the frisk is justified in order to protect the officer during an encounter with a citizen,the officer must first have constitutional grounds to insist on an encounter,to make a forcible stop if and when a policeman has a right to disarm such a person for his own protection,he must first have a right not to avoid him but to be in his presence.that right must be more than the liberty to address questions to other persons,for ordinarily the person addressed has an equal right to ignore his interrogator and walk away he certainly need not submit to a frisk for the questioner protection.emphasis added.thus we can assume without deciding that officer fries initial conversation with massenburg and his companions was consensual and that the fourth amendment was first implicated by officer gaines frisk of massenburg.
we emphasize that the constitution requires a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.united states griffin,cir quoting united states cortez,emphases added.as the supreme court noted in cortez,chief justice warren,speaking for the court in terry ohio,said that,t his demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of this court fourth amendment jurisprudence.cortez,at quoting terry,at emphasis added by cortez.indeed,as our late friend and colleague judge michael reminded us in the madison lecture at new york university,the fourth amendment owes its existence to furious opposition in the american colonies to british search and seizure practices th e controversy over the use of general warrants left citizens of the new american states with a fear of discretionary searches permitted by general warrants and writs of assistance.the honorable blane michael,reading the fourth amendment guidance from the mischief that gave it birth.arizona gant,noting the central concern underlying the fourth amendment is the concern about giving police officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person private effects delaware prouse,holding unconstitutional a discretionary,suspicionless stop for a spot check of a motorist license and registration,emphasizing that t his kind of standardless and unconstrained discretion is the evil the court has discerned when in previous cases it has insisted that the discretion of the official in the field be circumscribed.
on the facts of this case,there is precious little to sustain the district court holding that officer gaines had reasonable,particularized suspicion of massenburg such that a nonconsensual frisk was lawful under the fourth amendment.among the six factors the district court cited in support of its ruling is officer gaines one year worth of practical experience serving as a law enforcement officer,which of course is wholly unrelated to appellant.the first three factors it listed that the officers were responding to a vague report of shots fired,that massenburg was found in the general vicinity four blocks of the reported site of the gunfire,and that this encounter occurred in a area also do little to create particularized suspicion.
as the district court noted,the officers were responding to a vague report of shots fired.this report was not only vague indicating only that eight shots were possibly fired two blocks south of a certain intersection,it was also anonymous.reliance on an anonymous tip may be reasonable where,suitably corroborated,it exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability.florida.yet here corroboration did not exist until one of massenburg companions reported hearing shots can not be said to increase reasonable suspicion of the companion own party,especially since he also reported that the shots were fired from a moving car by unknown parties several blocks away.like the tip of illegal gun possession held unreliable in,the tip here provided no predictive information and therefore left the police without means to test the informant knowledge or credibility.id.at.the tipster here disclosed her basis of knowledge she heard the shots herself but little else.though that disclosure enhance s the tip reliability,united states perkins,cir,we have held that even a nearly contemporaneous report of a drug transaction the tipster reportedly saw was unreliable in the absence of s ome corroboration,since a fraudulent tipster can fabricate her basis of knowledge,united states reaves,cir.perkins at,anonymous tip held sufficiently reliable where contemporaneous viewing was corroborated by presence of a known drug user in front of a known drug house and where tipster,though she did not explicitly identify herself,was reasonably assumed to be a known,reliable informant 
furthermore,the poor match between the vague tip and the individuals encountered substantially undermines reliance on the tip for reasonable particularized suspicion of massenburg.the tip contained no physical description of the perpetrators or any other outward identifying features the only link between the tip and massenburg group was the group rough proximity to the alleged site of the gunfire.the tipster reported hearing shots two blocks south of the intersection of hull and streets massenburg and his friends were encountered four blocks west of that intersection.
thus,while the district court appears to have heavily relied on the fact that massenburg and his companions were the only people encountered as officers fries and gaines responded to the tip,this provides little basis for reasonable,particularized suspicion of massenburg.as and its progeny indicate,when a tip lacks sufficient indicia of reliability,presence in the area identified by the tip does not generate reasonable suspicion.here,massenburg was not even present at the site of the alleged gunfire he was encountered four blocks away.united states moore,f d,cir finding reasonable suspicion where only individual in the vicinity was found to yards from the entrance to a building burglarized two to three minutes before,moving away from the scene of the crime.to the extent that the tip,together with massenburg location,did identify his group with particularity,and reaves teach that an anonymous tip,absent some corroboration or sufficient other indicia of reliability,is not itself a reasonable basis for suspicion justifying a nonconsensual frisk.
the fact that this was a,area adds little to the anonymous tip.this counts among the totality of the circumstances we consider,but it does little to support the claimed particularized suspicion as to massenburg.an individual presence in an area of expected criminal activity,standing alone,is not enough to support a reasonable,particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.illinois wardlow,see brown texas.this is true because presence in a high crime neighborhood is a fact too generic and susceptible to innocent explanation to satisfy the reasonable suspicion inquiry.wardlow,at stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
as the officers testified,the city police usually get complaints for random gunfire in this area.that such incidents are common may make it more reasonable for otherwise innocent behavior to appear suspicious to officers on the beat but where a tip has already indicated that shots were fired,the level of such crime in the neighborhood does not provide an additional reasonable basis for suspicion of particular individuals.that the tip concerned a common incident in a neighborhood does little to bolster its reliability and less to create particularized suspicion.while we appreciate the danger posed by firearms in our cities,the supreme court has rejected an automatic firearm exception to our established reliability analysis,at.like any other anonymous tip,a tip concerning firearms must present certain indicia of reliability before it can provide a basis for reasonable,particularized suspicion.
to hold otherwise would be to authorize general searches of persons on the street not unlike those conducted of old by the crown against the colonists.allowing officers to stop and frisk any individuals in the neighborhood after even the most generic of anonymous tips would be tantamount to permitting a regime of general searches of virtually any individual residing in or found in neighborhoods,where complaints of random gunfire in the night are all too usual.james otis famously decried general searches as instruments of slavery and villainy,which place the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer,warning against abuses by e very man prompted by revenge,ill humor,or wantonness.timothy lynch,in defense of the exclusionary rule,harv.pub,quoting james otis,speech on the writs of assistance.the fourth amendment,and the courts fourth amendment jurisprudence,is aimed at this evil.without reasonable particularized suspicion of wrongdoing,such searches and seizures offend the constitution.
reasonable suspicion determinations are made according to the totality of the circumstances,and in light of the above massenburg presence in a neighborhood shortly after an unreliable tip concerning random gunfire in the general vicinity we give officer gaines a good deal of leeway in his interpretation of massenburg behavior.yet,as we recently reminded the government in foster,it can not simply proffer whatever facts are present,no matter how innocent,as indicia of suspicious activity.at.we expressed serious concerns there about the way in which the government attempts to spin mundane acts into a web of deception,these concerns are amplified when these mundane acts are incident to the refusal to consent to a voluntary search.
officer gaines made clear in his testimony that it was until actually i made contact with massenburg that i noticed nervous behavior from him.his account of the encounter which is not contradicted by fries or any other evidence indicates that this nervous behavior was his characterization of massenburg repeated refusal to consent to a voluntary we questioned if anybody had any weapons on them.the individuals besides massenburg stated,we do have anything,you can check us.and tyerail massenburg was kind of hesitant and,and kind of real reluctant to give consent to a pat down or a search of his person.gaines reiterated this when asked a second time to describe massenburg nervous behavior 
like,i said,he was standing off from the three in the group from being questioned sic.he was reluctant,did show any eye contact.looked down.once he stood back and stated,i do need to get a.that kind of raised my suspicion a little further.and we were more persistent to find out whether he had weapons on his person.
emphases added.on,gaines again explained that massenburg was the only one to be reluctant and admitted,when asked if it was true he had no new information to know massenburg was armed and dangerous but for the fact he did want to be patted down,that there was n othing except massenburg statements he kept on saying,i do need to be patted down and the area of the call.
the evidence gaines cites for massenburg nervousness is slight massenburg was standing a foot or two from the other three,who were lined up,and l ooked down or failed to make eye contact as gaines repeatedly asked him if he would consent to a search.the district court accepted the government characterization and deemed massenburg lack of eye contact nervous behavior,yet as judge gregory noted in united states foreman,the government often argues just the reverse that it is suspicious when an individual looks or stares back at officers,cir gregory,concurring in part and dissenting in part collecting cases see also united states mcfarley,cir noting,in support of reasonable suspicion,that appellant and his companion each canvassed the terminal area,obtaining eye contact with officer faulkenberry.given the complex reality of relationships in many cities,a young man keeping his eyes down during a police encounter seems just as likely to be a show of respect and an attempt to avoid confrontation.state scott,so d,nervousness on the part of a black laborer when confronted by an armed uniformed police officer does not seem so unusual as to indicate guilt or criminal proclivity.
it is,of course,highly relevant when suspects engage in evasive behavior or act nervously.united states mayo,cir.yet massenburg did not attempt to evade the officers in fact,he and his companions stopped to speak with officer fries,and one volunteered information about recent gunfire.and looking down as an officer persists in requesting consent to a search is a far cry from the unusually nervous behavior we cited in united states mayo,which included shaking hands,heavy breathing,and providing inconsistent answers.at citing to united states mcfarley,cir.as the tenth circuit explained in united states salzano,
i t is common for most people to exhibit signs of nervousness when confronted by a law enforcement officer whether or not the person is currently engaged in criminal activity.thus,absent signs of nervousness beyond the norm,we will discount the detaining officer reliance on the detainee nervousness as a basis for reasonable suspicion.
cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.see also state lee,n ervousness is of limited value to reasonable suspicion analyses as it is common knowledge that most citizens whether innocent or guilty,when confronted by a law enforcement officer who asks them potentially incriminating questions are likely to exhibit some signs of nervousness.
indeed,the supreme court of wyoming has applied this commonsense principle to a situation much like this one,where an officer was asking a motorist for consent to search his car and,upon the motorist refusal,continued to ask him whether there was some reason he did not want the officer looking in the vehicle.damato state.reasoning that r ealistically,few citizens would not have become uncomfortable to some degree with these questions,the court discounted as a factor of no significance far more extreme signs of nervousness,including the motorist sweating heavily although it was a chilly day,his carotid artery pulsating hard and fast,and an inability to keep eye contact.id.
and as a reasonable response to continued police questioning,looking down is a good deal more innocent than the defendant actions in united states sprinkle,where the defendant put his head down and his hand up to his face as if to avoid recognition as an officer passed the car and then drove away as soon as the officers walked by,cir.in sprinkle we found no reasonable suspicion existed,even though the officers knew the defendant to have been recently released from prison following narcotics convictions,defendant was in a neighborhood known for drug trafficking,and his evasive behavior was preceded by someone else entering the car and making gestures consistent with a covert exchange huddling with the two men hands close together as if to pass something.id.at.when we have held that behavior far more extreme,by a known narcotics dealer,in a area does not create reasonable suspicion,it is difficult to imagine that massenburg keeping his eyes down as he is asked repeatedly to consent to a voluntary search would suffice.
indeed,we are especially conscious here of the fact that massenburg looking down was incident to his repeated refusal to consent to a voluntary search.it can not be doubted that a refusal to cooperate with a police request to conduct a voluntary search,without more,does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.florida bostick,see also mayo,at a suspect refusal to cooperate with police,without more,does not satisfy terry stop requirements.if the ordinary response of the innocent upon being asked to consent to a search some mild nervousness sufficed to create reasonable suspicion,then terry reasonable suspicion requirement would become meaningless officers could ask a citizen for permission to conduct a voluntary search,and,if denied,they could use the citizen denial as evidence of criminal activity and perform the search anyway.though,as an analytic matter,nervousness can be separated from the denial of consent itself to attempt to extricate the very mildest indicators of nervousness such as a failure to maintain eye contact during the refusal,as the officer becomes more persistent,from the denial itself is too nice a matter.virtually any denial will be accompanied by these mild reactions to the request,and thus virtually any denial would go much of the way toward authorizing a nonconsensual search.this can not be the case.
as for the district court characterization of massenburg down as f urtive movements,it recalls the government suggestion in foster that a man sudden ly pop ping up in a car with his arms going haywire was suspicious.foster,at.there we warned against using whatever facts are present,no matter how innocent,as indicia of suspicious activity,and reminded the government that it must do more than simply label a behavior as suspicious to make it so the government must also be able to either articulate why a particular behavior is suspicious or logically demonstrate,given the surrounding circumstances,that the behavior is likely to be indicative of some more sinister activity than may appear at first glance.id.at.no such demonstration has been forthcoming.massenburg down was interpreted as such by officer gaines,and as an obvious attempt to satisfy him without consenting to a frisk,it provided little basis,if any,as a matter of constitutional analysis,for a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.
genuinely suspicious behavior,occurring in a neighborhood after a tip concerning gunfire,would certainly justify a terry stop and almost certainly a frisk of the detainee.where that tip is unreliable,the question becomes closer.but where the accompanying behavior the only substantial basis for particularized suspicion is simply a mild reaction to repeated requests to relinquish one constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches,it is clear that reasonable,particularized suspicion of criminal activity does not exist.
the government suggests that under the doctrine also called the fellow officer rule officer fries observation of a bulge in massenburg jacket pocket should be imputed to officer gaines,though,as the government concedes,fries never inform ed gaines about it.br.of appellee,at because this novel application of the doctrine would stretch it well beyond its purpose,we decline to do so.
the doctrine,as enunciated by the supreme court,holds that when an officer acts on an instruction from another officer,the act is justified if the instructing officer had sufficient information to justify taking such action herself in this very limited sense,the instructing officer knowledge is imputed to the acting officer.in whiteley warden,the supreme court recognized in dicta that officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid had probable cause to support the issue of the warrant.the court applied this principle in united states hensley,holding that where officers stopped defendant in objective reliance on a flyer from another department that explained that defendant was wanted in connection with an aggravated robbery and requested that other police departments pick up and hold him,the stop was justified if and only if the officers who issued the request had reasonable,particularized suspicion sufficient to justify their own stop 
we conclude that,if a flyer or bulletin has been issued on the basis of articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that the wanted person has committed an offense,then reliance on that flyer or bulletin justifies a stop if the flyer has been issued in the absence of a reasonable suspicion,then a stop in the objective reliance upon it violates the fourth amendment.

we have applied the doctrine often,both before and after whiteley and hensley,and our case law likewise establishes that the doctrine has a limited domain officers acting on the information and instructions of other officers.in united states pitt,federal police agent wurms learned through an informant that a large quantity of heroin was being driven from new york city to washington,cir.agent wurms informed fellow agents,including agent worden,and instructed baltimore city police to intercept the car.pitt was arrested by agent worden,with the assistance of city police.rejecting pitt claim that worden lacked personal knowledge of the facts constituting probable cause,we noted that p robable cause can rest upon the collective knowledge of the police,rather than solely on that of the officer who actually makes the arrest.id.at.though this shorthand reference to the doctrine might be misleading out of context,we went on in the next sentence to explain that i t was enough that agent wurms reported to agent worden the substance of his telephone conversation with the informant.id.
in our discussion of the doctrine in united states,we made its limitations explicit 
the law seems to be clear that so long as the officer who orders an arrest or search has knowledge of facts establishing probable cause,it is not necessary for the officers actually making the arrest or conducting the search to be personally aware of those facts.
when a superior officer orders another officer to make an arrest,it is proper to consider the superior knowledge in determining whether there was probable cause.likewise,when a group of agents in close communication with one another determines that it is proper to arrest an individual,the knowledge of the group that made the decision may be considered in determining probable cause,not just the knowledge of the indivi
