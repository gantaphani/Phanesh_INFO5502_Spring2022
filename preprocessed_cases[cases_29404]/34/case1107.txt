david titemore appeals from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,iii,chief judge,convicting him,after his guilty plea,of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g.on this appeal,titemore challenges the district court september,order denying his motion to suppress both evidence of his possession of a rifle and incriminating statements made to a state trooper.united states titemore,d.specifically,titemore argues that the evidence should be suppressed because,by walking across titemore lawn to question him at a side porch,the trooper invaded the curtilage of his home in violation of the fourth amendment.titemore also argues that,under miranda arizona,d,the district court erred when it failed to suppress evidence of incriminating statements that he made to the trooper.because the trooper approached a principal entrance to the home using a route that other visitors could be expected to take,we hold that the trooper actions did not offend the fourth amendment.we also hold that the district court did not err in holding that miranda did not bar the admission of titemore statements to the trooper.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the basic facts underlying titemore federal prosecution stem from a property dispute between neighbors near the shores of lake carmi in franklin,vermont.on april,the vermont state police responded to a dispute between david titemore and his neighbor,kevin lothian,upon information that titemore had assaulted one of lothian employees by striking him with the bucket of a tractor.an officer issued a citation to titemore to appear in the vermont district court on a simple assault charge.
on the following evening,lothian returned to his home to find that it had been vandalized.he called the vermont state police at about to report that his door had been kicked in,a pool table was damaged,and a marlin rifle had been stolen lothian and a friend,larry tatro,waited for the police in lothian home.at about they saw titemore come on to lothian property they watched titemore smash some lights,play with a propane tank,and attempt to enter the residence.this prompted lothian to place a second call to the vermont state police.the dispatcher patched lothian call through to trooper thad baxter.at the end of a brief telephone conversation in which lothian explained the situation,trooper baxter and lothian agreed to meet on main street in downtown franklin,vermont.
at about,trooper baxter met lothian and tatro on main street.again,lothian explained the situation to the his home had been vandalized,that his rifle was missing,and that he had watched titemore return to the property to engage in further vandalism.lothian also described to trooper baxter the positioning of the homes off of patton shore road.as trooper baxter recalled at the suppression hearing,patton shore road runs in a direction on the western edge of lake carmi lothian house lies just south of tatro on the eastern side of the road,next to the lake and titemore house lies slightly to the south,and to the west,of lothian,on the western side of the road at the intersection of patton shore road and titemore woods road.lothian then agreed to lead trooper baxter to the area.the three men traveled to patton shore road and parked at tatro house.
from tatro residence,the three men walked south along patton shore road in the direction of lothian residence.as they walked,lothian asked the trooper if he wanted to inspect the property damage at his residence trooper baxter said that he would prefer to go speak with titemore first.
at about,trooper baxter,lothian,and tatro arrived at the edge of titemore property.trooper baxter advised lothian and tatro to stay near the road while he approached titemore house.the two men were nervous,however they informed trooper baxter that titemore was probably drunk and most likely had lothian rifle.they were concerned that if titemore mistook the trooper for lothian,trooper baxter might get shot.they advised trooper baxter to approach a door on the western side of titemore property,which was equipped with a light that would illuminate trooper baxter uniform,making him easily recognizable to anyone inside the residence.trooper baxter told lothian and tatro that he would figure out how to proceed as he approached the house.he was aware that titemore was a convicted felon.
titemore home is a small,house with a and three dormer windows that jut from the southern face of the sloped roof.the broad sides of the rectangular home face north and south,but have no doors.on the eastern side of the house,a set of doors open onto a small,relatively open,porch that sits roughly three feet off the ground.on the wall next to the door,there is a light and a nonfunctioning doorbell.on the western side of the house,a small door with a working doorbell and a welcome mat opens onto a driveway that runs north to south where it connects to titemore woods road.at the top of the driveway a small garage is attached to the northwestern corner of titemore home.
the home is located on land adjacent to the intersection of titemore woods and patton shore roads,just north of the former and west of the latter.the two sides of the property not adjacent to the roads are demarcated by a thicket of woods and a fence along the western edge of the property.along the southern side of the property,there is a deep and wide drainage ditch or depression that parallels titemore woods road and feeds into a culvert that passes under the driveway.and on the eastern side of the property,a fence parallels patton shore road from the corner of the intersection until the fence gives way to a line of trees that continues north.because the fence runs right next to the road,but the trees are set back slightly from the edge of the property,there is a gap between the fence and the trees wide enough to permit a person to pass through.together,these and natural objects help to define the shape of the property yet the house still appears to sit on a relatively open lot that can be viewed without obstruction from either titemore woods or patton shore road.
when trooper baxter stood near the intersection of titemore woods and patton shore roads,it was dark.if it had been light,however,trooper baxter would have seen no traditional front door along the southern side of titemore home,but rather the door that opened onto the small porch on the eastern side of the house.at the same time,he had been informed by lothian and tatro of the second entrance on the western side of the house that opened onto the driveway and had the light.
as trooper baxter approached the house,he saw the flickering blue hue of a television set illuminate the door near the eastern.he decided to walk towards the porch and knock on the door.as the district court found,he chose this route for two principal reasons because the television was on in the room adjacent to the porch,he thought that he was more likely to find titemore if he knocked on the door next to that room and baxter was concerned about approaching from the western side of the house because the light would permit titemore to see him approach,but he would not be able to see titemore.thus,trooper baxter necessarily walked around the fence,over the shallow depression,and across titemore front lawn to a set of steps that lead up to the porch and the door.
when trooper baxter arrived on the porch,he found that the glass door had been left open,but a remained closed.as baxter peered through the screen,he could see titemore facing him,watching the television,which was next to the door.the trooper also noticed a rifle lying within titemore reach,at the foot of the chair that he was sitting on.at this point,trooper baxter introduced himself and briefly shined his flashlight upon his uniform so that titemore could see that he was a police officer.according to baxter,titemore was acting strangely,sitting in his chair and staring through the trooper.after baxter asked the defendant if he was david titemore,titemore nodded slowly.
trooper baxter asked titemore if either he could enter the house or titemore would come out to talk.titemore stepped onto the porch.when baxter spoke to titemore,he detected the odor of alcohol on titemore breath.the trooper also noticed that titemore thought processes appeared slowed and his speech slurred.baxter asked titemore if he had ever been convicted of a felony titemore responded,i may have been once.baxter then asked titemore if he was supposed to have a gun,to which titemore replied,no.baxter also asked titemore the make of the gun and whether it was loaded titemore replied that it was a marlin and that it was loaded.
although baxter told titemore that he had come to titemore home to ask about the vandalism at lothian house,he informed titemore that first he wanted to deal with the rifle.trooper baxter then informed titemore that he needed to retrieve the rifle and he asked permission to do so.titemore said yes.at this point,baxter opened the screen door,walked into the room,retrieved the rifle,and immediately walked back onto the porch.baxter then asked titemore how to unload the weapon titemore explained that baxter needed to remove the from the bottom of the rifle.trooper baxter then unloaded the weapon,which included removing a bullet from the chamber.
with the rifle secured,baxter asked titemore about the vandalism at lothian house.titemore replied that he had been at home all day and had not visited lothian property.titemore also claimed that lothian had struck him in the face on the previous evening.baxter issued titemore a citation to appear in court for the offence of unlawful mischief and unlawful trespass.baxter then left the residence,carrying the rifle and the bullets.
a grand jury returned a indictment,charging titemore with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g possession of a firearm by a person who had previously been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation of g and possession of a stolen firearm in violation of j.
titemore moved to suppress evidence of his possession of the rifle as the fruit of an unlawful entry onto the property under the fourth amendment and the incriminating statements to trooper baxter as a violation of his miranda rights.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying the motion to suppress.united states titemore,d.the district judge recognized that the fourth amendment protection extends to the curtilage surrounding a home.he held,however,that an officer does not offend the fourth amendment when he approaches any part of a building where uninvited visitors could be expected and that it was reasonable for baxter to approach the door.after determining that baxter was lawfully at the door,the district judge held that the seizure of the rifle was justified by exigent circumstances.finally,the district judge held that the discussion between baxter and titemore did not offend miranda because titemore was not in custody,a precondition for the requirement of miranda warnings.
titemore subsequently entered into an agreement to plead guilty to count one of the indictment charging possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g.in return,the government agreed to move to dismiss the remaining counts and to recommend that titemore receive credit for his acceptance of responsibility under the sentencing guidelines.titemore reserved his right to appeal from the district court denial of his motion to suppress.
at a subsequent sentencing proceeding,the district court sentenced titemore to seventy months imprisonment and three years supervised release.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,titemore argues that,because the lawn and deck of a home are intimately associated with the home itself,they are within the protected curtilage of the home.based on this argument,titemore contends that trooper baxter violated the fourth amendment by effecting a warrantless entry onto his protected property.titemore argues further that any evidence or statements that were derived from that unlawful entry must be suppressed because they were obtained by the trooper from an unlawful vantage point.
titemore contends that his statements to trooper baxter should be suppressed for the further reason that they were obtained in violation of his rights under miranda arizona,d.specifically,he argues that he was deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way when the trooper questioned him without issuing miranda warnings and therefore suppression is required.while the first argument requires a more elaborate response,we conclude that neither has merit.
curtilage argument 
before katz united states,d,the supreme court often used the concept of a constitutionally protected area to define the reach of the fourth amendment protections.wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment,at ed quoting silverman united states,d.but katz signaled the demise of the habit of conceptualizing areas of constitutional protection katz reminded us that the fourth amendment protects people,not places.katz,at.
while the majority opinion in katz shifted the focus in cases involving the fourth amendment,from places to people,it was justice harlan concurrence that provided the analytical framework for the future 
as the court opinion states,the fourth amendment protects people,not places.the question,however,is what protection it affords to those people.generally,as here,the answer to that question requires reference to a place.my understanding of the rule that has emerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement,first that a person have exhibited an actual subjective expectation of privacy and,second,that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.thus a man home is,for most purposes,a place where he expects privacy,but objects,activities,or statements that he exposes to the plain view of outsiders are not protected because no intention to keep them to himself has been exhibited.on the other hand,conversations in the open would not be protected against being overheard,for the expectation of privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.hester united states.
id.at.harlan,concurring.the reasonable expectation of privacy test,as articulated in justice harlan concurrence,was adopted by a majority of the court a little over a decade later.smith maryland,d.
as justice harlan concurrence made plain,however,katz did not eliminate all constitutional significance of the particular place that a search or seizure occurred it remained relevant to the expectation of privacy analysis at both the subjective and objective levels.see katz,at.harlan,concurring see also lafave,supra,at stating that reference to a place is ordinarily necessary in deciding what protection the fourth amendment affords to people.
the continued significance of place,albeit as a more limited analytical tool,is borne out by the supreme court discussion,for fourth amendment purposes,of the curtilage surrounding a home and its correlative,the open fields a discussion that both antecedes and katz.in hester united states,justice holmes excluded open fields from fourth amendment protections.hester,at.holding that the special protection accorded by the fourth amendment to the people in their persons,houses,papers and effects is not extended to the open fields.in support of this proposition,justice holmes noted the distinction between the open fields and the house is as old as the common law.id.citing william blackstone,commentaries.
justice holmes reference to blackstone commentaries was to a principal limitation of common law burglary,which distinguished between the open fields and the house.the common law definition of burglary was the breaking and entering of a,at night,with the intent to commit a felony inside.william blackstone,commentaries.although treading upon another land itself represented the offence of trespass,the heinous offence of disturbing another right of habitation was reserved for burglary.id.at.thus,in order to qualify for this more serious crime,it was indispensably necessary that the breaking and entering be of a mansion or dwe
