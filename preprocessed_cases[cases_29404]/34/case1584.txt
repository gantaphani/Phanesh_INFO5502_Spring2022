daniel brown appeals from his conviction and sentence in the western district of virginia for a child pornography offense.the grand jury returned a indictment against brown,charging him with receiving visual depictions involving the use of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct child pornography,in violation of a and b count one,and with possessing child pornography,in contravention of a b and b count two.brown sought to suppress evidence that had been recovered from his personal laptop computer the laptop.the district court rejected his suppression motion,however,and brown was found guilty by a jury on both charges.after vacating brown conviction on count two,the court sentenced him on count one to months in prison and ten years of supervised release.brown maintains that the court denial of his motion to suppress was erroneous,and he also contends that the court erred in vacating and dismissing count two the offense rather than count one.as explained below,we reject each of brown contentions and affirm.
in may,detective nicholas rudman of the charlottesville virginia police department,who was assigned to investigate internet crimes against children,began an investigation of an internet protocol ip address associated with a computer that had downloaded files containing child pornography those files were identified to rudman by what is known as hash value,rather than by a proper name rudman recognized the hash values of the files as corresponding to those which,he knew from prior experience,contained child pornography.the pornographic files had been transmitted over the internet through file sharing networks,where users are able to download each others digital files.
detective rudman investigation revealed that the subscriber of the ip address was medical transport,llc,a private ambulance business located in charlottesville.based on information obtained from the company manager,rudman and detective todd lucas were able to narrow the focus of their investigation to defendant brown and justin yarboro,who worked together and were always on duty at medical transport when the files were downloaded.using the information they had discovered,the detectives secured a search warrant on june,for medical transport headquarters.rudman and lucas,joined by detectives lisa reeves and michael flaherty,executed the search warrant that day while brown and yarboro were on duty.their search of medical transport building did not,however,reveal any computers or electronic equipment relevant to their investigation.
when the police officers arrived at medical transport,and while they were executing the search warrant,brown and yarboro were out on a call in an ambulance.upon the duo return to medical transport,they pulled the ambulance to the front of the building and exited the vehicle.the detectives promptly approached the ambulance,introducing themselves as officers of the charlottesville police department investigating internet crimes against children.detective rudman then inquired of brown and yarboro,do you guys have any laptops in your vehicle when brown responded in the affirmative,rudman asked,can you get those for us id.brown complied,retrieving his laptop,which rudman took out of brown hands and handed to detective flaherty for inspection.brown and yarboro were then brought into the medical transport building and interviewed separately.rudman conducted the interview of yarboro,who was the initial focus of the investigation because he was younger than brown and was presumably more computer savvy.detective lucas simultaneously interviewed brown,and quickly realized that brown was the more likely suspect of the two.
detective reeves,who was present at the outset of brown interview,also deduced that brown was more likely to have downloaded the files.she promptly left the interview room to interrupt detective rudman interview of yarboro and lead rudman to where lucas was interviewing brown.detective rudman explained that he was present to ask about child pornography.during the interview,rudman showed brown documents from the investigation indicating that files containing child pornography had been downloaded at medical transport ip address.brown soon admitted that his laptop was the computer that had been involved,and he acknowledged searching for child pornography by computer on and off for a couple of years,using search terms like daughter,incest,and pthc hard core.the detectives thereafter concluded the interview.having seized brown laptop,the detectives procured a second search warrant,authorizing them to search the laptop itself.the laptop was found to contain videos and images of child pornography.
brown was indicted by the grand jury in june.a superseding indictment,returned on february,contains the two charges underlying this appeal after preliminary proceedings in the case,brown jury trial was scheduled for monday,february.brown did not file his motion to suppress,however,until late on saturday,february.
by his suppression motion,brown suggested that the search warrant for medical transport did not authorize a seizure of brown laptop because the laptop was not found in the medical transport building.the motion contended that the warrant only authorized the search of the business of medical transport,and specifically identified and described the building,which was located on harris street in charlottesville.the motion maintained that the warrant allowed the detectives to search for computers,electronic storage devices,and employee records relating to scheduling,but did not authorize a search of either brown or the ambulance outside the building.more specifically,the motion asserted that 
n either brown nor the computer was at the location the warrant authorized for search.officer rudman statements reveal that the cpd officers zeal to obtain the subject of the warrant led them to disregard their authority to search for it here,the warrant clearly allows for search inside a specific building but officers chose to search a person and vehicle outside of the building.thus,the officers found what they were looking for but they did not find it in an area where they were constitutionally permitted to look.
when the parties convened on the monday morning of trial,the district court advised brown lawyer that i not going to listen to a lot of argument on motions that are filed late,but you can tell me what it is you want to argue and i consider it as quickly as i can.brown lawyer briefly explained his position that the police officers had exceeded the scope of the search warrant in their seizure of brown laptop,to which the court responded,i going to deny your motion based on what you filed.i not sure there was such a search.emphasis added.the court continued,disregarding whether the motion is late or not,i think it is late,but on the merits,i do think there substance to the motion and i going to deny the motion to suppress.
brown jury trial lasted for three days and involved the testimony of several witnesses,including brown himself.when brown renewed his motion to suppress at the conclusion of the prosecution evidence,the district court again rejected it,explaining 
as far as the original motion to suppress,i think you heard all the evidence.you questioned the witnesses.the court knows all of the evidence you would put on regarding that.on the merits of it,i think i do think it a meritorious argument i also think no justification for not filing it timely has been shown.
on march,after being instructed by the district court,the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts.in a motion filed on september,brown argued that the possession offense of count two is a offense of the receiving offense in count one,and that his convictions on both offenses therefore violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.brown moved to dismiss count one,which charged him with knowingly receiving child pornography,as opposed to count two,which charged him with knowingly possessing such files.see supra note.the united states attorney did not dispute that possession is a offense of receipt,but moved to dismiss count two,asserting that brown should be sentenced o
