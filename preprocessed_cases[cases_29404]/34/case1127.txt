luis rodriguez was convicted following a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,ross,of possession with intent to distribute heroin and conspiracy to distribute heroin.see.rodriguez now moves for a new trial arguing,inter alia,that the district court improperly admitted expert testimony offered by two law enforcement officers and that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.rodriguez principally argues,however,that his conviction should be reversed because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to warrant a conviction.on this score,we agree.we therefore reverse rodriguez conviction and remand with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.
background 
from july to december,the drug enforcement agency dea conducted an investigation into the activities of carlos medina,a suspected narcotics dealer.during this six month investigation a dea confidential informant,enrique ramos,personally met with and spoke by telephone to medina on several occasions to arrange the purchase of heroin.the investigation culminated on december,when the dea arranged a buy and bust operation at which ramos was to purchase heroin from medina.ramos and medina arranged to meet at a boston market restaurant to consummate the transaction.the prosecution against rodriguez and an alleged,tommy cruz,centered on their involvement in the events surrounding that meeting.
rodriguez and cruz were charged in a single indictment with two counts conspiracy to distribute a substance containing heroin in an amount of grams or more and possession with intent to distribute a similar amount of heroin.they were tried jointly.at trial,the government postulated that both men knowingly and intentionally assisted in the boston market meeting and the attempted sale of the heroin by serving as lookouts for medina.that is,they allegedly protected medina from detection by law enforcement and robbery by rival drug dealers.during the course of a two day trial the government offered the testimony of ramos and five dea agents.the government evidence consisted of the following.
before medina met with ramos,rodriguez and cruz arrived together at the boston market in a lincoln town car.the dea investigation had not previously targeted either individual as being involved with medina.but,when rodriguez and cruz exited their vehicle and began surveying the surrounding area and stores,dea agents began to monitor their actions.dea surveillance also showed that rodriguez and cruz examined vehicles in the restaurant parking lot,with cruz even walking up to and peering into a dea surveillance van.only after doing so did they enter the boston market to order food.rodriguez and cruz then sat together,several tables from where ramos already was seated.
thereafter,medina arrived at the boston market and sat with ramos.in hushed voices ramos and medina discussed the sale of heroin,and ramos agreed to accept grams of heroin at a price of per gram.after the negotiations were complete medina left the boston market,promising ramos that he would return with the drugs.medina walked east through the restaurant parking lot,and dea agents observed him make a call on his cellular telephone.soon thereafter,rodriguez and cruz exited the restaurant,entered the lincoln town car and,as medina had done minutes earlier,proceeded east through the parking lot.
as the agents waited for medina to return with the heroin they saw the lincoln town car carrying three unidentifiable passengers drive past both their surveillance van and the boston market.approximately three minutes later,the car reappeared.this time it carried only two passengers,cruz and medina,and it proceeded into the parking lot.at the same time agents observed rodriguez suspicious ly standing alone on a street corner a block from the restaurant,looking toward the restaurant parking lot.
on seeing medina,ramos exited the boston market and approached the car as he did so,ramos noticed that cruz was in the driver seat while medina sat alongside him in the front passenger seat.ramos entered the back seat of the car and medina directed him to look in a box located behind the driver seat.ramos opened the box and observed heroin hidden inside a plastic bag.satisfied,ramos informed medina that he would retrieve cash to finalize the transaction.instead,ramos exited the car and gave the dea agents a prearranged arrest signal.in response,the agents converged on the car and arrested cruz and medina.they also searched the car,seizing a total of grams of heroin.also seized from the back seat of the car was a locked briefcase that contained two weapons an electronic taser gun and oc spray and documentation including a hotel bill and passport bearing rodriguez name.finally,the agents seized a cellular telephone and a pager from medina.
after his arrest cruz professed that he did not know that medina was selling narcotics.instead,cruz stated that he had been asked to watch someone back and did not know precisely why medina met with ramos.for his part,medina immediately began to cooperate.rodriguez was apprehended three weeks later,at which time agents also seized a cellular telephone that he was carrying.a dea agent testified that one day after his arrest,while awaiting his initial appearance before a magistrate judge,rodriguez,apparently referencing the lincoln town car and the items found within it,asked where his car and passport were being kept.
at trial the government also offered the expert testimony of two dea agents.one of these witnesses,special agent mark tully,opined that when cruz stated that he had arrived at the boston market to watch someone back he used a phrase commonly understood in narcotics jargon to mean serving as a lookout for a drug deal.the government also offered the expert testimony of agent brian fleming,who oversaw the investigation.he testified that drug dealers usually bring armed associates to such transactions as a means of guarding against robbery by rival drug dealers and to detect law enforcement activity.
finally,the government offered two pieces of demonstrative evidence against rodriguez.first,to establish that rodriguez owned the lincoln town car the government offered into evidence the taser gun,oc spray and documentation bearing rodriguez name,all of which were seized from the locked briefcase inside the vehicle.second,the government offered records from the cellular telephones and pager seized when medina and rodriguez were arrested separately.these records showed that during the two days preceding medina meeting with ramos thirteen telephone calls and four pages were placed between the two phones.the toll records also showed that on the day of the meeting six calls were placed between the seized phones,with two calls being made minutes before rodriguez and cruz arrived at the boston market.additionally,the records indicated that a call was placed between the two phones corresponding to when agents observed medina talking on a cellular telephone as he walked through the restaurant parking lot after finalizing the terms of the sale with ramos.
after agent fleming completed his testimony the government rested its case.although the record before us indicates that medina was cooperating,the government did not offer his testimony.counsel for rodriguez and cruz then moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,arguing that the government had failed to demonstrate that either defendant knew that medina engaged in a drug deal or acted with the specific intent to provide assistance to a drug transaction.specifically,counsel for rodriguez maintained that the government had offered only suspicious behavior coupled with some cell phone calls such that t he government never demonstrated knowledge and intent on the part of rodriguez as part of this conspiracy and the evidence is sufficient to sustain the case going to the jury.when the district court denied the motions,rodriguez and cruz elected not to call any witnesses to testify on their behalf.the jury subsequently convicted rodriguez on both the conspiracy charge and the substantive possession charge.the jury acquitted cruz of conspiracy but convicted him on the substantive charge.
thereafter,the district court sentenced rodriguez principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by five years of supervised release.a judgment of conviction was entered on july,from which rodriguez timely appealed.
discussion 
standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the government evidence 
rodriguez asks us to determine whether the government presented evidence that proved his guilt on the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.to prevail,rodriguez bears a heavy burden,united states,cir,as our inquiry requires us to ask only whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.the relevant question in this inquiry is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.moreover,the absence of direct evidence establishing rodriguez guilt is not dispositive.united states glenn,cir.in fact,the government is entitled to prove its case solely through circumstantial evidence,provided,of course,that the government still demonstrates each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.id.it thus remains axiomatic that,i t would not satisfy the constitution to have a jury determine that the defendant is probably guilty.sullivan louisiana,d.
ii.the decision in united states cruz 
before addressing the merits of this case,we pause to note that we have already considered cruz appeal.in resolving that appeal we held that the government offered insufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could have found cruz guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states cruz,cir.we so held because the record,which largely tracks the evidence offered against rodriguez,was devoid of evidence that cruz knew that medina possessed drugs or that he intended to sell drugs to ramos.id.at.we noted that the dea agents testimony that cruz engaged in countersurveillance activity when he initially arrived at the boston market,that cruz was present at the boston market during the meeting,and that cruz drove the lincoln town car in which ramos first saw the heroin all indicated that cruz was present at the scene of the crime and likely knew that some type of crime was being committed.id.at.we held,however,that the evidence fell short of establishing that cruz knew of the specific crime medina proposed to commit or that cruz intended to facilitate such a crime.id.at.we thus held that the government offered insufficient evidence to show that,although cruz may have served as a lookout,he possessed the requisite knowledge and specific intent to sustain his conviction.id.
in addition,we also addressed cruz argument that agent tully was erroneously permitted to offer expert testimony regarding the meaning of cruz statement that he was present at the scene of medina meeting with ramos because he had been asked to watch someone back.we held that the district court improperly permitted agent tully to offer expert testimony regarding the meaning of this phrase because the government had offered no evidence that it had a fixed meaning in drug parlance.id.at.nonetheless,even taking into consideration this improperly admitted testimony,we held that there existed insufficient proof to permit a reasonable jury to have found cruz guilty.id.at.accordingly,we reversed cruz conviction and directed the district court to enter a judgment of acquittal.id.at.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence against rodriguez 
on this appeal rodriguez argues that the decision in cruz requires us to reverse his conviction.the government argues that despite our decision in cruz we may affirm rodriguez conviction because a separate set of facts established his guilt.moreover,the government argues that unlike cruz,who could have been convicted of the substantive charge only under an aiding and abetting theory,rodriguez could have been convicted under a constructive possession theory as well.despite the government attempt to parse the evidence,we hold that rodriguez conviction must be reversed.
rodriguez conviction under an aiding and abetting theory 
mindful of the deferential standard of review through which we must consider rodriguez appeal,we first ask whether the government presented sufficient evidence to merit a conviction on the conspiracy and substantive charges on the grounds that rodriguez aided and abetted a drug transaction.
to prove possession with the intent to distribute,the government was required to show that rodriguez knowingly and intentionally possessed heroin,and did so with the intent to distribute it.see a united states boonphakdee,cir.and,as we stated in cruz,a n aiding and abetting conviction must be premised on more than evidence of a general cognizance of criminal activity or suspicious circumstances.at quoting united states samaria,cir.we observed that t o prove that the defendant acted with specific intent,the government must show that the defendant knew of the proposed crime.cruz,at quoting united states labat,cir.
unlike cruz,who was convicted only of a possession charge,rodriguez was also convicted of violating section of title of the united states code.that section provides 
any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense,the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.
to sustain a conspiracy conviction,the government must present some evidence from which it can reasonably be inferred that the person charged with conspiracy knew of the existence of the scheme alleged in the indictment and knowingly joined and participated in it.united states morgan,cir quoting united states gaviria,cir.proof that the defendant knew that some crime would be committed is not enough.id.quoting united states friedman,cir.
in sum,the conspiracy and substantive charges,both of which are specific intent crimes,required the government to establish that rodriguez knowingly and intentionally participated in the drug deal involving medina and ramos.see morgan,at samaria,at,united states pitre,cir.for this reason,the government argues that it not only showed that rodriguez served as a lookout for medina,but also that it introduced sufficient circumstantial evidence of rodriguez knowledge and intent.
as an initial matter,we note that as we held in cruz,the government presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that rodriguez served as a lookout.see cruz,at viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all permissible inferences in its favor,the most the prosecution demonstrated here was that cruz acted as a lookout for medina.for instance,the testimony that rodriguez along with cruz engaged in countersurveillance activity outside the restaurant just before medina meeting with ramos,that both men remained in the restaurant for the entire minutes after medina had that rodriguez was observed standing on a corner one block from the restaurant when medina and cruz met with ramos in the lincoln town car,permitted the jury to conclude that rodriguez acted as a lookout.nevertheless,as in cruz,a critical question remains whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that rodriguez had the knowledge and specific intent to aid and abet a drug transaction.see samaria,at in conspiracy cases in which defendants acted as lookouts,we have upheld convictions only when other indicia of the elements of the underlying substantive offense have been in evidence.see also united states dean,cir noting that evidence establishing that defendant acted as a lookout was alone insufficient to show that he knew he was conducting countersurveillance for a drug transaction united states wexler,cir holding despite evidence that defendant acted as a lookout,absence of evidence linking defendant to the specific object of crime was fatal to prosecution.
on appeal,the government posits that four pieces of ev
