following a lengthy trial,a petit jury convicted jose gerardo on four counts involving hobbs act extortion and related money laundering.in this venue,the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of convictions based mainly on evidence neither identified in the indictment nor previewed before the grand jury.we affirm.
background 
because the appellant mounts a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we rehearse the relevant facts in the light most hospitable to the verdict,consistent with record support.see united states,cir.
in the,puerto rico began the substantive process of privatizing hospitals.see laws ann.tit.repealed.the enabling legislation,among other things,authorized the department of health the doh to contract out certain services and to sell off public hospitals.that aspect of the legislation required the doh,acting in concert with the government development bank the gdb,to approve each such transaction.see id.
sales of public hospitals typically had to be accomplished through competitive bidding.see id.if,however,a financially sound investor already was administering the affairs of a particular public hospital,the doh could the bidding process and negotiate directly with that investor for a sale of the hospital.see id.in an effort to take advantage of the option,caribbean anesthesia services,cas sought to assume an existing contract for the administration of the alejandro otero lópez hospital the hospital in manatí,puerto rico.the contract was,at the time,held by caribbean hospital corporation chc.
as part of a push to gain the doh approval for the contract assumption,a cas consultant arranged a luncheon between cas shareholders and the appellant,who was the chief legal adviser to the secretary of health the secretary and the director of the doh law department.at this on cas behalf by,among others,josé de,josé ivan ramos cubano,and alvin ramirez appellant learned of cas interest in taking over the hospital management contract and,ultimately,in purchasing the facility outright.when the meeting ended,the appellant said that he would help cas in whatever way he could.the cas shareholders thereafter agreed that de would shepherd the relationship with the doh generally and with the appellant specifically.
from that point forward,the appellant served as cas ears and eyes in the government,keeping de abreast of all developments.cas soon learned of two potential snags.first,there were other groups interested in acquiring the hospital.second,the gdb counsel had issued an opinion that highlighted a dispute over whether cas would be responsible for monies owed to the doh by its assignor chc.this dispute was significant both because of the size of the debt and because,under puerto rico law,an entity in debt to the doh could not take advantage of the option.see id.since the management contract had only a short time left to run,the gdb counsel argued that the hospital should be auctioned off through an open bidding process.
in october of,the doh overrode the gdb objections,approved cas proposed acquisition of the management contract,and gave cas until june,to negotiate terms for a direct sale of the hospital.cas took over management of the facility the next month.
on november,while the negotiations were in full flower,de wired from a cas account to the appellant bank account.on january,than a month appellant instructed his bank to return the money because it did not belong to him.however,a mere four days thereafter,de withdrew from a cas account and used the funds to procure fourteen money orders,each in the amount of.without exception,the proceeds of these money orders found their way into the appellant possession before the deadline.the appellant used the funds for a variety of personal purposes,to make a down payment on a new automobile,to pay for his children private schooling,and to augment individual retirement accounts held by him and his wife.
in june of,cas sent a letter of intent for the hospital purchase to the gdb and the doh.although the privatization committee found cas to be a suitable purchaser,an auditor report indicated that the debt dispute had not been resolved.a meeting was arranged between the gdb,the doh,the governor chief of staff,and cas.josé quirós,who held a twenty percent equity interest in cas,met with the appellant beforehand in order to present his views on the matter.when the meeting occurred,the governor chief of staff requested that the appellant draft a legal opinion to resolve the uncertainty.
in an initial opinion,dated september,the appellant found that cas was responsible for the debts amassed by its chc.shortly thereafter,the appellant did an and prepared a revised opinion,dated september,in which he concluded that cas was not responsible for the debts amassed by chc.the revised opinion was accepted by the agencies involved and made cas eligible to purchase the hospital without the hindrance of competitive bidding.the parties closed on the direct sale three days later although cas and the doh continued to debate financial issues that arose out of cas earlier management of the hospital.
at the same time that the doh was dickering with cas over the debt issue,the appellant was negotiating sub rosa to become counsel for pinnacle a company controlled by quirós.in those negotiations,the appellant presented pinnacle with a wish list that included a annual salary,a luxury car,a retirement plan,health benefits,sick leave,paid vacation,and summer camp for his children.in quirós words,he and de felt obliged to hire the appellant,notwithstanding the fact that his demands far exceeded what pinnacle had budgeted for the position.
in august of,while both the appellant employment negotiations and cas debt negotiations were ongoing,de leased an audi for the appellant use.cas not only footed the bill but also gave the appellant the use of a gasoline credit card,free of charge.
on october,pinnacle,through quirós,formally offered the appellant the counsel position.cas and the doh resolved their remaining financial issues the next month.the appellant started work at pinnacle in january of.the jury supportably could have found that these events were not merely coincidental but,rather,inextricably intertwined pinnacle managed two medical centers,including cas newly acquired hospital,and these two institutions jointly paid the salaries of all pinnacle employees including pinnacle neophyte counsel.
in due course,a federal grand jury indicted the appellant and four codefendants including de,ramos cubano,and ramirez ortiz.the indictment charged the appellant with two counts of extortion,one count of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion and one count of interference with commerce by extortion and two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering.see.after a day trial,a petit jury found the appellant guilty across the board.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
before us,the appellant advances three assignments of error.first,he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict on the hobbs act extortion charges counts and.second,and relatedly,he maintains that this same dearth of evidence undermines his convictions for money laundering counts and because the alleged extortion served as the underlying predicate offense on which those charges were based.third,he posits that his convictions on all four counts must be set aside due to a fatal variance those convictions were premised on evidence neither submitted to the grand jury nor referenced in the indictment.we address the three components of this asseverational array sequentially.
counts and.
we review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,assessing the proof in the light most hospitable to the verdict.see united states vega molina,cir united states valle,cir.the test is whether the evidence,including all reasonable inferences therefrom,would permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.see united states,cir.we administer the test without any independent evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses.see united states,cir.finally,we caution that to achieve a passing grade on this test,the prosecution need not have succeeded in negating every possible theory consistent with the defendant innocence.see,at.
the hobbs act criminalizes conduct that in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce,by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do.a.to support the hobbs act charges in this case then,the government needed to establish that the appellant committed extortion and that his actions affected interstate or international commerce.see id.we consider the sufficiency of the evidence as to each such element.
extortion.the hobbs act defines extortion as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right.id.b.the indictment charged the appellant with extortion both under color of official right and through inducement by economic fear.the color of official right and fear prongs provide alternative,independently sufficient grounds for finding extortion thus,adequate proof of one obviates any need for proof of the other.see united states bucci,cir explaining that the prosecution can establish a violation by showing that a defendant induced payment either through the use of fear,or under color of official right united states hathaway,cir similar.
the appellant contends that in a hobbs act color of official right case,the government must show that the official somehow induced the payment.this emphasis exaggerates the government burden.to establish guilt for extortion under color of official right,the prosecution must show only that the defendant,a public official,has received an emolument that he was not entitled to receive,with knowledge that the emolument was tendered in exchange for some official act.see evans united states,d united states,cir.the government is not required to prove any affirmative act of inducement on the part of the corrupt official.see evans,at.
here,the evidence reveals that the appellant accepted in serial money orders derived from a cas account.he received and spent these funds while the doh approval of cas proposal to acquire the hospital hung in the balance.given the appellant pivotal role in the doh triage of hospital purchase proposals,the importance attached to his opinion by the governor chief of staff,and his resultant power to impact cas financial interests,the jury reasonably could have inferred that the money orders were intended as reciprocity for official acts,past or that the appellant knew as much.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the appellant suggests that these payments were simply the fruits of his special relationship with de.that relationship,the appellant muses,inspired de to make a generous,gift.we need not dwell on the inherent implausibility of such an explanation it suffices to say that the government need not refute every alternative theory consistent with the defendant innocence in order to defeat a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.see united states woodward,cir.in this instance,the jury acted well within its proper province in rejecting the somewhat fanciful claim that the appellant received a considerable sum of money due to friendship with a man who just happened to be a beneficiary of his official acts.united states ortiz,cir explaining that jurors are neither required to divorce themselves from their common sense nor to abandon the dictates of mature experience.
we have said enough on this score.since a plausible view of the evidence supports a finding that the appellant accepted the money orders in exchange for official acts,the proposition that the government failed to establish extortion under color of official right necessarily fails.
although this finding,without more,establishes the extortion element,we note for the sake of completeness that the evidence also suffices to ground a finding of extortion induced through fear.we explain briefly.
under the hobbs act,fear encompasses fear of economic loss,including the loss of business opportunities.see bucci,at.to establish that kind of fear,the government must show that the victim reasonably feared that noncompliance with the putative extortionist terms would result in economic loss.see united states rivera rangel,cir.the evidence in this case satisfies that criterion.
cas made a substantial investment when it assumed the management contract for the it risked forfeiting both that investment and the prospect of future profits if the doh did not endorse its purchase proposal.the appellant played a key role in the negotiating pavane and,thus,had the potential to influence perhaps to dictate the success or failure of cas business plan.a rational jury surely could have inferred that,given the circumstances,de and quirós would have been apprehensive that noncompliance with the appellant demands such as his esurient terms for future employment at pinnacle would result in the foreclosure of a lucrative business opportunity.the plausibility of this inference was strengthened by quirós testimony that he had been considering a more experienced candidate for the pinnacle counsel position that he had budgeted a lower wage for that post but that he nonetheless felt obliged to hire the appellant at the more munificent salary that the appellant stipulated.in this regard,the jury reasonably could have thought that fe eling obliged was a euphemism for fearing the consequences of rejecting the appellant demands.
to cinch matters,the events that transpired demonstrate beyond hope of contradiction that cas economic fear was reasonable.the appellant initial opinion letter,which was unfavorable to cas,attained the secretary endorsement.it was only when the appellant reversed field and revised his legal opinion which otherwise would have barred any direct sale that a pathway opened for cas acquisition of the hospital.the timing amply illustrates the salience of this the parties closed on the sale of the hospital a scant three days after the appellant issued his revised opinion.
we hold,therefore,that the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the appellant was guilty of extortion induced by fear of economic loss.united states doyle,cir warning that o ne would have to believe in the tooth fairy to think a particular sequence of events merely coincidental.
commerce.in addition to establishing extortion,the government also must show that the extortionate conduct obstructed,delayed,or affected interstate or international commerce.see a.as to this prong,the case law erects a low threshold a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to sustain a hobbs act conviction.see vega molina,at.
the appellant advances two contentions in hopes of showing that the government failed to cross even this modest threshold.neither contention is persuasive.
the appellant principal argument is that there was no effect on interstate commerce because the money orders that he received were purchased by de personally.since de earned his livelihood as a physician and only practiced his profession in local hospitals,this thesis runs,an extortion of his funds could not have interfered with interstate commerce.this exercise in legal legerdemain does not withstand scrutiny.
while de bought the money orders,the record confirms that he first withdrew a sum equal to their cost a cas account.he then used the appropriated funds to buy the money orders.hence,the distinction between business and personal funds that the appellant relies on here is purely one of form,not of substance.
the jurisprudence of the hobbs act does not recognize that kind of artificial distinction.see,united states devin,cir finding an effect on interstate commerce when defendant had received money from the president of a corporation who,in turn,had derived the money from the coffers of the was engaged in interstate commerce.a temporary interval of personal possession may serve to weaken the causal connection between funds and interstate commerce,but that connection remains strong enough to for
