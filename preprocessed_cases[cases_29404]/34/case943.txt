rory jackson appeals his conviction after trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york dearie,for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of g.we vacate the conviction because the district court improperly admitted evidence that jackson had been present in an apartment where police later found a cache of weapons and other contraband.
background 
on november,new york city police officers responded to a call reporting a gunshot in an apartment building in queens.the shot was fired from apartment on the third floor into apartment below.police officers william sommer and jonathan jordan arrived at the building shortly after the call and saw durrell williams,rory jackson,and zanika arnold outside.the officers identified themselves and asked the three to stop.williams fled,and officer sommer pursued him.
as sommer chased williams,officer jordan approached jackson and told him to show his hands.jackson took a can of juice out of his pocket,threw it at jordan,and turned to flee.as jackson turned,officer jordan spotted what he believed to be the butt of a gun in jackson jacket pocket.jordan radioed a description of jackson and chased him for approximately to feet before giving up the chase.
officer scott ferrari arrived at the scene to help establish a police perimeter.he saw jackson exit a nearby building looking disheveled and wearing his pants.jackson refused ferrari and other officers commands to stop and instead crouched behind a parked car.ferrari then apprehended jackson at gunpoint.jordan arrived approximately minutes later and identified jackson.
ferrari and other officers searched the area for the gun that jordan believed he had seen in jackson pocket.ferrari found a gun in a garbage can in a courtyard between the locations where jordan had chased jackson and where ferrari later apprehended jackson.there were no fingerprints on the gun.
the day after jackson arrest,new york city police officers executed a search warrant on apartment,from which the shot had been fired.among other things,they found firearms,other weapons,vests,drugs,and cash.jackson was indicted in the eastern district for violating g,which prohibits a person previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year from possessing a firearm.
jackson trial was scheduled to begin on monday,june.at approximately on sunday,june,the government moved to admit evidence of the contraband that police recovered from apartment.the government proffered that eye witness testimony would establish that,shortly before the shot was fired,jackson was in possession of the items recovered from apartment 
four loaded firearms,including a revolver with an attached laser pointer,two bullet proof vests,at least rounds of live ammunition of various types,a metal knuckle knife and machete,quantities of cocaine and marihuana,empty ziplock bags,several scales and over in united states currency.
the government suggested two reasons for admissibility necessary background to the charged crime and to show jackson opportunity,plan and lack of mistake in possessing the gun.
the district court admitted the evidence,stating that y our party is put in that apartment with that kind of armament moments before the shot occurs.it is prejudicial,but not unduly prejudicial.it is highly relevant.
during the trial,the government called zanika arnold to testify,apparently as the eye witness who would establish jackson possession of the contraband in apartment.arnold testified that,at about on the night jackson was arrested,she went to visit her boyfriend durrell williams at the queens apartment in which he was staying.although the record is unclear as to the apartment number,the government argued to the jury during its closing statement that it was apartment.when arnold entered the building,she saw jackson downstairs.jackson escorted her upstairs to apartment so that she could use the bathroom.the government offered nothing further to link jackson to the apartment or,significantly,to the weapons and drugs found in it.
testifying for the government,officer jordan stated that he saw what he thought was the butt of a black gun in the left pocket of jackson black leather jacket.it was dark out,but a spotlight lit the area outside the building.on,jordan admitted that he was not sure that jackson had a gun and that he did not see jackson throw a gun away while running.
through testimony from jordan and officer philip mathew,who helped execute the search warrant,the government showed the jury four guns recovered from the apartment and a series of photographs depicting the weapons,cash,and drug paraphernalia found in apartment.during officer jordan testimony,the district court instructed the jury that the case ha d nothing to do with a narcotics charge,adding that the jury should not consider the evidence of drugs for any reason whatsoever.the court explained that the jury was receiving the evidence merely because these are the materials that were found in the apartment.
after the government rested its case,jackson moved for a judgment of acquittal.the district court denied the motion.
during its summation,the government specifically focused on the contraband found in apartment,telling the jury 
y ou heard a lot of evidence about things that were recovered in that apartment.you saw guns and you saw scales and a knife and things.
and i want to remind you the defendant is not charged with any of those things.
the reason the government presented you with that evidence is just so that you know the whole story,that you know exactly what was going on that day,and that you know who the defendant really is emphasis added.
in the government rebuttal summation,it argued that jackson had access to the apartment and that drug dealers do let you just walk into their apartments.according to the prosecutor,the fact that jackson had access to the apartment allowed the jury to make a reasonable conclusion about the defendant and whether he had a gun that night.
the jury found jackson guilty.
after trial,jackson retained new counsel who sought reconsideration of the motion for acquittal and moved for a new trial.jackson renewed his challenge to the admissibility of the evidence that weapons and drugs had been found in the apartment.he also contended that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that newly discovered evidence undermined the verdict.
in april,the district court denied jackson motions.carefully explaining its reasoning,the court remarked that the critical part of this case,given the circumstantial nature of the specific charge,has to do with the contents of the apartment.the district court added,i did not admit the guns and photographs as b evidence 
the district court subsequently sentenced jackson to months imprisonment.
jackson now appeals.
discussion 
we conclude that jackson conviction must be vacated because the evidence recovered from apartment the day after his arrest was not admissible for any proper purpose.we also hold that admission of the evidence was not harmless error.we need not address jackson other challenges to his conviction and sentence.
standard of review 
we review admissibility of evidence at trial for abuse of discretion.united states mercado,cir.
ii.background to the crime 
to be relevant,evidence need only tend to prove the government case,and evidence that adds context and dimension to the government proof of the charges can have that tendency.united states gonzalez,cir.thus,evidence is often admissible to provide background for the events alleged in the indictment or to enable the jury to understand the complete story of the crimes charged.united states reifler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we disagree that the contraband evidence was relevant as background to the crime.
the physical evidence from the apartment was not particularly helpful to explain the crime.the government version of the facts was simple and complete the police responded to a report of a shooting in the building they approached a group of people outside the building jackson fled officer jordan saw a gun in jackson pocket the police later
