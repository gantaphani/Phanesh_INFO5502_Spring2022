cindy moll moll appeals from the decisions of the united states district court for the western district of new york,william skretny,granting in part verizon motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment,and denying moll motion to compel production of documents.
moll alleges that verizon discriminated against her,subjected her to a sexually hostile work environment,retaliated against her for complaints of discrimination and harassment,and paid her less than her male colleagues for equal work.the district court concluded that moll premised her hostile work environment claim on only the allegations that were sexually offensive.and because moll did not allege any sexually offensive acts within the applicable statute of limitations,it dismissed her hostile work environment claims.the district court erred when it refused to consider all allegations in the complaint in their totality,including those that were not sexually offensive in nature.hostile work environment claims may be supported by facially incidents and sexually offensive acts may be facially.see alfano costello,cir.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it granted in part verizon motion to dismiss.
we also find that the district court abused its discretion when it denied moll motion to compel documents related to verizon reduction in force events and,therefore,order the district court to compel production of such documents.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it granted in part verizon motion for summary judgment.
in addition,we conclude that the district court erred when it refused to consider a witness statements in an affidavit that contradicted prior deposition testimony.although a party can not create a material issue of fact to defeat a motion for summary judgment by simply contradicting his earlier testimony,the sham issue of fact doctrine does not mandate that the court disregard a witness subsequent testimony when it conflicts with the witness prior statement.we thus vacate the judgment of the district court insofar as it granted in part verizon motion for summary judgment.
we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
