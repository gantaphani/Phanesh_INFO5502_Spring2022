background 
i.the offense 
tran is a canadian citizen and resident of toronto,canada.born in in north vietnam of chinese ancestry,tran spent many years in refugee camps in hong kong and china and speaks some english with an accent.he owns a small mattress manufacturing company.
on october,tran telephoned an office of thrifty car rental in toronto and inquired into renting a vehicle for a planned trip to a casino in upstate new york.according to tran,his own car was in disrepair.the rental agent suggested a chrysler pacifica.tran hesitated because he disliked chrysler vehicles,but the agent prevailed upon him to visit the rental agency and inspect the car.the next day,sometime between noon and,tran arrived at thrifty car rental to inspect the chrysler pacifica.he approved of the vehicle and signed a rental agreement,but he did not immediately assume possession of the vehicle.instead,tran returned to his factory for the afternoon.meanwhile,the chrysler pacifica remained unattended in the thrifty car rental parking lot,secured by its door locks and a steering wheel lock.
at approximately,tran returned to thrifty car rental and assumed possession of the rental vehicle.he drove to a shopping mall,and he then drove to a bar,where he ate and drank until midnight.after leaving the bar,tran again returned to his factory.although he planned to sleep for only a few hours,he instead slept until approximately.in preparation for his trip,he then packed a,a jacket,and a brush,as well as usd and canadian.although tran had no idea where the seneca niagara casino was located,he took no directions with him.he also apparently had no specific plans for returning home other than he expected to stay one day or,luck permitting,longer.
tran left toronto for the peace bridge border crossing,driving alone in the rental car.when tran reached the peace bridge,a united states customs officer inspected his citizenship card and asked him about his destination.the officer later testified that,when asked where he was headed,tran became somewhat nervous h e began sweating,he gripped the steering wheel.he became a little fidgety in the vehicle as in somewhat moving around,looking around.the officer referred tran to the secondary inspection area.
at the secondary inspection area,two other officers asked tran to complete a customs declaration form while they searched his car.during the inspection,the officers found a screwdriver and a gas can in the vehicle.meanwhile,one of the officers recalled an intelligence report that suggested there could be hidden compartments on the pacifica.after confirming the substance of this intelligence report with a special agent,the officer physically inspected the vehicle headliner,or interior roof lining,with his hands.upon discovering that the headliner felt very inconsistent with what a headliner should feel like,the officer then tested the density of the headliner using a device known as a buster.the device confirmed that the headliner density was unusual.at that point,the officer began removing the headliner,which,as he later testified came down very easily.
as the liner loosened,a bag slipped out from the space between the liner and the roof.the bag contained four smaller bags,each of which held several even smaller baggies.these smaller baggies contained what appeared to be pink and green pills.when tran saw the bags emerging from the headliner,he yelled something to the effect of what going on or what happening.the officers seized the bags of pills as evidence,arrested tran,and began to question him.tran repeatedly denied knowledge of the bags or the pills within them.
ii.dea handling and analysis of the pills 
shortly thereafter,dea agents arrived at the peace bridge to take custody of the pills,which the customs officers had sealed in evidence bags.the agents removed the pills from the four bags and separated them into evidence bags by color.the sorting produced a bag of pink pills and two bags of green pills.while sorting the pills,the agents did not track which pills came from each of the original four bags or,for that matter,which came from each of the smaller baggies therein.
the three evidence bags were sent to a laboratory for chemical analysis.there,the chemist first counted the pills,finding a total of pills weighing kilograms pink pills in one bag,green pills in another,and green pills in the last.he then removed pills from each of the three bags.initial screening showed that the pills in each group contained either methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma,commonly known as ecstacy or methamphetamine.after grinding up each of the three piles of pills into three corresponding piles of powder,the chemist performed further tests.according to those tests,the first pile contained mdma and the second mdma and and the third mdma and.at trial,the chemist testified that in his opinion,the results of these tests performed on the samples of pills accurately reflected the amount and percentage of mdma and in all of the pills that had been seized.
iii.tran trial 
following tran arrest,a grand jury in the western district of new york charged him with knowingly importing into the united states grams or more of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine,in violation of a,b h.the grand jury also charged tran with knowingly possessing with intent to distribute a mixture containing methamphetamine,in violation of a.
at trial,tran maintained his innocence and testified,inter alia,that he was an unwitting courier with no knowledge that his rental vehicle contained drugs.in its jury instructions,the district court explained what the jury must consider in deciding whether tran had knowledge of the drugs in the car 
it is obviously impossible to prove directly the operation of the defendant mind.but a wise and intelligent consideration of all the facts and circumstances may enable you to infer what the defendant state of mind was 
for example,if a defendant was a sole occupant of an apartment,it reasonable to conclude the defendant knew about the items in the apartment.the defendant behavior may also indicate knowledge.nervousness in the presence of drugs or flight from the site at which the authorities identified drugs may indicate that the defendant knew that the materials in question were narcotics.
trial tr.at emphases added.with the exception of this passage,the district court instructions to the jury largely comported with the model jury instructions.see leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions criminal.at no point did the district court instruct the jury that it could infer knowledge from the defendant sole occupancy of the vehicle.
the jury convicted tran on both counts.in september,the district court accepted the guidelines calculation of the probation office and sentenced tran to months incarceration,which was at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range,as well as five years supervised release and a special assessment of.
discussion 
tran appeals his conviction and sentence on several grounds.first,he challenges two of the district court jury instructions.second,he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict.third,he claims that his sentence was unreasonable.
i.the jury instructions 
tran challenges two of the district court instructions to the jury an instruction relating to the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from a defendant sole occupancy of a vehicle and an instruction on the relevance of a defendant nervousness to the element of knowledge.
sole occupancy of a vehicle 
in his brief,tran states that the district court instructed the jury that if the defendant was the sole occupant of a a sic vehicle,it is reasonable to
