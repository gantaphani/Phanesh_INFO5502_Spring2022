jean brown appeals the district court entry of a criminal judgment against her following a jury trial,whereby she was convicted of conspiring to traffic in kilograms or more of marijuana,and of additional charges stemming from the kidnapping and murder of michael knight in connection with her trafficking operation.brown also appeals the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on one of her four convictions.discerning no cognizable error,we affirm.
the government evidence at trial demonstrated that brown was at the forefront of a marijuana trafficking enterprise,in which copious quantities of the drug were smuggled across the border from mexico and trucked northeast for resale.brown facilitated her trafficking activities through a number of trucking companies under her control.in the typical instance,drivers hauling perishables across the country would meet the mexican suppliers in arizona,conceal the contraband within the legitimate cargo,and return to baltimore.some of the marijuana was sold locally,but most of it was redistributed for sale in pittsburgh and elsewhere.each month,brown operation processed about one ton of marijuana,from which she made about million to finance the next monthly purchase.
the lion share of the proceeds that brown did not return to the business made their way to jamaica,where she invested them in real estate.brown was born in jamaica,but came to the united states as an adult in or to reside for a time in miami.brown moved to the baltimore area in about and began to build her drug trafficking operation,though she maintained connections with florida and returned there frequently.in,having wed an american husband some years earlier,brown herself became a united states citizen through naturalization.
on christmas day,michael knight and two others were caught at montego bay attempting to enter jamaica with about in cash from brown trafficking proceeds.the authorities confiscated the entire sum.almost a year later,on december,knight again ran afoul of brown when he failed to account for of million in cash that he was supposed to be holding for her.upon discovering the shortfall,brown enlisted carl smith and dean myrie to help her pick up knight and transport him,bound with a telephone cord,to an apartment in the white marsh area of baltimore county.when it became apparent that knight would not produce the missing funds or disclose their location,brown summoned peter blake and huber downer to stab knight to death in the apartment bathtub.blake,downer,and myrie then dismembered knight corpse and disposed of it in dumpsters throughout the baltimore area.
the government investigation of the jamaica interdiction and concomitant seizure of brown trafficking proceeds resulted in her indictment on july,for bulk cash smuggling,see,and for conspiracy to commit the same.about three weeks afterward,brown was arrested in florida and brought to maryland for arraignment and detention.brown retained a fort lauderdale lawyer to defend her,and,with counsel assistance,she pleaded guilty to the substantive cash smuggling count on october.seeking sentencing credit,brown had her lawyer arrange a police station interview that same day with baltimore county detectives investigating the knight murder.counsel did not attend the interview with his client,however,electing instead to board a return flight to florida.the october interview led to another on november,which again was conducted outside the presence of counsel.brown was advised of her constitutional rights prior to each interview,see miranda arizona,and,on both occasions,she agreed to talk to the detectives without her lawyer present.
not long thereafter,on february,the grand jury returned a new indictment against brown.in the operative fourth superseding indictment of august,brown was charged in count one with conspiracy to traffic in marijuana,see a,in counts two and four with respectively,kidnapping and murdering knight in aid of racketeering,see a and in count three with conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering,see id.a.brown,having retained new counsel,moved to suppress certain of her pretrial statements,including those she made during the interviews at the police station.following a hearing on january,that motion was denied.
trial commenced before a jury in baltimore on february.brown was tried alongside gabrial campa mayen,a mexican intermediary indicted for his role in the drug conspiracy.a number of brown former associates testified for the government,relating the details of her marijuana trafficking operation and its breadth.blake,downer,and myrie corroborated the other witnesses testimony on that point,and they elaborated in detail on brown involvement in knight murder.
during its examination of one of the county detectives,the government played recorded video excerpts of the police station interviews.the recordings revealed that brown did not comport herself well during the detectives questioning,coming across as evasive and less than forthright.later,the government would argue to the jury that brown story toward the end of the recording was a far cry from where we started where she did know anything about anything,and it a far cry from what she said at each successive stage in her description of the events to the detectives.the government emphasized that,as the interviews progressed,brown eventually admitted every fact of the murder except for her own involvement.id.
brown testified in her own defense.upon ascending the witness stand,she continued to assert her innocence,insisting that she had no association with drug trafficking or complicity in knight death.according to brown,knight had been restrained and threatened after he failed to account for smith money.brown and myrie left the white marsh apartment for a time to drive smith to a truck stop,where he was embarking on a trip to arizona knight remained in the apartment,in the custody of blake and downer.brown returned to the apartment with myrie to discover that knight had been killed,with blake taking the credit.
following the close of all the evidence,during the charging conference on february,a question arose concerning the proper calculation in kilograms of the drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy.the question was significant,because if brown were convicted of conspiring to traffic in kilograms or more of marijuana,she would be susceptible to imprisonment under the applicable statute from ten years to life.see b a.if,on the other hand,the conspiracy were found to involve less than kilograms but more than,the prescribed statutory range would be five to forty years.see id.b b.the resolution of the drug quantity either way was exclusively the province of the jury.see alleyne united states,instructing that any facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed are elements of the crime that must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt quoting apprendi united states.
at one point during the discussion,the government asked the district court to just tell the jury that kilograms equals pounds,because the testimony had been in english as opposed to metric units.in response to the government request,counsel for brown expressed some reservations 
counsel and judge,i do have the exact version right,but i do want some lawyer saying it was point 
the court one kilo is pounds.
counsel exactly there is a few ounces either way 
the court exactly,i think.that the one.
counsel well,if that a correct statement of the law,we have nothing additional.
the court i think it a correct statement on the measurement as well.
the district court,however,turned out to be incorrect pounds equates to a metric mass of just less than kilograms,more than two kilograms short of the minimum quantity necessary to bring into play the possibility of life imprisonment under the sentencing statute.in order for the court to properly sentence brown in accordance with the kilogram threshold,the government was required to prove that the conspiracy involved a drug weight of at least pounds.the jury was presented with no evidence to assist it in precisely converting from the english system to its metric counterpart the drug quantities of which the witnesses testified 
the district court approval of the government request was the last word on the matter,and,upon charging the jury the next morning,it gave instruction as follows the purpose of the conspiracy charged in count was to distribute,or possess with intent to distribute,kilograms that pounds or more of marijuana.without objection,the court proceeded with the remainder of the instructions.the jury retired to deliberate afterward,having been given the parties agreed verdict form,which,among the drug quantity options,listed kilograms pounds or more.id.at.
the jury deliberated for almost two hours,then requested to view again an excerpt from the video of brown november,police station interview.about twenty minutes into the playback,the government paused the recording so that the district court could ask the jury how much of the remainder it wished to review.at that point,the court informed the jury that i have to step off for a brief period.the recording will continue to play in my absence,and the courtroom clerk will get me if i needed.the recording resumed,absent the court,for approximately minutes.upon the court return,brown moved for a mistrial,which was denied 
on february,the trial having recessed four days for the holiday,the jury reached its verdict.the courtroom clerk made official inquiry of the jury foreperson 
the clerk how do you find the defendant jean brown,not guilty or guilty,of the matters wherefore she stands indicted as to count one 
foreperson guilty.
the clerk okay.and what amount of marijuana was involved 
foreperson pounds.
the clerk pounds.
foreperson or more.
the jury also found brown guilty of counts two through four,relating to the kidnapping and murder of knight.
at the sentencing hearing on march,brown maintained that,with respect to her conviction of the marijuana trafficking conspiracy,she should not be subjected to the term of imprisonment prescribed by b a.brown contended that,because of the erroneous equivalency instruction and verdict form,the jury had not actually found that she had distributed the threshold quantity of marijuana authorizing a life sentence.the district court was unpersuaded,sentencing brown to life on the count one marijuana conspiracy,to concurrent life terms on the substantive murder and kidnapping charges in counts two and four,and to a concurrent term of months for her conviction of the count three murder conspiracy.by timely notice filed march,brown appeals her convictions and sentence.
brown asserts that the district court erroneously permitted the jury to view the recorded october and november police station interviews.more fundamentally,brown posits that her trial was structurally undermined by the court absence while the jury listened to the latter interview on playback.either of those supposed irregularities,according to brown,renders her convictions infirm and entitles her to a new trial.failing that,brown suggests that the uncertainty surrounding the jury verdict as to the drug quantity attributable to the conspiracy requires a remand.specifically,brown requests that she be resentenced on count one in accordance with the more lenient year range set forth in b b for a quantity of marijuana amounting to at least kilograms,but less than.
in evaluating brown appeal of the denial of her motion to suppress the recorded police interviews,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see united states williams,cir.we likewise review de novo allegations of structural defects in the trial process,see united states mortimer,cir.if the purported defect is not structural and has not been preserved via objection in the district court,we review for plain error only.see united states love,cir.
a trial judge absence from the bench may,depending on the circumstances,constitute a structural error that is reversible per se.see love,at citing riley deeds,cir see also mortimer,at.an error in contravention of apprendi and its progeny,however,is not a structural one.see united states white,cir citing united states carter,cir.irregularities of the apprendi sort may therefore be reviewed for harmlessness,or for plain error if not timely objected to in the trial court.see white,at united states mackins,cir.
the government could only use brown custodial statements at trial insofar as they were made voluntarily,in conformance with the fifth amendment privilege against compelled.see united states braxton,cir en banc.brown does not contest the validity or adequacy of the miranda warnings administered to her by the baltimore county detectives.instead,brown assertion of a fifth amendment violation begins with a uniquely sixth amendment premise that the lawyer who represented her in the cash smuggling prosecution was constitutionally ineffective by failing to accompany her to the police station,where she was questioned about uncharged criminal activity.the neglect of her florida counsel,according to brown,left her helpless before the police and rendered involuntary the entirety of her statements during the interviews of october and november.
brown theory of involuntariness is not one that we are prepared to embrace.indeed,t he sole concern of the fifth amendment is governmental coercion.colorado connelly,u.that is to say,t he voluntariness of a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege has always depended on the absence of police overreaching,not on free choice in any broader sense of the word.id.were it otherwise,we would risk imposing a requirement that courts must divine a defendant motivation for speaking or acting as he did even though there be no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision.id.at.
moreover,we routinely decline to address on direct appeal a criminal defendant contention that counsel has performed in an ineffective manner,unless the lawyer ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.united states bernard,cir.we see no reason to depart from such a settled rule,notwithstanding that brown suggestion of ineffective assistance does not serve as a standalone sixth amendment assignment of error,but is instead asserted as a predicate to relief under the fifth amendment.although florida counsel testified at the suppression hearing,and,as a result,the record is more thoroughly developed here than may be typical for a direct appeal involving a lawyer performance,we yet can not say that the materials before us conclusively establish the truth of brown allegations of ineffectiveness.that brown agreed to be interviewed outside the presence of counsel is patently insufficient,as pointed out by the supreme court in mcneil wisconsin 
one might be quite willing to speak to the police without counsel present concerning many matters,but not the matter under prosecution.it can be said,perhaps,that it is likely that one who has asked for counsel assistance in defending against a prosecution would want counsel present for all custodial interrogation,even interrogation unrelated to the charge.that is not necessarily true,since suspects often believe that they can avoid the laying of charges by demonstrating an assurance of innocence through frank and unassisted answers to questions.
the mcneil court appears to have captured the essence of the case at bar.brown florida counsel,by not insisting that he accompany her to the police station interviews,may well have unwittingly enabled his client misbegotten belief that she could talk her way out of the trouble that was looming.a mere breakdown in communication between brown and her lawyer,however,does not compel the conclusion that the latter was constitutionally ineffective.there being no legitimate basis to suppress the recordings of the interviews,the district court did not err in admitting them.
with respect to brown assertion of structural error emanating from the district court vacation of the bench,we note first that the record reflects no contemporaneous objection to the court absence.see.b specifying that a party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court when the court ruling or order is made or sought of the party
