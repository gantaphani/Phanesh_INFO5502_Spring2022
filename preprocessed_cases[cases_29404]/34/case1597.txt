darrell walter holmes appeals his conviction in the district court for the eastern district of virginia for two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child,in violation of and c.holmes challenges the district court decisions denying his motions to dismiss the indictment due to lack of venue and jurisdiction,denying his motion to suppress statements he made to military investigators,and granting the government motion in limine to exclude an expert witness.see united states holmes,d case.finding no error,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the conduct underlying holmes conviction occurred while he was on active duty with the united states air force and stationed at yokota air base in japan.on two separate occasions in or about and,holmes forced his stepdaughter to perform oral sex on him.at the time of both acts,was under the age of nine.
holmes and mother were married at the time of the acts of sexual abuse,but divorced in june.shortly after the divorce,told what holmes had done to her.confronted holmes via telephone about the accusations,but the matter was not pursued by at that time because recanted her statements.
from january to may,holmes was deployed to qatar,working hour days six days a week.while holmes was in qatar,renewed her accusations against him and this time reported the incident to the air force,leading to an inquiry by the air force office of special investigations osi.holmes return from his duty post in qatar was a journey that took approximately hours before he arrived in norfolk,virginia around on may.upon holmes return to langley air force base on the st,holmes commanding officer instructed him to report to osi for questioning.
osi agents keith king and david chan conducted the interview,which lasted approximately two hours.prior to questioning,holmes was informed of allegations and given his rights under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and article of the uniform code of military justice.holmes initialed and signed an acknowledgement and waiver of those rights.agent king inquired as to holmes mental and physical state,and holmes replied that he felt fine,was good,and was h appy to be home.when holmes was asked about the accusations,he repeatedly stated he did not think he could do something like that,although agent king noted the fact that holmes never directly denied it.
during the osi interview,holmes discussed with the agents,inter alia,his marriage to,their estrangement during the time of the accused conduct,prior statements against him and her subsequent recantation,and what might have led to make and renew these allegations.throughout the interview,holmes did not get angry,but remained very calm and.he also seemed alert and was responsive to the questions,such that agent king did not observe any indication that he was sleepy or otherwise physically unable to continue.at some point in the interview,agent king told holmes that if they were able to find out the truth behind the allegation s,they could settle this,and there a possibility that holmes could spare from having to testify.getting up on the stand would obviously be stressful for a child to have to deal with.when holmes expressed concern about his career,agent king explained that he could tell holmes what would happen to his career and that he had seen people be charged with things and still maintain their career.however,agent king did not recall indicating that an individual who had been accused of molesting a child had kept his career.
eventually,holmes admitted that he had molested his.agent king asked holmes to talk him through what had happened,and holmes described that his marital problems had led to drinking alcohol and watching a lot of pornography.holmes stated that on numerous occasions when was attending night school,he had taken care of and he confessed that on two such evenings he had brought into their room,and had her perform oral sex on him,orgasming into her mouth.
holmes agreed to make a written statement as well,in which he described the gravest mistake of his life and provided the same account of what had happened.agent king asked three questions,which holmes answered,initialing his responses.specifically,holmes admitted to orgasm ing into his step daughter mouth and hav ing her spit the semen into the bedroom toilet,stated that the second incident occurred for the same reasons as the first time drinking and watching pornography,and denied ever having sexual relations with another child or with his after the second incident.
this case came before the district court following lengthy procedural delays.in july,the air force ordered a general of holmes under the uniform code of military justice,but that proceeding was subsequently dismissed without prejudice in march.the following month,a grand jury in the eastern district of virginia indicted holmes on two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor,in violation of and c first indictment.holmes was arrested in the eastern district of virginia,but the first indictment was subsequently dismissed without prejudice,although the order does not provide a reason for that action 
in october,holmes was discharged from the air force and returned to chicago,illinois,where he had maintained his permanent residence throughout his military service.the following month holmes was in the eastern district of virginia,upon the same two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor,in violation of and c second indictment.holmes was arrested in north carolina and then transported to the eastern district of virginia,where he remained in custody.
the case was assigned to judge robert doumar,who initially denied,but on sua sponte reconsideration granted,holmes motion to dismiss the second indictment for lack of venue under.see united states holmes,d.may,case denying motion united states holmes,d,case granting motion on reconsideration.holmes contended that venue was lacking in the eastern district of virginia because he had been arrested under the second indictment in north carolina,and that arrest determined venue under.judge doumar agreed,finding that holmes first arrest for this offense occurred in north carolina when he was arrested on november,under the second indictment as the prior arrest under the first indictment was without any jurisdiction.since there was no jurisdiction to indict him in april,there was no jurisdiction to arrest him at that time.d at.judge doumar observed that looking solely at the second indictment,venue was proper under where holmes was arrested under that indictment,namely,in north carolina rather than virginia.id.at.accordingly,he concluded that venue did not lie in the eastern district of virginia,and he dismissed the second indictment without prejudice.id.at.
within hours of the second indictment being dismissed,and without having been released from the custody of the marshals,holmes was rearrested on a criminal complaint alleging the same charges based on the same conduct.in december,the third indictment for this conduct was filed in the eastern district of virginia under the same statutes as in the prior indictments third indictment.the third indictment is the operative indictment for the proceedings in the district court before judge mark davis,which are presently before us on appeal.
holmes again filed a series of motions,including a motion to suppress his statements to the osi agents,a motion to dismiss for lack of venue in the eastern district of virginia,and a motion to dismiss the indictment due to lack of jurisdiction under.the district court denied each motion.d at.
holmes pleaded not guilty and the case proceeded to be tried by a jury.the friday before the tuesday when trial was to begin,holmes disclosed to the government that he intended to call richard ofshe as an expert witness.holmes proffered ofshe as an expert in confessions who would testify as to the fact that,and reasons why,individuals falsely confess to acts they did not commit.the district court granted the government motion in limine to exclude this testimony,citing concerns about the late timing of the disclosure and the incompleteness of the disclosure under federal rule of criminal procedure b.
after a jury trial,holmes was convicted on both counts.the district court sentenced holmes to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.holmes does not raise any issues regarding the trial or sentencing.he noted a timely appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
holmes contends on appeal that the district court made the following errors prior to trial,any of which would require reversal of his convictions the denial of his motion to suppress statements made to military investigators,denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment due to the lack of venue,and exclusion of his proposed expert witness.we address each argument in turn 
holmes first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements oral and written that he made to the osi agents in which he admitted the charged conduct.he contends the statements should have been suppressed because the interrogation was conducted under circumstances causing holmes will to be overborne,which,under the totality of the circumstances,rendered his confession involuntary.opening br.to support this contention,holmes points to his lengthy return trip from qatar immediately preceding the interview,the osi agents failure to permit him more than twelve hours prior to the interrogation,the osi agents train ing in interrogation techniques,the failure to record the interrogation coupled with gaps in agent chan written notes of the interrogation,agent king statement that holmes career might be salvaged if he admitted to the acts,and agent king statement that if holmes confessed,would be spared the trauma of testifying.based on these factors,holmes contends the district court erred in concluding his statement was voluntary and failing to grant his suppression motion.opening br.
when reviewing the district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review factual findings for clear error and the legal determination that the statement was voluntary de novo.united states mashburn,cir.a confession made during a custodial interrogation will be suppressed unless police advise the defendant of his rights under miranda arizona,and the defendant knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waives those rights.united states guay,cir.
in considering whether a defendant waiver is voluntary,the court must determine whether the confession was extracted by any sort of threats or violence,or obtained by any direct or implied promises,however slight,or by the exertion of any improper influence.hutto ross,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.even where threats,violence,implied promises,improper influence,or other coercive police activity exist,a confession is not necessarily rendered involuntary.united states braxton,cir en banc.the proper inquiry is whether the defendant will has been overborne or his capacity for critically impaired.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we conduct this review by considering the totality of the circumstances,including the characteristics of the defendant,the setting of the interview,and the details of the interrogation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.having reviewed the record,we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that holmes confession was voluntarily made,and in denying holmes motion to suppress the statements on that basis.
holmes does not deny that the osi agents informed him of his constitutional rights under miranda before he gave his statement and that he voluntarily initialed and signed a statement saying that he understood and waived those rights prior to communicating with them about allegations.the record contains no indication that agent king statements critically impaired holmes capacity for,braxton,at,or that holmes will was overborne in such a way as to render his confession the product of coercion.arizona fulminante.as recounted above,agent king testified at the suppression hearing that he began the interview by asking holmes if he was tired or too sleepy to conduct the interview at that time.holmes replied that he felt fine.this response was consistent with agent king own observations of holmes demeanor,physical appearance,and behavior.at no time did holmes ask for the interview to end or indicate that he was tired,desired a break,or otherwise was unwilling to proceed.there is simply no connection in the record between holmes decision to provide a statement and his physical state as a result of his return from qatar.
but even if holmes was tired on the day of his interrogation,suppression is not required every time a defendant has a diminished mental state.united states cristobal,cir a deficient mental condition whether the result of a mental illness or,for example,pain killing narcotics administered after emergency treatment is not,without more,enough to render a waiver involuntary.rather,there would also have to be evidence that the police took advantage of holmes incapacitation.as we stated in cristobal,
c oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to a finding that a confession is not voluntary within the meaning of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.as such,coercive police activity is also a necessary predicate to a finding that a waiver of miranda rights is not voluntary.in determining whether a defendant will has been overborne,the court has focused on the crucial element of police overreaching.while each case has turned on its own set of factors justifying the conclusion that police conduct was oppressive,all have contained a substantial element of coercive police conduct.

there is no evidence in the record that the osi agents coerced holmes into making a statement,or otherwise overreached in order to cause holmes to confess.holmes contends that agent king improperly coerced a statement by observing that if he confessed,would not have to endure the pain of testifying or going through a trial.however,a law enforcement officer may properly tell the truth to the accused.united states pelton,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.numerous cases reiterate that statements by law enforcement officers that are merely uncomfortable or create a predicament for a defendant are not ipso facto coercive.see,id.at united states shears,cir g overnment agents may validly make some representations to a defendant or may discuss cooperation without rendering the resulting confession involuntary.agent king statements fell within the acceptable ambit of truthfully reflecting how holmes decision whether or not to cooperate could impact 
nor is there any merit to holmes assertion that agent king statements regarding the impact of these allegations on holmes military career were impermissibly coercive.at the suppression hearing,agent king testified that he expressly told holmes that he could not say what impact these allegations would have on holmes career,but that he had generally known individuals charged with crimes to maintain their careers.there is no evidence in the record to contradict agent king testimony on this point,nor is there any evidence that agent king made any direct or implied promises regarding holmes career or professional reputation that induced him to provide a statement.
holmes testimony at the suppression hearing further supports our conclusion.while he recounted his return trip from qatar and summarized the interview that occurred,he did not testify to any circumstances that overcame his will.indeed,holmes own explanation for why he confessed was that he could not remember not engaging in the alleged acts,and so he thought maybe he had committed them.this explanation does not indicate that he was exhausted from his trip,or that he felt threatened,or that he otherwise had been lured into confessing by something the osi agents said or did.nor does holmes description of the interview suggest that the osi agents used coercion,threats,or other promises to overcome his exercise of or overcome his will such that his confession was not voluntary.and while holmes on appeal refers broadly to the osi agents training in questioning techniques and a gap in agent chan written record of the interview,he points to no specific evidence that anything occurred contrary to those notes or agent king description of the interview.
in light of our review of holmes specific arguments,and based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation of holmes,we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that holmes statement was intelligently,knowingly,and voluntarily made.consequently,the district court did not err in denying holmes motion to suppress his statements.
holmes next challenges the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the third indictment for lack of venue under.that provision states,in relevant part the trial of all offenses begun or committed out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district,shall be in the district in which the offender is arrested or is first brought holmes moved to dismiss the third indictment for lack of venue,contending that under judge doumar reasoning in dismissing the second indictment,venue was proper in north carolina,not the eastern district of virginia.in holmes view,nothing changed following his in the eastern district of virginia prior to the third indictment because he had not been released from custody following the dismissal of the second indictment.
the district court denied holmes motion,concluding 
venue is determined by identifying the district in which holmes was first restrained on the charges now alleged in the third indictment.nothing in the statute suggests that the first arrest requirement is.that is to say,nothing in suggests that when an indictment is filed,dismissed,and then against a defendant,the arrest on the first indictment is not controlling for purposes of assessing venue.indeed,the statute is phrased in terms of the offense committed,stating that t he trial of all offenses begun or committed upon the high seas,or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular state or district,shall be in the district in which the offender is arrested or is first brought.emphasis added.this language indicates that venue is proper in the district where the defendant is first restrained in connection with the underlying offense,rather than any particular indictment.
d at.the court observed that holmes was first arrested for the relevant offenses in the eastern district of virginia,and so regardless of what happened subsequent to that arrest,venue for the conduct charged was proper in that district as a result of the original arrest under the first indictment.id.at.
on appeal,holmes contends that the district court erred because the statutory requirements to establish venue in the eastern district of virginia were not satisfied.relying on judge doumar earlier analysis,holmes asserts the original arrest in the eastern district of virginia pursuant to the first indictment was a legal nullity because there was no jurisdiction to arrest him at that time.pointing out that his arrest under the second indictment was in north carolina,holmes posits that indictment could not establish venue in the eastern district of virginia either.lastly,holmes asserts his arrest in anticipation of the third indictment does not count as the first arrest because the only reason he was in the eastern district of virginia at that time was because he was still in federal custody as a result of the second indictment.because the third arrest is the direct result of his arrest under the second indictment,holmes argues that venue would be proper in north carolina,but not in the eastern district of virginia 
we begin,as we must,with the text of,which establishes that venue for extraterritorial offenses shall be in the district in which the offender is arrested or is first brought.nothing in this text suggests that the provision is.to the contrary,the text of the statute focuses on the offense,establishing clear directions as to where venue for a specific offense is proper.the court must look at the offenses for which the defendant is facing punishment,and then determine where he was arrested or first brought for those offenses.under that analysis,holmes was first arrested on two counts of aggravated sexual assault of in the eastern district of virginia.we need not look any further than this first arrest for purposes of determining proper venue.
our opinion in united states erdos,cir,is consistent with this understanding of the statute.after reviewing the evolution of the statutory language,we observed that 
the phrase in the current version of the statute that venue shall be in the district in which the offender is arrested or is first brought means simply arrested,that venue is in that district within the united states where the offender is first restrained of his liberty in connection with the offense charged first brought within the context of the statute means first brought in custody with liberty restrained.
id.at citations omitted first emphasis added.although erdos involved a different inquiry than that presented here,its language nonetheless is consistent with reading the plain language of the statute to be rather than.for purposes of establishing venue under,the relevant inquiry is not the district of arrest for a specific indictment in a case procedural history,but rather the district of arrest for that specific offense,even if there is a subsequent dismissal of the original indictment or filing of a subsequent indictment regarding that offense.
in addition to being a straightforward reading of the statute,this understanding also comports with the purpose of establishing venue.the principle of proper venue is concerned with determining the appropriate location in which a criminal proceeding will occur.ordinarily,proper venue in a criminal case requires determination of where the crime was committed.united states.cores.t rial in the vicinity of the crime is a safeguard against the unfairness and hardship involved when an accused is prosecuted in a remote place.id.although the concerns are slightly different when the crime occurs at a location outside the territorial boundaries of the united states,the focus of is still the same to establish where venue for a specific crime,a specific offense,is proper.it is therefore appropriate for that determination to be made according to where the offender is arrested or first brought the first time for the charged offenses.this analysis permits venue to be definitively determined based on the static location of where a defendant is determined to be first arrested or brought with respect to the offense,without requiring reevaluation of that point at each stage of any subsequent procedural developments as with subsequent or superseding indictments for the same offense.
lastly,contrary to holmes assertions and judge doumar earlier analysis of this issue,cases from our sister circuit courts of appeals examining are consistent with an analysis to establish venue where an individual is arrested or first brought.for example,in united states wharton,cir,the fifth circuit rejected a challenge to venue where the defendant had been arrested for some offenses in florida,then transferred to louisiana,where the grand jury indicted the defendant on an additional charge.id.at.the court held that the challenge to venue in louisiana failed because the defendant was not arrested on the additional charge until he was in louisiana.id.venue for that charge was thus appropriate in louisiana.id.at.
similarly,the second circuit used an inquiry in determining proper venue under.in united states provoo,cir,the court analyzed a prior version of the statute,which established venue in the district where the defendant was found,a term courts had interpreted to mean arrested.id.at.the defendant in provoo was a serviceman arrested in maryland on sodomy charges.those charges were dropped,but he remained in custody and was transferred under guard to new york in order for authorities to arrest,indict,and try him for the separate crime of treason alleged to have been committed overseas.id.at.the court held that venue was not proper in new york because the army continued to hold him in maryland after the sodomy charge was dropped solely in order to send him to new york to be tried fo
