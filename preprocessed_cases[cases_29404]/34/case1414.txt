opinion of the court 
state police officers,acting upon a tip,stopped a vehicle in the immediate vicinity of a reported theft in progress.we address the constitutionality of this investigatory stop under the reasonable suspicion standard of terry ohio,d,and its progeny.we hold that,notwithstanding the vague and imprecise description provided by the informant in this case,other relevant circumstances furnished the police with reasonable suspicion to justify the terry stop.we will therefore affirm the district court judgment which denied appellant motion to suppress evidence,but as our opinion explains,we do so for an entirely different reason.
as the reasonable suspicion inquiry is highly in nature,we proceed to describe the facts relating to the vehicle stop in some detail,placing sole emphasis on those events preceding the stop.we preface this factual discussion,however,by noting that both the district court and the parties refer to many facts having little or no relation to the vehicle stop.such facts were deemed relevant in the proceedings below because the district court erroneously held that terry did not authorize the stop and therefore proceeded to consider the application of the exclusionary rule to the contested evidence.it ultimately denied the suppression motion,concluding that the contested evidence should nonetheless be admitted under certain exceptions to the exclusionary rule.our analysis does not proceed beyond the constitutional principles governing the investigatory stop.because we uphold the validity of the stop,we have no occasion to reach or address the alternate theories relied upon by the district court in denying the suppression motion.
mill hall is a small town in clinton county,pennsylvania.situated along the railroad tracks in a mixed residential and commercial part of town,directly adjacent to mill hall clay products and diagonally across the railroad tracks from r m gas oil r m gas,is webb webb,a farm supply company which sells anhydrous ammonia,among other agricultural products.anhydrous ammonia is a chemical used in agricultural industries,but also frequently employed in the production of methamphetamine.as a result of repeated thefts of anhydrous ammonia from webb tanks,the police viewed the surrounding vicinity as a hot spot for criminal activity.app.
on the night of september,at approximately,the pennsylvania state police barracks in lamar,pennsylvania received a call from an employee at mill hall clay products,reporting a possible theft in progress from webb anhydrous ammonia tanks.the caller identified himself as todd gentzyel gentzyel,a kiln operator at the brickyard adjacent to webb.gentzyel previously had informed the lamar barracks of similar thefts and had been advised to call the state police immediately upon witnessing any suspicious activity in the future.he told the police communications officer pco that,there was two people just carrying some kind of buckets or something across from the webb and they just,they over behind r m gas right now loading into some kind of a vehicle.i gon na go try to get a description.app.the pco directed gentzyel to call back when he obtained a description,and then immediately dispatched troopers stephen wilcox and christopher soo from the lamar barracks to r m gas.the pco also dispatched trooper david kirkendall,already out on patrol,to the scene.at,the pco repeated to one of the responding troopers that the suspects were behind r m.
having responded to numerous incidents at webb on prior occasions and having conducted routine surveillance of the anhydrous ammonia tanks on the property,troopers wilcox and soo were both familiar with the location of r m gas and the surrounding area.app.they arrived in mill hall within seven minutes of gentzyel call and proceeded down pennsylvania main roadway running through mill the direction of r m gas.as they drove down pennsylvania avenue,the troopers observed no vehicles coming from the direction of r m.however,as they turned right onto agnew of the side streets intersecting pennsylvania order to approach r m gas,they immediately spotted a small,vehicle in front of r m gas about a block and a half ahead.no other occupied vehicles were in the area.app.
at approximately troopers wilcox and soo pulled in front of the vehicle and activated their lights,causing the vehicle to stop.at about the same time,trooper kirkendall arrived from another direction and stopped behind the vehicle.the government does not dispute that this initial stop constitutes a seizure for terry purposes.
meanwhile,just prior to the stop,at precisely,gentzyel called back and reported to the pco that the vehicle had just pulled out over by r m gas.app.he believed,though he was not certain,that the occupants looked like two women,and he described the driver as a lady.app.he then advised the pco that the troopers had,in fact,pulled over the vehicle he was describing.app.as the stop occurred,gentzyel remained on the telephone line,providing further descriptions to assist the officers in their investigation.in particular,gentzyel told the pco the following additional information 
i fire the kilns on third shift and when i walked out they come across our parking lot.there was two people,two individuals carrying,it looked like buckets of something.they walked across the railroad tracks and went over to r m gas.over behind the r m gas plant,and then they were loadin stuff for about five minutes.i hurried up and run in and made a call,went back out to see if i could get a description of the vehicle.
app.gentzyel also described the vehicle in question as a smaller,vehicle,like a cavalier,and reported that he saw the two persons really struggling with the container as they carried and loaded it into the rear of the car.app.
immediately after the stop,trooper soo exited his vehicle and ran down the street to r m gas to check for other vehicles or individuals in the area.he observed no other activity in the area.however,between the stopped vehicle and r m gas,he encountered a strong smell of ammonia and noticed a substance scattered on the street with a cup and spoon located nearby.to the troopers,it appeared as if the cup and spoon had been thrown from the vehicle prior to the stop.app.
the troopers then spoke with the identified as jervis goodrich goodrich,defendant below,appellant here,who occupied the passenger seat,and his girlfriend melissa kinne kinne,the driver and owner of the determine if they had seen anything suspicious in the area.goodrich and kinne responded in the negative,and further told the troopers that they had been parking at r m gas.the troopers,however,observed within the vehicle in plain view tools and rags,a pliers,and a flashlight.from their prior experience,the troopers knew that these things were commonly used during anhydrous ammonia thefts.app.moreover,at least one of the occupants matched gentzyel description of a lady and the car generally matched his description of a small,vehicle,which information the troopers had received on police radio during the investigatory stop.
at some point,the troopers asked about the trunk of the car.goodrich stated that he had gone into the trunk to retrieve a blanket.app.the troopers thereupon requested permission to search the trunk,at which point goodrich claimed that the key had broken off in the trunk lock and that he had used pliers in retrieving the blanket from the trunk.upon examination,however,the troopers saw no key broken off in the lock.app.kinne,in turn,had told one of the troopers that she had lost the key to the trunk.app.and when a trooper suggested that she turn off the car to prevent it from overheating,kinne turned off the ignition and placed the keys in her waistband,thereby further arousing the troopers suspicion.app.
after conducting a national crime information center check of the vehicle license plate number and after running goodrich and kinne names and dates of birth through law enforcement databases,the troopers learned that there was an outstanding parole warrant in new york for goodrich.he was thereupon taken into custody.
at this juncture,gentzyel was brought to the scene and identified the vehicle and the occupants as the same vehicle and persons that he observed earlier in the evening.based on gentzyel identification and the other information gathered during the investigatory stop,the troopers believed probable cause existed to arrest goodrich and kinne for theft of anhydrous ammonia.accordingly,they placed kinne in custody,and informed both goodrich and kinne of their intent to file theft and drug charges.and yet despite their belief that probable cause existed for the arrests,the troopers waited for the issuance of a warrant to search the inside of the vehicle 
the united states subsequently charged goodrich with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute controlled substances,contrary to,theft of anhydrous ammonia,contrary to a,possession of listed chemicals,contrary to c,and distribution of a controlled substance,contrary to a.on february,a grand jury sitting in the middle district of pennsylvania returned a indictment against goodrich on these charges.the united states brought no charges against kinne,who entered a guilty plea to state theft charges and agreed to cooperate with the authorities 
before trial,goodrich moved to suppress any and all evidence obtained as a result of the stop arguing that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to perform the terry stop.he also argued that the police lacked probable cause to either arrest him or search the vehicle,as the facts used to support probable cause had been obtained from an illegal stop.on january,and february,the district court conducted hearings on the suppression motion.
at the hearings,the government presented the testimony of trooper soo.among others,goodrich presented the testimony of trooper wilcox.soo testified that the police decided to conduct an investigatory stop of the vehicle based primarily on its geographical proximity to the reported theft in progress.he admitted that the troopers had no specific description of either the suspects or the vehicle prior to the stop.soo further testified that the troopers would have stopped any vehicle in the near vicinity of r m gas.indeed,he testified on that had he seen three vehicles in the area,he would have tried to stop all three.app.trooper wilcox concurred,stating that the troopers had stopped kinne vehicle because it was the only vehicle in the area.
based on the foregoing testimony,the district court concluded that the stop was unlawful.the district court explained 
the informant in this case did not provide any specific description of the individuals or vehicle in question until the police had already stopped the vehicle.notably,the candid testimony of both troopers soo and wilcox indicates that they would have stopped any vehicle or person they encountered within a two or three block area of r m gas.trooper soo also testified that he had no other evidence that the vehicle was involved in criminal activity other than its location proximate to whether sic the activity had been observed quite clearly,the lone fact that a vehicle is proximate to an area of reported criminal activity is not sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion and the stop is,therefore,impermissible.
district court opinion at.
having found that terry did not authorize the investigatory stop,the district court proceeded to consider whether any exceptions to the exclusionary rule were applicable.it found that there were,concluding that the independent source and the attenuated connection principles,both exceptions to the general exclusionary rule,supported the admissibility of the challenged evidence.accordingly,the district court denied goodrich motion to suppress.
goodrich case thereupon proceeded to trial.on august,a jury convicted goodrich on the first two counts of the to manufacture and distribute controlled substances and theft of anhydrous found him not guilty on the remaining counts.on june,the district court sentenced goodrich to months imprisonment and years of supervised release and imposed a special assessment of and restitution of.this timely appeal followed 
goodrich challenges the denial of his suppression motion,essentially arguing that the contested evidence should have been suppressed as the fruits of an illegal stop.he contends that the district court erred in its application of the exclusionary rule and the exceptions relevant thereto,though he applauds the district court for finding an initial constitutional violation.the government argues that the district court erred in finding the stop unlawful,but performed the correct analysis in admitting the challenged evidence under the applicable exceptions to the exclusionary rule.
both parties agree that the pivotal issue in this appeal is whether the automobile stop ran afoul of the fourth amendment.if the stop is found to be lawful,that is,if the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the kinne vehicle,we need go no further respecting the exclusion of evidence the evidence should have been allowed as no fourth amendment violation occurred.
we therefore turn to address the primary question presented in goodrich appeal whether the vehicle stop satisfied the constitutional requirements set forth in terry ohio,supra,and subsequent case law.in doing so,we examine only the validity of the initial stop,for goodrich does not separately challenge the reasonableness or intrusiveness of the investigation following the stop as the initial stop,and nothing else,constitutes the alleged constitutional violation,the facts and circumstances known to the troopers preceding the vehicle stop acquire particular salience.we conclude,after considering all relevant circumstances,that the stop was lawful.
the supreme court,in adams williams,stated that the fourth amendment does not require a policeman who lacks the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest to simply shrug his shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a criminal to escape,d.on the contrary,the court explained,it may be the essence of good police work to adopt an intermediate response,to maintain the status quo with a brief stop that allows the police officer to investigate further the possibility of criminal involvement.id.at.in terry,the supreme court had earlier held that such an investigatory commonly referred to as a terry consistent with the fourth amendment whenever the police officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.terry,at.illinois wardlow,d.
we recently summarized the familiar precepts which govern the reasonable suspicion inquiry 
reasonable suspicion is an elusive concept,but it unequivocally demands that the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.united states cortez,d.an officer objective basis for suspicion must be particularized because the demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of this court fourth amendment jurisprudence.terry,at.at the same time,we must allow officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.united states arvizu,d internal quotation marks omitted see also united states nelson,cir in evaluating whether there was an objective basis for reasonable suspicion,we consider the totality of the whole picture.cortez,at.
united states brown,cir.
here we only emphasize that the reasonable suspicion analysis is objective subjective motive or intent is not relevant for terry purposes.see terry,at.when evaluating the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate citation and internal quotations omitted emphasis added.we also note that reasonable suspicion is measured before the search information acquired subsequent to the initial seizure can not retroactively justify a terry stop.florida,d the reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search.johnson campbell,cir u nder terry,in evaluating whether the officer interaction with the defendant prior to his arrest amounted to an unreasonable seizure,we must first determine at what moment the defendant was seized,and then whether that seizure was justified by reasonable,articulable facts known to the officer as of that time united states valentine,cir i t is true that the reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search quoting,at.
where,as here,the terry stop is made primarily upon the basis of information supplied to the police by an informant,a central issue is whether the informant information is sufficiently reliable and complete to provide the police with reasonable suspicion in stopping the designated persons or vehicles for investigation.in evaluating reasonable suspicion in this context,the court considers both the reliability of the tip or informant and the content of the tip.see valentine,at the reliability of a tip,of course,is not all that we must consider in evaluating reasonable suspicion the content of the tip must also be taken into account,as well as other surrounding circumstances.the content of the tip,concomitantly,must provide a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular persons stopped of criminal activity.see,at.the reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality,not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.
in this appeal,goodrich does not challenge the reliability of the tip itself or the informant rather,goodrich challenges the quality,or the information contained in,the tip.he argues that it lacked the requisite degree of specificity to justify the vehicle stop.in so arguing,he challenges the information contained in the tip as to both essential components,its tendency to identify determinate persons engaging in criminal activity.we examine each of these components below,turning first to goodrich principal contention that the police had no specific descriptions of either the suspects or the vehicle in question.
it is well established that an officer can not conduct a terry stop simply because criminal activity is afoot.united states brown,cir.instead,the officer must have a particularized and objective basis for believing that the particular person is suspected of criminal activity.id.citing cortez,at.emphasis added.goodrich argues that the police acted solely upon the information contained in gentzyel first report and thus without a specific description of either the suspects or the getaway vehicle.this information,goodrich contends,was too imprecise to satisfy constitutional standards.we can not agree.
other relevant circumstances can provide sufficient particularity or specificity to an otherwise general or indefinite description.a description,in other words,must be considered with reference to the totality of the circumstances.as one commentator explained 
whether the available description is sufficiently particular can not be determined in the abstract.to suffice,the description must permit the police to be reasonably selective in determining who to stop for investigation,and whether this may be said to be the case will depend upon how many persons are in the universe of potential suspects.
wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment,g ed footnotes omitted.accordingly,the imprecise description provided by the informant in this case must be considered alongside any other relevant factors which tend to more narrowly define the universe of potential suspects and thereby constrain police discretion.at least four such factors warrant consideration in this case the reputation of the area in which the stop occurred for criminal activity the time of day the geographical and temporal proximity of the stop to the scene of the alleged crime and the number of persons in the area.we discuss these factors seriatim.
high crime area 
an individual presence in an area of expected criminal activity,standing alone,is not enough to support a reasonable,particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime.wardlow,at.citing brown texas,d.however,the supreme court has noted the fact that the stop occurred in a high crime area is among the relevant contextual considerations in a terry analysis.id.citing adams,at.see also brown,at noting that reputation of area for criminal activity is a relevant terry factor.
here,goodrich was found in the near vicinity of webb and r m gas,an area with a reputation for theft of anhydrous ammonia.trooper soo testified that the pennsylvania state police had responded to ten to fifteen reported thefts of anhydrous ammonia from webb tanks preceding goodrich arrest.contrary to goodrich contention,then,the record indicates that the area around r m gas constitutes a high crime area for terry purposes.see,united states rickus,cir noting that area recently victimized by twelve unsolved burglaries was area of criminal activity for terry purposes.we thus conclude that the reputation of the area for prior thefts of anhydrous ammonia was one articulable fact upon which the troopers may legitimately have relied in conducting the stop.this fact,moreover,is given greater importance when considered with the next relevant time of day.
time of day 
the investigatory stop occurred at approximately.the lateness of the hour of the stop further supports the inference of criminal activity,especially when considered alongside the area reputation for criminal activity.see,michigan long,d noting that the hour was late as one relevant terry circumstance united states ramires,cir listing the fact that it was late at night as one circumstance justifying a terry stop united states lender,cir the lateness of the hour is another fact that may raise the level of suspicion.
this case,therefore,does not present the situation,raising constitutional concern,where the police perform a terry stop in an otherwise tranquil neighborhood during the daylight hours based only on a general description the lateness of the hour and the reputation of the area for criminal activity move this case closer to the elusive line separating constitutional from unconstitutional governmental action,but it is the next two factors which,in our view,place this case squarely on the constitutional side of the divide.
temporal geographical proximity 
the informant in this case,todd gentzyel,reported at approximately that two persons were carrying buckets or something across from webb,and they over behind r m gas right now loading into some kind of vehicle.the troopers responded immediately and stopped kinne vehicle within seven minutes of the report.in addition,the stop occurred in the immediate vicinity of the reported theft in progress.the record indicates that troopers wilcox and soo stopped kinne vehicle within one or two blocks of r m gas.hence,goodrich was found near in time and geographic proximity to the reported theft.
united states juvenile tk,cir,is instructive here.there,the police received two dispatches,forty minutes apart,that a man had broken into a gray vehicle and brandished a gun.the police had no license plate number for the vehicle in question,but the second dispatch located the suspect at a particular gas station.about seven minutes after the second dispatch,the police noticed a gray vehicle making a in a commercial parking lot about blocks to two blocks from the gas station identified in the second dispatch.the police proceeded to stop the vehicle,which had three occupants.two of the occupants were arrested for violating the curfew law and for public intoxication.no weapon was ever discovered.
after the united states charged one of the occupants with various crimes,including robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon,the occupant moved to suppress any evidence seized or gathered as a result of the stop,arguing that the police lacked reasonable suspicion in making the stop.on appeal,the eighth circuit affirmed the validi
