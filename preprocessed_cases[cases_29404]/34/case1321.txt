opinion of the court 
at issue in this antitrust action are the standards a district court applies when deciding whether to certify a class.we will vacate the order certifying the class in this case and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in deciding whether to certify a class under,the district court must make whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary and must consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties.see newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir citing szabo bridgeport,cir manual for complex litigation third.in this appeal,we clarify three key aspects of class certification procedure.first,the decision to certify a class calls for findings by the court,not merely a threshold showing by a party,that each requirement of rule is met.factual determinations supporting rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.second,the court must resolve all factual or legal disputes relevant to class certification,even if they overlap with the disputes touching on elements of the cause of action.third,the court obligation to consider all relevant evidence and arguments extends to expert testimony,whether offered by a party seeking class certification or by a party opposing it.
purchasers of hydrogen peroxide and related chemical products brought this antitrust conspiracy action against chemical manufacturers an inorganic liquid,hydrogen peroxide is used most prominently as a bleach in the pulp and paper industry with smaller amounts appearing in chemicals and laundry products,environmental applications,textiles,and electronics.hydrogen peroxide is available in solutions of different concentrations and grades depending on its intended use.major concentrations are,and percent.the grades,roughly in order from least to,are standard,which must meet fda standards,electronic,and propulsion.all defendants sold the standard grade,but not all defendants sold all other grades.defendants sold different amounts of each of the grades.each grade has different supply and demand conditions because the grades are sold to in a variety of industries with different economic characteristics.according to defendants,the different grades are not economic substitutes for each other,but plaintiffs disagree.prices diverge dramatically among grades electronic or propulsion grade can be as much as five times more expensive than standard grade.
the other two products at issue are sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate,together known as persalts,which are granular solids containing hydrogen peroxide used primarily as detergents.among the defendants,only solvay produced and sold sodium percarbonate in the united states during the class period.solvay chemicals,degussa,and fmc sold sodium perborate in the united states during the class period.akzo,arkema,and kemira did not sell or produce sodium perborate in the united states during the class period.
after the united states department of justice and the european commission began investigating possible violations of the antitrust laws in the hydrogen peroxide industry several plaintiffs filed class action complaints against producers of hydrogen peroxide and persalts under of the clayton act,alleging a conspiracy in restraint of trade violating of the sherman act.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred all cognate federal actions to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,which consolidated the cases.see in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,d.the consolidated amended complaint alleged that during an class period january,defendants communicated about prices they would charge,agreed to charge prices at certain levels,exchanged information on prices and sales volume,allocated markets and customers,agreed to reduce production capacity,monitored each other,and sold hydrogen peroxide at agreed prices.
the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.following extensive discovery plaintiffs moved to certify a class of direct purchasers of hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,and sodium percarbonate,over an class period.in support of class certification,plaintiffs offered the opinion of an economist.defendants,opposing class certification,offered the opinion of a different economist.defendants separately moved to exclude the opinion of plaintiffs economist as unreliable under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.concluding plaintiffs expert opinion was admissible and supported plaintiffs motion for class certification,the district court certified a class of direct purchasers of hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,and sodium percarbonate under.b.see in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust.the district court identified seven issues to be tried on a basis whether defendants and others engaged in a combination and conspiracy to fix,raise,maintain,or stabilize prices allocate customers and markets or control and restrict output of hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,and sodium percarbonate sold in the united states the identity of the participants in the alleged conspiracy the duration of the alleged conspiracy and the nature and character of defendants acts performed in furtherance of it the effect of the alleged conspiracy on the prices of hydrogen peroxide and persalts during the class period whether the alleged conspiracy violated the sherman act whether the activities alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy or their effect on the prices of hydrogen peroxide and persalts during the class period injured named plaintiffs and the other members of the class and the proper means of calculating and distributing damages.the class was defined as 
all persons or entities,including state,local and municipal government entities but excluding defendants,their parents,predecessors,successors,subsidiaries,and affiliates as well as federal government entities who purchased hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,or sodium percarbonate in the united states,its territories,or possessions,or from a facility located in the united states,its territories,or possessions,directly from any of the defendants,or from any of their parents,predecessors,successors,subsidiaries,or affiliates,at any time during the period from september,to january.

denying or granting class certification is often the defining moment in class actions for it may sound the death knell of the litigation on the part of plaintiffs,or create unwarranted pressure to settle nonmeritorious claims on the part of defendants 
newton,at see id.at irrespective of the merits,certification decisions may have a decisive effect on litigation.see also coopers lybrand livesay,d.in some cases,class certification may force a defendant to settle rather than incur the costs of defending a class action and run the risk of potentially ruinous liability.advisory committee note,amendments.accordingly,the potential for unwarranted settlement pressure is a factor we weigh in our certification calculus.newton,at.the supreme court recently cautioned that certain antitrust class actions may present prime opportunities for plaintiffs to exert pressure upon defendants to settle weak claims.see bell atl.twombly,d.
here,the district court found the rule a requirements were met,a determination defendants do not now challenge.plaintiffs sought certification under rule b,which is permissible when the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.b.the twin requirements of rule b are known as predominance and superiority.

in antitrust cases,impact often is critically important for the purpose of evaluating rule b predominance requirement because it is an element of the claim that may call for individual,as opposed to common,proof.see new motor vehicles,at in antitrust class actions,common issues do not predominate if the fact of antitrust violation and the fact of antitrust impact can not be established through common proof.bell atl.v.at t,cir w here fact of damage can not be established for every class member through proof common to the class,the need to establish antitrust liability for individual class members defeats rule b predominance.see also blades,at p roof of conspiracy is not proof of common injury.
plaintiffs burden at the class certification stage is not to prove the element of antitrust impact,although in order to prevail on the merits each class member must do so.instead,the task for plaintiffs at class certification is to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual to its members.deciding this issue calls for the district court rigorous assessment of the available evidence and the method or methods by which plaintiffs propose to use the evidence to prove impact at trial.see.advisory committee note,amendments a critical need is to determine how the case will be tried.see,in re linerboard antitrust,cir reject ing the contention that plaintiffs did not demonstrate that sufficient proof was available,for use at trial,to prove antitrust impact common to all the members of the class.
here,the district court found the predominance requirement was met because plaintiffs would be able to use common,as opposed to individualized,evidence to prove antitrust impact at trial.on appeal,defendants contend the district court erred in three principal respects in finding plaintiffs satisfied the predominance requirement by applying too lenient a standard of proof for class certification,by failing meaningfully to consider the views of defendants expert while crediting plaintiffs expert,and by erroneously applying presumption of antitrust impact under bogosian,at.

we summarize briefly the evidence and arguments offered to the district court.as noted,both plaintiffs and defendants presented the opinions of expert economists.importantly,the experts disagreed on the key disputed predominance antitrust impact was capable of proof at trial through evidence common to the class,as opposed to individualized evidence.
plaintiffs expert,john beyer,offered an opinion purporting to show that there is common proof that can be used to demonstrate that the alleged conspiracy to raise prices,restrict output and allocate customers would have impacted all purchasers of hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,and sodium percarbonate.beyer market analysis suggested that conditions in the hydrogen peroxide industry favored a conspiracy that would have impacted the entire class.first,hydrogen peroxide and persalts are fungible,undifferentiated commodity products,which means producers compete on price,not quality or other features.second,production is heavily concentrated in a small group of manufacturers third,there are high barriers to entry in the industry and no close economic substitutes,preventing any competitors from entering the market and undercutting prices.fourth,defendants geographic markets overlapped,so that purchasers would have benefitted from price competition if not for the alleged conspiracy.
beyer also observed a pricing structure in the hydrogen peroxide industry which,he contended,showed prices across producers,grades and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide,and end uses moved similarly overtime this,according to beyer,suggested a conspiracy would have impacted all class members 
my analysis of the similarity in price movements over time indicates that hydrogen peroxide prices charged by different manufacturers are affected by the same market forces of supply and demand these similarities in movement are sometimes referred to as pricing structure or structure to prices.this analysis confirms that prices would have behaved similarly,in a consistent and generalized manner,to a conspiracy to fix prices at artificially high levels and to restrict output or to allocate customers.
beyer also pointed to coordinated increases in list prices by defendants as evidence of common impact.
beyer identified two potential approaches to estimating damages on a basis benchmark analysis,which would compare actual prices during the alleged conspiracy with prices that existed before the class period and regression analysis,through which it may be possible to estimate the relationship between price of hydrogen peroxide,sodium perborate,and sodium percarbonate and the various market forces that influence prices,including demand and supply variables.these methods,according to beyer,could be used to estimate the prices plaintiffs would have faced but for the conspiracy.beyer stated that sufficient reliable data exist to allow him to employ one or both of the potential approaches.
defendants offered the opinion of their own expert economist,janusz ordover,to provide an independent expert assessment of whether certification of the proposed class of plaintiffs is appropriate in this matter.specifically,ordover set out to address whether,assuming a conspiracy of the kind described in the complaint,the plaintiffs will be able to show,through common proof,that all or virtually all of the members of the proposed class suffered economic injury caused by the alleged conspiracy.ordover also opine d on whether a formulaic approach exists by which impact could be demonstrated and damages to the class could be reasonably calculated.ordover responded to and disputed many of beyer opinions.
first,ordover disputed beyer finding that hydrogen peroxide and persalts are fungible,contending that the various grades of hydrogen peroxide and persalts have different supply characteristics and face different demand conditions.the existence of supply and demand characteristics that are specific to the various grades and uses requires individualized assessment of the impact of the alleged conspiracy at least across these different grades and uses.consequently,a finding of impact from the alleged conspiracy can not be inferred from the mere fact of the conspiracy and from common evidence.second,ordover alleged that,over the proposed class period,the industry experienced prolonged periods of increasing capacity,increasing production,and an overall trend of declining real and nominal prices in the face of stable or increasing costs.ordover disputed beyer pricing structure analysis,contending there is no tendency for prices charged to individual customers to move together,which indicates that the alleged conspiracy can not be shown to have had impact,necessitating individualized inquiries to determine whether a customer incurred impact.
ordover also found some of defendants announcements were prices did not follow the purported list prices could not be used to measure antitrust impact on a basis common to the class.ordover observed that a number of contracts for the sale of hydrogen peroxide were individually negotiated,with a variety of contract terms.and deposition testimony from named plaintiffs indicated list prices were sometimes disregarded.ordover opined that the statistical methods by which beyer proposed to demonstrate common impact and damages were not feasible.given the record of prices and output in the industry and the apparent influence of individualized factors on pricing,assessment of impact based on aggregate price information was impossible,and any formulaic approach to determine a set of prices would have to incorporate a multitude of different variables,defeating any reasonable notion of proof common to the class.
significantly,ordover presented empirical analysis of the data on individual sales transactions and found that different customers purchasing the two most common grades and three most common concentrations from the same hydrogen peroxide producer in a given year were as likely to experience a decline in actual prices over the year as an increase,while other similarly situated customers experienced no change in price.defendants contend this disparity goes to the core of the predominance and their expert,beyer,failed to explain how or which common proof could be used to determine that the alleged conspiracy impacted customers whose prices declined,as well as customers whose prices increased or stayed the same,over the same time period.br.of appellant at.beyer,according to defendants,only promised to come up with a method to overcome this obstacle,without showing or even suggesting how it might be done.defendants contend the market analysis is generic and note it would apply equally to a large number of industries.with respect to the pricing structure analysis,they contend beyer use of average prices,rather than those of individual transactions,to show pricing structure,was erroneous because it glossed over differences in actual prices.the theme of defendants argument is that the data,which ordover analyzed,rebut beyer theory that common proof was feasible.beyer and ordover analyses are irreconcilable.
in addition to presenting ordover testimony,defendants moved to exclude beyer testimony as unreliable,citing daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d the district court denied the daubert motion in its memorandum and order certifying the class.
the district court concluded the predominance requirement was met.it held that e ither beyer market analysis or the pricing structure analysis would likely be independently sufficient at this stage.plaintiffs and beyer have provided us with both.despite defendants claims to the contrary,we should require no more of plaintiffs in a motion for class certification.because hydrogen peroxide is fungible,the court found,purchasing decisions are made primarily on the basis of price rather than quality or specific properties,and price is by far the most significant means of competition among producers and an agreement to control prices will seriously hinder competition.the court rejected defendants objection that different grades and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide called into question its fungibility.the prices of the grades and concentrations were related to each other,so in the view of the court,the differences would not preclude common proof of antitrust impact.defendants high combined market share meant that no competitor who was not a member of the conspiracy would be able to take up the slack and keep prices stable.the high barriers to entry and lack of economic substitutes implied a conspiracy such as the one alleged here could continue indefinitely with limited risk that a new competitor would enter the market and undercut the prices.also,the court accepted beyer opinion that prices in the hydrogen peroxide industry moved similarly over time and the industry exhibited structure in pricing.the court added that it believed plaintiffs would be able to show antitrust impact on all purchasers merely by showing that defendants kept list prices that were artificially high because of their conspiracy.
the district court held that it was sufficient that beyer proposed reliable methods for proving impact and damages it did not matter that beyer had not completed any benchmark or regression analyses,and the court would not require plaintiffs to show at the certification stage that either method would work.
defendants contend the district court applied too lenient a standard of proof with respect to the rule requirements by accepting only a threshold showing by plaintiffs rather than making its own determination,requiring only that plaintiffs demonstrate their intention to prove impact on a basis,and singling out antitrust actions as appropriate for class treatment even when compliance with rule is in doubt.
although it is clear that the party seeking certification must convince the district court that the requirements of rule are met,little guidance is available on the subject of the proper standard of proof for class certification the supreme court has described the inquiry as a rigorous analysis,falcon,at,and a close look,amchem,at,but it has elaborated no further.
the following principles guide a district court class certification analysis.first,the requirements set out in rule are not mere pleading rules.szabo,at.the court may delve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied.newton,at quoting james moore et,moore federal practice see beck,at same see also johnston hbo film,cir district court properly examine d the factual record underlying plaintiffs allegations in making its certification decision 
an overlap between a class certification requirement and the merits of a claim is no reason to decline to resolve relevant disputes when necessary to determine whether a class certification requirement is met.some uncertainty ensued when the supreme court declared in eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,that there is nothing in either the language or history of rule that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action.only a few years later,in addressing whether a party may bring an interlocutory appeal when a district court denies class certification the supreme court pointed out that the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.livesay,at.quoting mercantile bank langdeau,d.as we explained in newton,at,eisen is best understood to preclude only a merits inquiry that is not necessary to determine a rule requirement.other courts of appeals have agreed because the decision whether to certify a class requires a thorough examination of the factual and legal allegations,id.at,the court rigorous analysis may include a preliminary inquiry into the merits,id.at,and the court may consider the substantive elements of the plaintiffs case in order to envision the form that a trial on those issues would take,id.at quoting moore federal practice quotation marks omitted.see id.at in reviewing a motion for class certification,a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged claims can be properly resolved as a class action.a contested requirement is not forfeited in favor of the party seeking certification merely because it is similar or even identical to one normally decided by a trier of fact.although the district court findings for the purpose of class certification are conclusive on that topic,they do not bind the on the merits 
the evidence and arguments a district court considers in the class certification decision call for rigorous analysis.a party assurance to the court that it intends or plans to meet the requirements is insufficient.see id.at w here the court finds,on the basis of substantial evidence as here,that there are serious problems now appearing,it should not certify the class merely on the assurance of counsel that some solution will be found.quoting windham am.brands,cir quotation marks omitted wachtel guardian life ins,cir the requirement that a district court include in its class certification order a clear and complete summary of those claims,issues,or defenses subject to class treatment provides for the full and clear articulation of the litigation contours at the time of class certification.
support for our analysis is drawn from amendments to rule that took effect in.first,amended rule c a altered the timing requirement for the class certification decision.the amended rule calls for a decision on class certification a t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative,while the prior version had required that decision be made as soon as practicable after commencement of an action.we recognized in weiss regal collections,cir,that this change in language,though subtle,reflects the need for a thorough evaluation of the rule this reason the rule does not require or encourage premature certification determinations.we explained 
directs that certification decisions be made at an early practicable time.c a.this recent amendment replaced the language of the old rule the former as soon as practicable exaction neither reflect ed prevailing practice nor capture ed the many valid reasons that may justify deferring the initial certification decision.see.c a advisory committee notes 
allowing time for limited discovery supporting certification motions may be necessary for sound judicial administration.see newton,at i t may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.quoting falcon,at.
id.at see gariety,at noting the change relatedly,in introducing the concept of a trial plan,the advisory committee note focuses attention on a rigorous evaluation of the likely shape of a trial on the issues 
a critical need is to determine how the case will be tried.an increasing number of courts require a party requesting class certification to present a trial plan that describes the issues likely to be presented at trial and tests whether they are susceptible of proof.
advisory committee note,amendments.
additionally,the amendments eliminated the language that had appeared in rule c providing that a class certification may be conditional.the advisory committee note explains a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.the standing committee on rules of practice and procedure advised 
the provision for conditional class certification is deleted to avoid the unintended suggestion,which some courts have adopted,that class certification may be granted on a tentative basis,even if it is unclear that the rule requirements are satisfied.
committee report,supra,at see moore federal practice the amendment clarifies that courts should not grant certification except after searching inquiry,and that courts should not rely on later developments to determine whether certification is appropriate.
while these amendments do not alter the substantive standards for class certification,they guide the trial court in its proper consider carefully all relevant evidence and make a definitive determination that the requirements of rule have been met before certifying a class.see ipo,at amendments arguably combine to permit a more extensive inquiry into whether rule requirements are met than was previously appropriate oscar,at noting that these subtle changes reflect that a district court certification order often bestows upon plaintiffs extraordinary leverage,and its bite should dictate the process that precedes it.
to summarize because each requirement of rule must be met,a district court errs as a matter of law when it fails to resolve a genuine legal or factual dispute relevant to determining the requirements.
class certification requires a finding that each of the requirements of rule has been met see unger,at the plain text of rule requires the court to find,not merely assume,the facts favoring class certification.gariety,at rule b requires the court to find predominance.factual determinations necessary to make rule findings must be made by a preponderance of the evidence.in other words,to certify a class the district court must find that the evidence more likely than not establishes each fact necessary to meet the requirements of rule.see teamsters local freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir.
in reviewing a district court judgment on class certification,we apply the abuse of discretion standard.a district court abuses its discretion in deciding whether to certify a class action if its decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.in re motors.truck fuel tank prods.liab,cir citation and quotation marks omitted see newton,at.under these rule standards,a district court exercising proper discretion in deciding whether to certify a class will resolve factual disputes by a preponderance of the evidence and make findings that each rule requirement is met or is not met,having considered all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties.the abuse of discretion standard requires the judge to exercise sound that,the judge decision is not entitled to the deference attendant to discretionary rulings.
if a class is certified,the text of the order or an incorporated opinion must include a readily discernible,clear,and precise statement of the parameters defining the class or classes to be certified,and a readily discernible,clear,and complete list of the claims,issues or defenses to be treated on a class basis.wachtel,at see.c b.
although the district court properly described the class certification decision as requiring rigorous analysis,some statements in its opinion depart from the standards we have articulated.the district court stated,so long as plaintiffs demonstrate their intention to prove a significant portion of their case through factual evidence and legal arguments common to all class members,that will now suffice.it will not do here to make judgments about whether plaintiffs have adduced enough evidence or whether their evidence is more or less credible than defendants.with respect to predominance,the district court stated that p laintiffs need only make a threshold showing that the element of impact will predominantly involve generalized issues of proof,rather than questions which are particular to each member of the plaintiff class.quoting lumco.as we have explained,proper analysis under rule requires rigorous consideration of all the evidence and arguments offered by the parties.it is incorrect to state that a plaintiff need only demonstrate an intention to try the case in a manner that satisfies the predominance requirement.similarly,invoking the phrase threshold showing risks misapplying rule.a threshold showing could signify,incorrectly,that the burden on the party seeking certification is a lenient one such as a prima facie showing or a burden of production or that the party seeking certification receives deference or a presumption in its favor.so defined,threshold showing is an inadequate and improper standard.t he requirements of rule must be met,not just supported by some evidence.ipo,at see,id.at,rejecting the view that a party seeking certification need only make some showing with respect to the rule requirements.
citing cumberland farms,industries,the district court reasoned,i t is well recognized that private enforcement of antitrust laws is a necessary supplement to government action.with that in mind,in an alleged horizontal conspiracy case when a court is in doubt as to whether or not to certify a class action,the court should err in favor of allowing the class.see also eisenberg gagnon,cir citing kahan rosenstiel,cir advising that in a doubtful case when presented with a putative securities class action,court should err,if at all,in favor of certification.these statements invite error.although the trial court has discretion to grant or deny class certification,the court should not suppress doubt as to whether a rule requirement is matter the area of substantive law.accordingly,eisenberg should not be understood to encourage certification in the face of doubt as to whether a rule requirement has been met.eisenberg predates the recent amendments to rule which,as noted,reject tentative decisions on certification and encourage development of a record sufficient for informed analysis.see.advisory committee note,amendments a court that is not satisfied that the requirements of rule have been met should refuse certification until they have been met.we recognize the supreme court has observed that p redominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.amchem,at.but it does not follow that a court should relax its certification analysis,or presume a requirement for certification is met,merely because a plaintiff claims fall within one of those substantive categories.see.b advisory committee note,amendment private damage claims by numerous individuals arising out of concerted antitrust violations may or may not involve predominating common questions.robinson.auto.dealers ass n,cir there are no hard and fast rules regarding the suitability of a particular type of antitrust case for class action treatment.rather,the unique facts of each case will generally be the determining factor governing certification.citations and quotation marks omitted.a ctual,not presumed,conformance with the rule requirements remains necessary.newton,at quoting falcon,at.see.motor freight,rodriguez,d although a putative class may bring a type of claim that typically involves common questions of law or fact,careful attention to the requirements of rule remains indispensable.
to the extent that the district court analysis reflects application of incorrect standards,remand is appropriate.we recognize that the able district court did not have the benefit of the standards we have articulated.faced with complex,disputes,trial courts have expended considerable effort to interpret and apply faithfully the requirements of rule.one important reason for granting interlocutory appeals under.f is to address novel or unsettled questions of law like those presented here.newton,at see.advisory committee note,amendments cases in which the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law are among the best candidates for interlocutory appeal.
defendants contend the district court erred as a matter of law in failing to consider the expert testimony of defendants expert,ordover,instead deferring to the opinion of plaintiffs expert,beyer.plaintiffs do not dispute that a district court may properly consider expert opinion with respect to rule requirements at the class certification stage,but maintain that in this case the district court considered and rejected ordover opinion and defendants arguments based on it.
in addressing defendants daubert motion to exclude beyer opinion,the court discussed whether it should consider ordover opinion in deciding whether beyer opinion was admissible.the court stated it would be improper to weigh the relative credibility of the parties experts in other words,to weigh ordover opinion against beyer for the purpose of deciding whether to admit or exclude beyer opinion.concluding beyer opinion was admissible,the court denied the daubert motion.but in addressing the rule requirements,the court did not confront ordover analysis or his substantive rebuttal of beyer points.nor did the court address ordover finding of substantial price disparities among similarly situated purchasers of hydrogen peroxide.the court appears to have assumed it was barred from weighing ordover opinion against beyer for the purpose of deciding whether the requirements of rule had been met.this was erroneous.
expert opinion with respect to class certification,like any matter relevant to a rule requirement,calls for rigorous analysis.see west prudential,cir it follows that opinion testimony should not be uncritically accepted as establishing a rule requirement merely because the court holds the testimony should not be excluded,under daubert or for any other reason.see ipo,at rejecting the view that an expert testimony may establish a component of a rule requirement simply by being not fatally flawed and instructing that a district judge is to assess all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage and determine whether each rule requirement has been met,just as the judge would resolve a dispute about any other threshold prerequisite for continuing a lawsuit blades,at,affirming denial of class certification where the district court denied defendants daubert motion and considered all expert testimony offered by both sides in support of or in opposition to class certification and afforded that testimony such weight as it deemed appropriate.under rule the district court must be satisfied,falcon,at,or persuaded,ipo,at,that each requirement is met before certifying a class.like any evidence,admissible expert opinion may persuade its audience,or it may not.this point is especially important to bear in mind when a party opposing certification offers expert opinion.the district court may be persuaded by the testimony of either or neither party expert with respect to whether a certification requirement is met.weighing conflicting expert testimony at the certification stage is not only permissible it may be integral to the rigorous analysis rule demands.see blades,at i n ruling on class certification,a court may be required to resolve disputes concerning the factual setting of the case,including the resolution of expert disputes concerning the import of evidence concerning the factual as economic evidence as to business operations or market transactions west,at cautioning that neglecting to resolve disputes between experts amounts to a delegation of judicial power to the plaintiffs,who can obtain class certification just by hiring a competent expert see also cordes.fin.servs.edwards sons,cir analyzing the opinions of plaintiffs and defendants experts in re polymedica.sec,cir vacating class certification order but finding no error in the level of inquiry the district court applied under rule when it went well beyond the four corners of the pleadings,considering both parties expert reports and literally hundreds of pages of exhibits focused on market efficiency 
resolving expert disputes in order to determine whether a class certification requirement has been met is always a task for the matter whether a dispute might appear to implicate the credibility of one or more experts,a matter resembling those usually reserved for a trier of fact.rigorous analysis need not be hampered by a concern for avoiding credibility issues as noted,findings with respect to class certification do not bind the ultimate on the merits.a court determination that an expert opinion is persuasive or unpersuasive on a rule requirement does not preclude a different view at the merits stage of the case.
that weighing expert opinions is proper does not make it necessary in every case or unlimited in scope.as the court of appeals for the second circuit instructed,
to avoid the risk that a rule hearing will extend into a protracted of substantial portions of the underlying litigation,a district judge must be accorded considerable discretion to limit both discovery and the extent of the hearing on rule requirements.but even with some limits on discovery and the extent of the hearing,the district judge must receive enough evidence,by affidavits,documents,or testimony,to be satisfied that each rule requirement has been met.

plaintiffs contend the district court acceptance of their expert opinion was consistent with in re linerboard antitrust litigation,cir,an antitrust conspiracy action in which we affirmed class certification.there are a number of surface similarities between this case and linerboard.plaintiffs expert,beyer,also appeared as an expert for the plaintiffs in linerboard,and in both cases he presented an analysis of the industry and a structure in pricing analysis.id.at.as in linerboard,beyer here proposed to demonstrate antitrust impact through the use of benchmarks and multiple regression analysis.id.at.in affirming the district court grant of class certification in linerboard,we concluded that beyer,along with another expert for the plaintiffs,effectively utilized supporting data,including charts and exhibits,to authenticate their professional opinions that all class members would incur antitrust impact.id.at.
in linerboard we did not address whether such expert opinion offered by the party opposing class certification would have been properly considered by the district court in the exercise of its discretion.but defendants here presented expert opinion disputing much of the evidence and argument plaintiffs offered for,ordover disputed beyer characterizations of the market and the alleged pricing structure.defendants contend ordover raised substantial doubts,not considered by the district court,about whether common proof would be available for plaintiffs to demonstrate antitrust impact at trial.
we do not question plaintiffs general proposition,which the district court accepted,that a conspiracy to maintain prices could,in theory,impact the entire class despite a decrease in prices for some customers in parts of the class period,and despite some divergence in the prices different plaintiffs paid.but the question at class certification stage is whether,if such impact is plausible in theory,it is also susceptible to proof at trial through available evidence common to the class.when the latter issue is genuinely disputed,the district court must resolve it after considering all relevant evidence.here,the district court apparently believed it was barred from resolving disputes between the plaintiffs and defendants experts.rule calls for consideration of all relevant evidence and arguments,including relevant expert testimony of the parties.accordingly,we will vacate the order certifying the class and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion 
defendants contend the district court,by relying on bogosian gulf oil,cir,erroneously presumed the predominance requirement was met.in bogosian,also a clayton act case in which plaintiffs sought class certification,the district court had denied class certification on the assumption that the issue of antitrust impact would have to be proven on an individual,as opposed to common,basis.at.finding that assumption erroneous,we reasoned that when an antitrust violation impacts upon a class of persons who do have standing,there is no reason in doctrine why proof of the impact can not be made on a common basis so long as the common proof adequately demonstrates some damage to each individual.whether or not fact of damage can be proven on a common basis therefore depends upon the circumstances of each case.id.applying the concept,we continued 
if,in this case,a nationwide conspiracy is proven,the result of which was to increase prices to a class of plaintiffs beyond the prices which would obtain in a competitive regime,an individual plaintiff could prove fact of damage simply by proving that the free market prices would be lower than the prices paid and that he made some purchases at the higher price.if the price structure in the industry is such that nationwide the conspiratorially affected prices at the wholesale level fluctuated within a range which,though different in different regions,was higher in all regions than the range which would have existed in all regions under competitive conditions,it would be clear that all members of the class suffered some damage,notwithstanding that there would be variations among all dealers as to the extent of their damage.
id.at see newton,at in antitrust class actions,injury may be presumed when it is clear the violation results in harm to the entire class.linerboard,at.
in linerboard,we found a strong argument could be made that the bogosian concept of presumed impact was properly applied on the facts of that case.id.at.plaintiffs had alleged a horizontal conspiracy by manufacturers to restrict supply and raise prices of linerboard,the paper lining used in corrugated cardboard boxes and sheets.id.over a period,defendants allegedly had agreed to idle their plants to reduce inventories to a low and boost prices.id.at.during the class period,prices had risen by ninety percent.see id.at coincident with defendants interference with the normal market forces,linerboard prices in the eastern united states rose in six consecutive price increases,from a low of around to per ton in third quarter to per ton by april.the record in this case is different.although the price of hydrogen peroxide rose at some points during the lengthy class period,the price was lower,not higher,at the end of the class period than at the beginning.and the evidence,as interpreted by defendants expert,shows that through much of the class period the production of hydrogen peroxide was increasing rather than decreasing.moreover,there was an active dispute between the experts as to the price structure in the industry to which bogosian refers.defendants cited,for example,ordover empirical analysis showing substantial price disparities among similarly situated customers.accordingly,defendants contended,it was far from clear the violation result ed in harm to the entire class,newton,at.it is not apparent that the district court considered,or believed it had the authority to consider,all the evidence in the record with respect to this dispute.
while the district court found the bogosian presumption applied,it also relied on beyer analysis.linerboard,at t his was not a case where plaintiffs relied solely on presumed impact and damages.as in linerboard,plaintiffs here stress that they do not rely merely on bogosian presumption to support class certification,but also on their expert analysis.plaintiffs do not contend a bare allegation of a conspiracy,in the absence of supporting evidence and analysis,suffices to support class certification consistent with a proper rigorous analysis under rule.we emphasize that a ctual,not presumed,conformance with the rule requirements is essential.newton,at quoting falcon,at.applying a presumption of impact based solely on an unadorned allegation of would appear to conflict with the amendments to rule,which emphasize the need for a careful,approach,informed,if necessary,by discovery.see.advisory committee note,amendments d iscovery in aid of the certification decision often includes information required to identify the nature of the issues that actually will be presented at trial.
the district court,upon review of all the evidence consistent with this opinion,may again consider whether the reasoning in bogosian is compatible with the record of this case.see in re salomon analyst metromedia,cir remanding for opportunity for party opposing class certification to present evidence rebutting the presumption,because rule requires a definitive assessment as to the predominance requirement.
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the class certification order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

a class action isan exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.class relief is peculiarly appropriate when the issues involved are common to the class as a whole and when they turn on questions of law applicable in the same manner to each member of the class.for in such cases,the device saves the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting an issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an economical fashion under rule.falcon,at.quotation marks and citations omitted alteration in original quoting califano yamasaki,d.class certification under rule has two primary components.the party seeking class certification must first establish the four requirements of rule a the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity there are questions of law or fact common to the class commonality the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class typicality and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class adequacy.a.if all four requirements of rule a are met,a class of one of three types each with additional requirements may be certified.see.b.rule received stylistic revisions effective december.advisory committee note,amendment.we quote the restyled version its changes are immaterial to this appeal.

before the district court,both parties agreed.and daubert should be applied to assess whether beyer testimony should be admitted for consideration.on appeal,neither party argues otherwise,and defendants do not now challenge the district court denial of the daubert motion.the district court stated that because the evidence is here offered for the limited purpose of class certification,our inquiry is perhaps less exacting than it might be for evidence to be presented at trial.as we explain,however,a district court conclusion that an expert opinion is admissible does not necessarily dispose of the ultimate the district court is satisfied,by all the evidence and arguments including all relevant expert opinion,that the requirements of rule have been met.
