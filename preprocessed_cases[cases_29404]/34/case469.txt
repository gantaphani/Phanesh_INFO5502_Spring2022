on february,lugo and two,alexander guzman guzman and oscar sosa,were arrested while fleeing from the armed robbery of the banco popular de puerto rico bank in aguas buenas,puerto rico banco popular,in possession of guns and the bank money.a few hours after his arrest,lugo confessed to the crime and to two prior bank robberies.the three men were charged in a indictment with aiding and abetting the banco popular robbery and endangering the lives of others by using a firearm,in violation of and a,d count one and aiding and abetting the use and carrying of firearms in relation to that offense,in violation of and c a ii count two.guzman and sosa pleaded guilty,and lugo went to trial.
proceedings 
on june,lugo filed a motion to suppress the incriminating statements that he made while in custody.the district court rejected the motion as untimely under a scheduling order that required motions to be filed by march.lugo then filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its decision and entertain the suppression motion,which the court denied.
subsequently,the government gave notice that it intended to present lugo confession to the two prior bank robberies as evidence at trial under federal rule of evidence b.lugo moved in limine to exclude this evidence.he argued that his statements about these other robberies were obtained in violation of his miranda rights and that their admission at trial would result in undue delay and unfair prejudice.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge and an evidentiary hearing was held.
testimony at the hearing established the following facts.about an hour after the banco popular robbery,puerto rico police officers interviewed lugo at the caguas police station,where lugo was initially detained after his arrest.the interview lasted two or three minutes.lugo confirmed that he could read and write and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.officers read lugo his rights in spanish from a police form and gave the form to him.lugo reviewed the form and asked officers to explain it,which they did.he then signed the upper portion of form,a section titled acknowledgment of rights,confirming that he was advised of his rights and understood them.he declined,however,to make a statement to officers or sign the bottom portion of the form,a section titled waiver of rights.at that point,lugo was asked no further questions and the interview concluded.according to a police officer who testified at the hearing,lugo did not ask for an attorney at any point during the interview.
later on,lugo was transferred to federal offices in guaynabo because an rico police joint task force had taken over the investigation.a little before,he was brought to an interrogation room and interviewed by luis enrique sosa rivera agent sosa,a member of the task force.agent sosa had not been present at lugo initial interview.lugo sat with one arm handcuffed to his chair during the interview.he was offered a meal,consumed chips and a soda,and was given permission to use the restroom if needed.
agent sosa identified himself and the other agents in the room to lugo as law enforcement officials in charge of the investigation.after determining that lugo was in good health and acting rationally,agent sosa read lugo his rights in spanish from a police form.lugo read the form,initialed each line,and told the agents that he understood his rights.lugo then signed the form after agents explained that,by doing so,he was agreeing to waive his rights.
agent sosa then asked him what had happened earlier that day.lugo had tears in his eyes and appeared remorseful as he spoke of failing his family.he confessed to robbing the banco popular with his two.lugo then provided details about his participation in two prior bank robberies that occurred within the past fifteen months.agent sosa testified that lugo was twice advised of his right to an attorney,and that lugo never requested one or asked for the interview to stop.
the third and final witness at the evidentiary hearing was lugo.lugo admitted that he had been advised of his rights during both interviews and that he had fully understood those rights.he contended,however,that he had asked for an attorney during each interview and that,at the second interview,agents responded that they were his attorneys.lugo testified that he had felt intimidated by one agent who kept demanding that he confess.he also asserted that he confessed because agents had told him that there was a lot of evidence against him and that,if he did not confess,he would serve more time in prison.
after the hearing,the magistrate judge issued a written report recommending that lugo motion in limine be denied.the magistrate judge rejected lugo claim that his confession to the two prior robberies was obtained in violation of his miranda rights.in particular,she found that lugo claim to have requested an attorney was not credible.she also found that lugo was not pressured to confess but did so voluntarily out of remorse for what he had done to his family and a realization of the overwhelming evidence against him.the magistrate further concluded that the evidence of the two prior bank robberies could be admitted under rule b and would not result in unfair prejudice.included at the end of the magistrate report was a notice that the failure to file specific objections to the report constituted a waiver of the right to review by the district court.
lugo objected solely to the magistrate conclusion that agents did not violate his miranda rights in obtaining his confession to the prior robberies.lugo accepted a substantial portion of the magistrate factual finding as correct,but argued that authorities were precluded from him because he had invoked his rights to remain silent and to counsel during the first interview.lugo did not object to the magistrate findings regarding the admissibility of the evidence under rule b.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation in its entirety,including her finding that lugo did not request counsel at any time during either interview.the district court supplemented the magistrate miranda analysis with a determination that,under michigan mosley,d,lugo right to remain silent was scrupulously honored even though the authorities resumed the interrogation after his initial decision to remain silent.turning to the rule b issue,the district court concurred with the magistrate conclusion that lugo confession to the two prior robberies constituted admissible rule b evidence and that its probative value would not be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect,and noted that lugo had failed to object to this part of the magistrate report.
b.the trial 
the trial commenced on march.witnesses to the bank robbery and law enforcement officers involved in the case testified to the following.around on february,two men entered the banco popular,where seven bank employees and seven or eight customers were present.one of the men,alleged at trial to be lugo,wore sunglasses and a cap and stood near the bank front entrance.he displayed a pistol,announced that a robbery was in progress,and ordered the people in the bank to lie on the floor.the second man,later determined to be sosa,jumped over the counter and forced the bank teller,rebecca claudio arroyo,to lie down on the floor.the man emptied claudio teller drawer while holding a black backpack in his hand.after seizing the cash,about in total,the two perpetrators fled the bank and jumped into a getaway car driven by a third man,who was subsequently determined to be guzman.
a banco popular videotape depicting the robbery,along with stills from the videotape,were offered into evidence.in the videotape,the man w
