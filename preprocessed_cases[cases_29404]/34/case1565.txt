senh phun organized a group of associates to steal cocaine from the stash house of a drug cartel.phun,along with saraeun min,khem un,marc eric johnson,jan stevens,and james dwayne mccalister collectively,the defendants conspired to commit the robbery,but were arrested just before they could attempt to complete the object of their conspiracy.in fact,unbeknownst to the defendants,the stash house and the cocaine never existed,but were rather a fiction created by undercover law enforcement officers.after a joint trial,each defendant was convicted on several counts related to his participation in the conspiracy.the defendants now challenge multiple aspects of the trial and their respective convictions.having fully considered the defendants contentions,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf agents began laying the foundation for a sting involving phun.based on information that phun was dealing in narcotics,large quantities of marijuana,and contraband cigarettes and had previously discussed committing robbery,agents established undercover identities and,over a series of meetings,sold phun contraband cigarettes in exchange for cash and marijuana.
at one such meeting,detective robert snyder presented phun with an opportunity to rob a drug stash location in virginia.snyder explained that he and his partner had been buying five kilograms of cocaine at a time for their boss,that the cocaine supplier had recently failed to supply two kilograms,and that it was imperative he retrieve this missing cocaine from the supplier stash house.this was all fiction there was no boss,no missing cocaine,and no stash house.but phun took the bait and agreed to assemble a crew to undertake the robbery.
the plan was for phun crew to steal whatever was at the stash house,which they were told repeatedly would be between five and ten kilograms of cocaine,and some unknown amount of cash.snyder would receive the two kilograms of cocaine he owed his boss,and the crew would keep whatever else they were able to seize.
on october,the day the robbery was to occur,every defendant except phun,who never intended to participate directly,drove to a storage facility in virginia.there they met undercover agents waiting with a van to execute the robbery.while mccalister and stevens remained in the defendants rented suv,johnson,min,and un got out and discussed final details with the agents.snyder reiterated,a ll i want is my two.there would be like at least ten in there.johnson responded,it ten and cash,right.the group then discussed whether and to what extent the stash house traffickers would be armed,and snyder asked,you got your shit though,right.all three responded in the affirmative after snyder suggested that the crew load the van,mccalister and stevens got out of the suv and transferred items concealed under their clothing into the van.the agents observed mccalister and stevens taking apart plastic molding in the van and lifting up some of the floorboards.finally,snyder asked all five defendants present whether they were ready to carry out the robbery,and they all nodded yes.
shortly thereafter,law enforcement moved in on the parking lot,arresting the defendants and recovering five loaded firearms from the wheel wells of the van.min alone waived his miranda rights and confessed to his involvement in a plan to rob a drug trafficker of cocaine and money.phun was arrested later that day in philadelphia.
the six defendants were each indicted on three counts conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce by robbery,a possession of firearms during a crime of violence,c and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute kilograms or more of cocaine,a.
after the district court denied defendants motions to sever,all six defendants were tried jointly and min redacted confession was introduced against him with a limiting instruction.the government had replaced the names of any defendants except min with terms such as another person,a third person,others,and one of the others,and had written the statement from the perspective of an officer interviewing min.see,min stated the following at approximately the night before,another person asked min if he would take a trip the next day to take care of business,which min understood to mean that they were to pick up some drugs in virginia.to min knowledge,this other person was making the trip at the request of a third person.none of the defendants testified at trial.detective snyder testified extensively about his understanding of recorded conversations he had with phun in the course of planning the robbery.
phun,un,min,and johnson were convicted on all three counts stevens and mccalister were convicted on counts one and two only.all six defendants timely appealed.
we first address whether the district court erred in denying the five defendants motions to sever and admitting the redacted confession of their codefendant,min,in the resulting joint trial.we review the decision to deny a motion to sever for abuse of discretion,though we review whether the admission of evidence violated the confrontation clause de novo.united states lighty,cir.
generally,defendants may,and indeed should,be indicted and charged together if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction.see.b zafiro united states,d.when such defendants have been joined properly under rule b,a district court should grant severance under rule only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants,or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro,at.although limiting instructions often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice as a result of the joint trial,in some situations the risk of prejudice is so high as to require a separate trial.united states hayden,cir.
such a situation can arise where the confession of a codefendant,admissible against himself but inadmissible hearsay against anyone else,inculpates one or more of the other defendants.in bruton united states,the supreme court acknowledged that the prejudice resulting from the introduction of a codefendant confession that directly implicates the defendant is so severe that even when the jury is instructed to consider the confession only against the codefendant,the other defendant sixth amendment right to confrontation is necessarily violated,d w here the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant,who stands accused with the defendant,are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial we can not accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for the defendant constitutional right of.
subsequent decisions have refined bruton holding significantly.first,in richardson marsh,the supreme court held that the confrontation clause is not implicated so long as the codefendant confession,accompanied by a limiting instruction,is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant name,but any reference to his or her existence,d.this is true even when the confession inferentially incriminates the defendant because other evidence admitted subsequently at trial clearly links the defendant to the statement in an inculpatory manner.id 
the supreme court later clarified that a codefendant confession is facially,not inferentially,incriminatory if it replace s a proper name with an obvious blank,the word delete,a symbol,or similarly notif ies the jury that a name has been deleted.gray maryland,d the court reasoned that redaction which directly reveals the existence of the defendant prejudices him in much the same way as the direct accusation in bruton.under gray,a confession is facially incriminatory,and thus inadmissible even with a limiting instruction,where the inferences required to link the statement to the defendant are of the type that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.id.at.
the supreme court has yet to face a situation in which a confession reference to other defendants is less obvious than a blank space,such as where defendants names are replaced with generic pronouns.however,taking our cue from hints in gray we have held admissible a codefendant redacted statement that referred to the existence of another person through neutral phrases.united states akinkoye,cir.in that case,each of two codefendants made an statement implicating the other.the statements were altered by replacing the defendants respective names with the phrases another person or another individual.id.
by concluding that the admission of these redacted statements did not offend bruton and affirming the district court denial of the defendants motions to sever,akinkoye dictates our decision here.unlike in gray,the obfuscation of the names of other defendants in the version of min confession admitted at trial was not obvious.written in the third person and in grammatically correct phrases,the redacted confession referred generally and without facial incrimination to some number of individuals who could,or could not,be the other defendants the statement did not implicate any one defendant in particular,nor did it leave the jury to fill in any obvious blanks.for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendants motions to sever,and that min redacted confession was properly admitted against him with a limiting instruction.
next,we turn to defendants impossibility argument,a major focus of their challenge.that the stash house,drugs,and entire factual premise of the robbery were the fictional creation of law enforcement officers,they argue,should be a defense to their conspiracy charges.this argument takes several forms.primarily,defendants assert that factual impossibility renders the evidence against them insufficient.they also contest the district court decision to prohibit defense counsel from arguing impossibility during closing argument,and challenge the exclusion from the jury instructions of impossibility as a defense.because each of these arguments relies on the same premise,we first address defendants underlying legal argument as a whole,concluding that factual impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.we then discuss more specifically the sufficiency of the evidence in this case.
we have yet to face the question of whether factual impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.the fundamental tenets of conspiracy law,however,in addition to the persuasive reasoning of several of our sister circuits,compel our determination that it is not.
it is that the inchoate crime of conspiracy punishes the agreement to commit an unlawful act,not the completion of the act itself.see united states jimenez recio,d.indeed,in the specific context of conspiracies to distribute cocaine in violation of,not even a single overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is required.united states shabani,d.because special dangers remain apart from the danger of attaining the particular objective,impossibility does not terminate conspiracy.jimenez recio,at.
in jimenez recio,the supreme court held that the charge of conspiracy was not defeated where police actions frustrated the conspiracy specific objective before its completion without the conspirators knowledge.id.that holding extends naturally to the present case,where the police had defeated the criminal objective from the beginning,by inventing it.united states belardo quinones,cir there is no basis for making a distinction between those who start a conspiracy that is impossible from the beginning and one who joins a conspiracy that has become impossible due to intervening events unknown to the conspirators.defendants have offered no convincing reason to distinguish the type of impossibility deemed irrelevant to conspiracy in jimenez recio from the type of impossibility we confront here.
in addition,several of our sister circuits have faced similar stash house sting cases in which law enforcement agents fabricated the existence of drugs,and all have concluded that factual impossibility is not a defense to the inchoate offense of conspiracy.see,united states corson,cir though it might seem odd,the fact that the stash house,the drugs indeed the whole plot was fake is irrelevant.that the crime agreed upon was in fact impossible to commit is no defense to the crime of conspiracy.the crime of conspiracy is the agreement itself.internal citations omitted united states orisnord,cir united states rodriguez,cir see also united states giry,cir finding factual impossibility irrelevant to crime of conspiracy to import cocaine orchestrated by dea agents.we agree 
defendants related insufficiency of the evidence claims merit brief individual mention.in addition to our conclusion that the impossibility of the conspiracy objective did not render the evidence insufficient as a matter of law,we also find that the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain each conviction on these particular facts.
we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction under a substantial evidence standard,which requires us to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and inquire whether a reasonable finder of fact could find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states hackley,cir.defendants argue the evidence established neither the amount of cocaine defendants conspired to steal nor the possession of firearms.we review the evidence introduced to prove each element,and find it supports the jury verdict as to both beyond a reasonable doubt.
contrary to defendants assertions,there was ample evidence to establish that the conspiracy involved more than five kilograms of cocaine.the testimony of undercover agents,as well as recorded phone calls and meetings,fully supported the conclusion that the plan was to steal at least five usually between seven and ten kilograms of cocaine from the stash house,and that the knew it.
unlike in united states hickman,cir,upon which defendants rely,the evidence here does not invite speculation as to the quantity of narcotics involved.in hickman,we carefully reviewed all of the evidence of actual amounts of heroin seized or known about in the course of a charged conspiracy,and even making all assumptions of dilution and quantity in favor of the government,concluded it fell short of one kilogram.id.at.we rejected the government theory that the amount should be inflated based on empty vials found in the defendant possession or the conspirators apparent familiarity with the drug trade.id.at.
in the present case,we need not engage in such calculations and estimations because,unlike in hickman,the evidence introduced was replete with references to the amount of cocaine the defendants conspired to steal.hickman does not stand for the proposition that all evidence of drug amounts for conspiracy charges must be proved by actual seized evidence.to the contrary,we considered evidence of several merely hypothetical transactions in calculating the total amount of heroin in hickman what hickman requires,and what we have here in abundance,is evidence of the amount of drugs the conspiracy intended to possess and distribute,sufficient to convict on count three.
similarly,there was a wealth of evidence that the defendants planned to possess firearms while committing the robbery,and did possess them in furtherance of the conspiracy.again,detective snyder testimony,corroborated by recordings of phone calls and meetings,repeatedly established that the plan was to commit an armed robbery of a drug stash location.further,there was specific evidence that on october,the defendants in fact possessed and carried five firearms to the staging point of the robbery.
defendants focus on who owned the van in which the firearms were found,in reliance on united states blue,cir,misses the point.that case concerned whether the defendant had dominion and control over a gun located under the driver seat of a car sufficient to establish constructive possession,because the government produced no evidence that the defendant actually possessed the firearm.the evidence in the present case presents no real question of dominion and control.there was evidence that defendants maintained the guns in their rented
