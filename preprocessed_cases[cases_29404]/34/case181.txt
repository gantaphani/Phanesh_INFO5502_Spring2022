todd carta appeals the district court ruling that he is a sexually dangerous person subject to civil commitment under the adam walsh child protection and safety act of the act after review of the record and the district court factual findings and legal conclusions,we affirm.
carta pled guilty to federal child pornography charges in and was sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervised release.prior to his scheduled release in,the bureau of prisons certified that carta was a sexually dangerous person and commenced proceedings pursuant to the act,which authorizes civil commitment of a person in federal custody.a.a sexually dangerous person is one who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and is sexually dangerous to others.a.a determination that an individual is a sexually dangerous person requires the government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder as a result of which he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.id.a 
after a district judge ruled that the government had failed to establish that carta diagnosis of paraphilia not otherwise specified characterized by hebephilia was a serious mental illness,abnormality or disorder within the meaning of the act,united states carta,d carta i,a panel of this court reversed,holding that the district court erred in ruling that the government had failed to establish the serious mental illness element.united states carta,cir carta ii.the case was remanded for consideration of whether the requisite dangerousness exists.id.a different district court judge subsequently conducted a trial,ultimately ruling in the government favor.see united states carta,pbs,wl.july,carta iii.this timely appeal followed.
we begin by observing that carta,who was years old when he pled guilty to the child pornography charges for which he was incarcerated,does not deny that the act first element that he has engaged in child molestation in the past is satisfied.his lengthy history of committing sexual abuse,beginning when he was years old and including many such acts over the course of three decades,is detailed in both district court orders.see carta iii,wl at carta i,d at.we eschew repeating the details of his history here.in addition to his prior abusive conduct,carta also displayed troubling behavior while in a sex offender treatment program in federal prison.after being transferred at his request to a prison in north carolina that offered the program,carta dropped out in part because of his inappropriate interest in the program younger members.carta ii,at.
given carta concession as to the first element,the remaining issues before us are whether he suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality or disorder and,if so,whether such condition would result in his having serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation.
at the heart of the first issue is the diagnosis proffered by the government expert,amy phenix,who testified that carta was afflicted with a mental disorder known as paraphilia not otherwise specified nos characterized by hebephilia.the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv or dsm describes the essential features of paraphilia as follows 
r ecurrent,intense sexually arousing fantasies,sexual urges,or behaviors generally involving nonhuman objects,the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one partner,or children or other nonconsenting persons,that occur over a period of at least months and that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,occupational,or other important areas of functioning.
carta ii,at quoting am.psychiatric ass n,dsm ed.the not otherwise specified portion of the diagnosis stems from the fact that hebephilia is not one of the specific conditions listed in the dsm iv,either separately or as an example of paraphilia.id.while the precise contours of hebephilia are the subject of debate,it suffices to say that the disorder consists of a sexual attraction to adolescents,as opposed to,for example,a specified paraphilia such as pedophilia,a sexual attraction to children.id.citing dsm at.
the parties dispute whether our determination in carta ii that the government had established the mental disorder element is binding as law of the case.it is.
under the law of the case doctrine,when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages of the same case.united states matthews,cir citing arizona california.two branches of the doctrine are pertinent here.the mandate rule proscribes relitigation in the trial court of matters that were decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.id.at.the other branch,related to the law of the circuit principle,binds a successor appellate panel in the same case to honor fully the original decision.id.here,both varieties of the rule apply.
the only issue before us in carta ii was whether the district court in carta i had correctly ruled that the diagnosis of paraphilia nos characterized by hebephilia was not a serious mental illness,abnormality or disorder.we determined that the statutory definition of serious mental illness is not limited to either the consensus of the medical community or to maladies identified in the dsm.carta ii,at.additionally,we noted that even if hebephilia lacks sufficient indicia to fit it within the statutory praxis,paraphilia itself is listed in the dsm,as is the category paraphilia not otherwise specified.id.at.thus,we discounted the testimony of defense expert leonard bard that hebephilia is not a generally accepted diagnosis and does not fit within the dsm definition of paraphilia.in the end,we concluded that phenix report,carta past history of sexually abusing minors,his behavior and his expressed attitudes justify classifying him as suffering from paraphilia he has a sexual fixation on minors that plainly has caused significant distress or impairment in his life.id.at 
on remand to determine whether carta would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation,the district court nevertheless acceded to carta request to accept additional evidence on the mental condition issue.carta iii,wl at.the court need not have done so.
in carta ii,we explicitly decided the serious mental illness question.under the mandate rule,relitigation is ordinarily foreclosed.see united states rivera martinez,cir when a case is appealed and remanded,the decision of the appellate court establishes the law of the case and it must be followed by the trial court on remand.emphasis in original.the trial court possesses some limited discretion to reopen an issue,but only in very special situations.united states wallace,cir quoting united states bell,cir.we have described the exceptional circumstances that must be present to overcome the mandate rule as requiring a showing of a change in controlling legal authority,significant new evidence not previously obtainable,or the prospect of serious injustice.id.
similarly,the law of the circuit principle requires that we follow carta ii unless and until the decision is modified or overturned by a higher court or if the initial ruling was made on an inadequate record or was designed to be preliminary or tentative,if newly discovered evidence bears on the question,or if reconsideration would avoid manifest injustice.wallace,at quoting ellis united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a finding of manifest injustice requires a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling is unreasonable or obviously wrong and a finding of prejudice.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
none of the factors that would obviate application of either branch of the law of the case doctrine to the holding in carta ii is present here.there has been no intervening authority that would undermine the earlier panel decision,carta ii was not decided on an inadequate record,and there was nothing about the opinion that could be regarded as preliminary or ten
