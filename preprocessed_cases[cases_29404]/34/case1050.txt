the government appeals from the district court hall,ruling that a tip from an informant was insufficiently corroborated to provide reasonable suspicion to stop defendant vamond elmore car.the government argues that the district court incorrectly categorized the informant as anonymous and therefore required too high a level of corroboration.defendant from the district court ruling that evidence found pursuant to a search warrant issued based on the fruits of the stop should not be excluded under the good faith exception to the warrant requirement.the government also contends that the district court erred in ruling that the defendant had fourth amendment standing to challenge the search warrant.
background 
on june,detective thomas roncinske of the norwalk police department received a telephone call from a woman claiming to be a close friend of the defendant vamond elmore.the caller identified herself as dorothy and provided roncinske with her home and cell phone numbers.she told roncinske that elmore was in possession of some weapons and expressed concern that he might do harm to somebody.roncinske had not previously used the caller as a confidential informant and had never spoken to her before.roncinske spoke with the caller approximately four times throughout the course of the day,gradually obtaining more information from her about herself and the defendant.he was able to communicate with her several times by calling the cell phone number that she had given him.
during the course of these calls,the caller eventually told roncinske that her full name was dorothy mazza and that she had been elmore girlfriend,but she had recently kicked him out of her house.roncinske used a department of motor vehicles dmv database to obtain an address and birthdate for a dorothy mazza,but he did not go to the address that he found in an attempt to verify her identity,roncinske asked mazza about an incident in in which elmore had been shot.mazza knew about the incident and described the specific injuries that elmore had sustained.she said she was the one who nursed him back to health.she also said that elmore had been shot in retaliation for having a man named demark bond.this information matched police reports on elmore injuries and the police theory on a possible motive for the shooting.details about the shooting and elmore injuries had been reported in several local newspaper articles,but the police theory about the motive was not public information.
roncinske did not meet with mazza because she said she was afraid of what would happen to her if she was seen working with the police.mazza also insisted that her name be left out of any police reports because she knew that the defendant had weapons and was afraid that he would retaliate against her.roncinske did not go to the address he had obtained from the dmv,nor did he attempt to call mazza on the home telephone number she had given him.there is no evidence that roncinske checked whether the phone numbers she gave him were registered to dorothy mazza.
mazza told roncinske that she had seen elmore in possession of several firearms at her residence as recently as june,three days earlier and that was why she kicked him out.these weapons included a caliber smith wesson revolver loaded with hollow point bullets,a caliber pistol,a caliber revolver,a riot pump shotgun,and an assault rifle.she said that elmore kept the smith wesson in his car,which she described as a black acura with tinted windows and new connecticut license plates that recently had been switched over from temporary plates.she said that she had seen the gun hidden under an altered piece of carpet on the passenger side of elmore car.
mazza said that elmore told her that he now kept the rest of the weapons with a woman named tanea and in the car of one dwayne sherman.she told roncinske that tanea lived in building at monterey place,in the apartment directly upstairs from dwayne sherman and his wife,in an area of norwalk,connecticut known as carlton court.she said that elmore frequented the carlton court and round tree motel areas of norwalk.mazza also told roncinske that dwayne sherman bmw was parked outside building.
roncinske took several steps to attempt to corroborate the information that he got from mazza.he went to monterey place and found a bmw registered to dwayne sherman parked in front of building,which shares a parking lot with building.he learned that dwayne sherman wife,denita sherman,leased an apartment in building and that a myra humphrey leased the apartment above the shermans finally,roncinske checked elmore and sherman criminal histories and discovered that they had been arrested together for armed robbery.
based on the information he obtained from mazza and his independent investigation,roncinske drafted a memo to all norwalk police officers indicating that he had received information that elmore was in possession of a handgun.the memo stated that elmore drove a black,acura whose last known registration was temporary,but now had regular connecticut plates and that he frequents the carlton court and round tree motel areas.the memo also warned that the weapon may be hidden under the carpet on the passenger side.a photograph of elmore was attached to the memo.
sergeant kenneth king received roncinske memo at the start of his late night shift on june.sometime shortly after on june,sergeant king and officer mark suda,driving in separate cars,saw a black acura with tinted windows driving in the vicinity of carlton court.the officers,who knew elmore from prior encounters,identified him as the driver by looking through the untinted front windshield of the car as it passed.the officers turned their cars around,followed elmore car and then pulled it over.they approached the car and asked the occupants,elmore and a woman suda identified as tanea humphrey,to step out of the car.king examined the passenger compartment and found a caliber smith wesson underneath the driver seat.the police placed elmore under arrest and then took tanea humphrey to her residence at monterey place.
following the arrest,roncinske applied for a search warrant for tanea humphrey apartment and dwayne sherman car based on the information he had received from mazza,his own investigation,and the results of the stop that led to elmore arrest.a search warrant issued and the norwalk police went to humphrey apartment on june.upon entering,they read humphrey miranda warnings and asked her where the weapons were located.she told them the weapons were in two bags in her bedroom closet,which elmore had asked her to keep for him.the police retrieved and opened the bags which contained an assault rifle with an accompanying loaded magazine,a caliber pistol,a shotgun,and a box of rounds of caliber ammunition.the police also found a caliber revolver,loose ammunition,and some crack cocaine in dwayne sherman car,but none of that contraband was charged in this case.
elmore had a limited connection with humphrey apartment.he and humphrey had been friends for one to two years.he did not reside at her apartment,nor had he ever been an overnight guest or even stayed for dinner.he did not have unfettered access to the apartment and had only been there approximately seven to ten times,each time only for about five minutes.his main link to the apartment was that humphrey allowed him to store his bags in her closet.
ii.the district court decision 
defendant was charged with two counts of being a felon in possession of firearms count one for the weapons found in tanea humphrey apartment and count two for the weapon found in his car.elmore moved to suppress the evidence in both counts,arguing that the police lacked sufficient,reliable information to form a reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop under terry ohio,d,and without the evidence they obtained during the stop,the police lacked probable cause to support the search warrant for tanea humphrey apartment.
the district court held that,because the police did not do enough to confirm mazza identity and therefore roncinske did not really know with whom he was speaking,she should be treated as an anonymous informant.united states elmore,d.analyzing mazza tip under the supreme court decisions on anonymous informants in alabama white,d and florida,d,the district court found that the tip lacked the necessary indicia of reliability to establish reasonable suspicion because roncinske was not able to corroborate sufficiently the information she gave.specifically,the district court noted roncinske failure to corroborate,with any specificity,predictive information about the future actions of third parties.roncinske was only able to corroborate easily obtained information.
the district court found,and the government does not contest,that without the evidence they obtained when they stopped elmore car,the police lacked probable cause to support the search warrant for tanea humphrey apartment and therefore the warrant was invalid.the district court further held that although elmore lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in tanea humphrey apartment,he had fourth amendment standing to challenge the validity of the search warrant because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his closed bags within the apartment.but the court went on to find that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule,set forth in united states leon,d,applied.because the officers reasonably relied on the search warrant issued by a neutral magistrate,whom they had not knowingly misled,the evidence they found by searching humprey apartment should not be excluded.
the government took an interlocutory appeal from the decision on count two to suppress the evidence found in elmore car.the defendant pleaded guilty to count one charging the weapons found in humphrey apartment,subject to this appeal from the district court application of the good faith exception,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.the government also challenges the district court finding that elmore had standing to challenge the warrant.
discussion 
i.the terry stopa.standard of review and law governing terry stops 
on appeal from a ruling on a motion to suppress,we review the district court ultimate determinations of reasonable suspicion or probable cause de novo,but of course review findings of fact for clear error.ornelas united states,d.
under terry ohio,d,police may briefly detain an individual for questioning if they have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot,and may frisk him if they reasonably believe he is armed and dangerous.united states colon,cir.when a suspect is stopped in a car,the police may perform a limited search of the passenger compartment if they reasonably believe that he is dangerous and may gain immediate control of a weapon.michigan long,d.a terry stop represents an intermediate response allowing police to pursue a limited investigation when they lack the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest.adams williams,d.reasonable suspicion requires more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.white,at.internal quotation marks omitted.police must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which,taken together with rational inferences from those facts,reasonably warrant the intrusion on a citizen liberty interest.terry,at.like probable cause,reasonable suspicion is determined based on the totality of the circumstances but the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause,and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.united states arvizu,d.
forming reasonable suspicion from informants tips 
reasonable suspicion may be based upon information from a confidential informant so long as the tip bears sufficient indicia of reliability.williams,at.as in the probable cause context,courts must assess whether an informant tip establishes reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances approach set forth in illinois gates,d,though obviously a lesser showing is required.see white,at.although in gates the supreme court abandoned the rigid test of aguilar texas,d,and spinelli united states,d,the informant basis of knowledge and veracity,how he knows and why we should believe him remain highly relevant to a determination of either probable cause or reasonable suspicion.see white,at.
when the informant tip,standing alone,lacks sufficient indicia of reliability because it does not do enough to establish the informant basis of knowledge and veracity,it may still support a finding of reasonable suspicion if sufficiently corroborated through independent police investigation.draper united states,d,provides the classic example.in draper,a known and previously accurate informant told the police that draper would arrive in denver on a train from chicago on one of two days carrying heroin.id.at.he would be wearing a light colored raincoat,brown slacks,and black shoes,and he habitually walked real fast.id.at.the informant gave no indication of the basis for his information.on one of the appointed days,the police in denver observed a man matching draper description and wearing the predicted clothes get off a train from chicago and begin walking quickly they arrested him.id.at.the supreme court held that the police had probable cause to arrest draper because they had corroborated every other bit of the informant tip and therefore had reasonable grounds to believe that the remaining unverified draper was carrying true.id.at.
even a tip from a completely anonymous it will seldom demonstrate basis of knowledge and the veracity of an anonymous informant is largely unknowable,see white,at.form the basis of reasonable suspicion or probable cause if it is sufficiently corroborated.in spinelli,the supreme court cited draper for the proposition that if an informant provided sufficient details,including predictions about the future actions of third parties,and those details are independently corroborated,the police could infer that the informant had some sort of inside information as his basis of knowledge.at.justice white,in his concurrence,stressed that draper should not stand for the proposition that because some of the informant tip proved to be true that the police could infer that the final critical fact was also true.in justice white view,corroboration did little to bolster veracity.id.at.white,concurring.in gates,however,the court reinterpreted draper,implicitly disavowing justice white limitation.stressing the importance of predictive information,the court held that corroboration of some of the information in the tip allows the police to reasonably infer that the remaining,unverified information is also true.gates,at.under the totality of the circumstances approach mandated by gates,even a completely anonymous tip could support a finding of probable cause with a sufficient degree of corroboration.the degree of corroboration required for a finding of reasonable suspicion is obviously less.white,at.
the supreme court discussed reasonable suspicion based on tips by anonymous informants in two cases alabama white,d and florida,d.theses cases represent two poles on the spectrum of the degree of corroboration needed and formed the framework for the district court analysis.the district court in the instant case followed,in which the police received a completely anonymous tip that a young black man in a plaid shirt at a particular bus stop had a gun.at.there the supreme court held that the anonymous tip,plus corroboration of the fact that a black man with a plaid shirt was at the bus stop,did not constitute reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the man.id.at.in white,on the other hand,a completely anonymous informant told the police that the suspect would leave a particular apartment at a particular time and drive to a particular destination in a particular car carrying drugs.at.the police observed that the suspect leave the apartment building,get in the car and drive in the direction of the destination before stopping her.id.the court called it a close case,but held that because the tip predicted with specificity the future movements of a third party,there was reasonable suspicion.id.at.in this case the district court distinguished white because here the police did not corroborate
