cruz roberto ramos gonzlez ramos appeals his conviction for possession with intent to distribute in excess of grams of cocaine.see a,b b.among other claims of error,ramos contends that his sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated when the district court allowed a forensic chemist to testify regarding the results of a drug analysis that he did not conduct.recent confrontation clause jurisprudence compels us to agree.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial consistent with this decision.
background 
in july,while on routine traffic patrol in caguas,puerto rico,transit police officers wanda vlez mojica vlez and javier reyes flores reyes attempted to stop a pickup truck with unlawfully tinted windows.the driver refused to yield,and a chase ensued.although the officers were able to forcibly stop the vehicle,the driver fled on foot and managed to elude capture.upon closer inspection of the abandoned truck interior,vlez identified two blocks of a substance that she believed to be drugs,and the blocks were taken to the puerto rico transit police station in caguas caguas station for analysis.
at the caguas station,an agent from the drug and narcotics division,juan santana rodriguez,conducted a field test of the blocks.neither vlez nor reyes participated in the field test,and there is no evidence that it was observed by any other officer.the two blocks were subsequently transferred to the puerto rico forensic science institute the institute,where they purportedly tested positive for cocaine.
the institute chemist who analyzed the seized substance,jos borrero,was initially listed as a prosecution witness however,due to mental illness and related treatment,he was unavailable to testify regarding his analysis.thus,three days before the trial commenced,the government amended its witness list to substitute kelvin morales coln morales,another chemist at the institute,for borrero.despite the substitution,the witness description remained unchanged,identifying morales as an expert who would testify b ased on his specialized training and experience in the examination and analysis of controlled substances including the methodology used to examine the drugs seized from the pickup,and the conclusions reached based on his expertise and examination of the substances.
at trial,neither vlez nor reyes testified definitively as to the contents of the blocks.vlez,who was at the caguas station but not in the room when the blocks were analyzed,stated that she believe d they tested positive for cocaine.reyes only testimony that the seized blocks were cocaine was his statement memorializing the incident,which he read into the record.in the statement,he reported that rodriguez had performed a field test on the evidence which yielded a positive result for cocaine.reyes did not testify,however,that he was present when the field test was performed,and rodriguez himself did not testify at trial.
the government then called morales,as its expert witness,to testify regarding the composition of the seized substance.after outlining the institute intake and chain of custody procedures,morales began to discuss the results of borrero test.defense counsel objected on the basis that morales had no personal knowledge of the underlying analysis,but the trial court determined that,based on morales experience and familiarity with official,he should be allowed to testify as to the veracity of this particular test.morales in fact had no involvement in testing the seized substance,and was no longer working in borrero department when the testing occurred.
morales confirmed that the evidence envelope entered by the government bore the signature of his colleague jos borrero,which he recognized from their years of working together.based on the envelope unique number,morales explained that the analyzed substance was that which had been seized by reyes and delivered to the institute by rodriguez,and that it was evidence in a matter involving ramos.he verified that the information on the evidence envelope matched the results reported in borrero certificate of analysis,and when questioned about those results,provided the following testimony 
prosecutor do you know the results of i sorry.looking at the envelope here,can you say what are the results of this test that was conducted 
morales both bricks were positive for cocaine,and had a combined weight of grams,including its wrapping in the plastic.
no further evidence was introduced at trial to prove that the blocks seized from the truck contained cocaine.
ramos was ultimately convicted by a jury and sentenced to months in prison.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we first address the appropriate standard of review for the sixth amendment claim.the government argues that because ramos did not specifically invoke the sixth amendment in his objection,he failed to preserve a cognizable confrontation clause challenge.see united states mercado,cir a n objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.accordingly,the government contends that the district court ruling should be reviewed for plain error.see united states ziskind,cir.we disagree.defense counsel alerted both the court and the government to the basis of his objection,asserting 
i originally thought morales was the chemist who conducted the analysis of these controlled substances,but i believe he is not.it was borrero.so i object to the fact that he has no personal knowledge of the test being conducted.
emphasis added.in context,it was clear that counsel was objecting to the inability to confront the declarant.see united states cabrera rivera,cir.his precise language,which may best be understood as a reference to an objection on confrontation grounds,sufficiently raised the sixth amendment issue,and we therefore review the challenge de novo.id.if ramos sixth amendment rights have been violated,his conviction must be vacated unless the government demonstrates that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.citing united states earle,cir.
confrontation clause challenge 
ramos contends that morales testimony regarding the substance of borrero report was barred by the sixth amendment,as construed in crawford washington,and melendez diaz massachusetts.given the evolving foundation upon which this claim rests,we first review briefly the current state of the supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence.
the sixth amendment guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him const.amend.vi.in crawford,which effected a shift in confrontation clause doctrine,the supreme court established a new constitutional baseline admitting testimonial of a witness not present at trial comports with the sixth amendment only where the declarant is unavailable,and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to the declarant.at.subsequently,in melendez diaz,the court held that certificates of analysis,like the report prepared by borrero here,are appropriately classified as testimonial statements for purposes of the sixth amendment.at.thus,the admission of such a report,for the truth of its contents,necessitates accompanying live testimony by a competent witness.id.
in a decision which the argument in this case,the court further clarified in bullcoming new mexico,that where a certified forensic lab report is introduced as substantive evidence,the surrogate testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification does not satisfy the accused right to confrontation.id.at.thus,where a testimonial certified forensic lab report is offered for its truth as evidence in a criminal prosecution,the accused has at least the right to confront the scientist who performed,observed,or supervised the analysis.
these supreme court cases are instructive,but they do not squarely address an issue that must be explored in this case the extent to which the sixth amendment permits an expert witness to disclose the substance of a previously unadmitted forensic lab report that he did not
