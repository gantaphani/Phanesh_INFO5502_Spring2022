on may,a jury found defendant guilty of one count of attempted coercion and enticement of a minor in violation of b.the district court sentenced defendant to months imprisonment and lifetime supervised release.defendant timely filed a notice of appeal.
on appeal,defendant contends that the district court made four reversible errors by improperly refusing to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the purportedly unlawful searches of defendant vehicle violating rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure by failing to inform defendant counsel of its jury instructions prior to closing arguments improperly instructing the jury as to the meaning of induce in b and improperly holding that the government produced sufficient evidence to sustain defendant conviction.we disagree with all of defendant contentions.
defendant first asserts that the district court erred in denying defendant motion to suppress evidence obtained through the inventory search and subsequent warrant search of his vehicle.in particular,defendant argues that the inventory search violated the fourth amendment and that the evidence obtained through the warrant search including lubrication,condoms,and a bag of candy should be suppressed because law enforcement officers secured the warrant based on information obtained during the allegedly unconstitutional inventory search.
