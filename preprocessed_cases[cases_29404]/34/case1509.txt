makia smith smith or appellant sued the baltimore city police department bcpd and several individual officers pursuant to and maryland law.smith claimed two officers battered and unlawfully arrested her after they saw her filming them as they arrested a juvenile.at trial,the district court allowed defense counsel to elicit testimony that smith had been arrested three times before.the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of the two officers on all counts.
we fail to see how smith prior arrests were relevant to her claim for damages,which was the sole reason the district court admitted them,and any probative value of those arrests was far outweighed by prejudice to smith.the admission of such evidence was prohibited by federal rule of evidence b and was not harmless.therefore,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
officer nathan church of the bcpd testified to the following facts at the trial.on friday,march,just as high school students were being released from school,officer church received a call for to the block of hartford road in baltimore.he arrived to find several juveniles running through the streets and another officer,talmadge jackson,attempting to arrest one of them.when officer church arrived,the juvenile was giving officer jackson a struggle.officer church and several other officers formed a barrier between the public and officer jackson to keep other juveniles from getting close to officer jackson.
meanwhile,officer church heard tires screeching and turned to see multiple vehicles stopped on hartford road.he testified that traffic was stopped moving extremely slowly,and smith car was blocking all the traffic behind her.smith was standing outside of her car with her phone up as if videotaping.officer church,over feet away from smith,yelled,pull your car to the side or keep on going.id.at.smith replied,i not going to let you hurt that young boy.i ai moving i ai moving shit.id.
officer church quickstep ped toward appellant and again told her to move,and she responded,i not moving shit.fuck all.officer church moved closer,told her this was a traffic stop,and asked for her license.smith ran back into her car and sat with her back toward the passenger door,which officer church described as not normal and indicative of someone trying to flee from the scene.id.at.at that point,officer church reached in the car and was trying to grab for her keys,but appellant began kicking him,throwing fists at him,and scratching him.id.at.at one point he was being hit with a n unidentified hard object.id.he placed his right arm on the vehicle and reached in the car with his left arm,just trying to grab her and pull her out of the car.id.she was flailing and office church was keeping his face out of harm way.id.at.officer church succeeded in pulling smith out of the car,but he did not know what he grabbed onto,whether it was her hair or something else.he handcuffed her and began to effect an arrest.pictures of officer church with visible red marks and scratch marks on his arm and neck were admitted into evidence.
smith version of the facts is quite different.according to her,while she was driving with her daughter on hartford road,she saw officer jackson arresting the juvenile and became concerned when she saw the officer knee pressed against his temple.she got out of her vehicle,took the keys out,and pulled her cell phone up as if videoing what the officers were doing.officer church yelled,what are you doing and smith replied,i just trying to make sure that you guys are not hurting that little boy and trying to make sure that he okay.id.at.
at that point,officer church started coming towards the vehicle l ike the incredible hulk,like manny pacquiao in an aggressive manner,and once he got closer to the vehicle,he started running.smith tried to get back in the car,but at that point,she could not have driven anywhere because traffic was still stopped.officer church came over to the car,snatched the phone out of her hand and he kicked it and he stomped it.id.at.he then said,you want to film things,b itch,film this.i should knock your teeth out.id.smith had one foot in the car and tried to get her other foot in the car when officer church took both of his hands and dragged her out of the car by her hair.id.she did not punch,scratch,or kick officer church before he grabbed her hair because that kind of thinking gets you killed,although she admitted to flailing to try and get officer church off of her.id.at.then she felt three or four other people join in but could not really see them.she felt someone hit her in the back of the head and then she just blacked out.id.at.the next thing she remembered is being slammed onto the car and then seeing her daughter crying.another officer,officer campbell,pulled her left arm back and all the way up and said,did you have enough yet do you want me to break it id.at.
as they began to arrest her,smith asked officer church if she could call her mother to come get her baby.officer church taunted,no.child protective services will be here to get your daughter.smith asked a bystander if she could come get her daughter out of the car,and the bystander did so.the officers put smith in the patrol car,and she began yelling out her mother phone number another officer finally gave the bystander her mother phone number.
smith was taken away in the transport vehicle to a central booking station.because she was complaining of head and neck pain,she was taken to a nearby hospital before booking.she was eventually charged with assault of officer church,resisting or interfering with arrest,failing to display a license on demand,willfully disobeying a lawful order of the police,and causing a vehicle to obstruct a free vehicle passage of a roadway.on january,after nearly a year of release obligations,the charges against smith were dropped via a nolle prosequi disposition.
on may,smith filed the instant action in the district of maryland against the bcpd anthony batts,commissioner of the bcpd office church officer campbell and two other officers at the scene,william pilkerton and nathan ulmer collectively,appellees.the operative complaint,amended on october,alleged counts excessive force,deprivation of property without due process,and violations of the first and fourth amendments under violation of attendant rights under the state constitution monell claims against the city and state law claims of conversion,battery,false arrest,false imprisonment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.smith claimed a minimum of million in damages for,inter alia,emotional trauma,humiliation,distress,bodily injury and damage to personal property.
the original district court judge to whom the case was assigned granted summary judgment to officers pilkerton and ulmer on some of the counts and determined the case should be tried in two phases.first the jury would consider claims against officers church and campbell,and then,the monell claims against the city would proceed in a second phase if the jury determined any constitutional harm had occurred.as a result,at the trial underlying this appeal,only five claims proceeded against officer church the first amendment,fourth amendment,excessive force,battery,and false arrest claims and two claims against officer campbell the excessive force and battery claims.
notably,on march,smith filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence or discussion of appellant prior arrests.smith had been arrested three times for second degree assault in,fleeing and eluding in,and second degree assault in no convictions followed any of smith prior arrests.the district court granted the motion on march,explaining,there shall be no reference at trial to appellant prior arrests.id.at.on march,the case was reassigned to a new district court judge and proceeded to trial.
during the trial in march,the following relevant exchanges occurred.first,at a bench conference on march,directly before smith mother testified on her behalf,appellees counsel said,i expect plaintiff counsel to elicit testimony from smith mother of pain and suffering after the event,but one of the motions in limine is that we are not allowed to go into prior arrests.i f plaintiff counsel go es into it,i believe they opened the door.the court explained to smith counsel,i have heard the testimony yet.but be forewarned.it makes sense to me.id.at.
smith mother then testified as follows 
following the incident,makia cried every day.she held onto her daughter and continued to apologize to her for what had happened.you know,she was,i sorry.i did know that was going to happen.i sorry.
she did eat,and at night she would just be up crying in her room crying.
her eyes would practically close where she just continued to cry and be depressed and sad.
id.at.later that day,just before smith testified,smith counsel reiterated at a bench conference that the prior arrests should not come in.the district court explained,
i have tremendous respect for the judge who originally ruled on the motion in limine.he has not heard the evidence.he did hear the mother give overemotional testimony which was shaded with hearsay 
i am letting it in.i think it goes to whether or not she really suffered pain and suffering from this incident.so i letting it in for that reason.
id.at.the court added,i think the original judge is right,you do attack somebody credibility by an arrest and not a conviction,but i letting it in.id.
during appellant testimony that same day,the following exchange took place 
smith every time i see a officer now,i immediately tense up.i remember once my taillight was out and i got pulled over,i was like extremely scared.every time i see anything that goes on on tv,i kind of get upset because i really trusted in the officers.i was raised to respect officers and that they were people that should be respected,and i kind of was let down.
by smith counsel 
had you ever had an interaction like this with an officer before 
not just the baltimore city police department,but anywhere 
q.what you just described,the problems you had,do you still have those problems 
most definitely.
emphasis supplied.
then,during,the following testimony occurred 
by bcpd counsel 
you said you were traumatized by this event is that correct 
i think anybody would be.
okay.and you also testified that you were brought up to have respect for police and now you feel a little different is that correct 
i do feel that they should be respected.i feel like i was let down by them.
q.you also remember when i had an opportunity to speak to you in my office,i asked you,i said this was your first rodeo,was it 
smith counsel objection.
the court let me tell you,it important i think i know where bcpd counsel is going,and i overruling the objection,which is understandable.
if the plaintiff am i right,the rodeo means arrest 
bcpd counsel that correct,your honor.
the court if the plaintiff was arrested and the charges were dismissed,which is,i think,what happened,you ca use an arrest,and it essential that you understand that.you can not use the mere fact of an arrest to judge the plaintiff credibility.that is absolutely essential.
rightly or wrongly,having heard the testimony,i think that since the plaintiff says this has had such an effect on her that the fact of the arrest may be relevant to the amount of damages,if any,that she suffered.so that i letting it in.
but please understand that you can not consider an arrest to judge the plaintiff credibility.that absolutely against the rules,and it a good rule,because they have you know,there has been a trial.and there an objection to this,and that understandable.
smith counsel and in addition to the prior ruling from the original judge that you 
the court he made his ruling,but he had heard the testimony.
smith counsel okay.
by bcpd counsel 
q.when you were in my office,i asked you,i said this was your first rodeo,was it 
smith yes,i have been arrested before.
right.and,matter of fact,when i asked you how many times,you said,two.no,i think three correct 
i think so.
appellees did not ask any further questions about the prior arrests.but on redirect examination,smith counsel asked about the nature of the prior arrests.as to the first second degree assault,smith explained the father of her child sent his girlfriend to beat her up,and she merely defended herself.the second fleeing and eluding occurred when an officer tried to her pull her over,and she kept driving to pull into a lit area,rather than a dark area.the officer arrested her,but when she explained herself,he apologized.finally,as to the third arrest second degree assault,the father of her child showed up in the middle of the night and dragged her baby out of the house in her car seat,threw her out into the grass,and tousl ed appellant around,and again,appellant defended herself.id.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of officers church and campbell on all counts on march,appellant moved for a new trial,raising an unrelated issue,but her request was denied.she then filed this appeal,raising only one issue whether the district court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of appellant prior arrests.
we review the district court evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion.see united states lighty,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs only when the district court acts arbitrarily or irrationally in admitting evidence.united states benkahla,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.such evidentiary rulings are,however,subject to harmless error review.united states johnson,cir.where error is founded on a violation of rule b,the test for harmlessness is whether we can say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states madden,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
this appeal turns on whether the fact that smith was arrested three times before with no evidence that her prior arrests involved a struggle of any kind with police and with no convictions stemming from the arrests makes it more or less probable that she suffered emotional damages in the case at hand,where the police allegedly cursed at her,beat her,and threatened to turn her child over to child protective services.we think not,and indeed,the admission of that fact could easily have tipped the scales in what the district court itself called a tough case that boiled down to a classic,dispute.
federal rule of evidence b prohibits the admission of e vidence of a crime,wrong,or other act to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.fed.evid.b.prior act evidence is admissible,however,to prove motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.fed.evid.b.
we utilize a test to assess admissibility of evidence the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than character,such as intent it must be necessary to prove an element of the claim it must be reliable and its probative value must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial nature.united states,wl,at cir,alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.in her opening brief,smith only questions the relevance and prejudicial nature of the prior arrests,so we limit our discussion to those two issues.
it is well established that a witness,whether a party or not,may not be asked questions as to irrelevant matters on for the purpose of discrediting her.united states chase,cir.generally,r elevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise prohibited by the constitution,the rules of evidence,statutes,or other rules prescribed by the supreme court.fed.evid.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence,and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.fed.evid.a,b.
under rule b,admission of evidence of other bad acts to assist the jury in measuring the extent of damages is a legitimate,use of such evidence.udemba nicoli,cir.citing lewis dist.of columbia,cir.emphasis supplied.but that evidence still must have probative value on the question of damages in the case at hand.nelson city of chicago,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
