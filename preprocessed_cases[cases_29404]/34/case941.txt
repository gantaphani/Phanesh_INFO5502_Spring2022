laval farmer was convicted by a jury in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,of murdering jose angel white and attempting to murder jacquel patterson for the purpose of maintaining or increasing farmer position within the bloods street gang,a,as well as conspiring to assault with a dangerous weapon and discharging firearms during the murder and the attempted murder.at trial,the government elicited testimony that farmer friends and fellow bloods knew him by the nickname murder,an appellation that farmer had acquired years before and that had little,if any,relevance to any contested issue.
farmer nickname,which would be problematical and suggestive in any case involving violent crime,posed a heightened risk of prejudice because the crimes charged included murder and attempted murder.farmer objected to the use of his nickname in the indictment,and he offered to concede identification to avoid its use at trial.but the government declined farmer offer,and the district court admitted the name.thereafter,the prosecution used the nickname promptly,repeatedly,and in ways calculated to intensify the prejudice.
when a defendant charged with a crime of violence is identified before a jury by a nickname that bespeaks guilt,violence,or depravity,the potential for prejudice is obvious.before receiving such evidence over a defendant objection,a trial court should consider seriously whether the probative value is substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice,and whether introduction of the nickname is truly needed to identify the defendant,connect him with the crime,or prove some other matter of significance.even so,a potentially prejudicial nickname should not be used in a manner beyond the scope of its proper admission that invites unfair prejudice.federal rule of evidence a provides with exceptions not applicable here that e vidence of a person character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.it is the ethical obligation of the prosecutor,and the legal obligation of the court,to ensure that this rule is observed.
in this case,the prosecutors,in their addresses to the jury,invited prejudice by repeatedly emphasizing farmer nickname in a manner designed to suggest that he was known by his associates as a murderer and that he acted in accordance with that propensity in carrying out the acts charged in the indictment.this abuse of farmer nickname entitles farmer to a new trial for the attempted murder of patterson and the related firearms offenses.however,we affirm farmer convictions for murdering jose white,discharging a firearm during that offense,and conspiring to assault,because the evidence so overwhelmingly established his guilt respecting those offenses as to nullify any prejudice resulting from the inappropriate argument to the jury.
farmer also argues that his killing of white,a child on a bicycle wearing the wrong color clothing,was so obviously a mistake that no other intent can be reasonably ascribed to the act,and that his attempted killing of patterson,another blood,was so obviously motivated by personal animus that this act likewise can not reasonably be attributed to an intent to increase farmer status as a element of the offense.we conclude that the government introduced sufficient evidence that the murder and attempted murder were committed for the purpose of maintaining or increasing farmer position in the bloods.a.this was shown by the bloods governance and code,the conversations and conduct of farmer and other bloods at and around the time of the crimes,and farmer boasts.
finally,we conclude that farmer is not entitled to relief on the ground that white relatives wore in the courtroom displaying white photograph.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded.
background 
a.the government case 
farmer was convicted for the murder of jose angel white in roosevelt,new york on september,and the attempted murder of jacquel patterson in,pennsylvania on july.the indictment charged that these acts came within the scope of a because farmer committed them for the purpose of maintaining or increasing his status in the bloods street gang,which was a racketeering enterprise.a.
the bloods 
farmer was a member of the velt gangsta lanes vgl of roosevelt,new york,on long island,a subgroup of the larger bloods gang.the vgl was associated with other bloods subgroups on long island.
aspiring members of the bloods were required to commit acts of violence to be eligible for membership.members were initiated by being blessed in vouched for by existing members or jumped in beaten by five bloods for seconds.
bloods operated under a code of loyalty that required members to take on their associates problems as their own.disagreements and grievances were resolved through violence,including stabbing or shooting.the leadership of the vgl promoted gang banging,or beating people up,to represent the neighborhood.
a member gain ed status within the gang by put ting in work,which entailed committing acts of violence,including attacking rival gangs.status was denoted by titles,which ranged upward from baby gangsta to original gangsta,or og.
during and,vgl members met regularly at centennial park and in an abandoned house on hanson place,both in roosevelt,new york.gang members wore specific colors,had gang tattoos,and flashed signs to fellow bloods.
murder of jose angel white 
on the evening of saturday,september,vgl members who gathered at centennial park learned that two vgl members roach and shoke had been hit by a car and beaten with baseball bats by members of the rival crips gang.the vgl members discussed retaliation and dispersed looking for revenge.
later that evening,farmer attended a party in glen cove,new york with fellow blood kashawn jackson.there,farmer spoke with jackson and gregory key,another blood,about the attack on roach and shoke.farmer said that he knew who did it,and the three agreed to t ake a ride out to roosevelt,see the guy who did it.jackson arranged for melissa petrizzo,the girlfriend of a blood,to pick them up in front of a housing project in glen cove.before getting into petrizzo car,farmer asked key if he had a burner a gun key assured him that he did.
once in roosevelt,the group stopped near a convenience store where farmer thought the offending crips might be,but farmer and key did not find them inside.as the two walked back to the car,farmer asked key whether he could carry the gun.key responded,yeah,but if you use it,you have to pay for it.farmer took the gun from key.
back in the car,key asked farmer where a certain crip lived.farmer said he knew,but expected only the crip mother to be home.key suggested that they shoot up the house anyway,because he wanted to increase respect for the bloods and because he needed to repair his status within the gang after having undergone drug rehabilitation in virginia.
petrizzo objected and kept driving,until farmer saw two boys on bicycles,one of them dressed in all blue,as a crip.farmer pointed and said,there they go right there directed petrizzo to pull over and turn off the lights and then got out of the car,took a few steps,and fired three shots at the two boys from a distance of approximately five feet.farmer got back into the car,dropped the gun at key feet,and told petrizzo to drive back to glen cove.
as petrizzo drove away,an ambulance passed going in the other direction.farmer excitedly proclaimed,i got those crabs bloods slang for crips.petrizzo dubiously observed that the victim looked like a little boy,but farmer responded,t hat was a little boy.i knew who it was.
later that afternoon,farmer visited petrizzo and her blood boyfriend,boasted that i got a body,and confirmed to petrizzo that the victim had died.farmer eventually discovered that he had killed jose white,a popular boy who was not a crip.after the shooting,farmer felt like his name may come up,so he had to get out of town.
farmer move from new york and attempted murder of jacquel patterson 
in december,three months after the white shooting,farmer moved to,pennsylvania,where he associated with fellow bloods damion russell and jacquel patterson.russell was a og member of the bloods who had enhanced his status living in california and assumed leadership of the vgl when he returned to new york.russell imposed discipline within vgl ranks and imported traditions.
farmer told russell that he had been driving around with key,jackson,and petrizzo looking for any crip he could see,and boasted that he had avenged the attack on the bloods by shooting a crips.russell suggested that farmer go back to glen cove to make sure the gun was destroyed,which farmer did in december.
in,farmer and his girlfriend stacey moved in with russell,then moved out a few weeks later to live with one of russell friends,khasan dancy,who had a larger house.jacquel patterson and his girlfriend were also living in the house when farmer moved in.farmer,patterson,and dancy sold crack together.
farmer relationship with patterson developed into hostility.russell testified that farmer viewed patterson as soft and weak.one day,when dancy and patterson got into a bar fight with men from philadelphia,farmer stabbed one of the philadelphia men to help out,and became angry when dancy and patterson did not back him up or show appreciation.worse,patterson expressed the view that the vgl was an illegitimate and inferior bloods set,to which farmer and russell took offense.
in july,farmer and patterson bought narcotics from a man named udi,whom farmer greeted with the bloods salute.when udi brushed off the salute and mocked the vgl set,farmer objected,udi drew a gun,and farmer was forced to stand down.patterson gloated at farmer humiliation.furious,farmer visited patterson house,punched cabinets,argued,and discharged his gun.after leaving patterson house,farmer called russell,demanded that he identify himself as a member of the vgl,and told him that he was sick of patterson,that he ca take it no more,and that he was about to give it to him.
farmer and russell agreed to teach patterson a lesson and again visited patterson house.while russell waited in the front doorway of the home,farmer and patterson walked to patterson bedroom.after they entered the bedroom,patterson girlfriend,esther ross,heard the rapid firing of seven to eight gunshots.during the fussilade,ross heard patterson apologize repeatedly and plead for his life.after patterson stopped pleading,ross heard two more shots.patterson suffered gunshot wounds to his body,legs,arms,and face,but survived.
after the shooting,farmer recounted to russell that he followed patterson into the room that patterson moved toward the bed,urging farmer to hold on that farmer started shooting,while patterson apologized repeatedly that when farmer stopped firing,he found a millimeter pistol under the mattress that patterson had been approaching and that farmer retrieved the pistol and used it to shoot patterson in the face.russell gave farmer money and arranged for him to flee to new york.
farmer arrest and statements 
farmer was arrested the day he arrived back in nassau county,july.when the police moved in to arrest farmer,he fled by car,was pulled over,and fled on foot into a house,where he was arrested.during the arrest,a second group of officers found a millimeter pistol in the car.farmer told the nassau county police that he had just arrived from virginia,where he had been living with his girlfriend stacey and doing construction work for the past three or four months that he did not shoot anybody in pennsylvania,that he had no role in the white murder,and that he did not know whose pistol was in the car.
on october,farmer pleaded guilty in state court to possession of the millimeter found in his car at the time of his arrest,which was identified as one of the weapons used in the patterson shooting.
b.the indictment and trial 
farmer was charged in a superseding indictment with conspiracy to assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering,in violation of a count one murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a count two use of a firearm in connection with murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of c count three attempted murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of a count four and use of firearms in connection with attempted murder in aid of racketeering,in violation of c counts five and six.
the jury trial started february,and ended february.the government elicited testimony from numerous lay and law enforcement witnesses.petrizzo testified,pursuant to a cooperation agreement,about driving the car on the night of white murder,the sequence of events leading up to the crime,and farmer inculpatory admissions thereafter.three bloods testified pursuant to cooperation agreements key,who was in the car with farmer on the night of white murder and who supplied the gun russell,whom farmer associated with in and zanne brown,who was a friend of white and who attended the meeting at centennial park on the night of his murder.
kahiem seawright,the friend bicycling with white the night he was murdered,testified to seeing a car pull up and turn off its lights before a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt came out,pulled out a gun,and shot white 
other government witnesses included investigating officers from nassau county and,emergency services workers,and a ballistics expert.
farmer called two witnesses.special agent james langtry was questioned about notes from his interview with key reflecting that key fired the first shots at white.farmer wife,stacey farmer,testified about patterson jealousy of farmer interactions with patterson evidently intended to inject a sexual motive into the conflict between farmer and patterson,and thereby rebut that farmer purpose was to increase his status in the bloods.
farmer moved to strike references to his nickname murder from the indictment.the district court denied the motion,ruling that if the government witnesses and one or more material witnesses have identified him to provide a nickname for the name murder or what have you,they are entitled to use that name in the i ndictment for that limited purpose.the court explained that,to keep the nickname in the indictment,the government would be required to elicit trial testimony from witnesses who knew farmer by that name.farmer then asked that the government avoid referring to him as murder in its questions and that it avoid eliciting testimony in which witnesses might call him murder.farmer stressed that he was the only defendant on trial,that identity was not at issue,and that he would waive any identification requirement to avoid prejudice from use of his nickname.
the district court initially indicated that it would consider precluding testimony mentioning the name murder,but accommodated the government protest and ruled that i f the witness knows this man by the name of murder he can so testify.
at trial,several government witnesses testified to knowing farmer as murder and used the nickname repeatedly in their testimony.similarly,the government used the name in its questions and dozens of times in argument to the jury.
on february,farmer was convicted on all counts.
sentencing 
on june,farmer was sentenced principally to two terms of life imprisonment for the murder and attempted murder counts.farmer was also sentenced to a term of three years imprisonment on the conspiracy count and consecutive terms of years imprisonment for the firearms offenses charged in counts three,five,and six 
discussion 
farmer challenges the sufficiency of the government evidence.we must affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states macpherson,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.united states gaskin,cir.
vicar statute 
farmer was convicted on three counts of violating the violent crimes in aid of racketeering vicar statute,a,which provides,in relevant part 
whoever for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity,murders,kidnaps,maims,assaults with a dangerous weapon,commits assault resulting in serious bodily injury upon,or threatens to commit a crime of violence against any individual in violation of the laws of any state or the united states,or attempts or conspires so to do,shall be punished 
for murder,by death or life imprisonment,or a fine under this title,or both 
for attempting or conspiring to commit a crime involving maiming,assault with a dangerous weapon,or assault resulting in serious bodily injury,by imprisonment for not more than three years or a fine of under sic.this title,or both.
a emphasis added.farmer argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his purpose in shooting white and patterson was maintaining or increasing position in the bloods,the enterprise identified in the indictment.
although section a does not define the phrase for the purpose of maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise,we interpret that phrase by its plain terms,giving the ordinary meaning to its terms.united states dhinsa,cir internal citation omitted.webster defines maintain as to preserve from failure or decline or to sustain against opposition or danger,webster third new international dictionary,and increase as to become greater in some respect listing as examples,size,value,power,authority,reputation and wealth.id.accordingly,section encompasses violent crimes intended to preserve the defendant position in the enterprise or to enhance his reputation and wealth within that enterprise.id.emphases omitted.
dhinsa broadly interpreted the motive requirement,and reject ed any suggestion that the for the purpose of element requires the government to prove that maintaining or increasing position in the enterprise was the defendant sole or principal motive.id.quoting united states concepcion,cir.t he motive requirement is satisfied if the jury could properly infer that the defendant committed his violent crime because he knew it was expected of him by reason of his membership in the enterprise or that he committed it in furtherance of that membership.id.quoting concepcion,at see also united states pimentel,cir.
concepcion,which considered whether a defendant could be liable under for shooting someone other than the intended victim,reject ed the suggestion that the government must prove that the victim of the violence was the defendant intended target,and applied the well established principle that a defendant who planned to murder one person and,in so attempting,killed another is guilty of the murder of the unplanned victim.at.we concluded in concepcion that 
it was sufficient for the government to prove that the defendant,as a member of a n enterprise engaged in racketeering activity,set out to commit a proscribed act of violence in order to maintain or increase his position in the enterprise,and that,in the course of so doing,he committed that act against a person who got in his way.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that farmer sufficiency challenge is foreclosed by these precedents.
conspiracy to assault rival gang members with dangerous weapons count one 
farmer argues that the government introduced no evidence of a conspiracy to use dangerous weapons on the night that white was murdered.although farmer concedes that he set out with key and jackson looking to beat down a crip,he asserts that his fellow bloods did not anticipate using dangerous weapons in the attack.
the government established that on the night of white murder,farmer told key that he knew who attacked their fellow vgl members,and that the men agreed to t ake a ride out to roosevelt,to see the guy who did it.the verb see is surely a euphemism.in any event,before getting into the car,farmer confirmed that key had a gun,and the two men entered a corner store,with the gun,looking for crips to assault.
as they left,farmer borrowed key gun,and key stipulated that farmer would have to replace it if he used it.upon returning to the car,key suggested using the gun to shoot up a crip house farmer instead used the gun to kill white.
farmer focuses on key testimony that key brought the gun for protection.but key could have brought the gun for protection and in anticipation of assaulting a crip if the need or opportunity presented itself.moreover,it is apparent that key contemplated farmer use of the gun,as evidenced by his warning that farmer would have to replace it if he did.based on this evidence,it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that key and farmer conspired to assault crips using key gun a dangerous weapon.
murder of jose white and discharge of a firearm during the offense counts two and three 
farmer argues that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy the vicar statute motivation element as to the murder of jose white.however,the government introduced substantial evidence that the bloods deemed an attack against one blood to be an attack against all,and that bloods could rise within the gang by defending their peers and committing acts of violence against rival gangs.by shooting farmer believed to be one of the crips who had attacked roach and conformed to the expectations of the bloods enterprise.an exultant farmer boasted about the crime to his fellow bloods in the days and months that followed.a reasonable jury could infer from these facts that farmer committed his violent crime because he knew it was expected of him by reason of his membership in the enterprise or that he committed it in furtherance of that membership.dhinsa,at quoting concepcion,at.
farmer argues that the government he and two friends set off on their own to avenge the attack on roach and inconsistent with the depiction of the bloods as a hierarchy,in which authorization to retaliate would come from superiors.but farmer cites no evidence that such authorization was required.to the contrary,the evidence showed that bloods were expected to aid one another without prompting.moreover,the vgl members jointly agreed to seek revenge at the meeting in centennial park on the night of the murder from that,the jury could infer that the attacks were authorized 
farmer also argues that killing an innocent could not serve the interest of the bloods,and that his move to pennsylvania after the crime was evidence that the gang did not condone his actions.in support,farmer cites united states bruno,cir,and united states,jg,wl,at,decisions vacating vicar convictions because of evidence that the killings were against the interests of the defendants enterprises.
however,the question is not whether farmer position in the bloods was advanced in fact by the murder he committed,but whether his purpose in committing the murder was to benefit his position.we held in concepcion that a defendant intent to increase his position in an enterprise can be transferred to an accidental killing.at.in this case,there was ample evidence that farmer intended to kill a crip and initially believed he had,and that at least part of his purpose in doing so was to raise his status in the bloods.
farmer contended at oral argument that notwithstanding concepcion,the motivation element was not satisfied because the killing was so obviously a mistake that it would be irrational to attribute it to his membership in the bloods.but the evidence showed that farmer shot a teenager wearing a crip color,where crips might be found.the blunder does not alter the intent.
as to bruno and,neither decision controls this case because the shootings in those cases did not involve mistaken identity.the defendants in bruno and intended to shoot and did shoot people whose killing could not have enhanced the defendants status.see bruno,at,wl,at.for all of these reasons,we conclude that the government evidence satisfied the requirement of the vicar statute that,in killing white,farmer acted for the purpose of maintaining or increasing his position in a racketeering enterprise.
attempted murder of jacquel patterson and discharge of firearms during the offense counts four,five,and six 
farmer also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that he shot patterson to enhance his position in the bloods.although we reject farmer argument,the patterson shooting presents a closer question.
the government argues that farmer conflict with patterson stemmed from patterson lack of respect for the vgl,and from patterson gloating when farmer was humiliated by udi during a drug transaction.the government posits that farmer grew tired of these insults and that he shot patterson to defend the vgl,to repair his reputation after the accidental killing of white,and to further his standing within the is why farmer took russell with him as a witness.
as farmer points out,the indictment charged farmer with attempting to murder patterson to increase his status in the bloods the government did not charge farmer with acting to enhance his position in the vgl.farmer argues that there was no evidence that shooting patterson could enhance his standing in the bloods because an shooting would not benefit the larger bloods enterprise.farmer points to evidence that bloods subgroups were often closely allied,and that bloods were expected to another.
however,the jury was free to credit testimony that members of the bloods rose in rank within a given set,that actions on behalf of a set could lead to increased status,and that farmer believed shooting patterson to defend the vgl could thus enhance his status within the larger bloods enterprise,the identity of his victim notwithstanding.
second,farmer argues that the patterson shooting was a personal matter,the culmination of months of increasing rancor unconnected to farmer standing or membership in the bloods.however,the government introduced evidence that farmer disagreement with patterson concerned at least in part the honor of the vgl set,and that farmer was enraged by patterson contempt for his subgroup.the government was not required to prove that farmer sole or principal motive was maintaining or increasing his position,dhinsa,at internal quotation marks omitted,so long as it proved that enhancement of status was among his purposes.the government met that burden.
in sum,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict as to all counts,and farmer sufficiency challenge is denied.
farmer challenges the repeated use of his nickname murder in the government presentation of evidence and argument to the jury.
farmer moved to strike his nickname from the indictment.the district court denied the request,explaining that the government was entitled to include the name if it elicited testimony that witnesses knew farmer as murder.farmer then asked that the government and its witnesses refer to him as the defendant.the government opposed the request,and the district court sided with the government.it therefore happened that farmer was called murder throughout the murder trial,with a lot of arch emphasis and many facetious asides.
for example,in the fourth sentence of her opening statement,the first prosecutor stated that laval farmer,known to everyone by his gangster name as murder,murdered ninth grader jose white in cold blood.moments later,describing the night that white was killed,she explained that i n gang life,if members of another gang mess up members of your gang,the rule is that you retaliate.so,murder decided that it was time to take out a crip murder was on the warpath.referring to farmer shooting of patterson,the prosecutor argued that as you might imagine from what happened eight or nine months before,it was murder way to let things go.
in her summation,the second prosecutor asked the jury,now,when opening statements began in this case three weeks ago,you must have been saying to yourself who would do such a thing who would execute a boy simply because he was wearing blue well,allow me to reintroduce you to the defendant.that would be murder.he would do something like this.in the climax of the summation,the prosecutor commented that farmer really tried to prove himself a real gangster,to come up in the gang.you know,maybe live up to his name of murder.
finally,in her rebuttal to farmer closing argument,the first prosecutor used the nickname murder nearly thirty times.she referred to murder on the warpath the day he shot patterson,and argued that i n a word,what happened in pennsylvania was about revenge and power and being a tough gangster.it was about murder living up to his name and his reputation as a blood.the prosecutor closed the government case by admonishing the jury to put the responsibility for these crimes where it belongs and that is with defendant laval farmer,the blood known as murder.
we have ruled on challenges to the use of a defendant nickname in three prior cases.in united states aloi,cir,the prosecution introduced nicknames for several defendants and witnesses,including charlie lamb chops,big vinny,philly rags,and checko brown.we explained that although this prosecution practice is to be condemned,we would not presume prejudice,because both the prosecution and defense had used the criminal backgrounds of witnesses to their advantage and because the epithets occasionally interspersed throughout an trial were insufficient to materially divert the attention of the jury.id.emphasis added.
in united states burton,cir,we considered use of the nickname big time.in burton,the defendant nickname was heard on recorded telephone conversations,and the defendant never moved to strike the nickname from the indictment.id.we held that i n view of the fact that testimony as to the defendant nickname was relevant to the government case and therefore properly before the jury,the prosecutor occasional reference to the defendant by his nickname during the presentation of the government case,while certainly not to be encouraged,was not prejudicial and does not require the grant of a new trial.id.emphasis added.
more recently,in united states mitchell,cir,we considered the government use of the nickname phox.in mitchell,the government had noted in summation that mitchell had outfoxed questions while testifying.id.at brackets omitted.we observed that mitchell identity was not at issue in this case,nor did the admission of the nickname directly relate to the proof of the acts alleged.accordingly,the government references were arguably inappropriate.id.at.we held,however,that the references to mitchell nickname were not prejudicial in view of the fact that they were brief and isolated and in light of the substantial evidence of guilt adduced by the government.id.emphasis added.
our decisions in aloi,burton,and mitchell are consistent with precedents in other circuit courts,which have looked to the relevance of the defendant nickname and the frequency of its use by the prosecution in deciding whether a defendant was prejudiced.see,united states,cir finding no error in including in indictment or admitting testimony of nickname macho gatillo trigger man where nickname was critical to establishing authorship of letter united states delpit,cir permitting use of nickname monster where it was not used to suggest defendant bad character or unsavory proclivities and where it could not be avoided in wiretaps united states black,cir holding that reference to defendant as the jamaican did not warrant reversal where name was not used in prejudicial manner and confidential informant only knew defendant by that name united states smith,cir affirming conviction where nickname boss man was introduced as evidence defendant held a supervisory or managerial role in the enterprise whose members called him boss man.
in assessing the propriety of using a defendant nickname,other courts have also looked to whether the name was necessarily suggestive of a criminal disposition.united states dean,cir holding that the nickname crazy k was not necessarily suggestive of a criminal disposition see also united states,cir noting that t he alias the egg,is similar to the alias red in taylor which that court observed,is no more than a nickname quoting united states taylor,cir.
in united states williams,the seventh circuit vacated a conviction because the prosecution elicited testimony from a police detective that he knew the defendant as fast eddie,cir.the court found that the detective testimony about the defendant nickname was completely unrelated to any of the other proof against the defendant,and t he prosecution only possible purpose in eliciting the testimony was to create an impression in the minds of the jurors that the defendant was known by the police to be an unsavory character or even a criminal.id.at.the prosecution introduction of the nickname was deemed so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.id.at united states clark,cir per curiam holding that where an alias,though proven,holds no relationship to the acts charged,a motion to strike the alias from the indictment may be renewed,the alias stricken and an appropriate instruction given the jury.
in these cases,the suggestiveness of the nickname has not required exclusion,especially when it helped to identify the defendant,connect him to the crime,or prove other relevant matter,or when coherent presentation of the evidence entailed passing reference to it.in determining admissibility,however,the courts also considered whether the nickname probative value was substantially outweighed by its capacity for unfair prejudice.see.dean,at.and even when admission of the nickname was found proper,the courts went on to consider the frequency,context,and character of the use that the prosecution made of it.see mitchell,at burton,at aloi,at.
in this case,it was error for the district court to permit the government to elicit testimony of farmer nickname except for references by witnesses who know him by that name identity was not an issue at trial,and farmer nickname,as a name,had no legitimate relationship to the crimes charged farmer nickname was strongly suggestive of a criminal disposition,dean,at,and a propensity to commit particularly heinous crimes,including the very offenses charged in the indictment.federal rule of evidence a prohibits admission of e vidence of a person character or a trait of character for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.moreover,the district court pretrial ruling imposed no restraint or limitation on the government use of the nickname and nothing was done to mitigate prejudice,such as giving a curative instruction.
but the main problem was not the admission of the nickname into evidence.rather,it was the prosecutors frequently repeated,gratuitous invocation of farmer nickname in their addresses to the jury,uttered in a context that,in effect,invited the jurors to infer that the defendant had earned the nickname among his gang colleagues as a result of his proclivity to commit inference corroborated by the government evidence that he had yielded to that proclivity in the particular instances being tried.this is precisely what rule a was designed to prevent.
even so,the misuse and overuse of farmer nickname would not lead us to vacate a conviction unless the defendant suffered substantial prejudice,by so infecting the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.united states shareef,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and brackets omitted see also united states mercado,cir.moreover,where,as here,the defendant did not object to the remarks at trial,reversal is warranted only where the remarks amounted to a flagrant abuse.united states coriaty,cir quotation marks and brackets omitted see also united states rivera,cir.
in our prior cases,the government use of a defendant nickname was occasional,burton,at aloi,at,or brief and isolated,mitchell,at.but farmer in a manner that offended rule the main rhetorical trope used by the prosecution in its addresses to the jury.this tactical misuse of the nickname,no fewer than thirty times during the rebuttal summation in a presentation that occupies only sixteen transcript pages,amounted to a flagrant abuse.
did the misuse of the nickname cause farmer substantial prejudice one of the relevant considerations is that the district court did nothing to curb the abuse or mitigate the prejudice,despite initially entertaining farmer request that the government avoid use of the nickname in its examination of witnesses.see united states feliciano,cir.however,the determinative factor here is the weight of the evidence.see id.at.farmer guilt respecting the white murder and the conspiracy to assault white was supported by such overwhelming evidence that conviction was a certainty.it was therefore not affected by the government conduct.on the other hand,the evidence supporting farmer guilt for the attempted murder of patterson was far less conclusive.
both the murder of white and conspiracy to assault white were shown with clarity by multiple witnesses who described in detail the sequence of events before,during,and after white murder.key described going with farmer to see the crips who attacked roach and shoke the murder was obviously a misguided act of retaliation.testimony of the witnesses was strongly supported by farmer acts and words after the crime,including his move to and his explanation to russell as to why he was there.ample evidence also showed the operation of the bloods and the role of violence in increasing members status within the enterprise.given the strength of the government evidence,there can be no doubt that farmer would have been convicted on counts one,two,and three even if he had no nickname.
however,our confidence does not extend to farmer conviction for the attempted murder of patterson.nobody witnessed the shooting or what happened in patterson bedroom.the evidence showed that the two men had an ongoing feud,with hatred and contempt on both sides.so it was farmer argued to the patterson initiated an attack against farmer in patterson bedroom,and that farmer acted in.this was supported by farmer account to russell of patterson moving toward the bed where the millimeter firearm was located.
additionally,as discussed in part i,supra,it is not clear whether farmer shot patterson to settle a personal score or to elevate his status within the bloods enterprise.only the latter finding would support a conviction under the vicar statute but the government may have the jury by repeatedly using farmer prejudicial nickname in discussing the patterson shooting.for example,the government argued that murder was the one that was on the warpath that day.in the government narrative of the shooting itself,o ut came murder pistol murder leaves,leaving patterson for dead.in a word,the government suggested,what happened in pennsylvania was about revenge and power and being a tough gangster.it was about murder living up to his name and his reputation as a blood.
the government argues that farmer could not have suffered prejudice because the crimes were so highly charged and gruesome that the nickname could not have had incremental effect.this argument is unsound that the trial evidence was unavoidably inflammatory was no reason for the government to raise the temperature in the courtroom by irrelevant sensation.
