calvin johnson appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on february,after a jury trial in the eastern district of new york nicholas garaufis,judge at which he was found guilty on four counts of distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base crack cocaine,see a,b c one count of distributing or possessing with intent to distribute cocaine,see one count of conspiring to distribute or possess with intent to distribute heroin,see id.b c,and one count of distributing or possessing with intent to distribute heroin,see id.a,b c.sentenced to a term of incarceration,which he is presently serving,three years supervised release,and a special assessment,johnson now seeks reversal of his conviction and a new trial based on two alleged evidentiary errors the admission into evidence of his pretrial proffer statements to rebut trial assertions made by defense counsel,and the admission of expert testimony from a law enforcement officer who also testified as a fact witness.because we conclude that both evidentiary rulings were within the district court discretion,we hereby affirm the judgment of conviction.
factual background 
johnson drug dealing 
from march to the end of that year,law enforcement authorities used a confidential informant and undercover police officers to investigate narcotics trafficking at and in the vicinity of schaefer street,brooklyn.the initial target of the investigation was leotha barrow,also known as petey,from whom confidential informant carvin skidmore made several purchases of crack cocaine in march.by april,however,authorities began to focus on barrow confederate,defendant calvin johnson.at trial,the prosecution proved johnson distribution of drugs,or his possession of drugs with intent to distribute,on the following days 
on april,law enforcement authorities sought to have informant skidmore introduce a new york city undercover officer,detective luis campana,to leotha barrow as a potential purchaser of crack cocaine.to arrange the meeting,skidmore placed an unrecorded telephone call to barrow.detective patricia rodriguez,a member of the investigative team,testified that she overheard skidmore say the name cal in the course of his conversation with barrow 
after the telephone call,skidmore and campana proceeded to schaefer street,a building.campana testified that,in the hallway,they encountered defendant johnson who asked them whom they wanted to see.when campana stated,petey,johnson replied that he was not around and asked the men what they were looking for.trial tr.at.skidmore said he was looking for ten bags,and campana said he was interested in nine.id.skidmore and campana then paid johnson for each bag requested,whereupon johnson went into a room,emerging a few minutes later to hand the two purchasers a total of nineteen ziplock bags,each containing a white rocky substance that laboratory analysis subsequently confirmed to be crack cocaine.
skidmore and campana returned to schaefer street on may.encountering johnson on the street,the informant and the detective told him that they each wanted ten and paid johnson in cash.id.at.johnson pulled a bag out of his pants from which he removed twenty smaller bags,each containing crack cocaine.
three months later,on august,campana went to schaefer street without skidmore,meeting johnson on the stoop.in addition to campana testifying to the meeting,a videotape and audiotape of the encounter were played for the jury initially,johnson professed not to recognize the detective.campana reminded johnson of previous purchases of crack that he had made in the company of carvin skidmore,and he stated that he was now interested in purchasing another ten.id.at.before proceeding,johnson demanded that the officer lift his shirt,presumably to check that he was not wearing a recording device.apparently satisfied,johnson sold campana ten ziplock bags of crack cocaine.
soon thereafter,on august,campana returned to schaefer street,with fellow officers again video and audiotaping his outdoor movements.seeing johnson on the street in the company of several persons,campana called out,cal.johnson replied by asking campana how many he wanted.trial tr.at.soon thereafter,campana gave johnson,whereupon johnson gave the detective ten ziplock bags of crack cocaine.
on december,new york city undercover detective deanna delesbore went to the corner of knickerbocker and schaefer streets where she spotted calvin johnson,who was soon joined by another man.delesbore asked if they had any sniff,a street term for heroin or cocaine.id.at.the second man said he did not have anything there but asked delesbore to wait.johnson and his companion got into a car driven by a third person and left the scene.returning a short while later,the second man gestured for delesbore to deal with johnson,who,in exchange for,sold her two glassine envelopes with small grains of powder that laboratory analysis confirmed to be heroin.
at about the same time,another undercover officer,detective antoine manson,also approached the corner of knickerbocker and schaefer streets and purchased a glassine envelope of heroin grains from johnson.soon thereafter,johnson was arrested.on his person,police officers found a small quantity of cocaine and several hundred dollars in cash,including buy money from the undercover purchases.
b.the federal charges and the proffer agreement 
within days of johnson arrest,federal authorities decided to prosecute johnson and leotha barrow for crack dealing.a complaint filed december,in the eastern district of new york alleged that barrow had sold crack to a confidential informant on march,march,and april.it alleged that johnson had sold crack to an undercover officer on april,and to a confidential informant on april.the complaint further charged that on may,after the confidential informant and the undercover officer spoke with leotha barrow,they met with johnson who sold them crack.it alleged that johnson again sold crack to the undercover officer on august,and on august.
a federal indictment was filed against johnson and leotha barrow on march,charging them with conspiracy to distribute crack and substantive distribution on the aforementioned dates the following month,johnson began to explore cooperation with prosecutors.
toward that end,on april,johnson signed a proffer agreement,which controlled his debriefing on that day.he signed additional agreements,identical in pertinent part,at subsequent debriefings on may,and june.the agreements uniformly represented that federal prosecutors would not use any proffer statements made by johnson either in their at trial or at sentencing.nevertheless,the agreements stated that prosecutors could use johnson proffer statements as leads to other evidence as substantive evidence to him and as substantive evidence to rebut any evidence offered or elicited,or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of johnson at any stage of a criminal prosecution including but not limited to detention hearing,trial or sentencing.proffer agreement,at see also proffer agreement,may,at proffer agreement,june,at.it is the quoted passage that is at issue on this appeal.
c.the use of proffer statements at trial 
by letter dated june,johnson counsel,who also represents him on this appeal,advised prosecutors that his client no longer wished to pursue cooperation.in late october,when johnson case proceeded to trial,an issue arose as to the admissibility of johnson proffer statements to rebut assertions made by his counsel in his opening statement to the jury and in his of campana.
the precipitating actions by defense counsel 
in his opening statement,johnson counsel announced that the defense theory was mistaken identity i want to be very clear with you at the outset,what the defense position is as to the first four sales,the crack sales and that is,that this is a case of mistaken identity.trial tr.at.in support of this theory,defense counsel stated that leotha barrow brother jamal was the real perpetrator of the charged crimes 
t he guy on that tape,on august,is not calvin johnson but jamal barrow,and the person who sold drugs to the undercover agent april,was not calvin johnson,it was jamal barrow,the same person who is on that tape.and on may it was jamal barrow not calvin johnson,the same person who is on the august tape.
and that the person who also sold not only on august,but also,august to the same undercover.
in campana,defense counsel not only highlighted various discrepancies between the officer testimony regarding the april,crack sale and his official report,he accused campana of fabricating his meeting with the confidential informant at schaefer street on that date you made up about meeting the there that day,did you trial tr.at.
the arguments and the ruling on admissibility 
the government argued that it was entitled to rebut the assertions made by counsel in his opening statement and on with proffer statements by johnson admitting that he routinely sold crack at schaefer street in.in response,defense counsel conceded that johnson admitted that he sold crack out of schaffer sic street.id.at.but,h e did not admit,my recollection is,that he sold on any of the occasions presently charged in the indictment id.the government submitted that counsel distinction was disingenuous because at the time of the proffer statements,johnson had the complaint,which charged specifically the dates and in detail the transactions that occurred at schaffer sic street.he also had the indictment,which charged him on the specific dates that we are now hearing testimony about.id.at.in any event,the government argued that one statement by barrow could fairly be construed as an admission to the charged april,crack sale.
johnson related that leotha barrow was responsible for johnson arrest.johnson recalled that carvin skidmore called barrow asking for ten bags of crack cocaine.since barrow did not have the ten bags he sent skidmore to johnson who sold skidmore the crack.government will argue on summation that specific reference relates to the april sale,which the undercover already testified about and defense counsel lind elicited on i believe from detective rodriguez,that carvin skidmore made a call that day to purchase ten bags of crack cocaine,that when the undercover arrived at schaffer sic that undercover asked,hey,we are looking for petey,which is the codefenda n t,barrow,nickname.instead,johnson sold the crack to both skidmore and the undercover officer.that a specific reference to the sale here,your honor.
the district court ruled that defense counsel assertions were fairly rebutted by evidence of johnson proffer statements that he sold crack cocaine from that location during the same period of time,although the court advised defense counsel that he could certainly argue to the jury that the admissions did not relate to the specific dates charged in the indictment.id.at 
the proffer statements offered in evidence 
elizabeth,a special agent with the drug enforcement administration,testified at trial to statements made by johnson at the various proffer sessions she stated that johnson disclosed that i n early he returned to new york from north carolina and began selling narcotics in the vicinity of schaffer sic.id.at johnson reported that i nitially,he sold heroin,but because crack was more profitable,he soon started selling that drug.id.johnson explained that,for a time,he and leotha barrow sold crack together,but because his sales exceeded barrow,johnson decided to operate on his own.agent testified that johnson blamed barrow for his arrest because there was one occasion where authorities sent an informant to purchase crack from barrow,barrow did have any,barrow directed the informant to go to the defendant and the informant did that and purchased crack cocaine.id.agent further stated that,in the course of the debriefings,johnson admitted that his nickname was cal and identified the informant to whom he sold drugs as carvin skidmore.id.at.at no point in the debriefings did johnson mention the name jamal barrow,nor did he ever tell authorities that they had the wrong man.id.at.
ii.discussion 
a.the admission of johnson proffer.the rule exception to admissibility 
johnson asserts that the admission of his proffer statements into evidence violated rule of the federal rules of evidence.that rule states,in pertinent part 
except as otherwise provided in this rule,evidence of the following is not,in any civil or criminal proceeding,admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions 
a plea of guilty which was later withdrawn 
a plea of nolo contendere 
any statement made in the course of any proceedings under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure or comparable state procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas or 
any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.
emphasis added see also.f the admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea,a plea discussion,and any related statement is governed by federal rule of evidence.the underlying purpose of rule is to promote plea negotiations by permitting defendants to talk to prosecutors without sacrificing their ability to defend themselves if no disposition agreement is reached.see.advisory committee note.statements made by defendants in proffer sessions are covered by rule.see united states velez,cir.
because rule is an exception to the general principle that all relevant evidence is admissible at trial,see,its limitations are not to be read broadly,see united states griffith,cir narrowly construing,which limits admissibility of defendant statements to officer.moreover,its protections are waivable.see united states mezzanatto,d holding that rule,in effect,creates a privilege of the defendant,and,like other evidentiary privileges,this one may be waived or varied at the defendant request quoting weinstein berger,weinstein evidence,at accord united states velez,at approving broad waiver similar to the one here at issue united states rebbe,cir united states krilich,cir.because johnson conditionally waived the protections of rule in his proffer agreement,our focus on this appeal is on the construction of that waiver.
johnson proffer agreement waiver 
the waiver provision here at issue permits the government to use johnson proffer statements to rebut any evidence offered or elicited,or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of him at any stage of a criminal prosecution.johnson does not challenge the validity of this proffer agreement waiver.see united states mezzanatto,at.holding that absent some affirmative indication that the agreement was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily,an agreement to waive the exclusionary provisions of rule is valid and enforceable accord united states velez,at holding that waiver of rule protection does not violate defendant right to present a defense,to the assistance of counsel,or to a fair trial,because a defendant remains free to present evidence inconsistent with his proffer statements,with the fair consequence that,if he does,the government is then permitted to present the defendant own words in rebuttal quoting united states gomez,d.nor does he complain because his proffer statements were admitted in the government rather than in its rebuttal case.see united states mezzanatto,at.ginsburg,concurring,with and breyer,jj.questioning whether use of proffer statements in government might more severely undermine a defendant incentive to negotiate,and thereby inhibit plea bargaining instead,johnson submits that the district court erred in concluding that his counsel trial conduct triggered the waiver clause of his proffer agreement.he insists that only a specific or direct contradiction between his proffer statement and an assertion by counsel has this effect.see appellant reply br.at.we disagree.
in considering johnson argument,we engage in a analysis.we first look at the terms of his proffer agreement waiver to see if it is fairly construed as narrowly as johnson urges.the agreement is,after all,a contract that must be interpreted to give effect to the intent of the parties.see united states liranzo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the interpretation of a contract is generally a question of law,we review this first issue de novo.accord rubens mason,cir.if we conclude that the proffer agreement waiver does apply in this case,our second step is to review for abuse of discretion the district court evidentiary rulings admitting particular parts of johnson proffer statements,see old chief united states,d accord united states schultz,cir,cert.denied,d,and we will not reverse unless an error affects a substantial right.a.an evidentiary error affects substantial rights only if we conclude that it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.united states dukagjini,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the proffer agreement waiver is not limited to direct contradictions but extends to any proffer statement that fairly rebuts a factual assertion made on johnson behalf 
where the language of a contract is unambiguous,the parties intent is discerned from the four corners of their agreement.united states liranzo,at and cases cited therein accord eternity global master fund morgan guar.trust of,cir.the proffer agreement here at issue uses unambiguous language to identify the conduct that can trigger waiver the offer of any evidence or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of johnson the purpose for which the waiver permits use of proffer statements to rebut and the proceedings at which the waiver is applicable any stage of a criminal prosecution.because johnson argument does not depend on the last phrase,we focus our discussion on the first two.
the factual assertions triggering waiver 
the waiver triggering language unambiguously expresses the parties intent to create an expansive waiver,applying to any evidence,whether offered directly or elicited on.see generally department of hous.urban dev.rucker,d noting that when used in a statute,the word any has an expansive meaning quoting united states gonzales,d.further indicative of the parties expansive intent is their extension of the waiver beyond formally admitted evidence to any factual assertions made by johnson or on his behalf at any stage of the prosecution.see collazos united states,cir w hen,as here,the two words at issue are connected by or rather than and,and when no commas set off the second word to suggest that it stands in apposition to the first,we construe the disjunctive words to convey different meanings.factual assertions made by a defendant counsel in an opening argument or on plainly fall within this broad language 
the mere fact that a defendant pleads not guilty and stands trial is not a factual assertion that triggers the proffer agreement waiver,and the government certainly does not contend otherwise.see united states krilich,at.nor are defense arguments that attempt to demonstrate why the facts put in evidence by the prosecution are insufficient to permit the jury to find the elements of the crime proved.thus,a defense argument that simply challenged the sufficiency of government proof on elements such as knowledge,intent,identity,would not trigger the waiver here at issue.on the other hand,a statement of fact in a defense opening,such as the statement in this case unequivocally identifying jamal barrow as the real perpetrator of the charged crimes,does qualify as a factual assertion within the four corners of the waiver provision.thus,we conclude that the waiver factual assertion requirement was satisfied in this case.
we note,however,that such a conclusion may not be reached so easily when counsel arguments or questions assert facts implicitly rather than directly.for example,a question challenging a witness perception or recollection of an event does not necessarily imply that the event did not occur,only that the witness may not have seen or reported it accurately.on the other hand,a question accusing a witness of fabricating an event,such as counsel in this case put to campana with respect to the april,meeting with the confidential informant,does implicitly assert that no such meeting ever took place.thus,when confronted with a government argument that a defense opening or implicitly satisfies the factual assertion requirement for waiver,a district court may well have to consider carefully what fact,if any,has actually been implied to the jury before deciding whether proffer statements fairly rebut it.
we further note that even when a district court is satisfied that a factual assertion triggering a rule waiver has been made,whether directly or implicitly,that conclusion does not mandate receipt of the proffer statements in evidence.a waiver agreement between the parties does not divest a district court of its considerable discretion to exclude relevant evidence that may inject unfair prejudice or confusion into the jury resolution of the issues in dispute.see,united states flaharty,cir.thus a court may well view a factual assertion made by counsel at sentencing,where parties frequently proceed by proffer,see,united states dillon,cir united states mayberry,cir united states marmolejo,cir,differently from the same assertion made in an opening statement or a question to a trial witness.counsels questions and arguments at trial are not,after all,evidence,see united states arboleda,cir see also leonard sand et,modern federal jury instructions,instruction t he question of a lawyer is not to be considered by you as evidence arguments by lawyers are not evidence,because the lawyers are not witnesses,and district courts may,in appropriate cases,decide to strike a question or argument,instructing the jury to ignore the factual assertion stated or implied,rather than admit defendant proffer statements in rebuttal.the exercise of such discretion necessarily depends on the district court unique insights into trial dynamics and into the impact the assertions at issue have had on the jury.for example,a district court might exercise its discretion to exclude proffer statements when it concludes that a factual assertion was inadvertently and only briefly interjected into the proceedings,and counsel agrees not to pursue the matter further.united states sampson,cir a defendant may completely forestall the admission of other act evidence on the issue of intent by expressing a decision not to dispute that issue with sufficient clarity alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
that,however,is not this case.the factual assertion implied by defense counsel the undercover officer had fabricated,in whole or in part,events underlying the april,the unequivocal factual assertion in the opening statement that jamal barrow was the real perpetrator of the charged crimes.under these circumstances,the district court had no reason to pursue alternatives to the introduction of the proffer statements.it properly concluded that johnson counsel had triggered the factual assertion requirement for waiver.
the permissible scope of rebuttal 
where evidence has been adduced or the requisite factual assertions made,the waiver provision states that the single purpose for which the defendant proffer statement may be used is to rebut.the word rebut has a common meaning,which is certainly well understood by trial courts and trial lawyers.to rebut means to contradict,meet,or oppose by formal legal argument,plea,or countervailing proof.webster third new international dictionary unabridged.black law dictionary ed,defines the term as t o refute,oppose,or counteract something by evidence,argument,or contrary proof.
while direct contradiction certainly falls within the scope of these definitions,it is not the only means by which evidence or assertions may be refuted,opposed,or counteracted.as we observed in united states hiss,what is within the scope of permissible contradiction is largely a matter of avoiding confusion of issues,and as such should be left to the discretion of the trial judge,cir.indeed,precisely because rebuttal is necessarily a flexible concept and because trial judges are uniquely situated to assess the impact certain evidence or arguments have made on a jury,we are disinclined to overturn a district judge,who has watching a case testimony properly rebuts an inference that a party adversary has sought to make.united states tejada,cir accord united states casamento,cir see also fdic suna,cir.
case law confirms that proper rebuttal is not limited to direct contradiction.in united states casamento,a defendant testified that he worked as a precious stones broker,thereby implicitly den ying that he had any connection to the charged narcotics trafficking.at.to rebut this implication,the trial judge allowed the prosecution to offer evidence that defendant name and telephone number had been found on a person from whom officers seized six kilograms of cocaine.although the seized evidence did not directly contradict defendant testimony as to his employment,we affirmed,ruling that linking the defendant to a drug trafficker who clearly was involved both in importing activities and drug trafficking,was proper rebuttal.id.
other cases similarly admit rebuttal evidence involving no direct contradiction.in united states ruffin,cir,a tax evasion case,we affirmed the district court decision to admit evidence showing that certain corporate expenditures had been used to buy defendant a mortgage.although the evidence did not directly contradict any particular proof,we concluded that it did rebut directly ruffin defense of insubstantial tax liability.id.at.in united states bari,cir,we ruled that an opening statement suggesting that defendant injuries rendered his charged attempted escape improbable opened the door to rebuttal evidence of a,therefore,not directly attempt defendant made while suffering from a different physical disability.in united states khan,cir,a drug smuggling case in which defense counsel told the jury that it would hear no evidence of defendant s wealth,we approved expert testimony about how inexpensively heroin could be purchased in pakistan.plainly,the evidence did not rebut the argument that defendant was not a wealthy man,but it did rebut the inference that a lack of means would have prevented him from committing the charged crime.id.finally,in united states kusek,cir,another drug case,defense counsel opened by alluding to a large cash seizure from his client home and stated that his client owned a restaurant that generated large sums of cash the district court concluded that this suggestion of a legitimate source for the money was properly rebutted with evidence of defendant disavowal of any knowledge of the seized cash,although the latter statement certainly did not disprove defendant restaurant ownership.
this precedent demonstrates that rebuttal is hardly limited to evidence that directly contradicts what it opposes rather,rebuttal encompasses any evidence that the trial judge concludes fairly counters and casts doubt on the truthfulness of factual assertions advanced,whether directly or implicitly,by an adversary.we must assume that when the parties in this case signed a proffer agreement with a waiver provision that used the word rebut,they intended that word to bear this commonly understood meaning.see krumme westpoint stevens,cir observing that the words and phrases used by the parties must,as in all cases involving contract interpretation,be given their plain meaning internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we reject johnson argument that the district court was obliged to construe his waiver to apply only to proffer statements that directly contradicted his counsel factual assertions.once defense counsel factual assertions in opening and triggered the proffer agreement waiver of rule,the district court enjoyed the same broad discretion to admit johnson proffer statements that it would have with respect to any other rebuttal evidence.
b.the district court admission of johnson proffer statements 
because we conclude that there was no legal error in the interpretation of the waiver agreement in this case,we review the district court evidentiary rulings admitting particular proffer statements to rebut defense counsel factual assertions only for abuse of discretion.see united states schultz,at united states tejada,at.
focusing first on those statements received with respect to johnson crack dealing,we conclude that,even if johnson failure to reference dates in his proffer statements precludes a finding of direct contradiction between these statements and counsel factual assertions,common sense nevertheless compels the conclusion that these proffer statements and the circumstances surrounding their making cast serious doubt on the truth of counsel assertion that jamal barrow was the real perpetrator of the charged crimes and that campana fabricated the events of april.when johnson voluntarily sat down for three proffer sessions with the federal authorities who were prosecuting him for crack trafficking,he knew the exact dates,places,and general circumstances pertaining to each charged sale.under these circumstances,it is unlikely in the extreme that,when he admitted regular crack trafficking at the locations charged throughout the time charged,he was referring to sales other than those specified in the complaint and first superseding indictment.certainly,at no time during the proffer sessions did johnson ever state that his admissions pertained to dates other than those charged.nor did he ever suggest that someone else was responsible for the charged crack sales.to the contrary,he attributed his arrest to events that paralleled those involved in the april,charge moreover,although his proffer statement identifies a host of other persons involved in drug trafficking,he never mentioned jamal barrow because the proffer statements thus fairly and convincingly cast doubt on the truthfulness of counsel assertions that jamal barrow,and not calvin johnson,had committed each and every one of the charged crack crimes,and that the events of april,were fabricated by the undercover officer,we conclude that the district court acted well within its discretion in admitting johnson proffer statements to rebut counsel factual assertions.
johnson attempts to draw a distinction between prosecution questions eliciting what he actually said in his proffer statements and those eliciting what he did not say.we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in allowing both.omissions from johnson proffer statements enjoy no fifth amendment protection.unlike an arrestee who has a right to remain silent and who has ordinarily been advised of this right,see doyle ohio,d united states hale,d,johnson voluntarily agreed to speak with government officials in pursuit of a possible cooperation agreement.he understood that the purpose of his proffer sessions was for him fully to disclose his own drug dealing as well as that of other persons known to him.under these circumstances,a jury could fairly infer that the accused would be more likely than not to dispute an untrue accusation,united states hale,at,and that johnson failure to disavow drug dealing on the charged dates,or to attribute those crimes to jamal barrow,could reasonably be understood as an admission to the charged crimes.in sum,what johnson failed to say in the proffer sessions was properly received in evidence because it reinforced the conclusion that what he did say rebutted his attorney trial assertions.see anderson charles,d per curiam holding that impeachment with prior inconsistent statements may highlight omission of certain facts from defendant earlier version of events united states strother,cir holding that memorandum omitting fact to which witness testified at trial should have been admitted as an inconsistent statement because i t would have been natural for the witness to include the fact in the memorandum.
in testifying to johnson statements about crack trafficking,dea agent volunteered that johnson also admitted selling heroin,a statement not previously approved by the district court.johnson objected at trial to all of the government proffer statement evidence,but he did not then cite the heroin testimony as especially problematic.nonetheless he points to this conduct on appeal as illustrative of prosecution.the argument warrants little discussion.at trial,johnson virtually conceded the charged heroin sale,seemingly ridiculing the prosecution for pursuing a trivial transact
