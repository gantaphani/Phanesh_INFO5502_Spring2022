a federal grand jury indicted michael hampton on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,in violation of g and a.the charge arose from the seizure of a pistol from hampton pants pocket by law enforcement officers who effected a traffic stop of a vehicle in which hampton had been a back seat passenger.hampton moved to suppress the firearm and,after a suppression hearing,the district court denied the motion.hampton was convicted by a jury after a trial.the district court imposed a sentence of months incarceration.
upon this timely appeal,hampton challenges both his conviction and his sentence.first,he contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress,insisting that the officer violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures when he ordered hampton to get out of the vehicle.second,he contends that the district court erred in calculating his advisory sentencing guidelines range in three ways by applying a enhancement to his base offense level pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual c dealing with assault on a law enforcement officer by applying a enhancement pursuant to b dealing with possession of a firearm in connection with a felony offense and by impermissibly double counting the two enhancements under c and b.for the reasons set forth below,we reject all of hampton contentions and affirm the judgment.
on july,hampton was the backseat passenger in a red honda automobile.deputy sheriff gerald atkinson of richland county,south carolina effected a traffic stop of the honda for a broken tail light after following and observing the vehicle for a short distance.two other deputies who were in the area,deputies warren cavanaugh and joseph andaloro,arrived as.atkinson approached the car,obtained the operator license and registration,and returned to his vehicle.during this time,the other deputies noticed that the backseat passenger,hampton,was sweating profusely,moving around,and exhibiting signs of nervousness.
having learned that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for the driver of the honda,atkinson returned to the vehicle and placed the driver under arrest.at about the same time,one of the deputies ordered hampton to exit the vehicle.as he climbed out,and after a brief verbal exchange with one of the deputies,hampton shoved cavanagh in the chest and fled from the scene.the deputies chased hampton,and cavanagh was the first to catch up to him.hampton struggled and was able to throw cavanagh off of him.atkinson then tackled hampton and held him to the ground.at this point,hampton was face down on the ground with atkinson on top of him.atkinson provided several instructions to hampton to put his hands behind his back,but hampton continued to struggle and to make multiple attempts to retrieve something from his pocket.atkinson then used his taser on hampton in an effort to subdue him.after using the taser,atkinson was able to place one of hampton hands in the handcuffs,but while he did so,hampton was able to work his other hand underneath his chest.at that point,atkinson again used the taser on hampton.atkinson was then able to fully handcuff hampton and pat him down.the search revealed a fully loaded taurus caliber revolver in hampton back pants pocket,a bag containing marijuana,and digital scales.in the course of his attempts to control hampton,deputy atkinson injured his rotator cuff and the ligament in his shoulder,which required medical attention and six weeks of physical therapy.
hampton was indicted in one count for violations of g and a,felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.he filed a pretrial motion to suppress.after an evidentiary hearing,at which limited video and audio recordings of the encounter at the traffic stop were presented,the district court found that,under maryland wilson,the deputies permissibly ordered hampton to step out of the honda.furthermore,the district court found,albeit only implicitly,that when hampton shoved deputy cavanagh,there arose probable cause for hampton arrest.therefore,the firearm was constitutionally seized,and the court denied the motion to suppress.hampton proceeded to trial before a jury and was convicted.
at the sentencing hearing,the presentence report psr revealed that hampton record of prior convictions exposed him to sentencing as an armed career criminal and a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration for months and a maximum of life.under the advisory sentencing guidelines,hampton base offense level was determined to be.he received a enhancement pursuant to b because the firearm he possessed was stolen.over hampton timely objection,the district court adopted the psr recommendation and applied a enhancement pursuant to c,finding that hampton had created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury while assaulting a law enforcement officer.similarly,the district court applied a enhancement pursuant to.b for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony,namely,assaulting a police officer while resisting arrest.thus,hampton final offense level was.as hampton criminal history category was vi,this resulted in an advisory sentencing guidelines range of to months.
in addition to his objections to the six and enhancements,hampton also timely and separately objected to the application of both enhancements,contending that the combined enhancement constituted impermissible double counting.the district court overruled all of the objections.hampton then sought a variance sentence,which the court granted,at least in part,because of the conceded overlap of the enhancements.the court sentenced hampton to months of imprisonment,followed by five years of supervised release.
we first consider the district court ruling on the motion to suppress.our standard of review is well known 
in assessing a trial court ruling on a motion to suppress,we review factual findings for clear error and legal determinations de novo.when a motion to suppress has been denied in the court below,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.

hampton does not contest the legality of the vehicle stop.he argues only that the deputies did not have reason to order him out of the car or chase him upon his flight.he contends that the district court reliance on maryland wilson,is misplaced because arizona gant,overruled wilson to the extent wilson permitted an officer to order a passenger to exit a vehicle.this is not correct,as we have already held.
wilson established that an officer making a traffic stop may order passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop.wilson,at.the officers may do so as a precautionary measure,without reasonable suspicion that the passenger poses a safety risk.id.at.the wilson court reasoned that the danger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in a stopped vehicle and the additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal.id.
hampton acknowledges that we explicitly rejected his argument that gant fatally undermined wilson in united states rumley,cir.nevertheless,he asserts the argument simply to preserve the issue.in rumley,we determined that an officer acted lawfully in ordering a passenger to exit a car absent any suspicion that the passenger had done anything wrong.id.at.we said 
long before its holding in gant or the events giving rise to this appeal,the supreme court held that an officer conducting a lawful traffic stop may,as a safety measure,order any passenger to exit the vehicle as a matter of course.maryland wilson,see also united states sakyi,cir.nothing in gant,which limits permissible searches incident to arrest,undermines the rule established in wilson.
under rumley and wilson,deputy atkinson order to hampton to exit the vehicle was constitutionally permissible.id.furthermore,quite apart from the issue of whether reasonable suspicion existed to conduct an immediate frisk of hampton after he stepped out of the vehicle,when hampton shoved deputy cavanagh in his effort to flee from the deputies,that act provided the deputies probable cause to arrest hampton for simple assault and to conduct a search of his person incident thereto.thus,the district court did not err in denying hampton motion to suppress.
we now turn to hampton three challenges to his sentence,each based on the district court advisory guidelines calculations.when considering the district court application of the sentencing guidelines,we review factual findings for clear error and questions of law de novo.united states green,cir.
it is undisputed that hampton qualified as an armed career criminal pursuant to e and therefore faced a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration of months and a maximum sentence of life in prison.although he does not challenge that aspect of his sentencing,hampton does contend that the district court erred in its calculation of his advisory guidelines range by applying two enhancements.
hampton base offense level was determined to be.the two disputed enhancements applied by the district court added a total of offense levels first,the court applied a enhancement pursuant to c for creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury while assaulting an officer during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom.second,the court applied a enhancement pursuant to b based on its finding that hampton possessed the firearm in connection with another felony,namely,assaulting a law enforcement officer while resisting arrest.hampton argues that it was error to apply either of these two enhancements and,even if either would apply,it was error to apply both,cumulatively.we consider his contentions in turn.
hampton first argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement pursuant to c because the evidence before the district court did not establish that he assaulted either of the arresting deputies in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.we reject this contention and conclude that the evidence before the district court was sufficient to support its application of the enhancement.
in considering hampton argument,we look first to the language of the enhancement.section c provides for a enhancement where a defendant in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury,and knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that a person was a law enforcement officer,assaulted such officer during the course of the offense or immediate flight therefrom.application note a to c states that the provision applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault.application note b provides that s ubstantial risk of serious bodily injury includes any more serious injury that was risked,as well as actual serious bodily injury emphasis added.the guidelines define serious bodily injury as injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation.emphasis added.
in light of these definitions and the largely undisputed facts before the district court at sentencing,the elements justifying application of the enhancement are clearly established.hampton does not dispute that he knew atkinson and cavanagh were law enforcement officers.it is also clear that atkinson suffered serious bodily injury during his struggle to detain and handcuff hampton after hampton tried to flee the scene of the traffic stop.atkinson injury to his rotator cuff and ligament in his shoulder required medical attention and six weeks of physical therapy.under the guidelines definition,this constitutes a serious bodily injury.see.
of course,the mere fact that atkinson suffered a serious bodily injury does not alone satisfy the provision we must also determine whether the district court committed clear error in finding that the evidence established that hampton assaulted deputy atkinson in a manner creating a substantial risk of such injury.
as the sentencing guidelines do not provide a definition of assault,we turn to the common meaning of the word for guidance.united states,cir because the sentencing guidelines do not define the phrase sexual abuse of a minor,we interpret it by employing the common meaning of the words that the sentencing commission used.we begin with the dictionary definition of assault.see id.citing webster and black law dictionary.black law dictionary lists several definitions of assault a threat or use of force inflicting a reasonable apprehension of harm an attempt to commit battery a battery and any attack.black law dictionary ed.webster defines the term as a violent physical or verbal attack and a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact creating immediate danger or apprehension of such harm.collegiate dictionary ed.these definitions reveal that in common usage,assault is synonymous with attack.
at least one other circuit court of appeals has looked to the common law to define assault within the sentencing guidelines.see united states lee,cir applying the common law definition of assault to the official victim enhancement we consider in this case,now located at c.it is worth noting that application of the common law meaning of assault provides us with the same result we reach by considering its common meaning.at common law,assault consisted of either attempted battery or the deliberate infliction upon another of a reasonable fear of physical injury.united states delis,cir citing william blackstone,commentaries on the laws of england wayne lafave,substantive criminal law,at,ed.in contrast,common law battery consisted of the unlawful application of force to the person of another,and required no specific intent to commit the act.id.citing lafave,supra,at.over the years,however,battery has come to be defined as a completed assault,and thus an assault is necessarily included in every battery.see id.e ven as a formal matter,a battery has generally been considered to constitute the successful completion of,and therefore necessarily to include,an assault.citing rollin perkins,offenses against the person,a battery includes an assault hence a defendant may be convicted of assault although the evidence shows also a battery.people heise,cal battery includes assault in fact,battery is a consummated assault.assault is,therefore,necessarily included in battery.state hefner,discussing a statute criminalizing assault inflict ing serious injury not resulting in death and noting that,although a n assault is an offer or attempt by force or violence to do injury,every battery includes an assault and an assault inflicting serious injury necessarily implies a battery.
consonant with this historical development,several states,as well as the drafters of the model penal code,have merged the two offenses.see,criminal law,b assault means the crimes of assault,battery,and assault and battery,which retain their judicially determined meanings.arizona stat,a a person commits assault by.intentionally,knowingly or recklessly causing any physical injury to another person or.intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury or.knowingly touching another person with the intent to injure,insult or provoke such person.model penal code a person is guilty of assault if he a attempts to cause or purposely,knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another.the effect of these changes is that the two crimes have become nearly synonymous.see delis,at noting that the terms assault and battery are often used interchangeably citing lafave,supra,at t he word assault is sometimes used loosely to include a battery perkins,supra,at it is not uncommon to detail the facts constituting a battery in speaking of an assault.considering both this history and the common meaning of the word,we readily conclude that battery of a law enforcement officer was intended to and in fact does satisfy c assault requirement.
the district court,expressly adopting the analysis of the probation officer contained in the psr,concluded that hampton assaulted atkinson when hampton struggled with the deputy while at the same time attempted to retrieve the firearm from his pocket an
