terrell campbell and esley porteous both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess fifteen or more counterfeit access devices,in violation of and b count one,and possession of fifteen or more counterfeit access devices,in violation of a count two.campbell also pleaded guilty to the use of one or more counterfeit access devices,in violation of a count six the district court sentenced campbell to eighteen months imprisonment and three years supervised release and sentenced porteous to twelve months imprisonment and three years supervised release.both defendants were ordered to pay restitution in the amount of,for which they are jointly and severally liable 
the defendants timely appealed they now argue that law enforcement officers lacked reasonable suspicion for the vehicle stop under terry ohio,that law enforcement ensuing warrantless search of the vehicle violated the fourth amendment,that the search warrant later obtained for the vehicle did not issue on probable cause and that admission of the defendants uncounseled statements made at the scene of the terry stop violated the fifth amendment because they were obtained without warnings,in violation of miranda arizona.additionally,campbell challenges his sentence.
we affirm the judgment of the district court for the following reasons.first,the district court correctly held that the stop of the defendants vehicle did not violate the fourth amendment.accordingly,the warrant issued for the search of the car was not tainted by an illegal stop.second,the defendants have failed to establish that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle searched after the stop.therefore,they can neither object to the search nor seek suppression of the evidence obtained in that search.third,the admission of statements obtained through the officers questioning of the defendants at the traffic stop did not violate the fifth amendment.consequently,the district court properly refused to suppress evidence gained as a result of the questioning.finally,the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence on campbell.
backgrounda.facts 
on may,scarborough police department patrol officer craig hebert responded to a report of suspicious conduct at an electronics store,bull moose,in scarborough,maine.officer hebert and a colleague,officer tim dalton,interviewed the store clerks.the clerks told the officers that three black men had come to the store.each one entered separately and departed before the arrival of the next one.each had attempted to purchase video game systems.the first man successfully used a credit card to pay for two systems.the second man attempted a similar purchase,but both credit cards he presented were declined.the name on both of the declined credit cards was the same name as the one on the credit card presented earlier by the first man.the third man entered the store and expressed an interest in purchasing video game systems.a clerk told him that bull moose could not sell him a game system and suggested that he go to the toys r us store in south portland,maine.the three men departed together in the same suv,which had new york license plates.the clerks told the officers the vehicle license plate number and said that the men likely were headed to toys r us.
officer hebert called dispatch he provided a description of the vehicle and its license plate number,and he said that the vehicle was occupied by three black males.south portland police department patrol officer kevin gerrish heard the dispatch call to look for the suv in the toys r us parking lot.he identified an unoccupied vehicle matching the description officer gerrish waited in the parking lot and saw three black males exiting toys r us carrying bags of merchandise.the men got into the vehicle and left the store parking lot.officer gerrish called dispatch,and either dispatch or officer hebert told officer gerrish to stop the vehicle 
officer gerrish stopped the vehicle in a hotel parking lot.he approached the vehicle and requested a license from the driver,michael barnes,as well as the vehicle registration and proof of insurance.barnes was unable to produce a license.campbell and porteous both provided valid identification at officer gerrish request.officer gerrish told the men that there was a report that they had had trouble with credit cards at bull moose.their response was evasive one man said that he was not at bull moose,and the others confirmed the assertion.officer gerrish testified that,at some point during this initial exchange of information,he smelled the scent of marijuana coming from the vehicle 
officer gerrish asked barnes to get out of the car.barnes got out of the car and spoke with officer gerrish away from campbell and porteous.barnes told officer gerrish that the vehicle was rented and that the men were visiting friends in the area.officer gerrish patted down and handcuffed barnes.in the meantime,officer hebert arrived on the scene.officer hebert asked campbell,who was sitting in the rear seat,to exit the vehicle.campbell complied,and officer hebert led him away from the vehicle for questioning.campbell identified himself,said that he was from brooklyn and said that he and the other men were visiting family in the area.campbell initially said that he had been at bull moose,but later denied being there and said that he had been in a nearby subway sandwich shop.when asked about using credit cards at bull moose,campbell said,according to officer hebert,what cards,what credit cards.
two additional officers also arrived on the scene,officer dalton and scarborough police department sergeant tom chard sergeant chard brought a k partner,a belgian malinois named chesca sergeant chard asked porteous,who was seated in the front seat,to exit the vehicle.sergeant chard asked porteous what the men were doing in the area,and porteous said they were looking for jobs.porteous said that he had rented the vehicle 
none of the defendants were given miranda warnings at any time during the stop.while other officers were speaking to the defendants,officer gerrish entered the driver side of the vehicle,front and back,and briefly looked over the passenger compartment.he also opened the hatchback and briefly looked over merchandise located there.
then,sergeant chard asked porteous whether he could put chesca in the car.porteous responded affirmatively.sergeant chard put chesca into the vehicle,and he observed her alerting in three areas the glove box,the pocket of the front door and the center console.without requesting additional consent,sergeant chard searched the glove box and the center console and found only marijuana residue when chesca alerted to the glove box,it was locked.sergeant chard retrieved a vehicle key,unlocked the glove box and searched inside.in the glove box,he found a box,which he also opened.inside the box,he found approximately fifty identification and credit cards and three wallets.
after finding the box containing the cards,the officers handcuffed the defendants and transported them for processing.the officers seized the vehicle and impounded it.the south portland police department received a warrant from a judge of the maine district court to search the vehicle.the warrant authorized the police to seize,among other items,credit cards and game systems already known to be in the vehicle.
district court proceedings 
following their indictment,campbell and porteous moved to suppress evidence obtained in connection with the vehicle stop and search.specifically,the defendants argued that the defendants had standing to challenge the search as violating the fourth amendment there was no reasonable articulable suspicion justifying the stop of the vehicle the warrantless search of the vehicle was not based on probable cause or valid consent the search warrant later obtained for the vehicle was not based on probable cause the defendants fifth amendment rights were violated due to the officers failure to inform them of their rights under miranda and statements and evidence obtained through the stop and interrogation were fruits of the poisonous tree and should be suppressed.
the magistrate judge who conducted the suppression hearing concluded that the vehicle stop was based on the reasonable suspicion that the defendants were involved in fraudulent credit card transactions at bull moose and toys r us.the magistrate judge rejected the defendants arguments that the stop was based on a mere hunch or on racial profiling the defendants activity,she concluded,would reasonably have caused any prudent person to suspect the fraudulent use of credit cards to purchase consumer electronics.
the magistrate judge also concluded that the warrantless search of the vehicle was permitted under the consent and automobile exceptions to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.the magistrate judge further determined that there was probable cause for issuance of the warrant to search the vehicle and seize contraband found in it.finally,the magistrate judge concluded that miranda warnings were not required because the defendants were not in custody in light of all of the facts and circumstances,a reasonable person standing in the defendants shoes would not have believed that he was being subjected to a restraint equivalent to a formal arrest.on february,the district judge entered an order accepting the magistrate recommendation.
neither the magistrate judge nor the district court addressed whether the defendants had the requisite privacy interest to address any of the issues concerning the search.
discussiona.stop and search of the vehicle 
we first consider the defendants argument that the district court should have suppressed evidence obtained during the stop and search of the vehicle.in reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review its findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.united states diaz,cir.absent an error of law,we will uphold a refusal to suppress evidence as long as the refusal is supported by some reasonable view of the record.united states lee,cir.
the defendants submit two separate arguments.first,they argue that the stop of the vehicle constituted an unlawful seizure under the fourth amendment.second,they contend that a law enforcement officer ensuing search of the vehicle violated the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches.we shall address each argument in turn.
the vehicle stop 
the defendants submit that the district court erred in holding that officer gerrish stop of the vehicle was constitutional because it was based on reasonable articulable suspicion.
we begin by setting forth the fourth amendment principles governing investigative stops.in terry ohio,the supreme court articulated the watershed principle that a police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.temporary traffic stops are analogous to these terry stops.berkemer mccarty.stopping a vehicle and temporarily detaining its occupants constitutes a seizure for fourth amendment purposes.united states cortez,collecting cases delaware prouse.because the defendants,as passengers in the stopped automobile,were seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment,they may contest whether the stop of the vehicle meets fourth amendment standards.brendlin california,see united states symonevich,cir 
a warrantless traffic stop satisfies the fourth amendment reasonableness requirement,const.amend.iv,if police officers have a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoinga suspicion that finds expression in specific,articulable reasons for believing that a person may be connected to the commission of a particular crime.lee,at see also united states sokolow,united states jones,cir.to constitute reasonable suspicion,the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause,and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.united states arvizu.
the supreme court has eschewed,emphatically,any reliance on a rigid test or formula to give the concept substance.rather,it has emphasized that the determination must be grounded in the totality of the circumstances.cortez,at see also jones,at united states coplin,cir.nevertheless,the court has disciplined the reasonable suspicion standard by requiring some objective manifestation that the person stopped either is wanted for past criminal conduct,or is engaging or about to engage in such conduct.cortez,at.a mere hunch,therefore,will not justify a stop.terry,at.
information that is received from others in the course of an investigation,as the court emphasized in adams williams,varies in its value and reliability 
informants tips,like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene,may vary greatly in their value and reliability.one simple rule will not cover every situation.some tips,completely lacking in indicia of reliability,would either warrant no police response or require further investigation before a forcible stop of a suspect would be authorized.but in some situations for example,when the victim of a street crime seeks immediate police aid and gives a description of his assailant,or when a credible informant warns of a specific impending crime the subtleties of the hearsay rule should not thwart an appropriate police response.
in short,in our search for some objective manifestation,we must recognize that,at bottom,the inquiry deals not with hard certainties,but with probabilities.cortez,at.in the supreme court words 
the idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements,each of which must be present before a stop is permissible.first,the assessment must be based upon all of the circumstances.the analysis proceeds with various objective observations,information from police reports,if such are available,and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers.from these data,a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.
the process does not deal with hard certainties,but with probabilities.long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such,practical people formulated certain commonsense conclusions about human behavior jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same and so are law enforcement officers.finally,the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars,but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.
the second element contained in the idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion is the concept that the process just described must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.
id.at.with these principles in mind,we turn to the case before us.
here,the stop occurred after the police had received a report from store employees that suggested that the defendants may have engaged in,or attempted to engage in,credit card fraud.these clerks worked for an established business within the officers jurisdiction and,as part of the store sales force,their work undoubtedly included being alert for fraudulent activity at the store.moreover,in a situation,the officers had an opportunity to judge the credibility of the clerks and the accuracy of their report.the bull moose clerks gave the officers specific information.they described their serial encounters with the defendants and specifically told the officers that two different defendants had attempted to use credit cards bearing the same name.the clerks further gave the police a description of the defendants vehicle,including the license plate number.they also provided,on the basis of their conversation with the defendants,the probable location of the defendants next stop.
although this encounter already gave the police officers a great deal of information upon which to formulate a suspicion of illegal activity,the officers went a step further before executing the stop and checked the clerks estimation of the defendants whereabouts.an officer went to the toys r us where,according to the clerks,the defendants might next appear.the officer found a vehicle matching the description of the defendants vehicle.the vehicle license plate number matched that reported by the clerks,with the exception of one instance of inverted numerals.shortly afterward,the officer observed the defendants approach the vehicle.they were carrying bags,suggesting that they had purchased items in the toys r us,as the clerks at the earlier establishment predicted they might do.the men not only were in the right place at the right time but also fit the suspects descriptions.lee,at.in short,only after law enforcement officers had learned all of the facts surrounding the suspected criminal activity and had corroborated the details did officer gerrish stop the defendants vehicle.
we think that this case is sufficiently similar to the situation that confronted us in lee as to be controlled by the principles articulated in that case.there,a store employee contacted the police to report suspected attempted credit card fraud.id.at.the employee told police that a young asian male had tried but failed to purchase a wristwatch using not one but two platinum american express cards ostensibly issued in the name of zhi lin.id.when a police officer arrived at the store parking lot,he observed a van containing two individuals matching the employee description.id.the officer approached the vehicle,and the driver attempted to pull away before the officer forced him to stop.id.we held that the collocation of circumstances plainly satisfied the reasonable suspicion standard for an initial terry stop.id.at.
as in lee,the circumstances surrounding the present defendants actions at bull moose and in the toys r us parking lot justified officer gerrish stop.the district court correctly concluded that the stop was supported by reasonable articulable suspicion 
the vehicle search 
the defendants next challenge the district court determination that the warrantless search of the vehicle,from the dog entrance into the vehicle through the search of the locked glove box,did not violate the fourth amendment.the district court took the view that the defendants consent,as well as the automobile exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement,brought that search within constitutional bounds.
in examining this question,we are confronted at the beginning of our analysis by an important threshold question.the defendants base their challenge to the search of the automobile on their status as passengers in that automobile.following the decision of the supreme court in rakas illinois,we have held squarely that passengers in an automobile who assert no property or possessory interest in a vehicle can not be said to have the requisite expectation of privacy in the vehicle to permit them to maintain that the search did not meet fourth amendment standards.united states symonevich,cir 
campbell never has claimed a possessory interest in the vehicle in his motion to suppress and at the hearing on that motion,porteous asserted,forcefully,that he did not lease the car to put it mildly,in taking those positions,neither defendant has carried his burden to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle.see united states lipscomb,cir before reaching the merits of a suppression challenge,the defendant carries the burden of establishing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area searched id.at holding that the defendant lacked the expectation of privacy required to challenge a seizure where the defendant actively disowned any interest in any of the seized items and repeatedly asserted at the hearing on his motion to suppress that the contraband seized was not his accordingly,because neither campbell nor porteous established a privacy interest in the car,they can not object to its search by the officers.
because the defendants do not assert the requisite privacy interest in the vehicle that was searched,they can not make any claim about the legality of the search of the vehicle.we therefore have no reason to address their contentions with respect to that search.
uncounseled questioning at the scene of the vehicle stop 
the defendants next submit that the law enforcement officers should have supplied miranda warnings before questioning them at the scene of the vehicle stop and that any statements made in the absence of such warnings should be suppressed.
in evaluating the district court ruling on whether the defendants were in custody for miranda purposes,we review the court factual assessment of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation for clear error.united states hughes,cir.then,we review de novo whether,viewed objectively,the discerned circumstances constitute the requisite restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.id.quoting california beheler,per curiam.
miranda arizona,held that the fifth amendment requires the exclusion of incriminating statements obtained during custodial interrogation unless the suspect fails to claim the fifth amendment privilege after being suitably warned of his right to remain silent and of the consequences of his failure to assert it.minnesota murphy.the purpose of the miranda doctrine is to combat the specific characteristics of custodial interrogation that work to undermine the individual will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.miranda,at.accordingly,miranda does not apply outside the context of the inherently coercive custodial interrogations for which it was designed.roberts united states.custody for purposes of miranda must be narrowly circumscribed to effectuate the precise purpose of the warnings.see murphy,at.in determining whether a person was in custody for this purpose,therefore,a court must keep in mind that t he warnings protect persons who,exposed to such interrogation without the assistance of counsel,otherwise might be unable to make a free and informed choice to remain silent.roberts,at.
in determining whether a person detained at a vehicular stop should have been given miranda warnings,the supreme court and the courts of appeals have followed the principles that we just have articulated.in berkemer mccarty,for instance,the supreme court held that miranda warnings are not required during routine stops involving traffic matters.the court acknowledged that a traffic stop is a seizure for fourth amendment purposes because few motorists would feel free either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the scene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so.id.at.the court distinguished traffic stops from the setting that occurs in miranda jailhouse interrogations.id.at.c ircumstances associated with the typical traffic stop are not such that the motorist feels completely at the mercy of the police.id.at.traffic stops are usually temporary and brief.id.at.they are public,which both reduces the ability of an unscrupulous policeman to use illegitimate means to elicit statements and diminishes the motorist fear that,if he does not cooperate,he will be subjected to abuse.id.at.typically each motorist is confronted by only one or two policemen.id.all of this combines to make a traffic stop substantially less police dominated than the kinds of interrogation at issue in miranda itself.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.traffic stops are comparatively nonthreatening,and therefore do not require miranda warnings to counter the threat of coercion.id.at.
notably,despite its holding that,generally,law enforcement officers are not required to give miranda warnings at traffic stops,the court established no categorical rule.indeed,it held that miranda warnings would be required as soon as a suspect freedom of action is curtailed to a degree associated with formal arrest.id.quoting beheler,at.thus,our task is to determine whether the facts of a specific case indicate a situation more akin to a routine traffic stop,at which miranda warnings are not required,or indicate that a suspect has been subjected to restraints comparable to those associated with a formal arrest,at which point miranda warnings are required.id.at.in understanding this analysis,we begin by noting that the court has held that a traffic stop is analogous to a terry stop and,therefore,that persons temporarily detained pursuant to such stops are not in custody for the purposes of miranda.id.at.in the course of its opinion,the supreme court also noted the absence of any suggestion in its opinions that terry stops are subject to the dictates of miranda due to t he comparatively nonthreatening character of detentions of this sort.id.
in focusing on terry stops,we also have recognized that,as a general rule,terry stops do not implicate the requirements of miranda,because terry stops,though inherently somewhat coercive,do not usually involve the type of police dominated or compelling atmosphere which necessitates miranda warnings.united states streifel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.more recently,in united states fornia castillo,cir,we have reiterated that general approach while observing,as the supreme court did in berkemer,that a valid investigatory stop can escalate into custody for miranda purposes where the totality of the circumstances shows that a reasonable person would understand that he was being held to the degree associated with a formal arrest.id.at quoting stansbury california,per curiam.while no scientifically precise formula can determine whether a terry stop rises to the level of a formal arrest,united states trueber,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the ultimate inquiry is whether there was a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.thompson keohane,internal quotation marks omitted.keeping in mind that the test is an objective one,stansbury,at,we focus without limitation on four factors whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect and the duration and character of the interrogation.hughes,at internal quotation marks omitted 
we believe that the circumstances surrounding this stop would not be viewed by a reasonable person as the functional equivalent of a formal arrest.the defendants were questioned in a neutral location,a hotel parking lot.see united states jones,cir although the location apparently was not familiar to the defendant and the area was not,a public highway is a neutral setting that police officers are not in a position to dominate as they are,for example,an interrogation room at a jailhouse.there were four or five police officers on the scene questioning three defendants.the police officers split up and questioned the defendants separately,such that each defendant was questioned by at most two officers.there is no indication that this ratio was overwhelming to the defendants.see united states crooker,cir determining that suspect was not in custody for miranda purposes where no more than two agents were in direct conversation with the suspect at one time.although the defendants may have temporarily been unable to use their cellular phones,neither campbell nor porteous was physically restrained at the time of the questioning.see hughes,at.the law enforcement officers on the scene made no show of force by using their weapons.crooker,at,holding that suspect was not in custody even where law enforcement officers initially approached house with weapons drawn.finally,the duration and character of the interrogation weigh in favor of finding that the defendants were not in custody.there is no indication that the stop lasted for an inappropriately long period of time or that the officers acted with hostility toward the defendants.see united states guerrier,cir holding that suspect was not in custody where the atmosphere was relatively calm and nonthreatening and the interview lasted a relatively short time.
in similar circumstances,we have determined that suspects were not in custody at the time of questioning.for example,in crooker,at,law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at the defendant house.there were between four and eight agents,who approached the house with weapons drawn.id.during a search,two agents conversed with the defendant.id.at.the agents did not advise the defendant of his miranda rights or arrest him.id.the defendant made incriminating statements about the location of firearms,ammunition and marijuana in the house.id.the district court denied the defendant motion to suppress those statements we affirmed,concluding that the defendant was not in custody for miranda purposes.id.at.we specifically considered that the interrogation was conducted in the significantly less intimidating setting of the defendant home that the officers weapons were holstered throughout the majority of the search that no more than two agents were in direct conversation with the defendant at any given time that the defendant never was restrained physically and that the interactions were cooperative and relatively brief.id.at see also hughes,at holding that suspect was not in custody where the interview occurred in his home,the number of officers was impressive but not overwhelming and only two officers participated in the questioning,there was no show of force and no weapons were brandished,the defendant was not restrained physically,the ambiance was relaxed and and the interview lasted for ninety minutesa relatively short duration fornia castillo,at,holding that suspect was not in custody where single officer stopped suspect on busy public road,at one point drew his service revolver in a defensive position,handcuffed the suspect for ten to fifteen minutes,frisked the suspect and questioned the suspect while he was handcuffed.
here,because campbell and porteous were not in custody at the time of their questioning,law enforcement did not have to inform them of their miranda rights,and the district court properly refused to suppress their statements.
c.campbell sentence 
we typically examine sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion,which is really a review for reasonableness.united states denson,cir,cert.denied.
campbell submits that the district court erred in imposing his sentence a reviewing court must consider both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence.gall united states.here,campbell raises no procedural challenges on appeal rather,he challenges the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.in his view,the district court failed to give proper weight to the medical care needed to treat his polymyositis,among other personal factors.see id.at characterizing the weight given to specific facts as a substantive reasonableness question.
we first note that campbell raised no objection to the guidelines calculation in the presentence report or to the calculation as explained by the district court during his sentencing hearing.more fundamentally,campbell sentence falls squarely within the sentencing court guidelines calculation.the base offense level was six.the amount of loss added eight levels and possession of a fraudulent license added two levels.the defendant received a reduction following his guilty plea,so the final offense level was thirteen.given his criminal history category of ii,the resulting guidelines range was fifteen to months.
nevertheless,on appeal,campbell submits that the trial court failed to consider adequately his medical needs and life circumstances.to the contrary,the record indicates that the court sufficiently considered those factors.first,the court acknowledged that it had carefully reviewed the contents of the written presentence investigation report,which describes campbell medical needs and to which campbell offered no objection the court listened to both campbell and campbell attorney discuss his medical condition at the sentencing hearing.prior to announcing the sentence,the court indicated that it had considered the presentence report,the history of the defendant and letters of support which,according to campbell attorney,discussed the defendant medical condition.it is clear that the court considered campbell personal circumstances 
further,the court explained that the sentence it imposed did provide leniency for
