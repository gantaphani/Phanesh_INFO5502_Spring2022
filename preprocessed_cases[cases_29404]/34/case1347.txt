opinion of the court 
in this appeal arising under the fourth amendment,we consider whether philadelphia police officers possessed sufficient reasonable articulable suspicion to stop a car.the traffic stop was based on information provided by a taxi driver who called after he saw a man brandish a gun at a gas station.the district court found that the call did not provide police with reasonable suspicion to effectuate the traffic stop and,accordingly,suppressed the evidence gathered after the stop.because we find that the totality of the circumstances amounted to reasonable suspicion,we will reverse.
on february,at,the philadelphia police department received a call which included the following information 
caller heading to philadelphia,pennsylvania heading north on broad at south street.you got a guy with a or.license plate f frank victor able.flashed a gun at the hess station at a bum sic trying to sell roses.

dispatcher all right,thanks.
caller your sic welcome,i going to peel off.
at three minutes after the call was radioed officers on patrol and told them that a hispanic male driving a silver bmw with license plate was driving eastbound on south street,and that the driver had a gun.
immediately upon receiving the report,officers in the field asked whether the dispatcher got a complainant for it the dispatcher informed them that no complainant is showing.within minutes,plainclothes officers observed a bmw matching the dispatcher description and with license plate pass them on south street,approximately twelve blocks from where the taxi driver had initially reported it.pursuant to department policy,the plainclothes officers relayed the information to uniformed police officers.by,uniformed officers spotted the vehicle,stopped it,and found that its johnny torres,a hispanic a millimeter handgun with one round in the chamber stowed in the pocket of the driver side door.
a grand jury indicted torres on one count of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon,in violation of g.torres filed a motion to suppress the weapon and ammunition,arguing that the tip from the taxi driver did not supply reasonable suspicion for the stop.the district court granted the motion to suppress after a hearing,and the government appealed.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and our jurisdiction arises under.the government argues that the district court erred in suppressing the handgun and the ammunition.the parties agree that the decision to suppress turns on the question of whether the officers had a right to stop torres vehicle pursuant to terry ohio,d.
in reviewing a suppression order,we exercise plenary review over the district court legal conclusions,and we review the underlying factual findings for clear error.united states laville,cir citation omitted.we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that the officers lacked sufficient reasonable articulable suspicion to effectuate a terry stop.see johnson campbell,cir.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures const.amend.iv.generally,for a seizure to be reasonable under the fourth amendment,it must be effectuated with a warrant based on probable cause.united states robertson,cir citation omitted.under the exception to the warrant requirement established in terry,however,an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow,d citation omitted.any evidence obtained pursuant to an investigatory stop also known as a terry stop or a stop and frisk that does not meet this exception must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.united states brown,cir citations omitted.
the initial step of a fourth amendment suppression analysis requires us to determine the timing of the seizure.u nder terry,in evaluating whether the officer interaction with the defendant prior to his arrest amounted to an unreasonable seizure,we must first determine at what moment the defendant was seized johnson,at.in the case at bar,the district court the parties do not torres was seized when the officers stopped his car.
having pinpointed the time of the fourth amendment seizure,we next ask whether that seizure was justified by reasonable,articulable facts known to the officer as of that time id.when officers are told to investigate a situation by a police dispatcher,as was the case here,the court must look beyond the specific facts known to the officers on the scene to the facts known to the dispatcher.see united states nelson,cir analyzing the reasonableness of a terry stop by asking whether the officer who,functioning as a dispatcher,had sufficient grounds to view the tip as reliable and issue the radio bulletin pursuant to which the car was stopped citation omitted see also rogers powell,cir the legality of a seizure based solely on statements issued by fellow officers depends on whether the officers who issued the statements possessed the requisite basis to seize the suspect.emphasis in original.in other words,the knowledge of the dispatcher is imputed to the officers in the field when determining the reasonableness of the terry stop.
the government concedes that the unidentified taxi driver tip was the only information known by the police when they seized torres.when the government relies upon a tip from an unidentified informant as the basis for reasonable suspicion,assessing the reasonableness of a terry stop becomes more intricate.see adams williams,d noting the reliability problems of anonymous telephone tips and distinguishing anonymous tips from tips given by a known informant whose reputation can be assessed and whose information is immediately verifiable at the scene.the supreme court has made clear that an informant veracity,reliability,and basis of knowledge are highly relevant in determining the value of his report.alabama white,d quoting illinois gates,d.the honesty of the caller,the reliability of his information,and the basis of his knowledge are closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense,practical question of whether there is reasonable suspicion to support a terry stop.gates.see also white,at.applying the gates analysis to reasonable suspicion context.this court has identified the specific aspects of tips which indicate their reliability 
the tip information was relayed from the informant to the officer in a interaction such that the officer had an opportunity to appraise the witness credibility through observation.
the person providing the tip can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated.
the content of the tip is not information that would be available to any observer 
the person providing the information has recently witnessed the alleged criminal activity.
the tip predicts what will follow,as this provides police the means to test the informant knowledge or credibility
