the parties present sharply divergent accounts of the facts,but they agree on the following maurice wilson died from multiple gunshot wounds on july.ballistics indicated that the shots that caused the wounds came from two different guns,neither of which was admitted into evidence at trial.police followed a trail of blood from the apartment where they found wilson body to an alley close to mark garrick house.upon obtaining a search warrant,police searched garrick house and found bloody clothing.esther jones,who claimed to have witnessed the crime,testified that eughenia jones,one of three men convicted of the murder,had been wearing those clothes when he and two other men,including petitioner wright,entered her apartment.police also seized a gun,which was not tied by ballistics evidence to any of wilson gunshot wounds,bullets,and photographs of garrick,eughenia jones,and andre wright,albeit not together in one photograph.garrick,jones and wright were indicted in december and all three were convicted of wilson murder following a jury trial.
wright conviction was based largely on the testimony of two witnesses,esther jones and earlene gates,who offered occasionally inconsistent testimony regarding wilson murder.jones and gates initially denied knowing who killed wilson they later changed their minds and implicated wright,garrick,and eughenia jones.the testimony of the two witnesses was consistent as to the following they were in their apartment along with maurice wilson,esther jones boyfriend,when the doorbell rang.wilson answered the door.shortly thereafter,jones,who was in her room,saw someone enter her room and remove a gun that wilson kept under her pillow.wright then entered jones room and forced her to come with him to the living room.eughenia jones woke up gates and similarly forced gates and her daughter into the living room.wright instructed both women to sit on the couch while eughenia jones held wilson on the floor with a gun to his head and demanded money and drugs.when wilson said he had given the three men everything he had,the three accomplices took him into the kitchen.jones and gates stayed in the living room,but they heard a loud argument taking place in the kitchen.both heard wilson say that he would not jump out the window.shortly thereafter,both witnesses heard multiple gunshots,followed by the sounds of people running up and down stairs.they also heard eughenia jones shout that he had shot himself.jones testified that she found wilson dead body in the kitchen.
although the two witnesses agreed on the above facts,they offered inconsistent testimony on several points.most importantly,esther jones testified that an unnamed man came into the apartment to see wilson while the crime was in progress.according to jones,the man was forced to lie on the ground in the living room and left after wilson was taken into the kitchen and shot.in contrast,gates testified that no such man was present on the day of the crime.
defense witnesses offered substantially different testimony.sharon hillian testified that on the day of the crime,she saw jones and two other men none of whom was ultimately accused of the murder enter the building where wilson was shot.hillian then heard four or five shots,after which jones and the two men left the building.wendy phillips also testified for the defense.she testified that at the time of the murder she was standing outside the building where wilson was killed.after hearing a gunshot,phillips observed two tall,black men none of whom were the codefendants running down the street.
wright was convicted of murder,robbery,and possession of an instrument of crime.on direct appeal,the pennsylvania superior court vacated the robbery conviction on the ground that it merged with the murder.in other respects,the court affirmed wright conviction.commonwealth wright.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allowance of wright appeal.wright then sought relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.et,but the pcra court denied relief.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the denial albeit on somewhat different grounds with respect to certain claims.commonwealth wright.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur.
wright next sought a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to a and a.the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation concluding that wright was not entitled to habeas relief,which the district court adopted.wright timely filed this appeal.
this court granted a certificate of appealability on the following questions whether wright claim that trial,and appellate counsel were ineffective with regard to trial counsel failure to call joanne turner as a witness was procedurally defaulted if that claim was defaulted,can wright overcome the default whether the claims of prosecutorial misconduct and violation of the confrontation clause deemed unexhausted by the district court are defaulted and,if so,can wright overcome the default and whether wright was denied his right to confront witness jones.
at oral argument,the government conceded that wright claim that trial,and appellate counsel were ineffective with regard to trial counsel failure to call joanne turner was not procedurally defaulted.this court then expanded the coa to address the merits of that wright appellate lawyer on direct appeal was ineffective.
the principal issue before us is whether wright lawyer on direct appeal was constitutionally ineffective for inadequately presenting the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call wright alibi witness,joanne turner.
wright claimed throughout his appeal that turner should have been called as a witness because she could provide him with an alibi.specifically,he claimed that the two of them were dating at the time,and on the day in question they both went to temple hospital to determine if wright had impregnated another woman.on direct appeal,he alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for not calling turner as a witness.the superior court denied relief,explaining that,w here a defendant alleges that his attorney was ineffective in failing to call witnesses in his defense,there must be some demonstration that their testimony would be helpful.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the court noted that wright has not alleged that turner was willing or able to testify,nor has he indicated about what she would have testified or how her testimony could have benefited him.absent such allegations,appellant is entitled to no relief.at.
wright then raised the issue at his pcra proceeding as a layered ineffectiveness claim.specifically,he argued that and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to preserve and properly present this issue on appeal.the pcra court held a hearing and found that turner was not credible.the superior court affirmed the pcra court decision.the court first reviewed the applicable legal principles,stating 
to establish ineffectiveness of counsel for failing to secure attendance of a witness,the appellant must show the witness existed the witness was available counsel knew or should have known of the existence of the witness the witness was willing to cooperate and testify for the appellant at trial and the witness testimony was so essential to the defense that the absence of the testimony caused an unfair verdict or sentence.commonwealth gillespie,citing commonwealth petras.
at.thereafter,the superior court held that the ineffectivenes
