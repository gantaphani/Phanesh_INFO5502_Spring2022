background 
colón employment at the municipality 
colón first began working for the municipality in as a temporary worker.in,the municipality reclassified colón as a regular employee.colón position with the municipality was reclassified multiple times in subsequent years.of significance to this appeal is her reclassification on june,when the municipality appointed colón as an auction officer,which became effective retroactively on may.
colón position as an auction officer required that she,among other duties,analyze bid recommendations,prepare bid notices,contracts,and award notices,attend the openings and holdings of bids,submit bid proposals for recommendations,evaluate recommendations and submit them to the bid board,and direct administrative work concerning the bids and proposals among various departments.to perform these duties,the auction officer was required to be physically present in the auction department.additionally,auction papers could not be removed from the auction office premises.
as an auction officer,colón worked in the auction department located in the municipal tower building in san juan,puerto rico the municipal tower building is accessible from a parking building that is adjacent to the municipal tower building.the municipality pays rent for approximately four hundred parking spaces for its employees.the municipality pays and the employee pays for each rental of a parking space.the municipal tower itself offers approximately parking spaces.
as an auction officer,colón was under the supervision of several municipality employees,all holding different managerial positions and varying degrees of authority over colón during the years relevant to this dispute.these supervisors included josé alicea rivera alicea,municipal secretary and president of the municipality auction board ivonne rodríguez rodríguez,director for the purchases and bids department and one of colón main supervisors during the relevant period maria marcano marcano,rodríguez first line supervisor in the auction department julia lanzó lanzó,manager of the auction department james delgado delgado,an auction official who was second in command in the auction department and who served as acting manager if lanzó was not present and josé rivera hernández rivera,who served as the special assistant of the municipal secretary and who verified that all persons parked in the municipal tower parking lot were authorized to do so.
generally,the municipality scheduled colón to work from to during the week.due to health problems,however,colón developed a pattern of absenteeism that continued throughout her employment her recurring absences made it necessary for her supervisors to temporarily shift colón work schedule and assignments in order to accommodate her absences and minimize work conflicts.
several of colón supervisors testified as to the quality of colón work performance and overall attendance during her tenure.for instance,lanzó testified that in terms of the performance of her work,nitza colón was excellent.lanzó acknowledged that despite her excellent work performance,she would have liked for colón not to get sick and to come to work more often.lanzó also noted that regardless of any health issues colón might have undergone during her employment,she would perform her tasks,i n that sense i have no complaints about nitza,and that colón never stopped doing her work the way she used to,she always did it.in contrast,rodríguez stated that most of colón absences were and are unannounced that her attendance is totally unpredictable and that s he is absent continuously,most of the time without prior notice.
municipality attendance policy 
although the municipality policies expressly require that all employees regularly and punctually attend work and comply with established work schedules,they do permit leave for illness.specifically,the municipality attendance manual provides that career employees are entitled to accrue sick leave proportional to the number of hours comprised by the assigned work schedule.if an employee exceeds her number of sick days,the manual states that sick leave can be accrued up to a maximum of ninety working days by the end of any calendar year.additionally,the municipality manual regarding work schedule,attendance registry,accrual and use of leave notes possible justifications for an employee absence or tardiness,including an employee or family member illness,an employee injury,or a death in the employee family.lastly,the manual states that the municipality is permitted to take disciplinary measures against an employee who is frequently absent from work in violation of established attendance norms or who exceeds the designated leaves of absence permitted.
co worker observations of colón health 
lanzó,one of colón supervisors,testified that in,colón absences became more and more frequent and that colón family members sometimes called to inform the office that colón would be absent on account of illness.lanzó also stated that sometimes colón came in swollen to the office,and that colón claimed to have pain in h er joints,her knees.lanzó also noted that colón was not one to stand up alot sic and remained at her desk,and that regardless of the pain colón may have had she would perform her tasks.
yesiree alemán alemán,a coworker in the auction department,testified that because of her condition,colón could not carry the work files,which were very big and heavy,but that she otherwise was able to carry out her immediate work tasks.adela otero ortiz otero also testified that colón was always feeling sick.
colón attendance record 
colón attendance record throughout her employment consists of numerous days during which she either was tardy or altogether absent from work on account of medical appointments,illness,or personal matters.further,at times colón leave periods exceeded the amount permitted by the municipality.on account of her excess leave days,the municipality would take some form of compensatory action,like docking colón pay.a summary of colón attendance record reveals the following 
in,the municipality approved colón request for the advancement of eighteen days of sick leave,but later denied a subsequent request because colón had present ed a pattern debt on account of sick leave.colón performance evaluation for that same year noted that overall colón surpassed the expected result in several performance categories,but that she needed to work to recover her health to improve her attendance.in,colón was absent from work approximately twenty percent of the time,and in,approximately percent of the time.the municipality approved colón request for leave without pay from july,through january.
in,colón was on leave without pay from january,through april.in september of that same year,the municipality sent colón a letter informing her that as of september,she would have no accrued leave balance.colón performance evaluation stated that colón needed to make improvements in her attendance and that she did not achieve the expected level of attendance for that year.
in,colón was granted leave without pay for medical treatment for an injury in her left foot from may,through august,colón received high rankings on her performance evaluation,but was informed that she needed to make improvements in her attendance.in,colón sought leave without pay on account of a surgical intervention of the knee on her left foot sic,which human resources forwarded along for approval in february in,colón was absent approximately percent of the time she was scheduled to work.in july of that year,colón requested authorization for the transfer of five days of vacation leave from another employee balance because she already had exhausted her own leave balance the municipality authorized the transfer.
in,colón was absent approximately percent of the time she was scheduled to work.in june of that year,colón sent the municipality a request to transfer days from several balances because she already had exhausted all of her leave balances,including sick and annual leave the municipality approved colón request.in december,colón again requested a transfer of days from because she had exhausted her leave balances.colón attendance records show that she was absent approximately percent of the total time she was scheduled to work,and that in may,she requested authorization to transfer several leave time because she already had exhausted her leave balances.the municipality authorized the request.colón performance evaluation noted that although colón is very responsible and diligent,her attendance needs improvement.
in,colón was absent from work approximately percent of the time.colón performance evaluations for that year state that her overall attendance and punctuality need improvement.in october,colón sought to transfer leave days because she had exhausted her annual and sick leave balances.in,colón was absent approximately nineteen percent of the time,with her performance evaluation stating that her attendance and punctuality required improvement.in,colón was absent approximately thirty percent of the time her performance evaluator stated that her health condition prevents her from attending regularly,but noted that she has been improving greatly in this area.
colón was absent from work approximately percent of the time in,requesting several subsequently granted leaves without pay from january through january april through april october through october through and november through january.colón was absent approximately percent of the time in,and approximately percent of the time in.in october,colón applied for a three month period of leave without pay because she already had exhausted her annual and sick leave balances the municipality granted colón request.
shifting gears colón reasonable accommodation request 
on october,colón sent a letter to josé rivera requesting a reserved parking space near the entrance and exit of the municipality tower building pursuant to medical recommendations and the provisions of the americans with disabilities act of.colón letter stated that she also had included medical evidence and information concerning reasonable accommodations.
on receiving no response,colón sent a email to rivera,copying rodríguez,lanzó,and jorge colomer montes on november.on november,rivera emailed colón stating that due to parking space needs at this time we can not assign you a reserved parking space.rivera also provided that if colón had a handicapped identification pass,she could use any of the six parking spaces specifically assigned for handicapped persons that were located near the building entrance.
rivera testified that he received no response from colón after his november reply,and thus,he took it as if she had accepted it i did see why i had to look any further.rivera also testified that sometime after his november response,he and colón had an informal encounter during which the subject of colón parking spot request was raised.rivera stated that he again informed colón that there were no parking spaces available because the parking lot was full,all spots had been assigned to other municipality employees.rivera also stated that he was aware of colón subsequent petition to the office of the ombudsman for persons with disabilities.
turning to administrative and judicial highways petitions,complaints and motions 
colón filed a petition with the office of the ombudsman for persons with disabilities on march.in this petition,colón explained that on account of her health condition,which her doctor had determined did not allow her to walk long distances,colón had requested a parking spot as a reasonable accommodation.colón stated that the municipality denied her accommodation request,instead offering her the use of reserved handicapped parking spots,which generally were unavailable by the time colón arrived at work.colón reiterated her request for a parking spot.
colón also filed a notice of charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc against the municipality mayor on june.colón alleged discrimination under the ada,retaliation,and continuing violations against her for having requested a reasonable accommodation.the eeoc responded on august,informing colón of her right to sue.
on november,colón filed her original complaint in this dispute against the municipality,which she subsequently amended on september.docket.in her amended complaint,colón asserted that the municipality discriminated and retaliated against her in violation of the ada and the rehabilitation act,and that it retaliated against her in violation of title vii of the civil rights act.colón also raised supplemental commonwealth claims under article of the puerto rico civil code,law of december,and law of july,
on august,the municipality moved for summary judgment.colón filed her opposition on september,and the municipality replied on october.on december,the district court granted the municipality summary judgment motion.finding no genuine issue of material fact as to colón various allegations,the court dismissed colón claims of disability discrimination and retaliation with prejudice,and it dismissed colón commonwealth law claims without prejudice.colón appealed,raising several evidentiary matters and asserting that the district court erred in dismissing her ada claim,her retaliation claim,her hostile work environment claim,and her equal protection claim.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we start our appellate engines considering the applicable standard of review.summary judgment is properly granted where the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.the movant must support her motion by citing specifically to materials in the record or by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute,or that an adverse party can not produce admissible evidence to support the fact.c.
the scope of appellate review of entry of summary judgment in ada cases,as in all others,is de novo.mulloy acushnet,cir quoting eeoc amego,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we must construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolv e all reasonable inferences in that party favor while safely ignoring conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation.carroll xerox,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,we are not married to the trial court reasoning but,rather,may affirm on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.cahoon shelton,cir.
evidentiary issues 
at the outset,we address several of colón evidentiary arguments which she contends justify a finding of reversible error.because these evidentiary arguments affect the record we review in determining whether the district court appropriately granted summary judgment,we turn to these arguments first.
translation of exhibits 
colón submits that the district court disregarded crucial and significant evidence filed in support of colón opposition to summary judgment motion on the grounds that such exhibits either had not been directly translated into english,or corresponding translations were not provided with the exhibits.colón asserts that the district court refusal to consider such evidence constitutes reversible error because the exhibits either were filed in english or submitted with their corresponding translations,thereby requiring the court consideration.colón lists the following exhibits as those disregarded by the district court,and.
we begin with local rule g of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,which provides that a ll documents not in the english language which are presented or filed,whether as evidence or otherwise,must be accompanied by a certified translation into english civ.g emphasis added see also providing that a ll pleadings and proceedings in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico shall be conducted in the english language emphasis added gonzález de blasini family dep t,cir holding that t he district court should not have considered any documents before it that were in the spanish language emphasis added.thus,the law is clear that any submitted exhibit not directly translated into english or provided with a corresponding english translation may properly be disregarded by the district court.
in this case,we view the scope of local rule g through the prism of another local rule,rule,also known as the rule in the district court for the district of puerto rico.see am.ins.rivera vázquez,cir.local rule,which governs summary judgment motion practice,requires,among other requisites,that each party submit separate,short,and concise statements of fact that are set forth in numbered paragraphs with specific citations to the record,including the specific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting the assertion.civ.b,c e.the purpose of this practice is to relieve the district court of any responsibility to ferret through the record to discern whether any material fact is genuinely in dispute.cmi capital mkt,llc gonzález toro,cir footnote omitted.thus,when read in connection with local rule g,it is clear that parties moving for or opposing summary judgment in the district court for the district of puerto rico,in addition to providing short and concise statements of material fact containing proper citations to the identified record,must also provide exhibits that either have been translated into english,or that contain a corresponding translation thereto.
we review the district court application of a local rule for abuse of discretion.mariani colón dep t of homeland sec.ex.rel.chertoff,cir citation omitted see also peña crespo puerto rico,cir finding no abuse of discretion where district court excluded plaintiff expert testimony because plaintiff did not provide an english translation of the expert report and resume.here,the district court stated that colón failed to translate numerous exhibits no translations were submitted for exhibits,and.any fact alleged by colon fontanez that is based on an untranslated exhibit will be disregarded.see colón fontánez municipality of san juan,d.reviewing the evidence before us,it is clear that,at least in the appellate record,the majority of the aforementioned exhibits contain english translations what is entirely unclear from this record,however,is if or when these translated exhibits were provided to the district court below 
according to the record,three different motions to submit certified translations in support of colón opposition to summary judgment motion were provided to the court.the first motion,dated october,moved to submit the following exhibits,and.the second motion,also dated october,moved to submit the following exhibits,and.the last motion,dated october,moved to submit exhibit 
these appear to be the only motions in the record pursuant to which colón sought to enter certified translated exhibits to her opposition to summary judgment into the district court record.thus,by process of elimination,it seems that the only exhibits for which colón failed to file a motion to submit certified translations were exhibits,and it is impossible for us,reviewing the record cold on appeal,to determine when,how,and most importantly,if these other translated exhibits were submitted to the district court.a review of the district court docket suggests that any such translations either were never submitted,or were not filed in accordance with proper procedures.because the law incontrovertibly demands that federal litigation in puerto rico be conducted in english,and that the district court sift out materials when collecting a record for summary judgment,we can not say that the district court refusal to consider exhibits for which an english translation either was never provided or was never properly filed with the court constituted an abuse of discretion.estades negroni of,cir see also cordero soto island,cir finding no abuse of discretion where district court excluded from consideration documents not filed in english.
admission of materials prepared by a paralegal 
colón also asserts that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted pursuant to.statements,charts,and computerized reports that had been prepared by a paralegal belonging to the law firm representing the municipality in this case.we review the court admission of an exhibit,like summary charts,for abuse of discretion.united states desimone,cir.
we find no error in the district court admission of the summary graphs.rule provides that t he contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.the summary charts and graphs at issue consisted of a condensed presentation of colón extensive record of work attendance over her near period of employment.thus,the charts served as an appropriate presentation of voluminous writings that can not conveniently be examined in court,as required by rule.further,the underlying materials on which the summary evidence was based were admissible in evidence pursuant to,as they consisted of attendance records kept in the course of the municipality regularly conducted business,according to a regular procedure,and for a routine business purpose.see united states davis,cir noting that for summary evidence to be admissible,the materials on which it is based also must be admissible in evidence see also united states loney,cir.
colón has two main arguments as to why the district court should not have considered the summary charts the summary graphs were never produced to colón during the discovery process and an appropriate foundation to the charts was not properly laid because the individual who prepared the charts i was never announced as a witness in the case,ii prepared the charts in anticipation of litigation,and iii was a paralegal who lacked the requisite expertise to testify in support of their admission.colón arguments are 
regarding colón first argument,rule provides that only the underlying documents,not the summaries themselves,must be produced to the opposing party.see.the originals of the contents of the writings,or duplicates,shall be made available for examination or copying,or both,by other parties at reasonable time and place.the circuits recognize this principle.air safety,roman catholic archbishop of boston,cir see also united states bakker,cir the language of rule simply requires that the original voluminous material be made available to the other party.coates johnson johnson,cir rule requires that only the underlying documents,and not the summaries,must be made available to the opposing party.thus,colón first argument as to the summary charts is incorrect the municipality had no obligation to provide the charts to colón.
turning to colón second argument,we first note that the paralegal who prepared the charts was announced to colón.the same day on which the municipality submitted its exhibits in support of its summary judgment motion,september,it also submitted the name and position of the paralegal who prepared the summary charts.thus,colón had ample notice of the paralegal identity and position,her role in relation to the chart preparation,and the likelihood that she could serve as a witness at trial.see united states caballero,cir finding that testimony from witness who summarized business records was not a surprise to defendants who had been notified of the witnesses and the substance of their testimony during the pretrial phase.
second,the district court specifically acknowledged that the summary charts were prepared in anticipation of litigation,and factored this into its consideration,stating 
the court understands that the summary materials were prepared by the municipality counsel for trial purposes and will consider the credibility and weight of the prepared attendance charts and graphs with due knowledge of that and of the fact that the paralegal worked only with the documents available to her.for that reason,the court views the percentages of attendance as approximations.
colón fontánez,d at emphasis added kestenbaum falstaff brewing,cir court rejected defendant objection to summary exhibits on grounds that they had been prepared in anticipation of litigation because summary was offered under and complied with.and underlying records were made available to opposing counsel.
third,for summary evidence to be admitted into court,there must be,like all evidence,a proper foundation laid for its admission.in the context of a summary exhibit,the proponent of the exhibit should present the testimony of the witness who supervised its preparation.united states bray,cir.here,the municipality offered the testimony of the paralegal who prepared the exhibits summarizing colón attendance record.the fact that the paralegal could testify as to her method of preparing and summarizing the exhibits does not an instant expert of her make.see united states milkiewicz,cir finding no merit to appellant argument that witness who prepared summary exhibits lacked the expertise to summarize the financial information represented in the charts,and noting that creating summaries of the data took patience but not expertise emphasis added see also franklin,app x,cir finding no error in allowing the preparer of the summary exhibits to testify because no expert opinions or conclusions were offered citation omitted caballero,at noting that witnesses who summarized business records and client lists and presented them in condensed form expressed neither a lay nor an expert opinion.moreover,the fact that she was a paralegal employed by defendants counsel,and not by the municipality itself,does not,in this case,affect the admissibility of the charts.see coates,at finding that court properly admitted summary evidence prepared by a paralegal employed by defendants counsel because underlying records consisted of memoranda memorializing employee performance prepared in the regular course of defendant business and were prepared in a trustworthy manner.
further,colón argument that the paralegal was not qualified to review and analyze colón attendance records holds little force.as the district court noted,t he sworn statement of the paralegal who prepared the summary charts and graphs goes into great detail about the documents relied upon and methodology used to develop the materials submitted to the court.colón fontánez,d at.colón offers no argument or explanation as to what qualifications or expertise should have been required of the preparer of her attendance record charts,nor does she ever contest the content of the summary charts.we thus fail to see how the district court admission of the paralegal summary charts constituted an abuse of discretion warranting reversal.see fraser major league soccer,llc,cir noting that i t is hard to imagine an issue on which a trial judge enjoys more discretion than as to whether summary exhibits will be helpful.
in sum,we find no error in how the district court handled the summary exhibits.
ada reasonable accommodation claim 
colón contends the district court erred in dismissing her reasonable accommodation claim under the ada by concluding that she was not a qualified individual.the municipality responds that the district court properly determined that colón was not a qualified individual under the ada because colón failed to satisfy an essential job function,attendance.
overview of an ada claim 
the ada prohibits covered employers from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability.a.a qualified individual is one who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.id.discrimination under the ada includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee,unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business.id.b a.
to establish a claim under the ada,a plaintiff must prove three factors by a preponderance of the evidence she was disabled within the meaning of the ada she was qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,either with or without reasonable accommodation and the employer took an adverse employment action against her because of the alleged disability.carroll,at see also ríos jiménez principi,cir.because we find that colón failed to establish the second element of an ada claim,show that she was a qualified individual under the ada,we limit our analysis to this factor 
qualified individual two part analysis 
whether an individual is qualified under the ada is a analysis.see m.the employee bears the burden to show,first,that she possesses the requisite skill,experience,education,and other requirements for the position,and second,that she is able to perform the position essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation.garcía ayala lederle parenterals,cir.we address each in turn.
construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,colón satisfies the first prong.the evidence shows multiple work performance evaluations of colón in which the reviewer observed that colón met or exceeded performance levels when present at work.for instance,colón received high marks on her and work performance evaluations.her evaluations from all described colón,among other complimentary descriptions,as a responsible,diligent,efficient,and positive worker who contributed to the goals of the office.these same evaluations from early to mid also marked colón as either good or superior in her performance levels.one of colón supervisors,julia lanzó,described colón work performance as excellent.based on these facts,a factfinder reasonably could determine that colón possessed the requisite skill,experience,and requirements for the position of auction officer.
however,our qualified individual inquiry does not end with an evaluation of the quality of colón work performance.the more pertinent question is whether colón established that she was able to perform her position essential functions without reasonable accommodation,and if not,whether any reasonable accommodation by her employer would allow her to do so.mulloy,at quoting phelps optima health,inc,cir.
an essential function is one that bear s more than a marginal relationship to the job at issue.chandler city of dallas,cir.it is a fundamental job duty that can extend beyond an employee technical skills and experience.calero cerezo dep t of justice,cir quoting ward.health research,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this court as well as the majority of circuit courts has recognized that attendance is an essential function of any job.ríos jiménez,at see also mulloy,at.on these facts,it is clear that regular attendance was an essential function of colón job.indeed,her job description,municipal regulation,and her supervisors testimony confirm that physical presence at her job was an understood expectation and requirement.the record reveals that colón can not show she met this essential function.
first,the same performance evaluations that colón contends the district court did not properly consider in evaluating her work performance repeatedly note that,regardless of her overall work performance,attendance was a continued area of needed improvement for colón.
second,the record shows that colón absenteeism was,dating well before her fibromyalgia diagnosis.a review of this evidence shows that in,the municipality approved one of colón requests for the advancement of sick leave eighteen days,but denied another request because colón attendance record showed her to be frequently absent from her job,presenting a pattern debt on account of sick leave.in,colón was absent approximately twenty percent of the time she was scheduled to work,and in,approximately percent of the time.from january,through april,colón,having exhausted all of her leaves,was on leave without pay.from at least may,through august,colón was on leave because of a foot injury.from november,through february,colón again was on leave without pay.in,colón was absent approximately percent of the time she was scheduled to work in,approximately percent of the time in,approximately percent of the time in,approximately percent of the time in,approximately nineteen percent of the time and in the year in which colón was diagnosed with fibromyalgia she was absent approximately thirty percent of her scheduled work time.
third,the record does not support colón assertion that,because the municipality never advised her of any consequences that might be incurred from her absences,attendance can not be deemed to have been an essential function of her position.the record suggests otherwise.
an internal document describing colón position establishes that physical attendance at work was a necessary aspect of her job.auction papers could not be removed from the office,and colón was required,among other duties,to draft bid notices,submit bid proposals for recommendations,submit recommendations to the board,attend openings and holdings of bids,direct administrative work,and communicate with other departments regarding bid matters or status,all of which required her physical presence in the office.indeed,colón notably has never argued that she could perform such duties from home.
further,the municipality manual regarding work schedule,attendance registry,accrual and use of leave expressly provides that the municipality may take disciplinary measures if an employee violates attendance norms by being frequently absent from work.the municipality policies also establish that employees are expected to attend work regularly and punctually.lastly,the evidence shows that colón received documentation on numerous occasions from the municipality as of at least advising her of her leave balance or exhaustion thereof reminding her of the municipality personnel regulations on her duty to comply with regular and punctual attendance informing her of docked pay due to overpayment after a period of unpaid leave and evaluating her attendance as unsatisfactory and in need of improvement 
fourth,colón does not deny her consistent lack of attendance throughout her employment.instead,she argues that it is not relevant for two reasons because the court ada analysis must be made as of the date of the challenged employment decision,which was when she requested and was denied a reserved parking spot and because a lack of available parking spaces,not her absenteeism,was the reason for which the municipality denied her a reserved parking space.colón arguments are incorrect.
colón pattern of absenteeism is relevant for purposes of assessing whether she is a qualified individual under the ada,and this determination,as previously stated,turns on whether colón can establish that she was able to perform her position essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation.the record,both and her diagnosis,makes overwhelmingly clear that colón could not satisfy regular attendance requirements.
moreover,and without addressing the reasonableness of the requested accommodation at issue,it is questionable whether colón ability to perform her position essential function of attendance would have improved with the granting of a reserved parking space.the evidence shows the municipality made extensive reasonable accommodations for colón throughout her years of employment without sanction or recrimination,including allowing colón to take sick leaves extending the duration of already granted sick leaves authorizing her to transfer leave balances from to her own exhausted balance assigning her an assistant,both to help with work coverage and to ensure that work would not be disrupted during colón unpredictable absences and offering her the use of handicapped spots with the appropriate identification card.none of these accommodations led to any improvement in colón attendance levels.
thus,regardless of colón noted skills or experience,her extensive absenteeism rendered her unqualified to perform her position functions,and this absenteeism recurred even with the municipality various reasonable accommodations over the years.see matzo postmaster,aff,holding that a secretary poor attendance record rendered her unqualified for her position,even though her skills,experience,and education were unexceptionable and coupled with uniformly favorable performance appraisals.for these reasons,we hold that colón was not a qualified individual under the ada.thus,her discrimination claim fails.
allegations of 
case law recognizes that an ada plaintiff need not succeed on a disability discrimination claim in order to assert a claim for retaliation.see soileau guilford of,cir.for colón to establish a retaliation claim,she must show that she was engaged in protected conduct suffered an adverse employment action and there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse action.carmona rivera puerto rico,cir see also wright compusa,cir.
the district court found,and we agree,that colón meets the first requirement.colón requested reasonable accommodation for her alleged disability in the form of a reserved parking space on october.colón followed up on her request on or about november.on november,she was informed that a reserved parking spot could not be assigned to her.
the municipality does not dispute that colón engaged in protected activity.instead,it contests colón ability to establish the second and third factors of a retaliation claim,colón can not show she suffered an adverse employment action that both caused her material harm and is linked to her request for a parking spot.
to establish an adverse employment action,colón must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.burlington santa fe ry.white,quoting rochon gonzáles,internal quotation marks omitted.for retaliatory action to be material,it must produce a significant,not trivial,harm,carmona rivera,at actions like petty slights,minor annoyances,and simple lack of good manners will not normally create such deterrence.burlington northern,at.however,demotions,disadvantageous transfers or assignments,refusals to promote,unwarranted negative job evaluations,and toleration of harassment by other employees may constitute adverse employment action,subject to the facts of a particular case.hernández torres intercont l trading,cir see also blackie maine,cir noting that adverse action determination requires a inquiry.
for causality to be established,the plaintiff must show a nexus between the protected conduct and the alleged retaliatory act.wright,at see also tobin liberty mut.ins,cir noting that to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that the defendant took an adverse employment action against him because of,in whole or in part,his protected conduct.one way of showing causation is by establishing that the employer knowledge of the protected activity was close in time to the employer adverse action.wyatt city of boston,cir.
we address each of colón alleged retaliatory acts in turn,relying on her categorization of the acts on appeal and applying an objective standard see burlington northern,at lockridge of me,cir test for retaliation is objective and should be judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff position,considering all the circumstances quoting burlington northern,at internal quotation marks omitted.
temporary removal of work equipment 
colón,relying on the testimony of adela otero,asserts the municipality eliminated her essential working tools in retaliation for her october request for a parking spot.otero testified in her deposition that sometime after colón returned to work following a absence unclear from the record as to when,colón had to work without a telephone for approximately two to three months.otero also testified that the municipality failed to provide colón with tools with which to carry out her work also unclear as to when,and in,following a absence,colón computer was taken away for several weeks,requiring her to complete all work manually.
colón supervisor,rodríguez,testified that no tools were withdrawn from a worker desk unless it was for short periods of time and for purposes of repair,such as an phone or malfunctioning computer.otero testimony does not contradict rodríguez assertions.otero testified that colón was without a computer and then they were cleaning the machines colón argues the district court improperly inferred from this testimony that employee work equipment sometimes was removed for the overall maintenance purpose of cleaning.we disagree.
the record shows that otero statement was in response to the question,you say that when colón returned to work in,that when she was without a computer otero testimony directly links the removal of colón equipment to the municipality maintenance practices.rodríguez testimony further compliments and clarifies otero testimony.and both testimonies establish that any such removal of colón office equipment was temporary.
additionally,even if the record did not clearly show a purpose for the removal of colón office equipment,colón offers no evidence,aside from otero testimony,showing that any removal of her work equipment was motivated by retaliatory intent.see randlett shalala,f d,cir stating that for plaintiff to prevail on summary judgment,she must show that any alleged adverse action was taken for the purpose of retaliating and point to some evidence of retaliation emphasis in original.at most,colón asserts there is no evidence that prior to her request for reasonable accommodation,her computer and telephone were taken away for months for cleaning purposes,and that the elimination of her working tools were part of the pattern of retaliatory acts against her.this is insufficient for purposes of establishing a genuine issue of material fact.see mesnick,cir not every discrepancy in the proof is enough to forestall a properly supported motion for summary judgment on issues where the nommovant bears the ultimate burden of proof,he must present definite,competent evidence.
withholding of paychecks 
colón submits that the municipality,in retaliation for her accommodation request,withheld her paychecks for four pay periods,including the months of july and august.colón does not provide specific dates for when her or refunded checks were issued,or when she actually received her reimbursed or refunded payments she instead asserts generally that she was not paid in july or august.
in contrast,the municipality provided evidence consisting of letters between the municipality and colón,letters between the human resources and executive departments,letters between the various finance offices,data processing sheets,and various refund notices supporting each instance when colón paychecks were delayed,withheld,docked,or otherwise irregular.the municipality also proffered an email communication in which colón contacted municipal secretary alicea on august,stating she had not received any payroll payment since july,alicea forwarded colón email that same day to human resources director antonio alvarez torres stating,i request your help in processing this case promptly that same day,the municipality issued a check to colón for.
the record additionally shows that the municipality issued fourteen payroll checks to colón between may,and december,all of which were signed and cashed.thus,although colón contests the municipality position that any withheld,docked,or delayed paychecks were paid justifiably attributable to days owed or insufficient remaining sick or annual leave,the evidence clearly shows otherwise.
colón raises additional arguments.colón claims the district court failed to consider evidence showing that other employees who previously owed days or exhausted their leave balance still have received their paycheck or not suffered as long a delay in receiving their reimbursement,all of which she asserts is indicative of the municipality retaliatory intent in withholding or delaying her paychecks.
the record shows the district court did in fact consider such evidence,specifically,the testimony of employee adela otero,an administrative officer ii for the municipality,who testified that other employees with no remaining leave balance received refund checks whereas colón allegedly did not.colón fontánez,d at.further,the record does not support the contention that colón failed to receive payment,whether in the form of refund checks or otherwise.thus,we do not find this testimony to be sufficient for purposes of establishing a genuine issue of material fact as to retaliation.
colón also asserts that the municipality decision to withhold plaintiff paycheck was discriminatory and in retaliation for colón decision to request reasonable accommodation.we have two responses.
first,colón offers no evidence showing retaliatory intent associated with the delay in payment,or evidence establishing that the delay exceeded that attributable to general workplace bureaucracy or administrative processing.carmona rivera,f d at.at most,colón asserts that she was the only employee who suffered such delays.in testimony,however,colón conceded that other also had checks withheld for at least a week period,thus weakening any alleged retaliatory intent.
second,colón offers no evidence linking the withheld payments to her parking spot request.randlett,at to make out a retaliation claim requires not only an adverse employment action and previously protected conduct,but also a colorable showing that a causal connection existed between the protected conduct and the adverse action.quoting fennell first step designs,cir.the most she offers is the unsupported assertion that in all years prior to her parking spot request,she never went several pay periods without payment,whereas months after her accommodation request,she did.
the record shows the municipality customarily docked her pay,or sent letters indicating a reduction in a subsequent paycheck,well before colón parking request.furthermore,the contested withheld payments date from summer,well over seven months after colón accommodation request this is insufficient for purposes of establishing causality.see calero cerezo,at noting that t hree and four month periods have been held insufficient to establish a causal connection based on temporal proximity.
because there is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude the alleged payment delays resulted from either intentional discrimination or retaliatory behavior,colón claim as to this alleged retaliatory act fails.
changes in colón work schedule 
colón claims that on february,she sent a request to rodríguez to make a change in her work schedule so that colón could attend medical appointments because rodríguez never answered colón request,she lost the balance of her leaves,which constituted a retaliatory act for colón parking spot request.we find no merit to colón argument.
colón testified that she never followed up with rodríguez following her initial submission of the work change request.specifically,the testimony provided 
q okay.then you also told me and correct me if i wrong,that you never did that,you never followed up.you sent an electronic mail and did not give any follow up of any kind 
a well,i did follow up 
this evidence,that rodríguez simply never responded to what likely was one of numerous emails received over the course of a month in her supervisory position and indeed,what has proved to be one of colón various requests for accommodation is not sufficient for purposes of establishing a causal connection to her parking spot request.see kosereis rhode island,cir affirming district court grant of summary judgment on plaintiff retaliation claim where plaintiff failed to show causal connection between the protected conduct and alleged retaliatory act.
it also is not sufficient to show retaliatory intent,particularly where the evidence shows that,outside of this isolated incident,the municipality made repeated efforts to accommodate colón absences due to her health over the course of nearly two decades.carmona rivera,at soileau,at evidence that an employer willingly granted an employee request for an accommodation militate s against making an inference of retaliation.
lastly,colón admitted in her deposition that the municipality subsequently approved a change in her work schedule in march,permitting her to attend her medical appointments without affecting her leave balance.thus,the record does not show colón materially suffered on account of her accommodation request.colón failure to proffer evidence showing significant harm or retaliatory intent is detrimental to her claim that rodríguez failure to respond constituted retaliation.
delayed approval of outlook computer training 
colón argues that rodríguez delayed approval of her request to participate in a computer training workshop constituted an adverse employment action.colón fails to show how any delay was intentional,material,or causally connected to her request for a parking spot.
colón testified that she submitted her request for the september,training on august,but that she never followed up with rodríguez as to the status of her request.although colón stated that she believed any with rodríguez would have been futile because rodríguez refused to meet with her,we do not see any evidence indicating intentional delay.see carmona rivera,at finding that district court properly granted summary judgment on retaliation claim because plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of a retaliatory intent associated with the delay in implementing her requests,or any evidence which shows that the delay was anything beyond that inherent in the workings of plaintiff workplace bureaucracy.
even construing the record in colón favor as to intentional delay,her claim still fails.to establish an adverse employment action,colón must show she suffered material harm due to the delay.see id.the most that colón alleges is that the lack of computer training would affect her progress and evolution as a professional.this conclusory allegation is not sufficient for purposes of establishing a significant,not trivial,harm that rises above mere inconvenience.ingram brink,cir stating that summary judgment can not be defeated by relying on improbable inferences,conclusory allegations,or rank speculation.
additionally,even if we were to determine that colón showed material harm,she still bears the burden of showing that the alleged adverse action,the approval delay,was taken for the purpose of retaliating.randlett,at emphasis in original.colón points us to no evidence showing that rodríguez delayed her september approval of colón participation in the workshop because of colón october request for a parking spot,nearly a year after the contested reasonable accommodation.the alleged approval delay occurred approximately eleven months following colón reasonable accommodation request this is not sufficient to establish causality between the two events.see clark cnty.sch.dist.breeden.
negative memorandum against colón 
colón contends the district court failed to properly consider her next alleged retaliatory act,a requested disciplinary memorandum.in a sworn statement,colón ruth carmona stated that rodríguez asked for my advise sic in order to issue a disciplinary memo against nitza colón but i refused.the district court noted that carmona sworn statement was undated.colón fontánez,d at.it further noted a lack of specificity in carmona testimony as to when rodríguez allegedly requested the disciplinary memorandum of carmona.id.
colón asserts that specificity,at least as to rodríguez alleged instruction,was established from carmona statement that the work environment towards colón became hostile a fter nitza colón requested a reasonable accommodation,and that i n sic one occasion,the director asked me to issue a disciplinary memorandum.we agree with the district court that these broadly phrased time estimates are far too general for purposes of determining when the alleged adverse employment action occurred.
moreover,even if we were to determine that causality is met because the alleged memorandum request occurred close in time to colón accommodation request,see wyatt,at,colón offers no evidence showing that she suffered material harm from rodríguez instruction.see burlington northern,u.at.indeed,the record indicates otherwise as no disciplinary memorandum ever was issued.
elimination of supervisory duties 
colón asserts that rodríguez retaliated against her when rodríguez removed colón assistant,yesiree alemán,from colón supervision,effectively eliminating her supervisory duties.the record shows that alemán was assigned to the auction department in,with julia lanzó acting as her immediate supervisor.in,rodríguez and lanzó assigned alemán to be colón assistant due to her precarious health condition.though the specific date of alemán transfer from being in alemán words colón direct and exclusive assistant to an assistant for anyone else including colón who needed me in the department is not clear from the record,both colón and alemán testimony agree that the transfer occurred sometime in after colón request for a parking spot.
construing the record in colón favor,we presume she can establish temporal proximity as to the alleged elimination of her duties and her parking space request.we therefore focus our analysis on whether colón can show the alleged adverse action constituted material harm.
case law acknowledges that a change in an employee responsibilities may be sufficient to establish an adverse employment action.see blackie,at noting a discharge,demotion,reduction in salary,divestiture of significant responsibilities,or withholding of recognition may be sufficient to constitute a materially adverse employment action see also connell bank of boston,cir stating a discharge,demotion,or failure to promote may adversely affect an employee.this is not the case here.
colón offers no evidence showing the alleged elimination of her supervisory position rose to the level of material harm.first,colón testimony casts doubt upon the supervisory nature of her alleged managerial position.colón testified that,although alemán was her assistant,colón was not responsible for evaluating alemán performance rather,evaluations were always done by the manager or the director.
further,the evidence shows that colón received alemán as her assistant on account of her unpredictable yet recurring absences,not because of any promotion in employee status,raise in salary,or change in job title.specifically,both lanzó and alemán testified during deposition that alemán was assigned to colón to ensure there would be no disruption of duties and to assure that colón work would be managed in her absence.further,upon the alleged elimination of supervisory duties,colón suffered no demotion,salary reduction,position reclassification,or loss of rank or prominence in her department.
although colón generally argues she suffered the lost sic of respect from her and an exacerbation of her health condition from the elimination of her alleged supervisory duties,colón argument misses the mark.because colón failed to proffer facts showing how alemán significantly affected her alleged prior authority,we fail to see how the transfer constituted a materially adverse action.see simas first citizens fed.credit union,cir noting case law holding that divesting an employee of significant assignments or substantial responsibilities may be sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action.as the district court noted,the municipality assignment of alemán to colón sounds like more of an accommodation than a retaliation,and an employer act of accommodation generally tends to militate against making an inference of retaliation.soileau,at.
reassignment of colón duties in the women affairs department 
colón asserts as her next retaliatory act rodríguez alleged elimination of her work duties for the department of women affairs alemán testified that in rodríguez held a personnel meeting in which it was declared that colón would no longer be in charge of the department for women integral development,and that her work would be reassigned to someone else in the department.in a sworn statement,rodríguez asserted,first,that she regularly did reassignments in the auction department to get things moving.these reassignments are done from time to time,in order to meet manpower gaps that the auction department has.rodríguez noted that the purpose of such reassignments was to prevent backlogs and ensure that all matters remained current,although she also acknowledged that the department of women affairs seldom required attention.second,rodríguez stated that her reassignment of colón work in this department was not on account of her health condition rather,it was to assist nitza colón in meeting her work levels requirements and to give nitza colón breathing space so that she could otherwise manage her absenteeism situation.
colón argument as to reassignment parallels her argument as to the alleged elimination of her supervisory duties,rodríguez eliminated certain work responsibilities of colón following her accommodation request and this constituted retaliation.colón argument holds little water.colón herself in testimony estimated that the alleged reassignment of her departmental duties occurred in november,approximately one year after her parking space request.as previously set forth,a near twelve month passage of time between the asserted protected conduct and alleged adverse action weighs against a finding of causality.see calero cerezo,at stating that three and four month periods have been held insufficient for purposes of establishing causality based on temporal proximity.
moreover,even assuming causality can be established,colón articulates no facts showing how the alleged reassignment caused her significant harm or substantially altered her job responsibilities.see blackie,at simas,at.indeed,even though colón acknowledges rodríguez assertion that the department of women affairs rarely produces work for the auction department and it does not require significant attention,colón does not counter it.this weighs against a finding that any loss or reassignment of duties in this area caused colón significant harm or materially altered her job responsibilities 
hostile work environment claim 
in addition to her various alleged acts of retaliation,colón also asserts that the municipality retaliated against her by subjecting her to a hostile work environment.to establish a hostile work environment,a plaintiff must show that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and create an abusive working environment.quiles quiles henderson,cir alterations in original quoting harris forklift,internal quotation mark omitted.
assessing whether the work environment is hostile or abusive must be answered by reference to all the circumstances.marrero goya of,cir quoting harris,at.while t here is no mathematically precise test to determine whether a plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that she was subjected to a severely or pervasively hostile work environment,pomales celulares telefónica,cir second alteration in original quoting kosereis,at,courts have recognized the following factors,among others,as relevant the severity of the conduct its frequency and whether it unreasonably interfered with the victim work performance.see also ríos jiménez,at.we note that our role is to distinguish between the ordinary,if occasionally unpleasant,vicissitudes of the workplace and actual harassment.noviello city of boston,cir.
case law is clear that simple teasing,offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment to establish an objectively hostile or abusive work environment.faragher city of boca raton,citation omitted quoting oncale sundowner offshore.colón allegations do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness that we have recognized as indicative of a hostile or abusive work environment.
for instance,colón alleges that when she would stop by rodríguez office,rodríguez would refuse to meet with her in violation of her supervisory duties.although rodríguez permitted other employees to come and go from her office,rodríguez avoided colón,required colón to wait,restricted colón access to her,and refused to amicably greet her in general encounters.on one occasion,rodríguez threw colón and a out of her office,yelling at them in front of other municipality employees.rodríguez then permitted the witnessing employees to enter her office without yelling at them.rodríguez ordered colón assistant,yesiree alemán,to return to her desk whenever she tried to discuss cases or prepare reports with colón.rodríguez failed to take action against various employees who made comments against colón.when colón asked rodríguez to hold a meeting with her fellow to discuss their derogatory comments towards her,rodríguez refused the request.colón general movements throughout the office were limited if she left her desk to go to the bathroom,colón supervisor,or someone designated by her,would follow her.in,when other were invited to participate in a contracts workshop,colón was not allowed to participate,even though colón previously had engaged in such activities.
while these facts certainly indicate an uncomfortable and tense working relationship between colón and rodríguez,again,they are not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment.see generally rosario dep t of the army,cir marrero,city of providence,cir.
furthermore,although rodríguez interactions with colón may be described as brusque and even uncivil,we note that a supervisor unprofessional managerial approach and accompanying efforts to assert her authority are not the focus of the discrimination laws.lee crespo schering plough del caribe,cir.even construing the facts in colón favor,as we are required to do,the evidence does not support a hostile work environment claim.the incidents described are episodic,but not frequent,in nature upsetting,but not severe mildly humiliating,but not physically threatening.id.at.lastly,such acts do not appear to have affected her overall work performance in fact colón,both below and on appeal,repeatedly has asserted to the contrary.see id.
colón additionally points to the following evidence as indicative of a hostile work environment told colón on several occasions to get on social security or apply for disability so that she could receive an assured check called her a hypochondriac claimed she was faking it or generally isolated her from general workplace interactions.again,while not questioning the discomfort such workplace interactions produce,these allegations are not sufficient for establishing an objectively hostile and abusive work environment.see suárez pueblo int l,cir the workplace is not a cocoon,and those who labor in it are expected to have reasonably thick skins to survive the ordinary slings and arrows that workers routinely encounter in a hard,cold world.
because the alleged acts of retaliation here do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness that a reasonable employee would find to have materially altered the conditions of her employment such that an abusive work environment was created,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as to a hostile work environment claim.
district court sua sponte dismissal of colón equal protection claim 
colón remaining argument on appeal is that the district court improperly dismissed her equal protection claim sua sponte because the municipality never moved for its dismissal in its motion for summary judgment.we begin with colón alleged claim.
the only reference to an equal protection claim that we can find in the record is in the jurisdiction section to colón amended complaint,in which she asserts also,the equal protection clause of the constitution is proclaimed.colón does not include the claim as a separate cause of action in the complaint she does not incorporate it into her other causes of action she makes no factual or legal argument in support of this claim in her amended complaint or other subsequent pleading or even on this appeal and she makes no reference to it in her opposition to summary judgment motion.see ruiz rivera pfizer,llc,cir finding no error where district court did not review a fleeting and inadequate claim that plaintiff only raised in her complaint introductory paragraph,which she did not raise as a separate cause of action,and to which she pled no supporting facts.
in short,colón makes a,legally and factually unsupported,emaciated assertion of an equal protection claim to secure the district court federal jurisdiction over her case.we have warned parties before that trial judges are not mind readers,and that i f claims are merely insinuated rather than actually articulated,courts are not required to make determinations on them.mccoy.inst.of,cir see also harriman hancock,f d,cir it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.quoting united states zannino,cir paterson leitch.mun.wholesale,cir a party has a duty to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly instead of being allowed to defeat the system by seeding the record with mysterious references to unpled claims.
moreover,even if colón one sentence claim,bereft of any legal citation or factual analysis,could be deemed to have required notice of its potential exposure to the winds of dismissal for failure to state a justiciable claim further notice,of course,aside from colón having already sought to amend her complaint and having fully responded to the municipality summary judgment motion which sought to effectively remove all of her listed causes of action from the court consideration,leaving as her only potential claim on which to prop herself before the federal court jurisdiction her alleged equal protection claim not every sua sponte dismissal entered without prior notice to the plaintiff automatically must be reversed.gonzález gonzález united states,cir.if it is crystal clear that the plaintiff can not prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile,then a sua sponte dismissal may stand.id.
here,the record shows that colón already was afforded the opportunity to amend her complaint,into which she planted the seed of an equal protection claim.but she buried and abandoned the seed in the complaint jurisdiction section,failing to support it with factual or legal arguments,or to even address it again whether in that pleading or in any other pleading,motion,or brief.thus,we can not see how a subsequent opportunity to amend would be anything but futile.colón can not reap what she has not sown.
further,any remand here is unnecessary because colón claim clearly fail s to survive the proper rule a notice pleading standard.cepero rivera fagundo,cir.rule a requires that a pleading stating a claim for relief must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a however,there must be sufficient detail in the complaint to give a defendant fair notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it rests.ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.that is,the plain statement must possess enough heft to show that the pleader is entitled to relief,and it requires more than an unadorned,accusation.sánchez pereira castillo,cir quoting ashcroft iqbal,internal quotation marks omitted.colón claim here lacks any legal or factual authority or supportive detail.she can not bury a blatantly inadequately pled claim in her complaint on the hope that it might spring to life like a forgotten upon the court disposal of all of her other alleged claims.we therefore find no error in the district court determination not to consider colón entirely unarticulated equal protection claim.see ruiz rivera,at.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
although colón references an equal protection claim in her amended complaint,she does not list it in the complaint causes of action or provide any legal or factual argument supporting it.we address both the substance and merits of this alleged claim infra,as it is an issue raised on appeal.
employee positions and department titles are not consistently translated in the record.to maintain uniformity,we refer to colón department as the auction department and to her title at the time she requested a parking spot as auction officer.
although the record shows reference to several health conditions or illnesses for which colón sought leave,we limit our analysis to the alleged disability at issue here,fibromyalgia,for which colón sought reasonable accommodation and because of which she allegedly suffered retaliatory actions.
as will be addressed subsequently,we make no comment as to whether colón alleged health condition constituted a disability for purposes of her ada claim.we offer this testimony solely for purposes of providing additional background color to the factual palette.
additional details concerning colón attendance record will be addressed infra when considering her arguments on appeal.
a letter from the municipality dated june,provided that colón leave period for her foot treatment would be for three months.it also stated that s ame was effective from march,and shall extend until august.it is unclear from the record whether the march,date was a typo,as all prior correspondence between colón and the municipality regarding her leave request refers to may.for purposes of our review,we need not determinatively resolve this matter as it remains clear that colón was on leave for at least a quarter of the calendar year.
neither party has provided the court with information concerning colón attendance record for the years and.
colón also alleged an equal protection claim in the jurisdiction section of her amended complaint,to be addressed infra.
only exhibits,and presently do not have a corresponding english translation available.because it does not appear from the record as if any translation ever was provided as to these four exhibits,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to consider them.
interestingly,appellee does not argue this point.instead,appellee seems to concede,with no reference to the record,that english translations were provided for the balance of the exhibits.this unsubstantiated statement is insufficient for purposes of confirming when or if these exhibits were,at first blush on our review,it appeared as though english translations had been provided for the contested exhibits because we located them in the appellate record.however,the translated exhibits appear immediately after colón index of exhibits,which according to the district court docket,was filed with exhibit attachments on september,but none of which were translated.docket.further confirming this point,colón filed a motion for an extension of time by which to file translations for the submitted exhibits on september,see docket,which the court granted in part that same day,giving colón until october,to file the english translations.docket.on october and,colón filed three different motions to submit certified translations,which did not include exhibits,and.
though the district court set a deadline of october,for the filing of the certified exhibit translations,the record shows that the district court accepted the later filing of exhibit on october.see docket.
we note that the district court listed ex
