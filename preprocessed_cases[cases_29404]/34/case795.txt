background 
on april,detective matt messer,then a major crimes detective in the grant county sherriff department in washington state,received a tip that an unidentified person was communicating online with a mother in washington who had disseminated a nude photo of her daughter and wanted to involve the daughter in sexual acts.detective messer located and interviewed the mother,who admitted to sexually abusing her daughter whom we identify as ko to protect her privacy for the past few months and regularly using a webcam to broadcast the abuse online.detective messer then executed a search warrant at ko mother apartment and seized a desktop computer and a webcam.
on may,and again on june,fbi agents logged in to ko mother yahoo instant messenger account.on both occasions,the agents found an unread message sent by micheal ledee to ko mother.the first message read yw you welcome i would definitely put the tip of my dick in her and put my whole d ick inside you.gov t app.the second message read d amn,my dick is so hard when i see you and your daughter that night was hot i hope i get to see the both of you again.gov t app.

in an indictment filed march,ledee was charged with conspiracy to sexually exploit a child e,et,sexual exploitation of a child a,e,et,and receipt of child pornography a,b,et.
on march,prior to trial,the government moved to close the courtroom during ko testimony pursuant to e.section e permits such closure,on conditions which the government argued were met,to all persons who do not have a direct interest in the case.in support,the government submitted an affidavit from ko father and legal guardian,who has had custody of ko following her mother arrest.ko father stated that although ko is normally outgoing,she is uncomfortable speaking in private about her sexual abuse and has said that she does not want to testify with members of the public and the press present in the courtroom.ko father further stated that ko is aware that men witnessed her sexual abuse online and that after her mother arrest was covered by the local news in ko hometown,people would stop ko to express sympathy,which caused ko to break down in tears.finally,ko father stated that he did not believe that ko would be able to communicate effectively if the courtroom were not closed.
at a subsequent conference,ledee orally opposed the motion to the extent that it would bar ledee parents from the courtroom during ko testimony.the district judge asked the government whether ko father would object to ledee parents being present and,after a short recess to confirm with ko father,the government told the district judge that he did object.the district judge also asked the public if anyone would like to voice support or objection to the closure motion and received no response.the district judge then orally granted the government motion to close the courtroom during ko testimony and,on april,filed a memorandum order explaining his decision.united states ledee,cr,wl.the district judge held that ensuring ko uninhibited testimony was an overriding interest that would likely be prejudiced unless the courtroom were closed and that such closure during ko testimony would be no broader than necessary to protect that interest.id.at.
at trial and just prior to ko testifying,the district judge asked everyone in the gallery to leave the courtroom and confirmed with the parties that everyone remaining in the courtroom had a direct interest in the case.at least people remained,including court staff,the legal teams,the jurors and alternates,and ko father.after ko testimony,the district judge reopened the courtroom to the public.the district court did not restrict the subsequent preparation and dissemination of the transcript that included ko testimony.
following trial,the jury found ledee guilty of all three counts.the district judge sentenced ledee to months imprisonment and lifetime supervised release.
ledee now appeals here.
discussion 
this appeal raises the single issue of whether,by excluding the defendant ledee parents from the trial during the victim testimony,the district court violated ledee right to a public trial under the sixth amendment.
we examine the district court findings of fact for clear error,its legal determinations de novo,and its ultimate decision to deny or grant a motion for closure for abuse of discretion.united states doe,cir.but because the district court discretion is significantly circumscribed by constitutional principles set forth by the supreme court,this court review is more rigorous than would be the case in other situations in which review is conducted.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
under the pertinent statute,a district court may close the courtroom to everyone who do es not have a direct interest in the case when a child victim of physical or sexual abuse testifies if the court determines that not doing so would cause substantial psychological harm to the child or would result in the child inability to effectively communicate.e.but the constitution of the united states circumscribes this discretion.the sixth amendment provides,in relevant part,that the accused shall enjoy the right to a public trial.const.amend.vi.this right,however,may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests such circumstances will be rare,and the balance of interests must be struck with special care.waller georgia.in order to close the courtroom in compliance with the sixth amendment,the closure must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding and the trial court must make findings adequate to support the closure.united states smith,cir citing waller,at.
i.the interest prejudiced 
notwithstanding that the closure must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,the more extensive the closure that is sought,the greater the burden on the party seeking closure.see doe,at.i f a party seeks a broad closure,it must demonstrate that the interest that the closure would purportedly serve is especially grave,and that the risk that would be posed to that interest by not closing the courtroom is more than serious.bowden keane,cir inte
