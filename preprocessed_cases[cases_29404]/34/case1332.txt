opinion of the court 
in july,a jury found jake kelly kelly guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g and e.soon after the jury verdict,kelly moved for a new trial,arguing,inter alia,that he had recently discovered new evidence of his hearsay statement of victor jones,who purportedly admitted to possessing the gun for which kelly was arrested.after an evidentiary hearing at which jones testified,the district court granted kelly motion in part and ordered a new trial.the government appeals the district court order,arguing that the court abused its discretion in granting kelly motion.specifically,the government contends that the district court erred in concluding that kelly had exercised sufficient diligence in regard to the discovery of the new evidence and the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal at a new trial.for the reasons stated below,we will reverse the order of the district court granting kelly motion for a new trial and remand for the entry of a judgment of conviction and sentence.
background 
i.the record at trial 
on september,kelly was charged in a indictment with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g and e.on july,the matter proceeded to trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.
at trial,the jury heard testimony that,on may,approximately nineteen officers and inspectors from the philadelphia police department vice enforcement unit and narcotics strike force,the philadelphia department of licenses and inspections,and the pennsylvania state police conducted an open inspection of café breezes,a row house bar located at columbia avenue.at about that morning,two plainclothes decoy officers entered the bar to determine whether any illegal activity was taking place.app.after being inside for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes,the decoy officers contacted corporal raymond drummond of the vice enforcement unit,who then led the rest of the officers into the bar,announced their presence,and explained that they were there to conduct an open inspection.the government called three of the officers present that morning,including corporal drummond,to recount the morning events.
the officers testified that the bar within café breezes was in the shape of a backward l,with the short side of the bar positioned closest to the establishment front door.officer donna stewart,a member of the narcotics strike force,stated that once she entered café breezes,she placed herself between the bar and the front door and monitored the patrons closest to her,while other officers monitored the patrons at the other end of the bar.according to officer stewart,there were six people sitting toward the front of the bar,two of which were the decoy officers a man,later determined to be kelly,was seated on the far right of the short section of the bar two unidentified women sat to his left and an unidentified man sat around the corner of the bar to kelly right.the unidentified man sat at the first barstool on the long section of the bar,and the decoy cops sat directly to his right.
officer stewart testified that,almost immediately,she took note of kelly,as he was looking around,kept looking over his shoulder,he looked in my direction,he looked in the direction of the door.he appeared to be following the other officers as they walked into the bar with his eyes.he started to sweat,he was fidgeting on his barstool,he could stay still.app.officer stewart eventually left the front of the bar to speak with her partner,officer brant miles,another of the officers the government called at trial.according to officer stewart,she returned to her post at the front of the the wall between kelly and the female seated to his maybe ten seconds.app.at that point,officer stewart observed that kelly was leaned over,crunched over in his seat with his hands below the bar where i could see them and he stopped fidgeting.he kept moving his head around,he kept looking around but he had stopped moving his body.app.officer stewart next described the following events 
when i returned to the front of the bar i stood there for maybe another minute or two,just keeping an eye on everyone,keeping an eye on the defendant.a vice officer asked someone for their id much further down the bar.it was at that point that the defendant reached quickly towards his back.at that point i stopped him,i put my hands on him,i had him put his hands on the bar.i walked around behind the defendant so i was standing between the defendant and the female to his left and at that point i had him stand up.as he stood up,the gun fell from his lap,it was about.it fell down along his left leg,it hit the brass chair rail at the base of the bar with a loud metal clang and then it landed on the floor.i yelled gun.other officers rushed up towards me,they placed handcuffs on the defendant and i recovered the weapon from the floor.
both corporal drummond and officer miles testified that they heard officer stewart yell gun app,officer miles testified that he heard a preceding thud app.neither corporal drummond nor officer miles testified that he saw the gun fall from kelly lap,as both men were positioned at different locations along the bar.after recovering the gun,officer stewart gave it to officer miles,who removed the magazine and a bullet from the chamber.
the government final witness at trial,officer ernest bottomer of the philadelphia police department firearms identification unit,testified that the weapon in question was indeed a firearm as defined by federal law and that he could not retrieve a serial number from the firearm.the parties ultimately stipulated that the gun qualified as a firearm for the purpose of the statute under which kelly was charged the firearm had been manufactured outside of pennsylvania and prior to may,kelly had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year within the meaning of g.united states kelly,crim,wl,at.kelly offered several photographs of café breezes into evidence,but called no witnesses on his behalf 
on july,the jury found kelly guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g and e.
ii.proceedings 
not long after the trial ended,kelly retained new counsel,who,on august,filed a motion for new trial and leave to supplement pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure rule on kelly behalf leave to supplement was granted,and kelly filed his counseled supplemental motion on october.in that motion,kelly argued,inter alia,that he had recently discovered evidence of his innocence that justified the granting of a new trial.kelly attached to the motion a statement from kemahsiah gant gant,a friend of kelly,that described a conversation between gant and a mutual acquaintance,victor jones jones,who was at café breezes the night of kelly arrest.according to gant statement,sometime in the summer of,she was talking to jones about kelly gun charge,and jones told her that the gun was not jake gun the police found jones said he had the gun.when the police came in,he got nervous and threw it down on the floor.app.when gant asked jones why he had not come forward earlier,jones did not answer.a few weeks later,after struggling with the decision,gant recounted the conversation to kelly girlfriend,jackie cephas cephas,who encouraged gant to speak with kelly lawyer.about a month and a half later,gant did so.gant statement was given just two days before kelly filed his supplemental motion for a new trial.
on june,after briefing on the motion was complete,the district court held an evidentiary hearing to address kelly newly discovered evidence claim.at the hearing,kelly called three witnesses gant,cephas,and jones 
as the first witness to take the stand,gant testified that she had known cephas,kelly,and jones each for approximately eight years as of the date of the hearing.in the past,gant,cephas,and jones had all worked at the same company and lived on the same block the block of wynnewood road in philadelphia,about eleven blocks from café breezes.though gant eventually moved to another neighborhood within the city,cephas and gant described as good friends app remained.when asked by defense counsel how kelly fit into the circle of friends,gant testified that she had known kelly as long as she known jackie cephas.app.kelly and cephas had been dating a bout on and off for eight years.app.
according to gant testimony,the circle of friends would all hang out at café breezes,a neighborhood bar where gant considered herself a regular patron and where jones,kelly,and cephas would frequent e very week.app.though gant was not at café breezes the morning of kelly arrest,people at the bar told her that kelly had been arrested f or a gun when she arrived there later that day.app.
on july,as support for jackie and also jake,gant accompanied cephas to court for the reading of kelly verdict.app.about a week or so later,after an unsuccessful attempt at visiting cephas,gant stopped by to see jones,who lived only a half a block away from cephas.app.gant explained that she and jones were having a general conversation about who amongst their friends would be the next to get married.gant surmised that it would have been cephas and kelly were it not for kelly being in prison.at that point in the conversation,gant testified that jones paused and said,i have something to tell you.app.when gant asked what it was,jones stated,it was jake gun.app.jones then revealed that it was he who had the gun and threw it on the floor.gant asked,well,why did you say anything app.jones never responded.
a few weeks after this conversation,gant approached cephas with what she had learned cephas asked gant to speak with kelly attorney,but gant initially refused.sometime in september,however,gant changed her mind,and on october,she met with willard brown brown,an investigator for kelly attorney.according to gant,during her conversation with brown,he drafted a statement,which she reviewed and signed.it was this statement that served as the basis for kelly supplemental motion for a new trial.gant never returned the telephone calls of the government investigator,chris lee.
when asked if she had any discussions about the substance of kelly case with either jones,cephas,or kelly between the date of kelly arrest and his subsequent conviction,gant testified that she had not.according to gant,she never asked any questions about kelly case because she did not want to get involved at all and because she had her own issues at the time.
the second witness to testify at the evidentiary hearing was cephas,kelly girlfriend of over eight years.at the beginning of her testimony,cephas was asked several questions about her relationships with kelly,gant,and jones.she confirmed that she had been romantically involved with kelly for going on nine years as of the date of the hearing.app.as to her relationship with gant,cephas described her as a good friend app,who she met initially through work and who,in the past,lived three,four doors down from cephas on wynnewood road.app.cephas met jones through work as well,and the two f riends app.see also app.ended up living on the same block,the block of wynnewood road app.though gant had moved from the neighborhood,cephas and jones continued to live on the same block.cephas explained that kelly knew gant and jones through her and that the group would socialize together at café breezes.cephas was not at café breezes the night of kelly arrest.
when asked about her contact with jones between kelly may,arrest and his july,conviction,cephas testified that she certainly would have seen jones during that time period because,we live on the same block and we friends.app.the two did not,however,discuss kelly case other than cephas mentioning that kelly was going to court.cephas further testified that both she and kelly got together with jones at café breezes m aybe about twenty times after kelly arrest and before his conviction app.according to cephas,when she,kelly,jones,and gant were together before kelly conviction,the group did not speak about kelly case.and when asked by the court,were there any discussions before the verdict between you and kelly and gant and jones either together or separately about the gun,cephas responded,about the gun,no.no.app.
as to her conversation with gant,cephas explained that,a couple of weeks after the verdict,gant came to her and told her,you know,jones told me he was there the night when jake got arrested and he threw the gun and jake was apprehended for it.app.after learning this,cephas contacted kelly attorney without first contacting kelly,who expressed interest in having one of his investigators speak to gant and jones.for a few weeks,gant refused to speak with anyone,but eventually she agreed.in the meantime,cephas testified that she confronted jones about what gant had told her,asking him,why did you tell me you could have told me before you told her.according to cephas,jones said nothing in response,he just looked dazed and straight as if he knew he was wrong.app.
cephas testified that,although she and kelly did not frequently speak about his case,when they did discuss the case,kelly just kept on saying it was his gun.app,see also app.kelly did not explain anything more about the circumstances surrounding his arrest.in fact,kelly never told cephas that jones was at café breezes the night of the arrest,and cephas did not find out that jones was at the bar until her conversation with gant.
the last of the defense witnesses to take the stand was jones.jones confirmed that he lived on the block of wynnewood road,the same block as cephas,and described cephas as one of my best friends.app.see also app.me and jackie work lives conflicted but because she is a good friend of mine,i mean i would go to her house any time of the night or any time of the day,it did really matter.he testified that he was friends with kelly through cephas app,see also app.and that,although he and kelly would not go out together without her,the two men would talk and hang out when they were together.
as to café breezes,jones described it as a spot where,a t some point,jones,cephas,kelly,and gant would go every tuesday,thursday,friday and also saturdays.app.jones and kelly were both at café breezes on may,the morning of kelly arrest.app.when first asked if he had been drinking that night,jones responded,not a lot.app.later in his testimony,however,jones volunteered that he was so drunk that the room was spinning.app.
jones painted a picture of a very crowded bar with no empty seats and people standing all around him.app,i mean,there was people were bumping into me all night,it was pretty tight,app.there was people standing next to me,there were people standing behind me,there was people on both sides,there were people standing all around me.he testified that when the police entered café breezes,he was sitting on the long side of the inverted bar in the first seat closest to the front door,and kelly was sitting around the corner to his left,on the short side of the l shape.see app.w e were kind of next to each other.when asked to describe,in his own words,what happened when he first realized that the police were present,jones set the following scene 
i was sitting at the bar.i had pretty much done drinking,i did want to drink any more,i was ready to go.there was a little bit of pushing,somebody pushed my shoulder,kind of like my back but people were brushing into me all night.somebody brushed into me and somebody put something in my lap and it was a gun.and i pushed it off of my lap onto the floor.
app.jones at first could not remember from which direction the gun came and in which direction he pushed it off his lap,but when pressed on cross examination,jones provided several additional details.jones deduced that the gun came from probably the right side of me,more so than the left side of me app,and fell in front of him,slightly to his left,because he brushed it with his left hand.as the gun fell,it first hit the base of the bar,which was wood,and then dropped to the tile floor,making a clackety sound app it did not hit the metal bar at jones feet.jones turned around to see who dropped the gun in his lap,but could not tell who did it.according to jones,there were no or him and kelly after the gun dropped to the floor.jones did not provide any details about kelly actual arrest he did testify that at some point after the gun fell to the floor,the police swarmed the corner of the bar and recovered the gun.app.
jones testified that he was pretty sure that the gun he pushed from his lap was the same gun for which kelly was arrested.app.though jones thought that kelly was wrongly arrested,he did not say anything because he did want to have anything to do with it.app.between kelly arrest and his conviction,jones did not speak to anyone about what happened that night.after jones admitted on to seeing kelly anywhere from one to three times after kelly arrest,the following exchange occurred between jones and the government 
q did he kelly he ever talk to you about his criminal case 
q did he ever ask you what happened 
q he never said to you hey,victor,you were sitting right next to me,did you see who threw the gun 
q he never mentioned his criminal case at all to you,at all 
a we did discuss the case.actually,when i was,at the time i was seeing him i really thought it was over.i did know that he still had a case.when i saw him after that incident his arrest i assumed that it was over.
toward the end of his direct testimony,jones was asked to describe the conversation he had with gant after kelly conviction.according to jones,gant stopped by his apartment,where the two were just hanging out for a minute,and gant asked him if he had heard what happened to kelly.app.gant told jones that kelly was in jail on the gun charge,and jones responded that that was fucked up because it the gun was his.app.gant asked jones how he knew that the gun was not kelly,and jones told her what happened.app.on cross examination,jones explained 
i told her that i was sitting at the bar pretty much next to jake and when the cops came in,which i did really see when the cops came in.i did realize that the cops were actually in there behind me until somebody dropped that gun in my lap.and once it got dropped in my lap,i pushed it off and i mean and that what,and that in fact how i knew it was his.i knew that he did do it.and that pretty much what i told gant.
app.jones testified that he never told gant that he threw the gun because he was nervous when the police walked in.
at some point after this conversation,cephas came to jones and asked him why he did tell her what happened app she did not ask him for his version of what happened,but did ask him to speak to a defense investigator.at first,jones refused,but then eventually agreed.jones told the investigator that if anyone were to serve a subpoena on him or ask him to testify,he would give a comment and would plead the fifth because he did want to discuss it.app.after that conversation,kelly counsel contacted jones to explain that the court wanted to appoint counsel for him they did not discuss the facts of the case or the substance of jones potential testimony.jones never met with the government investigator,despite the investigator offer to speak with him any time and anywhere.app.
when questioned about his decision not to invoke his fifth amendment rights,jones first explained,i had a change of heart only because come thinking about it,i felt that i could get myself into trouble by really not saying what happened if you asking me questions and i only say i plead the fifth.i do know,it just did feel right.i never heard of anybody actually doing it.i know that it the fifth amendment but i never actually heard of anybody going to court and saying they plead the fifth.app.before his testimony ended,jones clarified,i do feel that i did anything wrong.i felt that it would be better for me to say exactly what happened rather than to just say no comment.app.
officer clark 
after the testimony of kelly witnesses,the government called philadelphia police officer clarence clark of the city vice squad.officer clark was one of the two decoy officers sent into café breezes the morning of kelly arrest.while there,their responsibilities were to look for any underage drinkers,any illegal drugs or any illegal activity going on within the bar.app.
according to his testimony,officer clark and the other undercover officer,officer fairbanks,entered café breezes at approximately,o clock in the morning on may.app.the officers walked to the bar and sat in two seats close to the door officer clark took the seat immediately to the right of jones,and officer fairbanks sat immediately to the right of officer clark.officer clark confirmed that kelly was seated in t he first seat on the other side of the l of the bar next to two females.app.after ordering a beer and engaging in conversation with officer fairbanks,officer clark got up from his seat and went to the bathroom area to call his supervisor,corporal drummond,to the scene.after officer clark returned to his seat,corporal drummond arrived and announced that he and members of the vice squad and l i unit were there to do an open inspection of the bar.officer clark did not hear a gun drop to the floor when the police entered the bar,where he was sitting at the officer clark remember hearing a loud metal clang around the time of kelly arrest.according to officer clark,all i remember hearing is a yell,someone yelling gun.app.at that point in time,officer stewart was closer in proximity to kelly than was officer clark.
when asked directly whether there was anyone sitting behind him when corporal drummond and the others arrived,officer clark responded,no.app.he also testified that there was no one standing behind the person seated to his left,jones.
iii.proceedings 
after supplemental briefing,the district court denied kelly motion in part,granted it in part,and ultimately concluded that kelly newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial the government filed a timely notice of appeal.
we have jurisdiction to review this matter pursuant to.
standard of review 
as a motion for a new trial under rule is directed to the district court discretion,our function on appeal is to decide whether the trial judge abused that discretion or failed to exercise it.united states iannelli,cir.by definition,a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.united states askari,cir en banc quoting koon united states,d,vacated on other grounds,cir.thus,t he abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.id.
discussion 
as this court has consistently held,a defendant must meet five requirements before he may be granted a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence 
a the evidence must be in fact,newly discovered,discovered since the trial 
b facts must be alleged from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the defendant 
c the evidence relied on,must not be merely cumulative or impeaching d it must be material to the issues involved and e it must be such,and of such nature,as that,on a new trial,the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.
iannelli,at.although the decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial lies within the discretion of the district court,the movant has a heavy burden of proving each of these requirements.united states cimera,cir.if just one of the requirements is not satisfied,a defendant rule motion must fail.united states jasin,cir.courts should exercise great caution in setting aside a verdict reached after proceedings,and particularly so where the action has been tried before a jury.united states kamel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court concluded that kelly had met his burden of establishing each of the iannelli requirements.on appeal,the government challenges the district court disposition as to two of the requirements diligence and probability of acquittal.we address each of the challenged requirements in turn.
the government contends that the district court applied the incorrect legal standard in concluding that kelly had satisfied the diligence prong of the iannelli analysis.specifically,the government argues that the district court erred in focusing its diligence inquiry on kelly efforts to bring jones testimony to the attention of the court once the potential testimony was discovered,as opposed to focusing on kelly efforts to discover jones testimony in the first place.we agree.
as recognized above,the second prong of the iannelli analysis requires a defendant to allege facts from which the court may infer diligence.iannelli,at.in applying this prong,we have consistently focused our inquiry on whether the evidence at issue could have been discovered before or at the time of trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence on behalf of the defendant his counsel.id.at cimera,at.in iannelli itself,we affirmed the district court denial of the defendants new trial motion,as the newly discovered evidence could have been discovered at the time of trial and the defendants d id not allege any facts from which the court c ould excuse their lack of diligence prior to trial.iannelli,at.more recently,in united states cimera,we reversed the district court decision to a grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence where the defendant failed to establish that the supporting evidence could not have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence before or at the time of the trial.at see also government of the virgin islands lima,cir affirming district court denial of defendant motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence,finding,inter alia,that witnesses whose testimony formed the basis of defendant new trial motion could easily have been found in time for trial by the exercise of diligence emphasis added united states derewal,cir stating that newly discovered evidence must be evidence that trial counsel could not have discovered with due diligence before trial second emphasis added.
in this case,the district court concluded that kelly had met his burden of establishing that he was diligent with respect to the newly discovered evidence,dist.op.at,as kelly was diligent in bringing jones testimony to the court attention,id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court laid out the sequence of events leading up to jones prospective testimony,beginning with the date of kelly conviction and highlighting only events.although the district court found that a t the time of his conviction,kelly did not know about jones contact with the gun,the court never addressed whether either kelly or his counsel could have discovered the information before trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence.
a review of the record reveals absolutely no pretrial diligence on kelly behalf.the record could not be more clear that kelly made no effort to speak with seeing him anywhere from one to twenty times after the what he might have witnessed the morning of may.as we held in government of the virgin islands lima,cir,such inaction simply does not qualify as reasonable diligence.
in lima,after the defendant was convicted and sentenced for burglary,assault,and possession of a firearm,he filed a motion for new trial based on the affidavits of three newly discovered witnesses.two of the witnesses,rivera and sanchez,stated in their affidavits that,although they were out on rivera porch the night of the alleged incident,neither person saw the defendant enter or exit the victim house.according to her affidavit,rivera lived directly across the street from the victim.
in addressing the diligence prong of the iannelli test and ultimately finding that it had not been met,the district court stated 
with even a moderate amount of diligence these witnesses and their testimony could have been discoverable prior to trial.the witnesses are persons well known to defendant jose and who know him well.the location of hipolita rivera residence could not possibly be a secret to defendant.common prudence would have dictated that she be interviewed as a neighbor likely to throw light on the matter.this could and should have been done immediately after the arrest of defendant.
id.at quoting the district court.
on appeal,judge becker agreed with the district court,concluding easily that the defendant had not met his burden of establishing reasonable pretrial diligence as to the testimony of rivera and sanchez 
the proffered testimony also runs afoul of the diligence prong of iannelli because sanchez and rivera were friends of the defendant,one of whom resided directly across the street from the location of the incident.it would seem that they could easily have been found in time for trial by the exercise of diligence.
the facts of lima are analogous to the facts of this case.first,whether we label kelly and jones as friends or acquaintances,it is undisputed that the two men knew each other they were sitting next to each other the night of kelly arrest and they saw each other at least once after kelly arrest and before his conviction.we can also infer that jones home address was no secret to kelly,as jones lived on the very same block as kelly girlfriend of eight years with whom jones was best friends.in light of these facts,we see no reason why jones could not and should not have been interviewed as a witness likely to throw light on the matter,lima,at,prior to kelly trial,or at the very latest,before his conviction and kelly provides us with none.kelly makes no effort to distinguish lima and does not even acknowledge the case as precedent in his brief on appeal.
faced with jones undisputed testimony that kelly never once spoke to him about what happened at café breezes on may,kelly does not argue that he in fact exercised pretrial diligence in relation to jones potential testimony,nor does he contend that he could not have interviewed jones before his trial began.instead,kelly seeks to excuse his lack of pretrial diligence by he did before the district,prior to trial,he had no reason to believe that it was jones who possessed and threw the gun,that jones would have acknowledged possessing the gun.appellee br.essentially,kelly argues that,because he did not know what jones would say in response to being questioned,kelly had no duty to question him.though the district court appears to have accepted this narrow formulation of a defendant duty to exercise pretrial diligence,we can not.
kelly claim that he had no reason to know that it was jones who threw the gun and that jones was willing to acknowledge this fact appellee br.misses the point.though kelly may have had no reason to know the exact substance of jones potential testimony,he had every reason to question jones about the kelly claimed was not about what he may have witnessed the morning of kelly arrest.as the government points out in its brief,jones may have been able to provide kelly with evidence to corroborate his theory that someone threw the gun at him.see supra note.kelly could have asked jones if he saw who threw the gun at him or from what direction it was thrown he could have asked jones if he saw someone with a gun earlier that night or heard people talking about the incident after his arrest.and while there is always the possibility that jones would have been provide kelly with the answers to these questions,we will never know because kelly never asked them.any potential or anticipated futility in doing not excuse kelly from his duty to exercise reasonable diligence before trial 
unable to cite any precedent from this circuit,or from any of our sister circuits,in support of his position kelly relies heavily on two cases from district courts in our states carmichael,d,and united states morales,wl,only to demonstrate that when confronted with similar circumstances,other courts have reasonably employed the same approach as did the district court here.appellee br.n.while we express no opinion as to the propriety of the district courts decisions in these cases,we discuss them here,as they are distinguishable on their facts and thus ultimately unavailing.
in carmichael,after a trial for gun possession,the defendant presented the affidavit of a witness who admitted that the gun in question belonged to him.upon receiving this affidavit and hearing live testimony,the district court granted defendant motion for a new trial,finding that the defendant had no way of knowing at the time of trial that harvey,the witness,was the owner of the gun,or at least that he would admit to being the owner.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on the fact that harvey had testified before a federal grand jury prior to the defendant trial.during his sworn testimony,harvey claimed that he did not know to whom the gun belonged and denied being on the porch where the gun was found.id.at.the district court thus concluded that n othing in harvey grand jury testimony could have alerted the defendant to the prospect that harvey could be a helpful witness if called at trial.id.at.
here,unlike in carmichael,kelly had no reason to believe that jones would not have been a helpful witness if called at trial.jones was never questioned before trial about the gun or about what he witnessed the night of kelly arrest,he never affirmatively denied knowledge of the circumstances surrounding that night and he certainly did not provide sworn testimony to any court until after kelly conviction.had jones been questioned pretrial and had he denied knowledge of the gun,we would be presented with a different scenario.it is undisputed that jones was not questioned,and thus carmichael is clearly distinguishable.
united states morales,wl,the only case cited by the district court in support of its also distinguishable on this issue.in morales,the defendant was convicted by a jury for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
at trial,a government witness testified to seeing the defendant enter the home of a while carrying a red and black bag that was later found to contain cocaine.after the defendant was convicted,he moved for a new trial based on a newly discovered witness,who testified at a evidentiary hearing that she had observed the defendant carrying only his child and not a bag as he entered the home on the day in question.in addressing the diligence prong of the iannelli analysis,the district court specifically found that there was no evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing that defendant had any reason to know gonzalez,the newly discovered witness,had witnessed defendant entering the home.id.at emphasis in original.thus,the district court concluded that the delay in gonzalez coming forward can not be attributed to a lack of diligence on behalf of the defendant.id.
in this case,as recognized above,kelly had every reason to know that jones was a potential witness in his case.again,it is undisputed that,not only was jones present at café breezes the night of kelly arrest,but he was sitting next to kelly when the arrest occurred.kelly criticizes the government for ignor ing the fact that jones stated that he intentionally kept his involvement secret because he did not want to become involved,apparently believing that consideration of this fact would weigh in his favor.appellant br.at.see also dist.op.at.it does not.what kelly himself ignores in making such a statement is that the duty to conduct reasonable diligence before or at the time of trial lies with the defendant and his counsel.the fact that jones did not volunteer his testimony to kelly has no bearing on the question of whether kelly took affirmative steps to discover that testimony in the first instance.sitting on one hands and waiting for a known eyewitness to come forward with potentially exculpatory information or potentially inculpatory information from jones perspective can not be any diligence.were we to sanction the granting of a new trial under such circumstances,iannelli diligence requirement would quickly be rendered meaningless.
considering all of the circumstances surrounding this case,the fact that kelly did not even attempt to question have jones to his trial is both shocking and inexcusable.it is thus with little hesitation that we conclude that he has failed to satisfy the second prong of the iannelli analysis.because it is undisputed that kelly made no attempt to procure jones testimony prior to his conviction,his motion for a new trial should have been denied.
accordingly,we will reverse the district court order granting his motion.
ii.probability of acquittal 
the government also challenges the district court resolution of the fifth prong of the iannelli analysis the requirement that,on a new trial,the newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal.iannelli,at.because we have already determined that kelly did not meet his heavy burden of establishing iannelli diligence requirement,we need not reach this second issue as a means of justifying our reversal of the district court order.see jasin,at.however,as it appears that iannelli fifth prong has caused some confusion in our district courts,we will discuss its application here,so as to provide clarity to this area of the law.
before the district court,the government argued that kelly new evidence would not probably produce an acquittal,as jones testimony was simply too fantastic to be accorded much evidentiary weight.dist.op.at internal quotation marks omitted.the government urged the district court to conclude that the testimony was not credible and that,accordingly,kelly could not satisfy the fifth prong of iannelli.in support of its argument,the government identified several inconsistencies in the testimony of jones,gant,and cephas criticized jones testimony for conveniently absolving both kelly and jones of any criminal liability and argued that jones relationship with both kelly and cephas gave him a strong motive to lie on behalf of his friends.the government also reminded the court that jones admitted to being very intoxicated the night of kelly arrest and asserted that,at a new trial,jones testimony would be contradicted by the testimony of officers stewart,miles,and clark.
in its august,memorandum opinion,the district court rejected the government position and decline d to make a credibility determination at this juncture.dist.op.at.the court declared,at the outset of its discussion,that jones prospective testimony,if believed,would probably produce an acquittal,and the jury is the appropriate.dist.op.at.
in explaining why it would refrain from making a credibility determination,the district court distinguished several cases cited by the government and ultimately chose to adopt the reasoning employed in united states morales,wl.in that case,although the district court admitted to finding many inconsistencies in the proposed testimony of a newly discovered witness,it nonetheless concluded that the defendant is entitled to have a jury evaluate the credibility of the witness.if a jury finds her testimony to be credible,the jury may well have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant guilt.id.at.
after announcing that it would adopt the morales approach,dist.op.at,the district court underwent the following analysis 
although the court has some reservations about jones proposed,it nicely absolves both kelly and jones of criminal liability and it surfaced at a convenient court,out of an abundance of caution,concludes that kelly is entitled to have a jury evaluate the credibility of jones.the court further concludes that a jury is likely to find jones prospective testimony credible for,inter alia,the following reasons first it is not logical for jones to perjure himself for the boyfriend kelly of one of his friends cephas.second,jones had a strong motive not to come forward and to avoid discussing the incident until gant reported that kelly had been convicted.third,jones can not benefit by falsely helping kelly.fourth,some time after the arrest but while still at the bar,kelly stated someone threw the gun at him,which corroborates jones prospective testimony.
id.emphasis added second alteration in original internal footnote omitted.thus,although the court explicitly declined to make a credibility determination,it nonetheless appears from this passage that it did undergo a type of credibility assessment.
in light of the foregoing,the court concluded if a jury finds jones testimony to be credible the jury is likely to have a reasonable doubt as to whether kelly possessed the gun at issue during the early hours of may,at café breezes.thus,kelly has established that the newly discovered evidence is likely to produce an acquittal.id.internal citation omitted.
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in refusing to make a credibility determination in regard to jones testimony,leaving such a determination to the jury at a new trial.appellant br.according to the government,h ad the district court made a credibility finding,the district court should have found that the jones testimony was entitled to little,if any,probative weight.id.at.
kelly responds that,although he agrees in the context of newly discovery sic evidence motions,it is for the district court to assess the credibility of the evidence,this does not mean that a district court must find the evidence to be in fact credible.appellee br.in his view,unless the district court discredits the new testimony,the standard itself and common sense suggest that the district court should do nothing more than assess whether a jury probably would reach a different result upon hearing the testimony.id.at.to this end,kelly asserts that the district court did in fact make a credibility determination with respect to jones sic testimony id,as it specifically found that a jury is likely to find jones prospective testimony credible id.quoting dist.op.at.according to kelly,although the government goes to great lengths to argue that the district court abused its discretion for not discrediting jones sic testimony,t he district court factual findings can not be disturbed.id.
in light of the district court opinion and the parties arguments,two issues require our attention,both of which arise in the context of a district court inquiry into whether a defendant newly discovered evidence would probably produce an acquittal at a new trial whether a district court is required to make a determination as to the credibility of the proffered evidence and if so,how is such a determination to be made we address each of these issues in turn.
first,to be clear,i t is the job of the district court,either on affidavits or after an evidentiary hearing to decide whether the newly discovered evidence is credible,and,if so,whether it would probably produce an acquittal if a new trial were held.united states grey bear,cir internal citation omitted see also united states woolfolk,cir the purpose of the evidentiary hearing was for the district court to assess the credibility of the new witness and to determine the materiality of her testimony.while it appears that all of the circuits to address this issue are in agreement,we find the tenth circuit opinion in united states mccullough,cir,to be particularly instructive.
in mccullough,four months after the defendant was convicted by a jury on various drug and charges,he sent a letter to the district court stating that he had discovered evidence that five of the government cooperating witnesses had conspired to provide false testimony against him and his at trial.id.at.the defendant attached to his letter the written statements of nine inmates from his correctional facility.id.at.these statements indicated,inter alia,that the inmates had overheard the five cooperating witnesses,who were also inmates,conspiring to provide false testimony at trial in order to receive downward departures in their sentences.the statements also alleged that the cooperating witnesses had offered to sell information about the defendant case to other inmates,so that they too could become government cooperators eligible for downward departures.id.the defendant later filed a formal rule motion through counsel based on the inmates written statements.id.
after a evidentiary hearing,during which six of the nine inmates and all five of the cooperating witnesses provided live testimony,the district court denied the defendant motion.id.in doing so,the district court noted that it did not find the inmates testimony to be worthy of belief and set forth several reasons why the testimony was not credible.the district court ultimately found that,although the defendant had satisfied the first four prongs of the tenth circuit iannelli equivalent,he could not satisfy the fifth prong of the test.though the district court agreed that the new evidence,if believed,would probably produce an acquittal,it expressly found that the new evidence was not credible and denied the defendant motion.id.internal quotation marks omitted.on appeal,the defendant argued that the district court erred in making a credibility determination.according to the defendant,a jury should have made the credibility judgment,not the judge.id.at.
the tenth circuit soundly rejected the defendant argument,stating 
the defendant effectively argues,without any citation to supporting authority,that the district court was required to accept his proffered evidence as true,order a new trial,and allow a new jury to determine whether the proffered evidence was credible.neither the case law from this circuit,nor for that matter the case law from any other circuit,supports such a position.to the contrary,our test clearly implies that the district court is to serve as a gatekeeper to a new trial,deciding in the first instance whether the defendant proffered new evidence is credible.
id.the court added that the defendant position was patently absurd,as it would allow a defendant to automatically obtain a new trial,and thereby undermine the time and resources devoted to the initial trial,simply by manufacturing some type of newly discovered evidence,no matter how incredible such new evidence might be.id.at.
the defendant position in mccullough appears to be similar to the position taken by the district court in this case and by the district court in morales.both courts refused to make a finding of fact as to the credibility of the evidence before them,each believing that a defendant is entitled to have a jury evaluate the credibility of his newly discovered evidence.but,as mccullough makes clear,the district court is to serve as a gatekeeper to a new trial,deciding in the first instance whether the defendant proffered new evidence is credible.id.at.a district court that fails to exercise its discretion in this regard,abuses that discretion and is thus subject to reversal on appeal.
having established that a district court is required to make a credibility determination as part of its inquiry,we next address the proper standard for making such a determination.kelly suggests that a district court focus should be on whether a jury probably would reach a different result upon hearing the new evidence.we agree.as the eighth circuit stated in united states grey bear,t he real question we suppose,is not whether the district judge believed the proffered testimony,but how likely the district judge thought a jury at a second trial would be to believe it.at.to make a determination under this standard,the district court can not view the proffered testimony in a vacuum it must weigh the testimony against all of the other evidence in the record,including the evidence already weighed and considered by the jury in the defendant first trial.see united states woolfolk,cir the judge,in determining credibility,must look to all aspects of the witness including not only her testimony but the evidence presented at trial.
in this case,even though the district court explicitly declined to make a credibility determination,believing that the jury is the appropriate,dist.op.at,the court nonetheless concluded that a jury is likely to find jones prospective testimony credible and set forth four reasons it thought this was so thus,it appears that the district court may have made a credibility determination after all.though we assume that this determination took into account,at the very least,the other testimony presented at the court june,evidentiary hearing,we can not be certain that the district court weighed jones testimony against the testimony presented at kelly first trial.as the government points out,jones testimony is contradicted at various points by the testimony of,among others,officer stewart.for instance,it would seem that one could not believe jones testimony that he threw the
