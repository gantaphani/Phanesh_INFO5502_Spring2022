abdoh ahmed alrefae,a citizen of yemen,petitions for review of a june,order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming without opinion a july,decision of immigration judge ij philip montante,denying alrefae motion to rescind an in absentia order of removal and to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of new evidence.in re abdoh ahmed alrefae,no.a june,aff g no.a immig.buffalo july.in,alrefae became a lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis as a result of his marriage to a united states citizen.he was ordered removed in absentia after he and his wife failed to file a timely joint petition to remove the conditional basis of his permanent resident status and he subsequently failed to appear for his removal hearing.we hold that the ij erred in denying alrefae motion to rescind by failing to explain why alrefae had not rebutted the presumption that he received notice of his removal hearing and by improperly applying this presumption in evaluating alrefae claim that exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing at his hearing.we also hold that the ij erred in denying alrefae motion to reopen because he failed to explain why alrefae was not prima facie eligible for removal of the conditional basis of his residency status,or why alrefae divorce,which did not become final until after his removal hearing,did not constitute new evidence.because of these errors,we grant the petition for review,vacate the bia order and remand this case to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
aliens who attain permanent resident status by marriage to a citizen are initially granted that status on a conditional basis for two years.a.within ninety days before the anniversary of the granting of conditional permanent residence,the alien and his or her spouse must jointly petition,by filing a form,to remove the conditions on residence,and must attach documentary evidence establishing that the marriage was not entered into for purposes of evading united states immigration laws.c,d in re stowers.aliens who are unable to file jointly may seek a discretionary waiver of the joint filing requirement from the government on one or more of three bases enumerated at c.stowers,at.among the bases for a waiver is the marriage waiver,under which the alien must show that the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but the qualifying marriage has been terminated other than through the death of the spouse and the alien was not at fault in failing to file jointly.c b.if the government denies the waiver application,the alien may seek review of the denial before the ij in the course of removal proceedings.f.
alrefae entered the united states on a nonimmigrant visa in july and remained here after the visa expired.on may,alrefae married tracy reilly,a united states citizen,but apparently took no action to adjust his immigration status.on june,he received notice that removal proceedings had been initiated against him for overstaying his visa.in response,he conceded removability and requested voluntary departure,and on august,this request was granted.alrefae thereafter filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings on the basis of his marriage and to adjust his status.this motion was granted on march,and on january,alrefae attained permanent resident status on a conditional basis.
alrefae permanent resident status was terminated on february,after he and reilly failed to file a joint petition to remove the conditions on that status.alrefae apparently took no action between and in response to the termination.on january,however,alrefae appeared voluntarily at the buffalo,new york office of the immigration and naturalization service ins to register pursuant to the national security registration system nseers program at the ins office,officials served alrefae with a notice to appear for removal proceedings,but did not set a hearing date.on february,the ins mailed a notice of hearing date for march,to the address listed on the notice to appear.alrefae failed to appear for his hearing and was ordered removed in absentia.a copy of the removal order was mailed to him that day.
alrefae had filed for divorce from reilly on december,claiming that she was abusive to him and addicted to drugs.he was granted a divorce on may,about two months after he failed to appear for his removal hearing.on june,alrefae filed a motion to rescind in absentia order of removal and reopen proceedings,explaining that his wife had refused to file with him to remove the conditions on his residence because of her mental state,which may be attributable to her addiction to illegal narcotics.he sought rescission of the removal order pursuant to b c,claiming that his failure to appear was the result of exceptional circumstances beyond his,that he had not received the notice of his hearing date because u pon information and belief,the notice was intercepted by a third party and was therefore never delivered to him.alrefae also asserted that,according to an ins memorandum and under bia precedent,he was entitled to request a continuance of the removal proceedings pending finalization of his divorce.he therefore claimed that there would have been no reason for him not to appear at the removal hearing had he received notice of it.moreover,he stated that on or about may,he had filed a form petition with the ins to remove his conditional status along with a request for waiver of the joint filing requirement 
on july,alrefae filed a notarized letter with the immigration court stating that his home at tenbroek,in albany,new york had been burglarized on february,and that soon thereafter he began receiving mail at the address of his friend fuad mansour alrefae also stated in the letter that mansour had told him that he lost the mail,but would not sign an affidavit to this effect.alrefae submitted along with the letter a police report concerning the burglary of his home.
the following day,july,the ij denied alrefae motion.the ij stated that the notice of hearing had not been returned to sender,giving rise to a presumption of delivery.moreover,he observed that the notice had been sent to the address alrefae had provided,and alrefae had not subsequently filed a change of address form with the immigration court.for these reasons,the ij concluded,alrefae had failed to establish exceptional circumstances that would entitle him to rescission of the in absentia removal order.the ij also stated that to prevail on a motion to reopen,alrefae would have had to show prima facie eligibility for the underlying relief sought and present material,previously unavailable evidence.without further explaining his reasoning,the ij denied alrefae motion to reopen.
alrefae appealed the ij decision,and on june,the bia affirmed without opinion.alrefae filed a motion under in the united states district court for the western district of new york,seeking review of the bia order.this petition was transferred to this court as a petition for review pursuant to the real id act of,a,stat,codified at real id act see order,alrefae ridge,june,docket entry.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia affirms an ij decision without opinion,we review the decision of the ij as the final agency determination.tu lin gonzales,cir.we review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion,which may be found if the decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements.wei guang wang bia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we note at the outset that we,unlike the parties,construe alrefae motion to rescind the in absentia removal order and to reopen proceedings on the basis of new evidence as comprising two distinct motions,which we review under different substantive standards.as we recently explained,although a motion to rescind is a type of motion to reopen,it is distinctive in that a motion to reopen for purposes of rescinding an in absentia removal order seeks to restart proceedings as if the previous proceedings never occurred.maghradze gonzales,cir.because d ifferent requirements pertain to each type of motion to reopen,when an alien files a single motion that seeks both rescission of an in absentia removal order on an enumerated ground,see b c,as well as reopening of removal proceedings based on new evidence,we treat the motion as comprising distinct motions to rescind and to reopen,and review each under the applicable substantive standards.see maghradze,at we construe the single motion filed here as if it were two separate motion to rescind and a motion to reopen.although alrefae submissions before the ij and bia were not models of clarity regarding the form of relief sought,we note that the ij invoked the substantive standards for both motions to rescind and motions to reopen.
in arguing that we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of alrefae claim of prima facie eligibility for waiver of the joint filing requirement,the government conflates the requirements for a motion to rescind and a motion to reopen.the government is correct that we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of alrefae claim of prima facie eligibility in the context of reviewing the ij denial of alrefae motion to rescind.judicial review of in absentia removal orders is limited to three specifically enumerated grounds,none of which concerns the merits of the relief the alien would seek if the in absentia removal order were rescinded.see b d.on the other hand,we have jurisdiction over alrefae claim that he is entitled to rescission on the grounds of nonreceipt of notice and exceptional circumstances because his claim that the notice of hearing did not reach him goes to his reasons for not attending the proceeding,one of the three grounds for judicial review.id.because,as we will explain,alrefae claim that he is prima facie eligible for a waiver of the joint filing requirement is an element of his motion to reopen on the basis of new evidence,the restrictions of b d on judicial review of in absentia removal orders do not apply,and we therefore assume jurisdiction over this claim in the context of reviewing the ij denial of alrefae motion to reopen.
alrefae motion to rescind the in absentia order of removal 
although alrefae claimed that he had not received notice of his removal hearing because his friend lost his mail,the ij found that alrefae had failed to rebut the presumption of delivery that applies to notices of removal hearings.the ij also concluded that because of this presumption,alrefae had failed to establish that exceptional circumstances prevented him from appearing for his removal hearing.although,as we will explain,there is a presumption of receipt when notice of a removal hearing was properly sent,the ij erred by failing to explain why he found that the evidence alrefae submitted did not rebut this presumption.moreover,the ij erred by not analyzing alrefae claim of exceptional circumstances independently of his claim of nonreceipt.
with exceptions not relevant here,to prevail on a motion to rescind an in absentia removal order,the movant must show either that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances or that he or she did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph or of section a.b c.exceptional circumstances are defined as circumstances such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien,serious illness of the alien,or serious illness or death of the spouse,child,or parent of the alien,but not including less compelling circumstances beyond the control of the alien.id.e.the bia standard for exceptional circumstances appears fairly stringent,both in terms of the required severity of the circumstances and the proof required to establish a claim.see,in re,where an alien argues that his failure to appear resulted from a serious illness,we normally would expect specific,detailed medical evidence to corroborate the alien claim.in re,rejecting a claim of exceptional circumstances because a common headache would not constitute a serious illness and,even if a serious headache would qualify,the alien perfunctory statement regarding his headache included no detail regarding the cause,severity,or treatment of the alleged illness.
with regard to claims of nonreceipt under b c ii,there is a presumption that aliens receive notices of removal hearings that were properly mailed,and aliens who move to reopen claiming that they did not receive notice must rebut this presumption.when an alien fails to appear for removal proceedings,an in absentia removal order shall be entered if the government establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that written notice was provided and that the alien is removable.b a emphasis added.when an alien seeks to rescind the removal order,however,claiming that he did not receive notice of the hearing,a s the use of the word receive in b c ii establishes,when considering the motion to reopen,the central issue no longer is whether the notice was properly mailed as it is for the purpose of initially entering the in absentia order,but rather whether the alien actually received the notice.lopes gonzales,cir per curiam.
the bia has stated that where service of a notice of a deportation proceeding is sent by certified mail through the united states postal service and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail,a strong presumption of effective service arises.matter of grijalva,wl.this presumption can be overcome by the affirmative defense of nondelivery or improper delivery by the postal service,but only if the alien presents substantial and probative evidence such as documentary evidence from the postal service,third party affidavits,or other similar evidence demonstrating that there was improper delivery.id.although we have recently held that this exacting standard is inapplicable where,as in alrefae case,notice of delivery was sent by regular rather than certified mail the bia may apply a less stringent,rebuttable presumption to notices of removal hearings if the record establishes that the notice was accurately addressed and mailed in accordance with normal office procedures.lopes,at.although the bia in grijalva spoke in terms of a presumption of delivery,we have held that it is presumed not only that delivery to the alien mailing address was effective,but also that the alien personally received the notice.see id.when an alien seeks to rescind an in absentia removal order claiming nonreceipt,the ij must consider all relevant evidence,including circumstantial evidence,offered to rebut th e presumption.id.at.
in his motion to rescind,alrefae appears to have sought relief based on both exceptional circumstances and nonreceipt of notice,and the ij referred to both of these grounds in his decision.we therefore assume,without deciding,that an alien who claims nonreceipt of notice of his or her removal hearing could also claim that exceptional circumstances prevented him or her from receiving the notice.we focus here on the adequacy of the ij explanations for denying alrefae claims for rescission 
although the ij did not cite grijalva,he invoked a presumption of delivery in rejecting alrefae claim of nonreceipt,explaining that s aid notice of hearing was not returned to the court file,giving rise of sic a presumption of delivery.we need not decide whether the ij intended to invoke the grijalva standard,which we have rejected for notices sent by regular mail,or instead a less stringent presumption,because in either case the ij erred in rejecting alrefae claim of nonreceipt by failing to explain why alrefae had not rebutted the presumption of receipt.alrefae submitted a notarized letter attesting that he had not received notice because his friend mansour lost his mail,and he offered a police report as support for his claim that he began receiving his mail at mansour home after his own home was burglarized.although the ij was correct that there was no evidence of,alrefae claimed that his mail was lost after it was delivered to his mailing attempted to show that he had not personally received the notice.the ij was by no means required to find alrefae assertions sufficient to rebut the presumption,but he should have addressed them in his decision.see lopes,at althoug
