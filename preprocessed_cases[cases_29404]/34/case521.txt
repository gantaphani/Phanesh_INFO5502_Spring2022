andy williams and gilberto appeal from their convictions for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of and possession with intent to distribute approximately five kilograms of cocaine in violation of a.finding no reversible error,we affirm the convictions.additionally,although the district court failure to articulate its reason for choosing a particular sentence within a guideline range that exceeded months violated c,we find no plain error that would require resentencing.
background 
we describe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see,united states sampson,cir.from,appellants and,along with others,allegedly shipped cocaine from puerto rico to the mainland united states on commercial airline flights departing from either san juan or aguadilla airports.luis,an employee of the catering company that serviced airplanes at puerto rican airports and a member of the conspiracy,agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officers.he arranged to have drugs shipped on a commercial flight leaving aguadilla airport on december,and taped conversations among the alleged conspirators,including the appellants,regarding this shipment.
on february,a grand jury indicted and,along with irvin and carlos.during the course of a trial,the government introduced the testimony of cooperating witness regarding the alleged conspiracy,including testimony that both and were part of the december conspiracy.the government also introduced tape recordings had made with the alleged conspirators.the taped conversations,which occurred between december and december,concerned the planning of the december shipment as well as the actions of the alleged conspirators after the shipment was lost.
in addition,the government showed video recordings of delivering silver or gray wrapped packages to on december and entering the plane on december.finally,the government introduced evidence of five drug packages that it seized from the rear lavatory of the airplane on december.the appearance of these packages matched the appearance of the packages delivered on the.
the jury convicted and on april.was sentenced to months in jail and to months.in sentencing the defendants,the district court never explained why it chose the specific sentences within the guidelines range,other than to recite that it had considered all of the factors that it was required to consider under a.
and timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
introduction of evidence of a separate conspiracy 
the appellants principal argument on appeal is that the district court should have granted their motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor misconduct in introducing evidence of a separate december conspiracy.it is undisputed that five of the government eleven witnesses testified about the fbi attempt on december,to seize another shipment of drugs.that attempt was stymied when the alleged drug traffickers were notified of the presence of federal agents.in fact,two of the witnesses testified exclusively about the december events.in the course of the trial,the government admitted that the events of december involved a different conspiracy,to which the appellants were not parties.for present purposes,we will assume that the government did not advise the defendants of the error until april,during the jury charge conference after the government had rested.then,the government clearly admitted that the december events involved a different conspiracy that did not involve the appellants.the defendants immediately objected and filed a motion for a new trial the next day,which the district court denied.
appellant first argues that a mistrial should have been granted because the prosecutor delayed disclosure regarding the separate december conspiracy violated his rights under brady maryland,d,to access to exculpatory material.argues that if the information had been disclosed earlier,he would have been able to impeach the truthfulness of testimony and cast reasonable doubt on the amount of drugs involved in the charged conspiracy.it is unclear how further would have benefitted.vague assertions that this evidence could have impeached the cooperating witness,without explaining why or how,is insufficient to establish that brady material was withheld.in any event,admits that he did not request a continuance or seek to recall any witnesses when he learned about this evidence before he presented his.as a general rule,a defendant who does not request a continuance will not be heard to complain on appeal that he suffered prejudice as a result of discovery.united states sepulveda,cir see also united states osorio,cir.has failed to establish the manifest abuse of discretion required to overturn the presider decision to allow a criminal case to go forward,notwithstanding delayed disclosure of material relevant to impeachment of a witness.sepulveda,at 
next,both appellants assert that the introduction of the december evidence constituted prosecutorial misconduct that warrants a new trial.w e determine the legal question of whether the prosecutor actions constitute misconduct de novo,and the question of whether the alleged misconduct requires a new trial for abuse of discretion.united states casas,cir.
we assume,without deciding,that the prosecutor actions constituted misconduct.see united states auch,cir finding misconduct where a prosecutor made repeated references to an uncharged armored car robbery during the prosecution of a different armored car robbery.however,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a new trial was not warranted.in determining whether prosecutorial misconduct so poisoned the well as to require a new trial,this circuit considers whether the prosecutor misconduct was isolated deliberate whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction and whether any prejudice surviving the court instruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case.id.at.
the claimed misconduct in this case was clearly repeated.however,this is not a close case since the evidence plainly supported a conviction.indeed,the appellants do not argue otherwise,with one exception noted below.most important,as part of the jury charge,the district court explicitly,clearly,and repeatedly instructed the jury 
not to consider at all any testimony regarding the december events you are not to make any connection between that event and the drug conspiracy charge since the december,events are not evidence of the conspiracy charge y ou shall disregard all references by these witnesses to the december events 
during these instructions,the jurors were told twice that the december events were not part of the charged conspiracy twice that the testimony regarding december had been stricken and three times that they should not consider the testimony regarding december.we are at a loss as to how the district court,under these circumstances,could have provided stronger curative instructions 
this court has repeatedly held that a strong,explicit,and thorough curative instruction to disregard improperly admitted evidence or improper comments by the prosecutor is generally sufficient to cure any prejudice from prosecutorial misconduct in that regard.see,united states cormier,cir finding no prejudice where the court issued final instructions to the jury that were strong and clear on their duty to disregard the improper comments internal quotation marks and alterations omitted united states boldt,cir finding that a very strong and thorough curative instruction to disregard sufficed to dispel any prejudice from the prosecutor improper comment.this follows from the fact that our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court instructions united states owens,cir.
there may be some circumstances in which the improper evidence introduced by the prosecutor so overwhelms the trial as to make no instruction sufficient to cure the prejudice.however,this is not such a case.as noted earlier,the record discloses significant other evidence that could have been the basis for the jury guilty verdict,and the december evidence was not central to the government theory of the case.in fact,there was no specific testimony at trial that linked the appellants to the december events.we conclude that a new trial was not required.
ii.improper admission of statements 
the appellants argue that the district court improperly admitted statements made by alleged in tape recorded telephone conversations with cooperating witness.
while statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted would normally be hearsay,rule d e explicitly excepts a statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy from the definition of hearsay.
in this circuit,statements by an alleged are only admissible if the district court determines that it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states petrozziello,cir.such a finding is called a petrozziello determination.the district court must consider all of the evidence in determining whether the prosecution has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the declarant and the defendant were.see united states murphy,cir.thus,while the district court is generally required to make a conditional admissibility determination if the defendant objects to the introduction of an statement under rule d e,this circuit require s the court to delay its final petrozziello determination until the close of all evidence.earle benoit,cir united states ciampaglia,cir.if the district court,having conditionally admitted the statements,later determines that they are inadmissible,it should strike the statements and give a curative instruction or,if no instruction would cure the prejudice,declare a mistrial.ciampaglia,at.
in this case,the government sought to introduce a tape recording and transcript of the conversations between and at trial during the direct examination of task force agent lópez.the defendants objected,asserting that statements were inadmissible hearsay because he was acting as a government informant at the time and therefore was not a under united states giry,cir g overnment agents do not count as t he government informer is not a true conspirator.
on march,the district court issued its preliminary admissibility ruling,concluding that t he preponderance of the evidence so far leads us to conclude that was a bona fide in the conspiracy charged and not an informant.in making this ruling,the district court relied on the allegations of the indictment that the conspiracy lasted from november to december,an fbi report of an interview with in which he said was a member of the conspiracy,the tape recordings themselves the testimony up to this moment of task force agent victor lópez,and an fbi certification letter that listed the dates that was a cooperating witness as may,through august,and february,through may.the appellants take issue with the district court reliance on this last piece of evidence,arguing that the author of the certification letter,fbi special agent in charge luis fraticelli,did not testify at trial and therefore was not subject to,allegedly in violation of the appellants sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against them.
we find no error in the district court reliance on the fraticelli letter in making its preliminary admissibility determination.a court may consider any evidence it wishes,unhindered by considerations of admissibility,in making preliminary admissibility determinations.bourjaily united states,d see also.a.moreover,since a district court is not required to hold a formal hearing in making this preliminary determination,as the appellants acknowledge,no violation of the appellants right to occurred.see united states campbell,cir.
the appellants also appear to complain that the evidence ultimately introduced at trial did not support admissibility of the statements.here,the district court erred in failing to make a final petrozziello determination at the close of the evidence.as noted earlier,f or petrozziello purposes,the critical juncture is the close of all the evidence.united states ortiz,cir.however,although the defendants objected at the time the statements were introduced,leading to the preliminary determination,they never renewed their objection at the close of the evidence nor did they request a final petrozziello determination.this court has held that a defendant failure to object to the omission of such an express determination bars him from raising the point on appeal in the absence of plain error.ortiz,at quoting united states perkins,cir see also campbell,at.
we find no plain error on the record of this case.even putting to one side the out of court statements on which the district court relied in making its preliminary determination the government presented significant admissible evidence at trial that was a,not a government informant,at the time of the tape recordings.fbi agent marrero explicitly testified at trial that was a cooperating witness for the fbi only from may,until august,and again from february,until april.similarly,task force agent lópez testified during by one of the counsel that while was a government informant at other times,he was not a government informant in december when he made statements at issue.the evidence relied on by the appellants only shows that was a government informant at some point in time,not that he was a government informant,and therefore not a,when the tape recordings were made.a new trial is not required.
iii.other alleged errors 
alleged napue violation 
argues that his conviction should be reversed because the prosecution improperly allowed the cooperating witness,to testify falsely and then used that false testimony in its closing argument.at a sidebar conference on march,the government made the following explicit admissions the government has no intention of prosecuting for these charges at this time the government has no intention of pursuing charges because he can not be prosecuted based only on his own statements and at this point in time,at no time has the government had any intention of prosecuting escobar,because without his cooperation,we would not have been able to proceed with this case.however,on march,during by a counsel as to motivation for cooperating,testified to the contrary,stating that just like the defendants here,i sitting here testifying without a piece of paper,and because of my testimony,i could also be put in jail.finally,during closing arguments on april,the prosecutor said 
decided let me save my hide and help,and maybe i get something out of this for me,maybe i get rid of that case in boston.but he also told you there are no promises,no promises you do have a plea agreement,you do have a cooperation agreement,you do have any kind of immunity no.no.no.
the rules governing this issue were established by the supreme court in napue illinois,d.there a government witness,in response to a question by the prosecutor,testified that he had received no promise of consideration in return for his testimony.id.at.the prosecutor had in fact promised him consideration,but did nothing to correct the witness false testimony.id.the supreme court held that the prosecutor may not knowingly use false evidence,including false testimony,to obtain a tainted conviction regardless of whether the prosecutor solicit s false evidence or,as here,allows false evidence to go uncorrected when it appears.id.at.the use of such false testimony violates the defendant constitutional right to due process.id.a new trial is required if the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.giglio united states,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
we first reject assertion that the prosecutor statements during closing argument constituted a napue violation.the prosecutor merely said there we re no promises and no plea,cooperation,or immunity agreement.has pointed to no evidence to the contrary.
turning to testimony itself,the government argues that no napue violation occurred because was unaware that the government did not intend to prosecute him.we disagree.in light of the government prior admission that at no time has the government had any intention of prosecuting escobar,the government clearly knew that was not going to be put in jail for his testimony.yet,was permitted to testify that because of my testimony,i could also be put in jail.thus,the government allow ed false testimony to go uncorrected when it appear ed.napue,at.
however,the government admissions regarding its intent not to prosecute occurred at a sidebar conference in the presence of the defense counsel before made the challenged statements.counsel was thus equally aware that testimony was false.although there is some division within the circuits on the issue,we agree with the majority of circuits that absent unusual circumstances,the right of the defendant to disclosure by the prosecutor is deemed waived if defense counsel with actual knowledge of the false testimony chooses not to present such information to the jury.united states iverson,opinion on rehearing footnote omitted when the defendant knows about the false testimony and fails to bring it to the jury or the court attention,the assumption is that he did so for strategic reasons,and the defendant will not be allowed to question his own strategic choices on appeal.beltran,at.nor does this case present unusual circumstances that undermine this presumption,such as when the failure to object is the result of defense counsel conflict of interest,see ross,at,or when the defendant was prevented from raising or pursuing the issue at trial by circumstances essentially beyond his control,see iverson,at.having had knowledge that testimony was false at the time it occurred and having chosen not to raise this issue at the time,can not now raise the issue on appeal.
improper statements by prosecution witnesses 
argues that his conviction should be reversed because prosecution witnesses made repeated references to a larger,and very violent organization,despite the limited scope of the charged conspiracy.since there was no defense objection to these statements on the specific basis that raises on appeal we review only for plain error.see united states figueroa,cir.all of the statements relied on by merely provided background information about the investigation.almost any large drug trial will have references to gangs and violent activities.since none of the statements connected to this activity we find no plain error.
iv.other alleged errors 
alleged constructive possession errors 
argues that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for acquittal as to the second count of the indictment,charging him with possession with intent to distribute approximately five kilograms of cocaine,because there was insufficient evidence on the possession element.we disagree.
for purposes of the statute of conviction,a,possession may be either actual or constructive.united states del rosario,cir,vacated on other grounds sub nom.pacheo united states,d.constructive possession exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object,either directly or through others.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.argues that t here was no evidence that was the owner of the plane,had command of the people transporting the kilos,or any evidence from which the fact finder could find,or at least infer,that he had the necessary power and intent to possess the cocaine.appellant br.
to the contrary,there was sufficient evidence at trial for the jury to conclude that constructively possessed the requisite amount of drugs during the events of december.first,the record contains evidence that the drugs involved in the conspiracy were owned by.moreover,tape recorded conversations introduced at trial and the testimony of cooperating witness indicated that was going to pay the person who placed the drugs on the december plane and that the courier on that plane was supposed to deliver the drugs to in the united states.finally,other tape recorded conversations showed scheduling the shipment of the drugs and coordinating who would place drugs on the plane.based on all of this evidence as well as additional evidence introduced at trial,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying rule motion for acquittal on the possession charge.
makes two other arguments related to constructive possession.first,he argues that the district court jury instructions should have included a second sentence from del rosario in addition to the one quoted above in the text i n a drug case,constructive possession may be inferred from a defendant dominion and control over an area where narcotics are found.at internal quotation marks omitted.this quote is clearly just one example of when constructive possession can be found in a drug case,and the district court did not err in refusing to include this language in the instruction.
second,argues that the prosecutor rebuttal closing argument improperly analogized constructive possession to when someone is shipping you something fed ex or ups and you know it coming to you and you got the tracking number but you have gotten possession of it yet.certainly,the facts of this case could be distinguished from the analogy,but we do not see how this analogy rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct.
comments on failure to produce evidence 
also alleges that the prosecutor improperly commented on his silence during the rebuttal closing argument.attorney,during his closing argument noted that the prosecution had not provided any evidence that was in new jersey at the time of the charged conspiracy and noted in particular that the government had failed to provide a telephone or electric bill to show that was in newark.in rebuttal,the prosecutor responded that had not provided any evidence to the contrary,stating 
armenteros suggested,oh,they could have brought the electric bill,they could have brought the phone bill to prove who my client was.defendants also could have done that they do have to 
objected to this statement,and the district court immediately gave a curative instruction that the defendant did not have to present evidence because he was presumed innocent and the government had to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.the prosecutor then continued,saying a s the court explained,they do have to that does mean they ca,and objected again.the court instructed the prosecutor to leave that subject matter because it w ould have to the jury.
t he fifth amendment forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.griffin california,d footnote omitted.if the prosecutor had been the first one to raise the issue by noting failure to produce documents showing he was not in newark,the prosecutor comments might be seen as a comment on the defendant failure to testify.see united states stroman,cir united states hershenow,cir noting that documents within a defendant personal possession are protected by the amendment.
however,the comments were only made in rebuttal after defense counsel had himself raised the issue of the government failure to produce an electric or telephone bill.united states henderson,cir emphasis omitted.by suggesting that the prosecutor could have produced such documents,the defense attorney indicated that these documents were available to persons other than the defendant.under these circumstances,the prosecutor response was not such that the jurors would probably interpret it as commentary on the accused failure to take the stand.id.internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the government comment merely suggested that,if the documents were generally available as defense counsel had suggested,either side could have produced the defendant taking the stand.
under the invited reply doctrine,the prosecutor remarks were invited,and did no more than respond substantially in order to right the scale,and do not warrant reversing the conviction.united states young,d.in a similar context in henderson,defense counsel suggested that the government was hiding something by not producing a witness to the drug transaction,and the prosecutor responded in rebuttal by saying that the defendant could have produced this witness.at.this court rejected the defendant claim that this was an improper comment on his silence,concluding that defense counsel invited a response by raising the issue and t he prosecutor remarks were limited and addressed only the defense counsel own comments.id.for the same reason,a new trial is not warranted in this case.
cumulative effect of errors 
argues that,even if each individual error was harmless in its own right,the total number of incidents in the case at bar have a cumulative effect that warrant a new trial.appellant br.see united states mooney,cir.as described above,we find only three errors in the district court proceedings the use of the december testimony,the failure to make a final petrozziello determination,and the use of false testimony of.
we conclude that these three errors together are insufficient to warrant the remedy of a new trial,which is rarely used and is warranted only where there would be a miscarriage of justice or where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.id.as discussed above,we can not say that the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict on either the conspiracy or the possession charges.we have already concluded that there was legally sufficient evidence that possessed the requisite amount of drugs and significant evidence aside from the december events of his involvement in the conspiracy.nor can we say that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors,given the curative instructions that were given and the strength of the other evidence,constitutes a miscarriage of justice.
sentencing 
the appellants raise two types of sentencing issues.argues that the district court erred in its calculation of his guideline sentencing range.raises two objections to the calculation of his range.he first argues that the district court erred in failing to adjust his offense level for minor participation.we find no clear error in the district court refusal to give a minor role adjustment.see united states cassiere,cir.given the evidence of role described above,the district court could have reasonably concluded that his role was more than that of a minor participant.second,argues that the district court factual finding that the drug quantity involved in the conspiracy was over kilograms of cocaine was erroneous.we again find no clear error,as there was testimony that the conspiracy shipped four kilograms of cocaine to the united states every weeks for the period of the conspiracy november through december.see united states,cir.although argues that the drug quantities belonging to alleged government informant should not be counted for purposes of sentencing,this issue was not raised below and we find no plain error given the lack of evidence that was the only member of the conspiracy to possess these drugs 
finding no error in the calculation of the guideline sentencing ranges,we turn to the contention by both appellants that the district court failed adequately to explain its reasons for imposing the particular sentence within the range.because the appellants failed to object at sentencing,we review for plain error.see united states,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.
sentencing range was to months,and the district court sentenced him to months.sentencing range was to months,and the district court sentenced him to months.since both of these ranges exceeded months,the court,at the time of sentencing,was required to state in open court the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the guidelines sentencing range.c.in explaining why it chose the sentence it did for each defendant,the district court merely recited that it had considered the factors it was required to consider under a it did not specifically identify some discrete aspect of the defendant behavior and link that aspect to the goals of sentencing as is required under c,at.thus,as the government admits,the court statement was deficient as a matter of law.govt.br.at.
however,we must determine whether it constituted plain error sufficient to warrant resentencing.to vacate a sentence under plain error review,four prerequisites must be established an error occurred the error was clear and obvious the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states,cir.
we conclude that a clear and obvious error occurred but that this error did not affect and substantial rights.this court has addressed plain error review under united states booker,d,where the district court,in a trial conducted before booker was decided,treated the sentencing guidelines as mandatory.in that context,this circuit has held that t he burden is on the defendant to convince us on specific facts that there is a reasonable probability of a different sentence in the absence of the error.united states antonakopoulos,cir emphasis added.
this court has applied the same standard in reviewing a district court failure to comply with c,holding that a reversal under plain error review requires a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.united states gilman,cir quoting,at.
the purpose of c is to enable appellate review of district court sentencing decisions to insure that the district court choice of a particular sentence was reasonable.see,at see also,at,as reprinted in.our sister circuits have held that a sentence may be unreasonable 
if a sentencing court fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight,gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor,or considers only appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear error of judgment by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.
united states haack,cir see also united states smith,cir.thus,to establish a reasonable probability of a different sentence in the context of a c error,the appellant has the burden of identifying specific facts that convince us that the district court considered a significant improper factor,failed to consider a significant proper factor,or made a significant error in balancing the factors.
here,was sentenced near the low end of the applicable range and was sentenced near the midpoint.the appellants do not identify anything in the record suggesting that an improper factor was considered or a proper factor was not considered,nor do they identify any error in the balancing of the factors.the reasonable probability test is not satisfied by the mere assertion that the sentence could have been different if not for the error.see antonakopoulos,at.instead of pointing to specific facts to convince us that there is a reasonable probability of a different sentence,the appellants seem to urge a per se rule that the failure to provide an adequate explanation under c constitutes plain error.as noted,such a per se rule was specifically rejected in gilman.since the appellants have not carried their burden to identify specific facts that support a conclusion that there is a reasonable probability of a different sentence,we find no plain error and no basis for resentencing 
conclusion 
for the reasons explained above,the appellants convictions and sentences are affirmed.
it is so ordered.
at points in their briefs,both the government and assert that six government witnesses testified about the december events.however,they then only list five witnesses who so testified.this error may stem from apparently incorrect assertion below that fbi special agent amado vega testified about the december events.
see united states ingraldi,cir t he test for delayed disclosures is whether defendant counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant case.
in full,the court instructed the jury as follows the only part of the five witnesses testimony that i am striking has to do with what they testified to about the december,surveillance in
