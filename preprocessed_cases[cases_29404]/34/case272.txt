following a comprehensive investigation into the organized drug trade in a blighted neighborhood of boston,a jury convicted darren franklin of several charges stemming from the sale of crack cocaine and the possession of both drugs and ammunition.on appeal,franklin seeks to overturn those convictions,alleging an illegal search and an overly long time to trial.after careful consideration,we agree with the district court disposition of both issues.we affirm.
background 
drugs and ammunition 
in,federal,state,and local authorities began conducting a coordinated investigation of the drug trade around the warren gardens housing complex in the roxbury section of boston franklin reputation as a supplier of crack cocaine to street dealers led law enforcement to peg him as a primary target.looking to nab the cautious franklin on concrete charges,law enforcement set up two controlled buys of crack cocaine.
the first controlled buy occurred on july.on copeland street in roxbury,an undercover boston police officer approached a street dealer from whom he had previously purchased crack cocaine.queried about the availability of crack cocaine,the dealer shook hands with the officer,told him to sit on a nearby set of stairs,and then walked over to a minivan.the dealer spoke with two individuals in the van,one of whom was later identified as franklin.apparently fearful of so,given that the copeland street interactions were being recorded on told the dealer to move to a more discreet location before consummating the deal.the officer and the dealer crossed warren street and ended up on rockland street in the warren gardens complex,where a detective would later testify it is nearly impossible to conduct surveillance.the van arrived at rockland street moments later.the dealer approached the van,and franklin passed a plastic bag to the van other occupant,who then handed the bag to the dealer through the van open window.the dealer removed a material from the bag,cut off a chunk,and handed it to the officer.in return,the officer gave to the dealer,who then got into the van back seat.as the van pulled away,the officer saw the dealer pass the money to franklin.the chunk of material was later determined to contain a net weight of grams of crack cocaine.
the second controlled buy took place on march.this time,law enforcement employed a confidential informant ci to arrange a more substantial purchase from goal was an ounce,or roughly grams of crack cocaine.with an officer present,the ci twice tried to reach franklin by phone before he called her back.the ci and franklin arranged a deal to take place at the presidential acres apartment complex in randolph,massachusetts,where franklin mother lived.specifically,the ci asked for a full one referring to an franklin said he sell her for a g referring to.officers searched the ci and her vehicle and found no drugs or money they then provided her with in government money and placed a radio transmitter in her vehicle,on the driver side visor.
the ci traveled to the appointed location in randolph and parked by the pool.officers were posted at various places around the apartment complex,monitoring audio from the ci vehicle and recording video of franklin.the officers surveillance revealed that franklin exited his mother apartment,got into a brown vehicle,and drove to meet the ci by the pool.franklin got out of his vehicle and into the ci.the two of them conversed for a couple of minutes,and then franklin got back into his vehicle and left.the ci also drove away,followed by a dea agent.about a mile away from the apartment complex,the ci and the agent pulled over,and the ci handed over to the agent bags containing a substance.the substance was later determined to contain a net weight of grams of crack cocaine.
on april,the government was ready to move in on franklin a grand jury returned an indictment charging him with three counts of cocaine possession with intent to distribute,and the court issued a warrant for his arrest.that very night,detective robert fratalia set up a post at pine grove drive in brockton,massachusetts,where franklin was living with fania hemingway and her two children.fratalia surveilled both the apartment complex courtyard and a blue ford taurus sedan that was registered to franklin mother and that he had previously seen franklin drive.detective and deputized federal agent george maclaughlin and agent michael cashman were also posted separately nearby.
at around,an individual fitting franklin black man,around years old,six feet tall or so,and probably or from the courtyard and got into the front seat of a white sedan,which then drove away.the car returned about half an hour later,and the individual headed into the courtyard and out of fratalia sight.about an hour after that,the same individual emerged again,this time carrying a shopping bag,which he placed in the trunk of the blue ford taurus sedan.he got into the taurus driver seat,started the car,and began to pull away but stopped almost immediately then he waited a couple of minutes,got out of the car,locked it,and returned to the courtyard.
by around on april,a swat team had arrived to arrest franklin,who law enforcement had reasonably concluded was the individual fratalia had observed.the team surrounded the apartment complex.officer brian cahoon,a member of the swat team,used a cell phone to call into franklin apartment.hemingway answered the phone and then passed it to franklin.cahoon told franklin that the apartment was surrounded,so franklin prepared to surrender he got dressed,gathered his phone,his keys,and some loose cash,and then came out carrying a plastic bag full of ammunition.he was directed to leave his belongings on the ground and to crawl on all fours toward nearby officers he was then placed in plastic cuffs and taken into custody.
franklin was brought to maclaughlin and cashman,who introduced themselves and advised him of his miranda rights.franklin said he understood.by all accounts,the agents told franklin that he had been observed placing a plastic bag in the trunk of the blue ford taurus.here,however,the record diverges a bit.
according to cashman,the agents asked franklin if he would consent to a search of the car.franklin skirted the issue by responding that the car was his mother.cashman then asked him what was in the plastic bag franklin said it was a little weed.cashman followed up by asking why he had placed a little weed in the car franklin said he had heard that his people were getting arrested,and he wanted to protect his girlfriend by removing any contraband from the apartment.having secured this information,cashman repeated his initial request that franklin consent to a search of the car.franklin replied,yeah,do what you got to do.cashman testified specifically that the agents did not tell franklin that they would get a warrant to search the car if he did not consent.
according to maclaughlin,the conversation went more or less as cashman testified.under maclaughlin version of events,however,franklin only explained why he had placed the marijuana in the trunk of the protect his telling the agents to do what you got to do.
according to franklin,however,the agents first asked him what he had been doing in the car at night.franklin told them that he was just going out to my car to smoke some weed.they asked what was in the bag that he had placed in the trunk.he replied,some sneakers.then the agents asked whether they could search the car,to which franklin replied,no.after conferring with one another,the agents asked franklin whether the car was his mother.he replied that the car was his but was registered to his mother.stymied,mclaughlin said,well,you know we could tow the car until we get a search warrant.only at this point did franklin offer the response that the officers took as consent well,do what you got to do then.
on the basis of franklin apparent consent,mclaughlin retrieved the keys to the taurus from hemingway.the agents searched the car,finding a bag in the trunk.the bag contained a shoe box,the shoe box contained a smaller bag,and that bag contained grams of crack cocaine and grams of marijuana.
pretrial procedural hiccups 
on april,franklin entered a plea of not guilty,and on october,he moved to suppress the fruits of the agents search of the car,arguing that he had not actually consented to the search.franklin also requested an evidentiary hearing on the issue.the government opposed the motion and argued that there was no need for a hearing.
in the meantime,on october,franklin was also indicted on another charge,this time stemming from the drugs the agents found in the car the new indictment also added a charge.franklin entered a plea of not guilty to the additional counts in the superseding indictment.
in january,the district court first addressed the motion to suppress,suggesting that there was no real need for an evidentiary hearing.eight months later,however,the court granted the request for a hearing,which took place over three days in november and december in early march,having received no ruling from the district court,franklin filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for violation of the speedy trial act.
finally,on march,a year and a half after franklin filed his suppression court denied the motion on the alternate grounds that franklin had given consent or that the officers had probable cause to conduct the challenged search.two days later,the court denied the motion to dismiss,finding no violation of the speedy trial act.however,following a request for reconsideration,the court reversed course,found a violation,and dismissed the indictment without prejudice.
in november,a grand jury franklin on three counts of cocaine and one count of,all stemming from the three episodes set forth in the facts above.under the new indictment,franklin moved again for dismissal,this time with prejudice,for violations of the speedy trial act and the sixth amendment.the court denied the motion,and franklin was convicted on all counts after a trial.
on appeal,franklin raises only the speedy trial act and suppression issues.we have jurisdiction under.
speedy trial act 
the speedy trial act was enacted to effectuate the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial in criminal prosecutions.see united states scott,cir,at,reprinted in.the act provides at a that i f a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit established elsewhere in the act,then the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.because the parties agree that franklin was not timely brought to trial,the issue here is whether dismissal with prejudice is necessary under the act.
the act at a speaks to this issue directly 
in determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice,the court shall consider,among others,each of the following factors the seriousness of the offense the facts and circumstances of the case which led to dismissal and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.
in considering the other factors adverted to in the act,this court has hewn to the principle that any such factors must be rationally related to the balancing objectives of the tripartite test.united states hastings,cir.thus,these factors may include the length of the delay and the prejudice to the defendant stemming from the violation or conversely,the absence of prejudice.id.indeed,we have come to describe prejudice to the defendant as the fourth factor for courts to consider.see united states barnes,cir.in the end,however,one policy underrides our analysis dismissal with prejudice is a last and rare resort.united states dessesaure,cir.
our standard of review is abuse of discretion,see,but the district court decision is sound enough to withstand even significantly more searching scrutiny indeed,it is sufficiently to stand on its own.nevertheless,we will briefly expound on each of the factors set forth above.
first,franklin concedes that his crime was serious,and rightly so.both common sense and court precedent command the conclusion that the possession on multiple occasions of large quantities of drugs and ammunition is serious.see,id.at.
second,franklin argues that the facts and circumstances of the delay in this case are like those in united states stayton,cir,where the second circuit held that a delay between voir dire and swearing in the jury warranted a dismissal with prejudice applying the second factor,the stayton court noted that the district court ignored the persistent prodding of the government to decide outstanding motions and proceed to trial.id.at.given that specific context,the court held that the enormity of the delay was enough to tip th e second factor in favor of dismissal of the indictment with prejudice.id.at.
the government argues that this case is controlled by scott,where we held that a wait for an order on a motion to suppress warranted only dismissal without prejudice.among the factors supporting dismissal without prejudice was our determination that the facts and circumstances of the delay do not show any bad faith on the part of the government instead,t he delay was largely due to the district court,which acted without clear guidance by the law on the point.id.at.scott holding reflects our practice of looking to whether there is government culpability as the focus of our analysis.see united states hastings,cir.
the government is correct scott controls,and stayton does not.there are many reasons for this,not least of which is that scott is binding in this circuit while stayton is not.additionally,scott is squarely on point here in both cases,the delay stemmed from the court belated decision to hold an evidentiary hearing and then require more briefing and not from any government misconduct.see scott,at.we made clear in scott that these circumstances favor dismissal without prejudice.id.at.
stayton,on the other hand,is not only but also inapplicable here because of its vastly different facts.in stayton,there was no indication that the defendant bore any responsibility for the delay,for which the reviewing court could not discern a single justifying reason.stayton,at.here,franklin responsibility was twofold he requested a continuance and later remained silent about the delay until he filed the motion to dismiss.see dessesaure,at reversing dismissal with prejudice where the defendant was as to remind the judge about the delay as was the prosecutor.additionally,in stayton the delay was months here,the days,as the district court found,or,as franklin far shorter.in the end,then,scott controls,stayton is wholly inapposite,and the facts and circumstances of the delay strongly favor the government.
third,franklin suggests that dismissal without prejudice would disrupt the administration of justice and of the speedy trial act by effectively extracting the act teeth.this argument ignores the act specific inclusion of dismissal without prejudice as a sanction,and that sanction several teeth the cost to the government in bringing a new prosecution,the possibility of statute of limitations issues,the chance of failure to,and the risk of losing evidence and witnesses over time the argument has therefore been roundly repudiated by both this court and the supreme court.see united states taylor,dismissal without prejudice is not a toothless sanction.barnes,at quoting same.we need say no more on that.
fourth and finally,franklin does not suggest how he might have been prejudiced by the delay,instead espousing the proposition that where serious enough delay occurs,it i s unnecessary to determine the extent to which the defendant ha s actually been prejudiced.but the delay here was not extreme,and it resulted at least in part from franklin own request for a continuance and subsequent inaction.more importantly,franklin suggestion that we bypass prejudice belies a glaring weakness in his argument there is nothing in either the record or the briefs to indicate that he actually was prejudiced in any way by the district court delay.accordingly,the fourth factor tips the scale still further in the government favor.
thus,the record reveals a serious crime,a somewhat lengthy but innocuous delay,a just sanction,and no harm to franklin.far from being an abuse of discretion,the district court dismissal without
