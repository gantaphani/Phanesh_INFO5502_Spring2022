opinion of the court 
clayton lilly appeals to us from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus.he argues that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing to develop his claim that his counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him adequately about waiving his right to a jury trial.we disagree,and thus affirm the petition denial.
in,law enforcement officials began investigating lilly after they received information from a confidential informant that he was selling crack cocaine over the counter of the clothing store he owned and operated.after police observed lilly engage in a variety of drug transactions,they applied for a warrant to search him,his store,and his car.to avoid destruction of evidence,police detained lilly while waiting for the search warrant.upon executing the warrant,police found crack cocaine in lilly store as well as in his car and on his person.lilly then stated,it hard selling these clothes.the guys are buying these clothes.i have to support myself.lilly was arrested.police subsequently secured a search warrant for lilly home,where they discovered large amounts of crack cocaine.the combined searches yielded grams of crack cocaine.
a grand jury indicted lilly for possession with intent to distribute in excess of grams of a substance containing cocaine base,in violation of a and b a iii.prior to trial,lilly attorney,william stockey,filed a motion to suppress the evidence police had seized.because the evidence in support of the motion to suppress was almost identical to the evidence that would be presented at trial,the parties allegedly agreed to proceed with a trial where the district court would hear the evidence on the suppression motion and the trial together.however,lilly and his attorney did not sign a written waiver of his right pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a until some six weeks after the trial was completed,but before the district court rendered a verdict.
in november,the district court conducted a joint hearing and trial where it heard all of the evidence.at the beginning of the proceedings,the court confirmed with the parties their intent to have a trial 
the court i think the record should show that both the government and the defendant have requested a trial is that correct 
government that correct for the government,your honor.
stockey correct for the defendant,judge.
lilly was present for this interchange,but he did not speak up,nor did the court ask him directly to confirm his desire to waive a jury trial.
the court then heard evidence on the suppression motion and the case simultaneously.the government based its case on the cocaine that police had seized in its searches of lilly person,business,car,and home.lilly conceded that the searches had yielded a large quantity of cocaine,but argued that the search warrants were unsupported by probable cause because the police officers and the confidential informant were not credible.he further argued that the government had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that lilly was guilty because,among other things,it had not called the confidential informant to testify,nor had it established that lilly had the lavish lifestyle one would expect of a drug dealer.
after hearing all of the evidence,the court found the police officers to be credible and denied lilly motion to suppress.in late december,the court issued its findings of fact and found lilly guilty.at sentencing,the investigation report classified lilly as a career offender under the united states sentencing guidelines,giving him a guidelines range of months to life imprisonment.lilly filed a motion for downward departure on the basis that the designation overrepresented his criminal history.the court granted the motion and sentenced lilly to a term of imprisonment.
lilly appealed his conviction.stockey,his trial counsel,initially represented lilly on appeal,but then withdrew because lilly and his family could no longer afford his representation.our court appointed new appellate counsel.we affirmed lilly conviction in march.
in march,lilly filed a pro se habeas petition under.in it,lilly alleged,inter alia,that stockey had been ineffective in failing to advise him of his right to a jury trial and in failing to obtain from him a written,signed waiver of that right.lilly further alleged that stockey had tricked him into signing the written waiver six weeks after trial.
one month after filing the initial pro se petition,lilly filed a supplemental pro se habeas petition alleging that he was denied his constitutional right to a jury trial when his counsel waived it without his consent he further asserted that the district court would have learned all of this had it conducted a colloquy with him directly before accepting his waiver.the government filed a single response to both petitions contending that lilly had been informed of his right to a jury trial and had knowingly and voluntarily waived it.
the district court treated lilly multiple filings as a single,petition so that lilly would not run afoul of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa prohibition on filing second or successive habeas petitions the district court also appointed habeas counsel.while lilly petition was pending before the district court,his trial counsel submitted a voluntary affidavit stating that he had informed lilly of his right to a jury trial and that lilly had waived it.in pertinent part,the affidavit stated 
i am aware that lilly has filed a motion to vacate under i am also aware that lilly claims that i did not advise him of his right to a jury trial in the present case.
i did inform lilly that he had a right to trial by jury.on september,and at subsequent meetings i also advised him to waive that right and proceed with a bench trial.
lilly took my advice.he knowingly and willingly waived his right to jury trial.in fact,he even signed a written waiver of his right to jury trial that i filed with this court before a verdict was entered in this case.
the district court concluded that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary and denied lilly petition in its entirety.with regard to lilly claims about his waiver of a jury trial,the district court understood him to be making two distinct arguments that his counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him that he had a right to a jury trial,and in failing to have him sign a written rule a waiver of a jury trial before trial began.the court found that the record belied lilly assertion that he was never advised of his right to a jury trial.specifically,it reasoned that lilly signed waiver,his trial counsel affidavit saying that lilly had knowingly and willfully waived a jury trial,and the district court pretrial oral confirmation of lilly waiver demonstrate d indisputably that lilly was of his right to a jury trial.united states lilly,wl,at.the district court continued that lilly simply can not get a second chance with a jury after taking his chances with the court based on a claim,wholly refuted by the record,that he was not advised of his right to a jury trial.id.
with regard to lilly claim about the timing of the written waiver,the court held that rule a does not require that a written waiver be filed at any particular time.thus filing the waiver after trial but before verdict was appropriate.even assuming that the late waiver showed incompetence by lilly attorney,the court found no prejudice because it had orally confirmed the waiver with lilly counsel prior to trial in lilly presence.
finally,the court noted that it was under no duty to conduct an colloquy with lilly prior to accepting his waiver of the right.see united states anderson,cir.as will be discussed below,while an colloquy is preferred,it is not constitutionally required.id.
lilly filed a motion for reconsideration on the claim,which the district court denied.in the opinion and order denying reconsideration,the court considered whether lilly petition could be read as raising a due process claim in addition to an ineffective assistance of counsel,that his waiver was not knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.the court went on to find lilly due process
