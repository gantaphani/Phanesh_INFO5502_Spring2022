this appeal requires us to consider the admissibility of what is known as reverse rule b evidence.see rule b,federal rules of evidence.defendant richard williams was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon g after police discovered a semiautomatic handgun in the bedroom in which he was apprehended.at trial,williams sought to introduce evidence that another individual with whom he was arrested,andre urlin,had previously been convicted of possessing a firearm.the evidence was offered to show that the weapon found in the bedroom belonged to urlin rather than williams.the district court excluded the evidence.on appeal,williams contends that the district court erred and that,pursuant to our holding in united states stevens,cir,evidence of crimes or bad acts committed by persons other than the defendant reverse rule b evidence is admissible so long as its probative value is not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice,undue delay or confusion of the issues.
as explained herein,williams misreads stevens,and we write to clarify that rule b proscription against propensity evidence applies regardless of by whom,and against whom,it is offered.under stevens,we grant defendants more leeway in introducing bad acts evidence under one of the rule b only that its probative value is not substantially outweighed by rule considerations such as unfair prejudice,undue delay or confusion of the issues.but stevens did not afford defendants more leeway in admitting propensity evidence in violation of the prohibition of rule b.because the only purpose for which williams sought to introduce urlin prior conviction was to show that he has a propensity to carry firearms,the district court correctly excluded the evidence.accordingly,we will affirm williams conviction.we will also reject his reasonableness challenge to his sentence.
on may,detectives from the east orange police department responded to a report of drug activity at birchwood avenue.after arriving at the scene,the detectives surveilled the house from unmarked police cars.while they were watching the house,the detectives saw a silver audi sedan pull into the driveway of the house.williams and another man,leon clark,exited the vehicle.a third man,andre urlin,was waiting in the driveway for them.after williams and clark exited the car,urlin got in the driver side of the car and parked it in the garage at the back of the house.
suspecting correctly that the car was stolen,one of the detectives drove past the house to confirm the address and then radioed his to detain urlin,williams and clark.once the detectives converged on the scene,williams fled up the driveway and into the house.as he fled,one of the detectives observed that he was clutching a type weapon against his chest.the detective cried out gun and chased williams into the house.
the detective chased williams through the first floor of the house,losing sight of him only as he turned the corners.he and another detective finally cornered williams in a bedroom,where he was crouching over a bed with his back to the door.they apprehended,searched and handcuffed him.finding no weapon,one of the detectives began searching the bedroom.she found a,model,handgun loaded with a clip containing two bullets and full metal jacket between the mattress and the of the bed over which williams had been found crouching.the weapon had a long shoelace tied to it,serving as a strap.a consensual search of the house subsequently revealed glassine envelopes of heroin,in cash and a second stolen audi.two other individuals were also found in the home.
williams,urlin and clark were arrested.a criminal history check revealed that williams had several prior convictions,including a felony conviction for aggravated assault.williams was subsequently turned over to the united states bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g.
prior to trial,williams filed a motion in limine for admission of reverse rule b evidence that urlin had recently been convicted for possession of a firearm by a felon.williams contended that this evidence was admissible to show that urlin,rather than williams,had possessed the weapon in question.the district court delayed a ruling on the question until the close of evidence,at which time it denied the motion without explanation.the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
the presentence investigation report,to which williams did not object,stated that williams guidelines range was to months imprisonment,based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iv at his july,sentencing,williams requested a sentence,ten months below the applicable guidelines range.he asserted that he had a troubled childhood and a history of alcohol and marijuana abuse,and that he was denied rehabilitative opportunities while incarcerated in new jersey.the government opposed the request,noting that williams was convicted of possessing a very powerful weapon loaded with bullets and that he had an abysmal criminal history.it requested a sentence.
the district court agreed with the government that williams offense was very serious and that his criminal record was terrible.it also considered and rejected williams contention that his upbringing warranted a lesser sentence.it sentenced williams to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.the judgment of conviction and sentence was entered on august,and williams filed a timely notice of appeal.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction over williams claims of error at trial under.although the government contests our jurisdiction to review williams sentence for reasonableness,this court held that we have jurisdiction to review sentences for reasonableness under a.see united states cooper,cir but see cooper,at aldisert,concurring and dissenting.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.united states versaint,cir.under the abuse of discretion standard,an evidentiary ruling is to be reversed only if arbitrary or irrational.united states universal rehab,cir.
at the center of this case is this court decision in united states stevens,our seminal case addressing the admissibility of what is known as reverse rule b evidence.in contrast to ordinary other crimes evidence under rule b,which is used to incriminate criminal defendants,reverse rule b evidence is utilized to exonerate defendants.stevens,at such evidence is most commonly introduced by a defendant to show that someone else committed a similar crime or series of crimes,implying that he or she also must have committed the crime in question.see wigmore on evidence,at chadbourn ed.
in stevens,we held that the district court erred in excluding reverse rule b evidence of a similar robbery involving a victim who failed to identify the defendant as the assailant.at.the evidence was offered to show that the same person committed both robberies and that because the defendant was not identified as the perpetrator of the first robbery,he was not the perpetrator of the second.id.at.although one of the robberies involved a sexual assault and the other did not,both crimes took place within a few hundred yards of one another were armed robberies involved a handgun occurred between and were perpetrated on military personnel and involved a black assailant who was described similarly by his victims.id.the two robberies also occurred within days of one another,and the fruits of both robberies were discovered in similar locations.id.
at issue in stevens was what degree of similarity should be required when a defendant offers evidence of bad acts committed by a third party.the government argued that the same standard of similarity should apply regardless of who offers the evidence,and that the two robberies did not satisfy the high standard that would apply if it sought to introduce evidence of bad acts by a defendant.id.at see,carter hewitt,cir observing that the degree of similarity required to prove identity is extremely high when the government seeks to introduce a defendant bad acts.specifically,it contended that the defendant must show that there has been more than one similar crime or that the other crime was sufficiently similar to be called a signature crime.stevens,at.we disagreed,concluding that rule b was primarily intended to protect defendants and that a lower standard of similarity should govern reverse rule b evidence because prejudice to the defendant is not a factor.id.recasting our conclusion in terms of the federal rules of evidence,we stated that a defendant may introduce reverse b evidence so long as its probative value under rule is not substantially outweighed by rule considerations.id.at 
williams reads this language in stevens to mean that evidence of bad acts involving someone other than the defendant is admissible whenever its probative value is not substantially outweighed by rule considerations,regardless of the purpose for which it is admitted propensity,identity,motive or otherwise.williams defense in this case is that urlin possessed the gun,not him.he argues that urlin prior conviction rationally tends to disprove his own guilt the import of the conviction being that urlin has a propensity to possess firearms and that,therefore,the gun recovered from under the mattress was likely urlin 
williams misreads stevens.this court has never held that rule b prohibition against propensity evidence is inapplicable where the evidence is offered by the defendant.in stevens,it was indisputable that the evidence was being offered to show identity,that the perpetrator of the second robbery was the same as the perpetrator of the first because of the similarity of the crimes.rule b expressly permits such evidence of other similar crimes to prove identity.see rule b,federal rules of evidence bad acts evidence may be admitted to prove motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake emphasis added see,united states powers,cir holding that other bank robberies and attempted robbery of which defendant had been convicted were sufficiently similar to the charged offense to render identity evidence admissible.the evidence was not being used to show that the perpetrator of the first robbery committed the second robbery simply because he had a general propensity to commit robberies.
it was implicit in stevens that we do not begin to balance the evidence probative value under rule against rule considerations unless the evidence is offered under one of the rule b exceptions.that the prohibition against propensity evidence applies regardless of by against is offered is evident from rule b plain language,which states that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.rule b,federal rules of evidence emphasis added.rather than restricting itself to barring evidence that tends to prove the character of the accused to show conformity therewith,rule b bars evidence that tends to prove the character of any person to show conformity therewith.although,under stevens,a defendant is allowed more leeway in introducing evidence under rule b,he or she is not allowed more leeway in admitting propensity evidence in violation of rule b.united states mccourt,cir explaining language from united states aboumoussallem,cir,that is virtually identical to that used in stevens.we therefore reject williams argument,and affirm that the prohibition against the introduction of bad acts evidence to show propensity applies regardless of whether the evidence is offered against the defendant or a third party see united states lucas,cir w e affirm that prior bad acts are generally not considered proof of any person likelihood to commit bad acts in the future and that such evidence should demonstrate something more than propensity.emphasis added mccourt,at evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts,no matter by whom offered,is not admissible for the purpose of providing propensity or conforming conduct,although it may be admissible if offered for some other relevant purpose.united states white,cir unpublished a s opposed to rule a,which relates to character evidence of an accused,witness or victim,rule b applies to other acts evidence regarding a person.citing lucas,at united states sturm,cir affirming exclusion under rule b of evidence that witness had been involved in a prior scheme.
perhaps anticipating our conclusion that urlin prior conviction was not admissible to show that he had a propensity to possess weapons,williams argues in the alternative that urlin prior conviction was admissible to prove opportunity and identity,which are among the several purposes for which such testimony can be introduced under rule b.see rule b,federal rules of evidence.this argument is not convincing.first,we fail to see how the prior conviction could supply urlin with the opportunity to commit the crime for which williams is charged.there was no evidence that urlin prior conviction involved the same gun,or even the same type of gun which might imply that he had continued access to the type of gun in question.
second,although a prior conviction need not rise to level of a signature crime to justify admission under rule b identity exception,see stevens,at,urlin prior conviction is simply too generic to prove identity.as in stevens,we balance the probative value of the evidence under rule against the countervailing rule considerations to determine whether the prior bad act is admissible to prove the identity of the perpetrator.looking first at rule,the evidence of urlin prior conviction is not probative of the identity of the handgun owner.there is no evidence that urlin was arrested with the same model or in the same location,or that the two crimes share any facts in common other than that they both involved a gun.the mere prior possession of a firearm,without more,is not by any means a distinctive act,and does not prove identity see united states spencer,cir i f the characteristics of both the prior offense and the charged offense are not in any way distinctive,but are similar to numerous other crimes committed by persons other than the defendant,no inference of identity can arise.quoting united states perkins,cir.moreover,even assuming that the information had some minimal probative value,it would be substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues.see lucas,at observing that unfair prejudice is viewed not only from the defendant perspective citing rule,federal rules of evidence,advisory committee notes unfair prejudice within its context means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,commonly,though not necessarily,an emotional one.
ultimately,urlin prior conviction was only probative inasmuch as it showed that he had a propensity to carry a purpose proscribed by rule b.williams protestations to the contrary are not persuasive.as we stated in united states morley,cir,a proponent incantation of the proper uses of such evidence under the rule does not magically transform inadmissible evidence into admissible evidence.id.at.he or she must clearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences,no link of which may be the inference that the defendant has the propensity to commit the crime charged.id.quoting united states himelwright,cir.williams has not done that here.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in excluding evidence of urlin conviction,as it was not admissible to show propensity and was not probative of identity or opportunity.see lucas,at holding that companion prior conviction for possessing and selling cocaine was not admissible to show that defendant did not possess the cocaine in question because it showed propensity and was not probative of knowledge or intent spencer,at holding that companion prior bad act of h iding a gun under a car seat is not a distinctive crime,and can not be used to satisfy the identity exception to rule b.
williams also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence.the district court explained williams sentence as follows 
the court has considered the appropriate sentence and the factors as set forth in and,of
