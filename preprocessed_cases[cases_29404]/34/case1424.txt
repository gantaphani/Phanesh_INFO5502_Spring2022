opinion of the court 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania has appealed the district court grant of the writ of habeas corpus to florencio rolan.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
background 
florencio rolan was convicted in pennsylvania state court of murder and of possession of an instrument of crime for the death of paulino santiago.the commonwealth theory of the crime was that rolan shot and killed santiago during an attempted robbery of the proceeds of a drug deal.rolan was sentenced to death by a jury,but in the pennsylvania relief court vacated the sentence,holding that rolan attorney provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of the trial.in,the penalty phase was retried and,following a unanimous jury verdict,rolan was to life imprisonment.rolan then brought a federal habeas action under,alleging that he also received ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt stage of his original trial.
the crux of rolan ineffective assistance claim was that his trial counsel,melvin goldstein,failed to investigate two witnesses who would have supported rolan claim.as a result,goldstein never called the witnesses to testify at trial.rolan also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because goldstein prevented rolan from testifying on his own behalf and because goldstein did not properly francisco santiago,the prosecution key witness,concerning a deal with the commonwealth for his testimony.
rolan version of events,which corroborates his claim,is that he and his cousin,robert aponte,were involved in a dispute with brothers,paulino and francisco santiago,over the proceeds of a petty drug sale.a buyer drove by the street corner on which rolan,aponte,and the santiago brothers were selling marijuana.the driver held out a five dollar bill,and paulino santiago and aponte both tossed a nickel bag of marijuana into a car.paulino grabbed the bill as the driver drove away with the two bags,leaving paulino and aponte to resolve their claims to the money.in the ensuing dispute rolan sided with aponte,and francisco santiago with his brother,paulino.
according to rolan,at some point during the argument,an intoxicated paulino grew angry and walked away,and francisco went to urinate in an abandoned building in which neighborhood residents kept guns and drugs.rolan followed francisco into the building to continue discussing the payment incident.paulino then entered the building.he was carrying what rolan believed to be a knife,shouted a threat at rolan,and charged at him.rolan claims that he noticed a loaded rifle lying nearby,picked it up in time,and felled paulino with a single shot.
prior to trial,goldstein and rolan spoke on two occasions for short periods of time.goldstein asked rolan whether there were any people with whom he should speak about the crime.rolan provided two names robert aponte and daniel vargas.goldstein wrote a letter to the prosecutor office in which he disclosed these names as potential alibi rather than witnesses in accordance with pennsylvania law.see.formerly.rolan claims that he did not tell goldstein that vargas and aponte were alibi witnesses but instead that he wanted to call them in furtherance of his claim.
there is no indication that goldstein ever attempted to contact vargas or aponte.a detective for the commonwealth did,however,interview them.vargas refused to cooperate with the detective.the detective reported that vargas knew absolutely nothing about rolan and was not an alibi witnesses.when aponte was interviewed,he told the detective that a s i started walking home after the shooting i saw my cousin rolan and i asked him was he alright,paulino santiago did stab you or anything.
for reasons that are not clear from the record,the prosecution initially did not disclose having interviewed aponte,stating on the eve of trial that he could not be found.at the close of the case,the prosecution did admit that detectives had interviewed aponte,but reported that he was not an alibi witness and that neither vargas nor aponte knew anything about paulino santiago death.goldstein did not dispute the prosecution claim.
at trial,the commonwealth presented evidence that rolan killed paulino santiago after following him into an abandoned house with the intention of robbing him of the five dollars from the drug deal.the main witness for the state was francisco santiago,who testified that he and paulino were in the abandoned house when rolan burst in carrying a rifle and demanded that paulino give him the drug money.according to francisco,rolan then fired a single shot to paulino chest,killing him.francisco further testified that rolan fled out of the back of the house and down an alley francisco was given immunity from prosecution for the drug activities described in the testimony and other charges related to his brother murder.at trial,the prosecution stated that the only thing the commonwealth gave in exchange for francisco testimony was a letter to the parole board to let them know that francisco had cooperated in the investigation and trial.this misrepresentation was never corrected by the commonwealth or challenged by goldstein.
the commonwealth also called edwin rosado.rosado testimony was largely inconsistent with francisco account.rosado claimed to have heard paulino and rolan arguing over a woman and stated that rolan entered the house,without a weapon,before paulino.rosado then heard a single shot and saw paulino emerge from the front of the house,at which point francisco came to aid his not from inside the house,as francisco claimed.
rolan pressed his attorney in open court to call vargas and aponte after goldstein said he had no witnesses to call on rolan behalf.rolan declared,yes,i have two other witnesses who are willing to come and testify.goldstein explained to the court that rolan was referring to vargas and aponte but that neither were alibi witnesses.after some wrangling between counsel and the court,goldstein refused to call the witnesses.the jury returned a verdict of guilty and sentenced rolan to death.melvin goldstein died while the direct appeal of rolan conviction was pending.after the direct appeal was denied,commonwealth rolan,rolan sought collateral relief under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.et.in the meantime,robert aponte died.
in,the pennsylvania court of common pleas held an evidentiary hearing on rolan pcra petition.at the hearing,vargas testified that he was never asked to testify on behalf of rolan but would have testified if he had been asked to do so.vargas also stated that the detective asked him to testify against rolan and that he did not voluntarily go to the police with his knowledge of the case because at that time he did want to get involved in that because the families was sic hurt and he knew both families.vargas also testified at the pcra hearing that,when rolan went into the abandoned house,he was not carrying anything except a quart of beer francisco followed rolan into the house then paulino came around the corner carrying a kitchen knife paulino went into the house after rolan,screaming,i kill you,motherfucker vargas then heard a shot.when vargas went into the house with aponte,paulino was lying on the ground and there was a knife at his feet.
on,the commonwealth questioned vargas concerning his recalcitrance when interviewed by detectives before rolan criminal trial.the commonwealth noted that the detective who interviewed vargas gave him a piece of paper that said you being questioned concerning a possible alibi witness for the defendant florencio rolan.are you willing to give a statement to the district attorney office.vargas,who stated that he understood alibi to mean lie,testified that he thought this meant that the detective had approached him to testify against rolan.
the pcra trial court found that goldstein assistance was constitutionally defective during the penalty phase of rolan trial and vacated the death sentence but held that rolan had waived his claims regarding the guilt phase of his trial.the court nevertheless reviewed rolan claims regarding the guilt phase for purpose of providing the state appellate court with a complete record.although its analysis was brief and conclusory,the pcra trial court rejected rolan ineffectiveness claims.see commonwealth rolan,slip op.
rolan appealed the denial of pcra relief as to his guilt to the pennsylvania superior court.the superior court held that the court of common pleas erred in finding that rolan claims for ineffective assistance were waived.it then proceeded to the merits and rejected the claims both because the court was unable to conclude that vargas was willing to appear on rolan behalf at trial and because aponte statements were irrelevant to the claim.the court declared that aponte statement establishes merely that aponte was aware that rolan had engaged in an altercation and was not immune to the potential danger posed by life on the street.any suggestion that aponte question establishes his awareness that the victim had actually attempted to stab rolan is entirely unsubstantiated.the superior court also found that goldstein was not ineffective as counsel for interfering with rolan right to testify because rolan decision was knowing and voluntary.in addition,although the superior court conceded that the prosecution should have articulated to the jury the details of its deal with francisco,its failure to do so did not so undermine the process as to require a new trial.see commonwealth rolan,phila,slip op,june.
rolan then filed his federal habeas petition under.the district court exercised jurisdiction under a and a.the district court granted rolan habeas petition pursuant to because of goldstein ineffective assistance of counsel.claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are reviewed under the test of strickland washington,which examines whether assistance was ineffective and,if so,whether it prejudiced the defendant,d.the district court concluded that there was no finding of fact on vargas willingness to testify to which it was required to defer under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,et,because the finding was made by the pcra appellate court rather than by the pcra trial court as required by pennsylvania procedure.the district court then conducted an evidentiary hearing at which vargas testified,and credited vargas testimony that he would have testified if he had been called on rolan behalf at trial.having rejected the state court prejudice analysis,the district court proceeded to strickland s ineffectiveness prong and concluded that goldstein performance was unconstitutionally defective because he failed to conduct any pretrial investigation.this meant that his decision to forgo the claim was not a strategic choice entitled to a presumption of validity.strickland,at.the district court rejected or did not address rolan other claims of constitutional error.
the commonwealth of pennsylvania appealed.we have jurisdiction over the appeal under and c a.we undertake a plenary review over a district court grant of habeas corpus,duvall elwood,cir,and review any factual findings resulting from the district court evidentiary hearing for clear error,love morton,cir.
ii.discussion 
this appeal by the commonwealth presents several issues did the district court err in failing to defer to the superior court appellate factual determination that vargas was unwilling to testify at trial did the district court err in holding an evidentiary hearing to determine whether vargas was willing to testify at the guilt phase of rolan trial did the district court err in holding that rolan trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the potential witnesses.first,however,we must determine whether the pcra courts considered rolan claims on the merits so that aedpa applies to the district court consideration of this habeas petition.
does aedpa apply to the district court determination to grant habeas relief 
to determine whether aedpa,et,applies to rolan claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,it is necessary to assess whether the pennsylvania state courts adjudicated the claim on the merits.everett beard,cir.on appellate review of rolan pcra petition,the pennsylvania superior court concluded that rolan was not prejudiced by his attorney failure to interview vargas,a possible witness,because rolan could not establish that vargas was willing to testify on rolan behalf at trial.a court can choose to address the prejudice prong before the ineffectiveness prong and reject an ineffectiveness claim solely on the ground that the defendant was not prejudiced.see strickland,at.here,because the pcra appellate court found that vargas was not willing to testify at the guilt phase of rolan trial,its decision to deny habeas relief on that basis constituted an adjudication on the merits.see rompilla horn,cir,rev on other grounds,rompilla beard,d.therefore,aedpa applies to rolan habeas petition.
aedpa limits a federal court authority to grant habeas relief when a state court has previously considered and rejected the federal claim on the merits.d.if the petitioner legal claims were presented but not addressed by the state courts,d does not apply,and federal courts undertake a de novo review of the claim.everett,at.
if aedpa does apply,however,the writ can not be granted unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
aedpa also has a provision relating specifically to a federal court review of state court factual findings 
in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
these limitations on review of the state courts factual findings applied to the district court consideration of rolan petition and also to our review here.
b.the district court erred in failing to defer to the pennsylvania pcra appellate court findings of fact.
the district court declined to defer to the pennsylvania superior court factual determination at the appellate level that vargas was not willing to testify on rolan behalf at the guilt stage of rolan criminal trial.the district court,citing campbell vaughn,cir,first determined that,according to pennsylvania review procedure,an appellate court should remand a case to the pcra trial court for factual determinations rather than make them in the first instance.because the superior court made its decision upon review of the cold record from the pcra trial court,rather than remanding,the district court did not believe that it was bound to defer.
when earlier presented with this issue of deference to appellate factual findings in campbell,we specifically declined to rule on whether a federal court must defer to a pennsylvania pcra appellate court finding of fact made on a cold appellate record.at.
generally,federal courts defer to state appellate court determinations of fact.in sumner mata,the supreme court addressed whether a federal court should defer to state appellate court determinations of fact,d.in that case,the california court of appeal made the factual determinations at issue after review of the trial court record.id.at.the supreme court held that state appellate court fact finding should receive deference on habeas review because d makes no distinction between the factual determinations of a state trial court and those of a state appellate court.id.moreover,important interests in comity and federalism require deference to factual determinations made by all state courts.id.
similarly,in dickerson vaughn,we reviewed a habeas petition following a pennsylvania pcra proceeding.cir.in that case,the pcra trial court made findings of fact following an evidentiary hearing.id.at.on review,the pcra appellate court specifically rejected these findings based on the same record.id.dickerson cited both sumner and parke raley,d,for the
