while conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel in the gulf of mexico,a federal agent found that the ship catch contained undersized red grouper,in violation of federal conservation regulations.the officer instructed the ship captain,petitioner yates,to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the catch until the ship returned to port.after the officer departed,yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish overboard.for this offense,yates was charged with destroying,concealing,and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation,in violation of.that section provides that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to years if he knowingly alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record,document,or tangible object with the intent to impede,obstruct,or influence a federal investigation.at trial,yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge.pointing to origin as a provision of the act of,a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of enron corporation,yates argued that reference to tangible object subsumes objects used to store information,such as computer hard drives,not fish.the district court denied yates motion,and a jury found him guilty of violating.the eleventh circuit affirmed the conviction,concluding that applies to the destruction or concealment of fish because,as objects having physical form,fish fall within the dictionary definition of tangible object.
held the judgment is reversed,and the case is remanded.
reversed and remanded.
justice ginsburg,joined by the chief justice,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor,concluded that a tangible object within compass is one used to record or preserve information.
a although dictionary definitions of the words tangible and object bear consideration in determining the meaning of tangible object in,they are not dispositive.whether a statutory term is unambiguous is determined not only by reference to the language itself,but also by the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.identical language may convey varying content when used in different statutes,sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute.see,faa cooper.

section position within title,chapter,further signals that was not intended to serve as a ban on the destruction of physical evidence.congress placed at the end of chapter following immediately after specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.
the contemporaneous passage of c,which prohibits a person from alter ing,destroy ing,mutilat ing,or conceal ing a record,document,or other object with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,is also instructive.the government argues that c reference to other object includes any and every physical object.but if reference to tangible object already included all physical objects,as the government also contends,then congress had no reason to enact c.section should not be read to render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same act.see marx general revenue.
the words immediately surrounding tangible object in falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record or document also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,tangible object,as the last in a list of terms that begins any record or document,is appropriately read to refer,not to any tangible object,but specifically to the subset of tangible objects used to record or preserve information.this moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions proscribes the verbs falsif y and mak e a false entry in typically take as grammatical objects records,documents,or things used to record or preserve information,such as logbooks or hard drives.see gustafson alloyd.

furthermore,the meaning of record,document,or thing in a provision of the model penal code mpc that has been interpreted to prohibit tampering with any kind of physical evidence is not a reliable indicator of the meaning congress assigned to record,document,or tangible object in.there are significant differences between the offense described by the mpc provision and the offense created by.

justice alito concluded that traditional rules of statutory construction confirm that yates has the better argument.title list of nouns,list of verbs,and title,when combined,tip the case in favor of yates.applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns any record,document,or tangible object the term tangible object should refer to something similar to records or documents.and while many of verbs alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in could apply to nouns such as salamanders or sand dunes,the term makes a false entry in makes no sense outside of filekeeping.finally,title destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.

john yates,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice ginsburg announced the judgment of the court and delivered an opinion,in which the chief justice,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor join.
john yates,a commercial fisherman,caught undersized red grouper in federal waters in the gulf of mexico.to prevent federal authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish,yates ordered a crew member to toss the suspect catch into the sea.for this offense,he was charged with,and convicted of,violating,which provides 
whoever knowingly alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record,document,or tangible object with the intent to impede,obstruct,or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title,or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
yates was also indicted and convicted under a,which provides 
destruction or removal of property to prevent seizure.whoever,before,during,or after any search for or seizure of property by any person authorized to make such search or seizure,knowingly destroys,damages,wastes,disposes of,transfers,or otherwise takes any action,or knowingly attempts to destroy,damage,waste,dispose of,transfer,or otherwise take any action,for the purpose of preventing or impairing the government lawful authority to take such property into its custody or control or to continue holding such property under its lawful custody and control,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
yates does not contest his conviction for violating a,but he maintains that fish are not trapped within the term tangible object,as that term is used in.
section was enacted as part of the act of,stat,legislation designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of enron corporation.a fish is no doubt an object that is tangible fish can be seen,caught,and handled,and a catch,as this case illustrates,is vulnerable to destruction.but it would cut loose from its mooring to hold that it encompasses any and all objects,whatever their size or significance,destroyed with obstructive intent.mindful that in,congress trained its attention on corporate and accounting deception and,we conclude that a matching construction of is in order a tangible object captured by,we hold,must be one used to record or preserve information.
on august,the miss katie,a commercial fishing boat,was six days into an expedition in the gulf of mexico.her crew numbered three,including yates,the captain.engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect both recreational and commercial vessels,officer john jones of the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission decided to board the miss katie to check on the vessel compliance with fishing rules.although the miss katie was far enough from the florida coast to be in exclusively federal waters,she was nevertheless within officer jones jurisdiction.because he had been deputized as a federal agent by the national marine fisheries service,officer jones had authority to enforce federal,as well as state,fishing laws.
upon boarding the miss katie,officer jones noticed three red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on the deck.at the time,federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red grouper less than inches long.cfr d ii effective april.violation of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension.see a,g,a,g.
suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board,officer jones proceeded to inspect the ship catch,setting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to him to be shorter than inches.officer jones ultimately determined that fish fell short of the mark.a fellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized fish on a catch measurement verification form.with few exceptions,the measured fish were between and inches three were less than inches none were less than inches.after separating the fish measuring below inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates,officer jones directed yates to leave the fish,thus segregated,in the crates until the miss katie returned to port.before departing,officer jones issued yates a citation for possession of undersized fish.
four days later,after the miss katie had docked in cortez,florida,officer jones measured the fish contained in the wooden crates.this time,however,the measured fish,although still less than inches,slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board.jones surmised that the fish brought to port were not the same as those he had detected during his initial inspection.under questioning,one of the crew members admitted that,at yates direction,he had thrown overboard the fish officer jones had measured at sea,and that he and yates had replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.
for reasons not disclosed in the record before us,more than months passed before criminal charges were lodged against yates.on may,he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure,in violation of a,and for destroying,concealing,and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation,in violation of by the time of the indictment,the minimum legal length for gulf red grouper had been lowered from inches to inches.see cfr d iv effective may.no measured fish in yates catch fell below that limit.the record does not reveal what civil penalty,if any,yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the regulation.see a.
yates was tried on the criminal charges in august.at the end of the government case in chief,he moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge.pointing to title and its origin as a provision of the act,yates argued that the section sets forth a documents offense and that its reference to tangible object s subsumes computer hard drives,logbooks,and things of that nature,not fish.app.yates acknowledged that the criminal code contains sections that would have been appropriate for the g overnment to pursue if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with evidence.app.section a,set out supra,at,fit that description.but,yates insisted,did not.
the government countered that a tangible object within compass is simply something other than a document or record.app.the trial judge expressed misgivings about reading tangible object as broadly as the government urged is there a latin phrase about construction of a statute.the gist of it is you take a look at a line of words,and you interpret the words consistently.so if you talking about documents,and records,tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a record,as opposed to a fish.ibid.the judge nonetheless followed controlling eleventh circuit precedent.while recognizing that was passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud,the court of appeals had instructed that the broad language of is not limited to corporate fraud cases,and congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially prompted legislative action.md,app.quoting united states hunt.accordingly,the trial court read tangible object as a term independent of record or document.app.for violating and a,the court sentenced yates to imprisonment for days,followed by supervised release for three years.app.for life,he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.
on appeal,the eleventh circuit found the text of plain.because tangible object was undefined in the statute,the court of appeals gave the term its ordinary or natural meaning,its dictionary definition,h aving or possessing physical form.ibid.quoting black law dictionary ed.
we granted certiorari,and now reverse the eleventh circuit judgment.
the act,all agree,was prompted by the exposure of enron massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company outside auditor,arthur andersen llp,had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents.the government acknowledges that was intended to prohibit,in particular,corporate to hide evidence of financial wrongdoing.brief for united states.prior law made it an offense to intimidat e,threate n,or corruptly persuad e another person to shred documents.b emphasis added.section cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself.see,describing as a new general anti shredding provision and explaining that certain current provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents,but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents yourself the new section also expanded prior law by including within the provision reach any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states.at.
in the government view,extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage.the words of,the government argues,support reading the provision as a general ban on the spoliation of evidence,covering all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under federal investigation.
yates urges a contextual reading of,tying tangible object to the surrounding words,the placement of the provision within the act,and related provisions enacted at the same time,in particular and c,see infra,at.section,he maintains,targets not all manner of evidence,but records,documents,and tangible objects used to preserve them,computers,servers,and other media on which information is stored.
we agree with yates and reject the government unrestrained reading.tangible object in,we conclude,is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information,not all objects in the physical world.
the ordinary meaning of an object that is tangible,as stated in dictionary definitions,is a discrete thing,webster third new international dictionary,that possess es physical form,black law dictionary ed.from this premise,the government concludes that tangible object,as that term appears in,covers the waterfront,including fish from the sea.
whether a statutory term is unambiguous,however,does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words.rather,t he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined not only by reference to the language itself,but as well by the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.see also deal united states,it is a fundamental principle of statutory construction and,indeed,of language itself that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used ordinarily,a word usage accords with its dictionary definition.in law as in life,however,the same words,placed in different contexts,sometimes mean different things.
we have several times affirmed that identical language may convey varying content when used in different statutes,sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute.see,faa cooper,slip,at actual damages has different meanings in different statutes wachovia bank,schmidt,located has different meanings in different provisions of the national bank act general dynamics land systems,cline,age has different meanings in different provisions of the age discrimination in employment act of united states cleveland indians baseball,wages paid has different meanings in different provisions of title robinson,at employee has different meanings in different sections of title vii of the civil rights act of merrell dow pharmaceuticals thompson,arising under has different meanings in,art.iii,and district of columbia carter,state or territory has different meanings in and atlantic cleaners dyers,united states,trade or commerce has different meanings in different sections of the sherman act.as the court observed in atlantic cleaners dyers,at 
most words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed.where the subject matter to which the words refer is not the same in the several places where the words are used,or the conditions are different,or the scope of the legislative power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another,the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes of the law,to be arrived at by a consideration of the language in which those purposes are expressed,and of the circumstances under which the language was employed.
in short,although dictionary definitions of the words tangible and object bear consideration,they are not dispositive of the meaning of tangible object in.
supporting a reading of tangible object,as used in,in accord with dictionary definitions,the government points to the appearance of that term in federal rule of criminal procedure.that rule requires the prosecution to grant a defendant request to inspect tangible objects within the government control that have utility for the defense.see fed.rule crim.proc.a e.
rule reference to tangible objects has been interpreted to include any physical evidence.see lafave,israel,king,kerr,criminal procedure g,and ed.rule is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue.in that context,a comprehensive construction of tangible objects is fitting.in contrast,is a penal provision that refers to tangible object not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding,but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind,including those not yet begun see commissioner national carbide,hand,words are chameleons,which reflect the color of their environment just as the context of rule supports giving tangible object a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition,the context of tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.
familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words tangible object as they appear in.
we note first caption destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy.that heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence,however remote from records.neither does the title of the section of the act in which was placed,criminal penalties for altering documents.stat.furthermore,the only other provision passed as part of,is titled destruction of corporate audit records and addresses only that specific subset of records and documents.while these headings are not commanding,they supply cues that congress did not intend tangible object in to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,including things no one would describe as records,documents,or devices closely associated with them.see united states,t he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.if congress indeed meant to make an ban on the spoliation of evidence,as the dissent believes congress did,one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent.
section position within chapter of title further signals that was not intended to serve as a ban on the destruction of physical evidence of every kind.congress placed and its companion provision at the end of the chapter,following immediately after the,and,each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific contexts.see audits of recipients of federal funds federal examinations of financial institutions criminal investigations of federal health care offenses.see also,at observing that and apply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases,such as bankruptcy fraud,examinations of financial institutions,and healthcare fraud 
but congress did not direct codification of the act other additions to chapter adjacent to these specialized provisions.instead,congress directed placement of those additions within or alongside retained provisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to official proceedings and criminal trials section,civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,was codified as and inserted between the,which addresses civil actions to restrain harassment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases,and,which defines terms used in and.section,tampering with a record or otherwise impeding an official proceeding,was codified as c and inserted within the,which addresses tampering with a victim,witness,or informant to impede any official proceeding.section,retaliation against informants,was codified as e and inserted within the,which addresses retaliation against a victim,witness,or informant in any official proceeding.congress thus ranked,not among the broad proscriptions,but together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits.this placement accords with the view that congress conception of coverage was considerably more limited than the government 
the contemporaneous passage of c,which was contained in a section of the act discrete from the section embracing and,is also instructive.section c provides 
c whoever corruptly 
alters,destroys,mutilates,or conceals a record,document,or other object,or attempts to do so,with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the legislative history reveals that c was drafted and proposed after.see cong.rec.the government argues,and yates does not dispute,that c reference to other object includes any and every physical object.but if reference to tangible object already included all physical objects,as the government and the dissent contend,then congress had no reason to enact c virtually any act that would violate c no doubt would violate as well,for applies to the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter,not just to an official proceeding.
the government acknowledges that,under its reading,and c significantly overlap.brief for united states.nowhere does the government explain what independent function c would serve if the government is right about the sweeping scope of.we resist a reading of that would render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same act see marx general revenue,slip,at t he canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.
the words immediately surrounding tangible object in falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record or document also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.as explained in gustafson alloyd,we rely on the principle of noscitur a sociis a word is known by the company it keeps to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words,thus giving unintended breadth to the acts of congress.internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states williams,a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated in gustafson,we interpreted the word communication in of the securities act of to refer to a public communication,rather than any communication,because the word appeared in a list with other words,notably notice,circular,and advertisement,making it apparent that the list refer red to documents of wide dissemination.at.and we did so even though the list began with the word any.
the noscitur a sociis canon operates in a similar manner here.tangible object is the last in a list of terms that begins any record or document.the term is therefore appropriately read to refer,not to any tangible object,but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents,objects used to record or preserve information.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual,records,documents,or tangible objects includes a records,documents,or tangible objects that are stored on,or that are,magnetic,optical,digital,other electronic,or other storage mediums or devices and b wire or electronic communications.
this moderate interpretation of tangible object accords with the list of actions proscribes.the section applies to anyone who alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record,document,or tangible object with the requisite obstructive intent.emphasis added.the last two verbs,falsif y and mak e a false entry in,typically take as grammatical objects records,documents,or things used to record or preserve information,such as logbooks or hard drives.see,black law dictionary ed.defining falsify as t o make deceptive to counterfeit,forge,or misrepresent,to tamper with a document,record.it would be unnatural,for example,to describe a killer act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as falsifying the murder weapon.but it would not be strange to refer to falsifying data stored on a hard drive as simply falsifying a hard drive.furthermore,congress did not include on c list of prohibited actions falsifies or makes a false entry in.see c making it unlawful to alte r,destro y,mutilat e,or concea l a record,document,or other object with the requisite obstructive intent.that contemporaneous omission also suggests that congress intended tangible object in to have a narrower scope than other object in c 
a canon related to noscitur a sociis,ejusdem generis,counsels where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are usually construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.washington state of social and health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,internal quotation marks omitted.in begay united states,for example,we relied on this principle to determine what crimes were covered by the statutory phrase any crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,e b ii.the enumeration of specific crimes,we explained,indicates that the otherwise involves provision covers only similar crimes,rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.at.had congress intended the latter all encompassing meaning,we observed,it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all.ibid.see also csx,alabama of revenue,slip,at we typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.just so here.had congress intended tangible object in to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish,congress would have had no reason to refer specifically to record or document.the government unbounded reading of tangible object would render those words misleading surplusage.
having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine markers of congressional intent within the act and itself,we are persuaded that an aggressive interpretation of tangible object must be rejected.it is highly improbable that congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial.
the government argues,however,that our inquiry would be incomplete if we failed to consider the origins of the phrase record,document,or tangible object.congress drew that phrase,the government says,from a model penal code mpc provision,and reform proposals based on that provision.the mpc provision and proposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on anyone who alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,or removes a record,document or thing.see ali,mpc.those proscriptions were understood to refer to all physical evidence.see mpc,comment,at provision applies to any physical object accordingly,the government reasons,and the dissent exuberantly agrees,post,at,congress must have intended to apply to the universe of physical evidence.
the inference is unwarranted.true,the mpc provision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical evidence.but unlike,the mpc provision did not prohibit actions that specifically relate to records,documents,and objects used to record or preserve information.the mpc provision also ranked the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instances in which the actor believ es that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted.mpc,at.yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution,and certainly not one instituted at a time when even the smallest of the fish he caught came within the legal limit.see supra,at bond united states,slip,at rejecting boundless reading of a statutory term given deeply serious consequences that reading would entail.a proposed federal offense in line with the mpc provision,advanced by a federal commission in,was similarly qualified.see final report of the national commission on reform of federal criminal laws.
section conspicuously lacks the limits built into the mpc provision and the federal proposal.it describes not a misdemeanor,but a felony punishable by up to years in prison.and the section covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding,including one not even on the verge of commencement.given these significant differences,the meaning of record,document,or thing in the mpc provision and a kindred proposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning congress assigned to record,document,or tangible object in.the mpc provision,in short,tells us neither what congress wrote nor what congress wanted,post,at,concerning yates small fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution.
finally,if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of tangible object,as that term is used in,we would invoke the rule that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.cleveland united states,quoting rewis united states.that interpretative principle is relevant here,where the government urges a reading of that exposes individuals to prison sentences for tampering with any physical object that might have evidentiary value in any federal investigation into any offense,no matter whether the investigation is pending or merely contemplated,or whether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or civil.see liparota united states,application of the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature,the prosecutor,and the court in defining criminal liability.in determining the meaning of tangible object in,it is appropriate,before we choose the harsher alternative,to require that congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.see cleveland,at quoting united states universal credit.see also jones united states,rule of lenity reinforces the conclusion that arson of an residence is not subject to federal prosecution under i because such a residence does not qualify as property used in commerce or activity 
for the reasons stated,we resist reading expansively to create a coverall spoliation of evidence statute,advisable as such a measure might be.leaving that important decision to congress,we hold that a tangible object within compass is one used to record or preserve information.the judgment of the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit is therefore reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
it is so ordered.
alito,concurring in judgment 
john yates,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice alito,concurring in the judgment.
this case can and should be resolved on narrow grounds.and though the question is close,traditional tools of statutory construction confirm that john yates has the better of the argument.three features of stand out to me the statute list of nouns,its list of verbs,and its title.although perhaps none of these features by itself would tip the case in favor of yates,the three combined do so.
start with the nouns.section refers to any record,document,or tangible object.the noscitur a sociis canon instructs that when a statute contains a list,each word in that list presumptively has a similar meaning.see,gustafson alloyd.a related canon,ejusdem generis teaches that general words following a list of specific words should usually be read in light of those specific words to mean something similar.see,christopher smithkline beecham,slip,at.applying these canons to list of nouns,the term tangible object should refer to something similar to records or documents.a fish does not spring to mind nor does an antelope,a colonial farmhouse,a hydrofoil,or an oil derrick.all are objects that are tangible.but who would raise an eyebrow if a neighbor,when asked to identify something similar to a record or document,said crocodile 
this reading,of course,has its shortcomings.for instance,this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because record and document are themselves quite general.and there is a risk that tangible object may be made superfluous what is similar to a record or document but yet is not one an,however,could be such a thing.see united states sentencing commission,guidelines manual and comment.reading records,documents,or tangible objects to includ e what is found on magnetic,optical,digital,other electronic,or other storage mediums or devices an,after all,might not be a document if,as was traditionally so,a document was a piece of paper with information on it,not information stored on a computer,electronic storage device,or any other medium.black law dictionary ed.might also not be records if records are limited to minutes or other formal writings designed to memorialize past events.at.a hard drive,however,is tangible and can contain files that are precisely akin to even these narrow definitions.both record and document can be read more expansively,but adding tangible object to would ensure beyond question that electronic files are included.to be sure,tangible object presumably can capture more than just congress enacts catchall s for known unknowns.republic of iraq beaty.but where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis apply,known unknowns should be similar to known knowns,here,records and documents.this is especially true because reading tangible object too broadly could render record and document superfluous.
next,consider list of verbs alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in.although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as as salamanders,satellites,or sand dunes,the last phrase in the list makes a false entry in makes no sense outside of filekeeping.how does one make a false entry in a fish alters and especially falsifies are also closely associated with filekeeping.not one of the verbs,moreover,can not be applied to filekeeping certainly not in the way that makes a false entry in is always inconsistent with the aquatic.
again,the government is not without a response.one can imagine congress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines up with every noun.but failure to line up may suggest that something has gone awry in one interpretation of a text.where,as here,each of a statute verbs applies to a certain category of nouns,there is some reason to think that congress had that category in mind.categories,of course,are often underinclusive or overinclusive,for instance,applies to a letter but not a bomb.but this does not mean that categories are not useful or that congress does not enact them.see,vance bradley.here,focusing on the verbs,the category of nouns appears to be filekeeping.this observation is not dispositive,but neither is it nothing.the government also contends that verbs cut both ways because it is unnatural to apply falsifies to tangible objects,and that is certainly true.one does not falsify the outside casing of a hard drive,but one could falsify or alter data physically recorded on that hard drive.
finally,my analysis is influenced by title destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy.emphasis added.this too points toward filekeeping,not fish.titles can be useful devices to resolve doubt about the meaning of a statute.porter nussle,quoting united states,see also lawson fmr llc,sotomayor,dissenting slip,at.the title is especially valuable here because it reinforces what the text nouns and verbs independently suggest that no matter how other statutes might be read,this particular one does not cover every noun in the universe with tangible form.
titles,of course,are also not dispositive.here,if the list of nouns did not already suggest that tangible object should mean something similar to records or documents,especially when read in conjunction with peculiar list of verbs with their focus on filekeeping,then the title would not be enough on its own.in conjunction with those other two textual features,however,the government argument,though colorable,becomes too implausible to accept.see,washington state of social and health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,focusing on the product of two canons of construction which was confirmed by other interpretative evidence obama,cadc aggregating evidence.

a criminal law,prohibits tampering with any record,document,or tangible object in an attempt to obstruct a federal investigation.this case raises the question whether the term tangible object means the same thing in as it means in everyday language any object capable of being touched.the answer should be easy yes.the term tangible object is broad,but clear.throughout the code and many states laws,it invariably covers physical objects of all kinds.and in,context confirms what bare text says all the words surrounding tangible object show that congress meant the term to have a wide range.that fits with congress evident purpose in enacting to punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence any physical evidence with the intent of thwarting federal law enforcement.
the plurality instead interprets tangible object to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information.ante,at.the concurring opinion similarly,if more vaguely,contends that tangible object should refer to something similar to records or documents and should include colonial farmhouses,crocodiles,or fish.ante,at alito,concurring in judgment.in my view,conventional tools of statutory construction all lead to a more conventional result a tangible object is an object that tangible.i would apply the statute that congress enacted and affirm the judgment below.
while the plurality starts its analysis with heading,see ante,at we note first caption i would begin with text.when congress has not supplied a definition,we generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning.see,schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,slip,at.as the plurality must acknowledge,the ordinary meaning of tangible object is a discrete thing that possesses physical form.ante,at punctuation and citation omitted.a fish is,of course,a discrete thing that possesses physical form.see generally seuss,one fish two fish red fish blue fish.so the ordinary meaning of the term tangible object in,as no one here disputes,covers fish including red grouper.
that interpretation accords with endless uses of the term in statute and rule books as construed by courts.dozens of federal laws and rules of procedure and hundreds of state enactments include the term tangible object or its first cousin tangible thing some in association with documents,others not.see,referring to any material or tangible object that could harbor a pest or disease c authorizing investigative demands for documentary material or tangible things a d defining museum as entity that owns tangible objects that are exhibited to the public b allowing discovery of relevant facts,books,papers,documents or tangible things to my knowledge,no court has ever read any such provision to exclude things that do record or preserve data rather,all courts have adhered to the statutory language ordinary,expansive meaning.for example,courts have understood the phrases tangible objects and tangible things in the federal rules of criminal and civil procedure to cover everything from guns to drugs to machinery to animals.see,united states obiukwu,per curiam handgun united states acarino,supp,edny heroin in re newman,ca fed.energy generation system martin reynolds metals,cattle.no surprise,then,that until today courts have uniformly applied the term tangible object in in the same way.see,united states mcrae,corpse united states maury,cement mixer.
that is not necessarily the end of the matter i agree with the plurality really,who does not that context matters in interpreting statutes.we do not construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.tyler cain.rather,we interpret particular words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.davis michigan of treasury.and sometimes that means,as the plurality says,that the dictionary definition of a disputed term can not control.see,bloate united states.but this is not such an occasion,for here the text and its context point the same way.stepping back from the words tangible object provides only further evidence that congress said what it meant and meant what it said.
begin with the way the surrounding words in reinforce the breadth of the term at issue.section refers to any tangible object,thus indicating in line with that word plain meaning a tangible object of whatever kind.webster third new international dictionary.this court has time and again recognized that any has an expansive meaning,bringing within a statute reach all types of the item here,tangible object to which the law refers.department of housing and urban development rucker,see,republic of iraq beaty,ali federal bureau of prisons.and the adjacent laundry list of verbs in alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry further shows that congress wrote a statute with a wide scope.those words are supposed to ensure just as tangible object is meant to that covers the whole world of,in all its prodigious variety.see united states rodgers,rejecting a narrow,technical definition of a statutory term when it clashes strongly with sweeping language in the same sentence.
still more,tangible object appears as part of a phrase including also records and documents common to laws and always understood to embrace things of all kinds.the model penal code section,drafted more than years ago,similarly prohibits a person from alter ing,destroy ing,conceal ing or remov ing any record,document or thing in an effort to thwart an official investigation or proceeding.ali,model penal code,emphasis added.the code commentary emphasizes that the offense described in that provision is not limited to conduct that alters a written instrument.comment,at.rather,the language extends to any physical object.ibid.consistent with that statement and,of course,with ordinary meaning courts in the more than states that have laws based on the model code tampering provision apply them to all tangible objects,including drugs,guns,vehicles and yes,animals.see,state majors,cocaine puckett state,gun state bruno,bicycle,skeleton,blood stains state crites.dist.lexis,deer antlers.not a one has limited the phrase scope to objects that record or preserve information.
the words record,document,or tangible object in also track language in,the federal law covering as even the plurality accepts,see ante,at physical evidence in all its forms.section,both in its original version preceding and today,repeatedly uses the phrase record,document,or other object most notably,in a provision prohibiting the use of force or threat to induce another person to withhold any of those materials from an official proceeding.a of the victim and witness protection act of,stat,as amended,b.that language,which itself likely derived from the model penal code,encompasses no less the bloody knife than the incriminating letter,as all courts have for decades agreed.see,united states kellington,boat united states applewhaite,stone wall.and typically only the most compelling evidence will persuade this court that congress intended nearly identical language in provisions dealing with related subjects to bear different meanings.communication workers beck,see scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.context thus again confirms what text indicates.
and legislative history,for those who care about it,puts extra icing on a cake already frosted.section,as the plurality notes,see ante,at,was enacted after the enron corporation collapse,as part of the act of,stat.but the provision began its life in a separate bill,and the drafters emphasized that enron was only a case study exposing the shortcomings in our current laws relating to both corporate and criminal fraud.the primary loophole congress identified,see,at,arose from limits in the part of just described that provision,as uniformly construed,prohibited a person from inducing another to destroy record s,document s,or other object s of every type but not from doing so himself.b see supra,at.congress as even the plurality agrees,see ante,at enacted to close that yawning gap.but could fully achieve that goal only if it covered all the records,documents,and objects did,as well as all the means of tampering with them.and so was written to do exactly that to apply broadly to any acts to destroy or fabricate physical evidence,as long as performed with the requisite intent,at.when a person destroys evidence,the drafters explained,overly technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution.at.ah well congress,meet today court,which here invents just such a distinction with just such an effect.see united states philadelphia nat.bank,c reat ing a large loophole in a statute designed to close a loophole is illogical and disrespectful of congressional purpose 
as congress recognized in using a broad term,giving immunity to those who destroy evidence has no sensible basis in penal policy.a person who hides a murder victim body is no less culpable than one who burns the victim diary.a fisherman,like john yates,who dumps undersized fish to avoid a fine is no less blameworthy than one who shreds his vessel catch log for the same reason.congress thus treated both offenders in the same way.it understood,in enacting,that destroying evidence is destroying evidence,whether or not that evidence takes documentary form.
the plurality searches far and wide for anything anything to support its interpretation of.but its fishing expedition comes up empty.
the plurality analysis starts with title destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy.see ante,at see also ante,at opinion of alito.that already a sign something is amiss.i know of no other case in which we have begun our interpretation of a statute with the title,or relied on a title to override the law clear terms.instead,we have followed the wise rule that the title of a statute and the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text.trainmen baltimore ohio.
the reason for that wise rule is easy to see a title is,almost necessarily,an abridgment.attempting to mention every term in a statute would often be ungainly as well as useless accordingly,matters in the text are frequently unreflected in the headings.at.just last year,this court observed that two titles in a nearby section of serve as but a reference to the general subject matter of the provision at issue,not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.lawson fmr llc,slip,at quoting trainmen,at.the of the headings,we stated,was apparent.lawson,at slip,at.so too for title,which refers to destruction,alteration,or falsification but not to mutilation,concealment,or covering up,and likewise mentions records but not other documents or objects.presumably,the plurality would not refuse to apply when a person only conceals evidence rather than destroying,altering,or falsifying it instead,the plurality would say that a title is just a title,which can not undo or limit more specific statutory text.ibid.quoting trainmen,at.the same holds true when the evidence in question is not a record but something else whose destruction,alteration,is intended to obstruct justice.
the plurality next tries to divine meaning from position within chapter of title.ante,at.but that move is yet odder than the last.as far as i can tell,this court has never once suggested that the section number assigned to a law bears upon its meaning.scalia,supra,at listing more than interpretive principles and canons without mentioning the plurality new theory.and even on its own terms,the plurality argument is hard to fathom.the plurality claims that if applied to objects generally,congress would not have placed it after the,and because those are specialized provisions.ante,at.but search me if i can find a better place for a broad ban on.the plurality seems to agree that the law properly goes in chapter the criminal code chapter on obstruction of justice.but the provision does not logically fit into any of that chapter sections.and with the first numbers of the chapter already taken starting with and continuing through,the law naturally took the place.that is standard operating procedure.prior to the act of,all of chapter was ordered chronologically section was later enacted than,which was later enacted than,which was well,you get the idea.and after,congress has continued in the same vein.section is thus right where you would expect it as is the contemporaneously passed between added in and added in 
the plurality third argument,relying on the surplusage canon,at least invokes a known tool of statutory construction but it too comes to nothing.says the plurality if read naturally,would render superfluous c,which congress passed as part of the same act.ante,at.but that is not so although the two provisions significantly overlap,each applies to conduct the other does not.the key difference between the two is that protects the integrity of matter s within the jurisdiction of any federal department or agency whereas c safeguards official proceeding s as defined in a a.section language often applies more broadly than c,as the plurality notes.for example,an fbi investigation counts as a matter within a federal department jurisdiction,but falls outside the statutory definition of official proceeding as construed by courts.see,united states gabriel.but conversely,c sometimes reaches more widely than.for example,because an official proceeding includes any proceeding before a judge or court of the united states,c prohibits tampering with evidence in federal litigation between private parties.see a a united states burge,united states reich,sotomayor.by contrast,would ordinarily operate in that context because a federal court is a department or agency.see hubbard united states,so the surplusage canon does come into play overlap even significant overlap abounds in the criminal law.see loughrin united states,slip,at.this court has never thought that of such ordinary stuff surplusage is made.see connecticut nat.bank germain.
and the legislative history to which the plurality appeals,see ante,at,only cuts against it because those materials show that lawmakers knew that and c share much common ground.minority leader lott introduced the amendment that included c along with other criminal and corporate fraud provisions late in the legislative process,explaining that he did so at the specific request of the president.see cong.rec,remarks of lott.not only lott but several other senators noted the overlap between the president package and provisions already in the bill,most notably.see,at remarks of lott,at remarks of biden,at remarks of hatch and gramm.the presence of both and c in the final act may have reflected caution if contained some flaw,c would serve as a backstop.or the addition of c may have derived solely from legislators wish to satisfy audiences other than courts that is,the president and his justice department.gluck bressman,statutory interpretation from the inside,stan,emphasis deleted.whichever the case,congress consciousness of overlap between the two provisions removes any conceivable reason to cast aside ordinary meaning in service of preventing some statutory repetition.
indeed,the inclusion of c in creates a far worse problem for the plurality construction of than for mine.section c criminalizes the destruction of any record,document,or other object of any record,document,or tangible object.on the plurality view,one object is really an object,whereas the other is only an object that preserves or stores information.but t he normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different parts of the same act,passed at the same time,are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson secretary of treasury,internal quotation marks omitted.and that is especially true when the different provisions pertain to the same subject.see supra,at.the plurality does really,ca explain why it instead interprets the same words used in two provisions of the same act addressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different things.
getting nowhere with surplusage,the plurality switches canons,hoping that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis will save it.see ante,at see also ante,at opinion of alito.the first of those related canons advises that words grouped in a list be given similar meanings.the second counsels that a general term following specific words embraces only things of a similar kind.according to the plurality,those latin maxims change the english meaning of tangible object to only things,like records and documents,used to record or preserve information.ante,at but understood as this court always has,the canons have no such transformative effect on the workaday language congress chose.
as an initial matter,this court uses noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to resolve ambiguity,not create it.those principles are useful rule s of construction where words are of obscure or doubtful meaning.russell motor car united states.but when words have a clear definition,and all other contextual clues support that meaning,the canons can not properly defeat congress decision to draft broad legislation.see,ali,at rejecting the invocation of these canons as an attempt to create ambiguity where the statute text and structure suggest none 
anyway,assigning tangible object its ordinary meaning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis when applied,as they should be,with attention to subject and purpose.those canons require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a statutory phrase.see,graham county soil and water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,ali,at.in responding to that demand,the plurality characterizes records and documents as things that preserve information and so they are.but just as much,they are things that provide information,and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to matters under review.and in a statute pertaining to obstruction of federal investigations,that evidentiary function comes to the fore.the destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries.and so too does the destruction of tangible objects of whatever kind.whether the item is a fisherman ledger or an undersized fish,throwing it overboard has the identical effect on the administration of justice.see supra,at.for purposes of,records,documents,and all tangible objects are therefore alike.
indeed,even the plurality ca fully credit its argument.the same reasoning would apply to every law placing the word object or thing after record and document.but as noted earlier,such statutes are common the phrase appears among other places in many state laws based on the model penal code,as well as in multiple provisions of.see supra,at.the plurality accepts that in those laws object means object its argument about superfluity positively depends on giving c that broader reading.see ante,at.what,then,is the difference here the plurality proposes that some of those statutes describe less serious offenses than.see ante,at.how and why that distinction affects application of the noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis canons is left obscure count it as one more of the plurality,interpretive theories.see supra,at.but in any event,that rationale can not support the plurality willingness to give object its natural meaning in,which like sets out felonies with penalties of up to years.see a c,b,c.the canons,in the plurality interpretive world,apparently switch on and off whenever convenient.
and the plurality invocation of verbs does nothing to buttress its argument.see ante,at ante,at opinion of alito.the plurality observes that prohibits falsif ying or mak ing a false entry in a tangible object,and no one can do those things to,say,a murder weapon or a fish.ante,at.but of course someone can alter,destroy,mutilate,conceal,or cover up such a tangible object,and prohibits those actions too.the court has never before suggested that all the verbs in a statute need to match up with all the nouns.see robers united states,slip,at t he law does not require legislators to write extra language specifically exempting,phrase by phrase,applications in respect to which a portion of a phrase is not needed and for good reason.it is exactly when congress sets out to draft a statute broadly to include every imaginable variation on a theme that such mismatches will arise.to respond by narrowing the law,as the plurality does,is thus to flout both what congress wrote and what congress wanted.
finally,when all else fails,the plurality invokes the rule of lenity.see ante,at.but even in its most robust form,that rule only kicks in when,after all legitimate tools of interpretation have been exhausted,a reasonable doubt persists regarding whether congress has made the defendant conduct a federal crime.abramski united states,scalia,dissenting slip,at quoting moskal united states.no such doubt lingers here.the plurality points to the breadth of,see ante,at,as though breadth were equivalent to ambiguity.it is not.section is very broad.it is also very clear.every traditional tool of statutory interpretation points in the same direction,toward object meaning object.lenity offers no proper refuge from that straightforward even though capacious construction 
the concurring opinion is a shorter,vaguer version of the plurality.it relies primarily on the noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis canons,tries to bolster them with list of verbs,and concludes with the section title.see supra,at,addressing each of those arguments.notably,even the concurrence puts no stock in the plurality and superfluity claims.from those familiar materials,the concurrence arrives at the following definition tangible object should mean something similar to records or documents.ante,at opinion of alito.in amplifying that purported guidance,the concurrence suggests applying the term tangible object in keeping with what a neighbor,when asked to identify something similar to record or document,might answer.ante,at.w ho would raise an eyebrow,the concurrence wonders,if the neighbor said crocodile ante,at.courts sometimes say,when explaining the latin maxims,that the words of a statute should be interpreted consistent with their neighbors.see,united states locke.the concurrence takes that expression literally.
but meaning should not hinge on the odd game of mad libs the concurrence proposes.no one reading needs to fill in a blank after the words records and documents.that is because congress,quite helpfully,already did so adding the term tangible object.the issue in this case is what that term means.so if the concurrence wishes to ask its neighbor a question,i recommend a more pertinent one do you think a fish or,if the concurrence prefers,a crocodile is a tangible object as to that query,who would raise an eyebrow if the neighbor said no 
in insisting on its different question,the concurrence neglects the proper function of catchall phrases like or tangible object.the reason congress uses such terms is precisely to reach things that,in the concurrence words,do not spring to mind to my mind,to my neighbor,or most important to congress.ante,at opinion of alito.as this court recently explained t he whole value of a generally phrased residual term is that it serves as a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated known unknowns.beaty,at.congress realizes that in a game of free association with record and document,it will never think of all the other things including crocodiles and fish whose destruction or alteration can less frequently but just as effectively thwart law enforcement.united states stubbs,dead crocodiles used as evidence to support smuggling conviction.and so congress adds the general term or tangible object again,exactly because such things do not spring to mind.
the concurrence suggests that the term tangible object serves not as a catchall for physical evidence but to ensure beyond question that and other electronic files fall within compass.ante,at.but that claim is in its own right.would a congress wishing to make certain that applies to add the phrase tangible object as opposed,say,to electronic communications would a judge or jury member predictably find that tangible object encompasses something as virtual as as compared,say,with something as real as a fish if not and the answer is not,then that term can not function as a failsafe for.
the concurrence acknowledges that no one of its arguments can carry the day rather,it takes the latin canons plus verbs plus title to tip the case for yates.ante,at.but the sum total of three mistaken arguments is three mistaken arguments.they do not get better in the combining.and so the concurrence ends up right where the plurality does,except that the concurrence,eschewing the rule of lenity,has nothing to fall back on.
if none of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation can produce today result,then what accounts for it the plurality offers a clue when it emphasizes
