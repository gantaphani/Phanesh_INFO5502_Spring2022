opinion of the court 
on october,three philadelphia police officers entered a private residence located at north franklin street in philadelphia without a warrant because they believed the house to be abandoned.upon searching the house,they found khayree harrison sitting in a recliner with a gun,scales,pills,and cocaine base on the table next to him.the police took harrison into custody,seized the gun,and obtained a warrant to seize the rest of the items.the government charged harrison with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base.harrison moved to suppress the physical evidence on the grounds that it had been confiscated pursuant to a search that violated the fourth amendment.the district court held a hearing and denied the motion,finding that although harrison had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the house,the police officers were operating under the mistaken but reasonable belief that the house was abandoned.harrison appealed.we will affirm.
khayree harrison lived at north eighth street in philadelphia,but paid nicole hawkins a month to use the house at north franklin street starting in august harrison spent only one or two nights a week at the north franklin street house.he testified that he had a key to the house and entered the home by unlocking the front door.he had paid nicole hawkins rent for october.
on october,philadelphia police officer robert mccarthy was driving around the neighborhood in a marked police car when he spotted a dirt bike on the side of the road.he pulled over,retrieved the bike vehicle identification number,began a search for the owner information on his computer,and drove away.about ten minutes later,he learned that the bike was reported stolen.he went back to get the bike,but it was already gone.later that day,he spotted the same bike being ridden by an unknown male.officer mccarthy did not follow or apprehend him at that time.around that evening,officer mccarthy was joined by officer matthew mccarthy,his cousin,and officer joseph.they decided to walk through the yards between franklin and streets to see if they could find the stolen bike.they spotted the bike in the backyard of north franklin street.the officers walked around to the front yard,where they noticed that the front door was open.they also saw candlelight through a window on the first floor.believing the house to be abandoned,the three officers walked in the front door and opened the door on their immediate left.they did not knock or announce their presence.
the officers saw harrison sitting in a recliner chair.next to him,he had a gun,scales,pills,and an unknown substance.seeing the officers,harrison ran out of the room and into the basement.the officers followed and took him into custody.they then contacted an officer reynolds,also of the philadelphia police department,and had him prepare a search warrant for the house.in preparing the warrant,officer reynolds discovered that nicole hawkins investment company owned the property.
at the suppression hearing,the officers testified to the condition of the house and the district court credited their testimony.the officers testified consistently that north franklin street was in a state of constant and severe disrepair.specifically,officer robert mccarthy testified that the backyard was full of trash and there were boards on the door and the window.appendix.app.at.the yard was covered in weeds and generally untended.there was nothing covering the windows on the second floor.on the front of the house,they observed that the two bottom windows were boarded up with plywood,there was trash all over the yard,and the front door was unlocked and ajar.
officer matthew mccarthy,who had been at the house many times before,testified that the front door was never locked,app.at,and was always open.in fact,he seemed unsure of whether the door could be locked.he also testified that the condition of the house never changed.it remained in the same state of disrepair each time he saw it.
officer mccarthy also testified about the condition of the house interior.he said that he entered north franklin street several times in the months leading up to october,although he never made any arrests or filled out any incident reports.he described the house as a known drug residence,and said that one would often see drug users and dealers hanging out outside,going in and out the front door all day long.app.at.he observed this activity all summer.app.at.prior to october,he had entered the house to kick people out numerous times.he testified that 
the whole house was filled with drug paraphernalia all over the house,trash.the front door is never locked.it always open.the upstairs has a single mattress in the front room of the building.drug bags all over the place,drug paraphernalia.mostly crack bags,some heroin bags.the first floor,again,trash all over the place.the whole house smells like urine.people are often in there sleeping.there is feces in both the tub and the toilet that is never flushed because there is no water in the house.again,i go in there routinely just to kick people out,just to keep them out of the area.
app.at.officer mccarthy also said that he had no reason to believe there was electricity in the house.ultimately,he did not think anyone could actually be living there,as it did not seem habitable.app.at.he last entered the house two or three weeks prior to the search that is at issue here.
the grand jury returned an indictment that charged harrison with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base,in violation of a,b b commission of that offense within feet of a school,in violation of and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c.
prior to trial,harrison filed a motion to suppress the physical evidence against him.after a hearing,the district court denied the motion.it held that while the property was not abandoned,b ased on the appearance of the property and the officers knowledge of the property history,the police acted reasonably in entering the property to investigate.app.at.
after a jury trial,harrison was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute but was acquitted on the other charges.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.this timely appeal followed.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to u.
we review factual determinations made on a motion to suppress for clear error and legal determinations de novo.united states kennedy,cir.the proponent of a motion to suppress bears the burden of proving that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched and that the search was illegal.kennedy,at.because the district court denied harrison suppression motion on the grounds that the search was permissible,we must review the propriety of the warrantless search that led to the discovery of incriminating evidence.united states williams,cir.in so doing,we construe the record in the light most favorable to the government.united states myers,cir.
the supreme court has consistently held that t he touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness.florida jimeno,d.it remains a cardinal principle that searches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate,are per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.california acevedo,d internal quotation marks omitted.at issue here is the abandonment exception,which we consider in the context of the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule typically applied to evidence seized without a warrant.see united states leon,d w here the officer conduct is objectively reasonable,excluding the evidence will not further the ends of the exclusionary rule in any appreciable way for it is painfully apparent that the officer is acting as a reasonable officer would and should act in similar circumstances internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we first consider the contours of abandonment.
a warrantless search of property is permissible under the fourth amendment where the owner has abandoned his reasonable expectation of privacy in that property.united states fulani,cir citing abel united states,d.this determination must be made from an objective viewpoint,and proof of intent to abandon must be established by clear and unequivocal evidence.id.we look at the totality of the facts and circumstances in making such a determination.see mckenney harrison,cir.in most cases,disclaiming ownership or physically relinquishing the property is sufficient to establish abandonment.united states liu,cir.
we note that,abandonment for purposes of the fourth amendment differs from abandonment in property law here the analysis examines the individual reasonable expectation of privacy,not his property interest in the item.fulani,at citing united states lewis,united states stevenson,cir.thus,our holding will not turn on whether the house was abandoned under the common law of property.indeed,there is a real difference between and constitutional abandonment,for courts have repeatedly found abandonment for constitutional purposes in situations that might not support a finding of abandonment in the understanding.united states redmon,cir flaum,concurring en banc.therefore,the fact that for common law purposes real property can not be abandoned,see,pocono springs civic,mackenzie,is not dispositive.see united states wilson,cir w e hold that local law of real property does not provide the exclusive basis upon which to decide fourth amendment questions.rather,it will inform our inquiry.see stevenson,at.as such,what the common law property rules suggest is that abandonment of real property under the fourth amendment is difficult,but not impossible,to establish.
the home occupies a sacrosanct place in our fourth amendment jurisprudence.hudson michigan,d kennedy,concurring.privacy and security in the home are central to the fourth amendment guarantees as explained in our decisions and as understood since the beginning of the republic.id.
nevertheless,a person can lose his reasonable expectation of privacy in his real property if he abandons it.thus,a person can,as he can with any other property,sufficiently manifest an intent to abandon his house.see mckenney,at united states levasseur,cir mann cannon,cir finding that a warrantless search of a doctor house was permitted when the the house had become open to the public,vandalized,uninhabitable,and from appearances virtually abandoned.united states callabrass,cir thus it appears to all intents and purposes that appellant abandoned the house and the property in it.oakes,dissenting united states wilson,cir see also,people taylor,state hunter,wl,at.may,state linton,permitting a search of a house that had all the indicia of abandonment state mckinney,a reasonable expectation of privacy in real property may be surrendered,however,if the property is permanently abandoned.wayne lafavre search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment e ed it has often been held that if a defendant has in fact abandoned the place where he formerly resided,then he may not have suppressed from evidence what the police find on those premises after the time of abandonment.united states wyler,state carter,so d,we agree with the premise of the state argument that an individual does not possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in an abandoned home and therefore may not complaint about a warrantless entry of the premises by the police.
even the framework established by a plurality of the supreme court for analyzing searches of burned down houses implicitly recognizes that a residence can be abandoned.in michigan clifford,d,the supreme court found unconstitutional a warrantless search of a home after a devastating fire.in the early morning,a fire broke out at the home of raymond and emma clifford.id.at.by that day,the fire was extinguished and a work crew was pumping water out of the home.id.at.a fire department inspector entered the home without a warrant and searched it,finding evidence of arson.id.the constitutionality of the warrantless search,a plurality of the court held,can turn on whether there are legitimate privacy interests in the property.id.at see also united states francis,cir finding that the existence of legitimate privacy interests,to be an important factor in determining whether a warrantless search of a house was permitted.expectations of privacy may remain in homes because p eople may go on living in their homes or working in their offices after a fire.even when that is impossible,private effects often remain.id.quoting michigan tyler,d internal quotation marks omitted.the plurality enumerated several factors that should be analyzed in determining whether a legitimate expectation of privacy remained the type of property,the amount of fire damage,the prior and continued use of the premises,and,in some cases,the owner efforts to secure the home against intruders.see also united states mitchell,cir.in other words,there are circumstances in which the combination of fire damage and an owner own acts so exposes a home to the outside world that the owner has relinquished his legitimate expectation of privacy in that home clifford,at.
the same logic applies to a person abandonment of his house.a person can,through his own acts or omissions,manifest an intent to relinquish his legitimate expectation of privacy in his real property,as the same test applies regardless of the nature of the property.this is,however,a difficult standard to meet,and one that requires a careful analysis of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case.before the government may cross the threshold of a home without a warrant,there must be clear,unequivocal and unmistakable evidence that the property has been abandoned.only then will such a search be permitted.
in this case,it is undisputed that the house was not actually abandoned and that harrison,as a renter,possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the property.therefore,the only issue before us is whether the police officers belief that the house was abandoned justified their warrantless entry.
the law does not require that police officers always be factually correct it does demand,however,that they always be reasonable.illinois rodriguez,d.consequently,a reasonable mistake of fact does not violate the fourth amendment.united states delfincolina,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states elliott,cir.in deciding what is reasonable,a court is to apply an objective standard,looking at whether the facts available to the officer at the moment warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the search was permissible.rodriguez,at internal quotation marks omitted.
unlike a mistake of fact,a search conducted pursuant to a police officer mistake as to the governing law,even if reasonable,is not permitted under the fourth amendment.delfin colina,at,a mistake of law by the seizing officer will render a traffic stop per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment unless facts are offered that show that the identified law was actually broken.
harrison contends that the police officers made a mistake of law when they entered north franklin street.their mistake,according to harrison,was that they assumed a house could be abandoned at all.thus,the argument goes,it is irrelevant whether the officers were reasonable in their belief.we disagree.first,as discussed above,a house can be abandoned for fourth amendment purposes,and thus the officers did not make a mistake of law.second,the officers made a mistake of fact.their observations of the property over time suggested to them that whoever once had an expectation of privacy in the property had since effectively relinquished it.as they testified before the district court,the police officers believed that the house was unfit for human habitation and that no one lived there.this is a mistake of fact,not of law.in essence,the officers were mistaken in their belief that there existed no person who had a remaining expectation of privacy in the property.thus,under our case law governing mistakes of fact,the officers warrantless search of the house was permissible if their mistake was reasonable.
