following a trial,a jury convicted defendant luis mercado of being a felon in possession of a firearm,g.the district court sentenced him to months in prison and three years of supervised release under the united states sentencing guidelines.he now appeals his conviction,assigning error to the of a defense witness regarding her delay in coming forward with allegedly exculpatory information,and to the district court refusal to instruct the jury on fleeting possession.for the first time on appeal,mercado also challenges his sentence under united states booker,d.finding these claims unavailing,we affirm.
because this appeal follows a conviction,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states,cir.
on the night of february,two plainclothes police officers on patrol drove by bodell avenue,part of the hartford housing project in providence,rhode island.the officers,detective oscar perez and officer thomas zincone,observed a black buick and a red chevy astro van parked side by side in the parking lot in front of the building,with a group of eight to ten men in and around the vehicles.perez and zincone pulled into the parking lot and got out of their car to investigate.perez saw mercado standing between the buick and the van with a gun in his hand.perez alerted zincone to the gun,then yelled police,and told mercado to drop the gun.rather than complying,mercado reached through the open door of the van for a leather jacket and tried to stuff the gun into the jacket pocket.when perez started to approach mercado,however,mercado fled,dropping the gun and the jacket.perez then picked up the gun for safekeeping while zincone pursued mercado,catching him within a few feet of the van.after a brief struggle,the officers arrested mercado and took him into custody.
once mercado was in custody,perez checked the caliber semiautomatic determined that it was loaded with nine rounds of ammunition.perez also recovered the jacket into which mercado had attempted to put the gun.in one of the jacket pockets,the officers found paperwork bearing mercado name.
a grand jury indicted mercado on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm,g,e.to be convicted under g,a defendant must have previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year,and have knowingly and intentionally possessed,in and affecting commerce,a firearm.mercado stipulated to elements,and namely,that he had a prior felony conviction,and that the semiautomatic pistol recovered at the scene had moved in or affected interstate commerce and was a firearm.the only issue at trial was therefore whether mercado had possessed the firearm.
during the jury trial,officers zincone and perez testified to the events described above for the prosecution.mercado then presented a defense,relying on two witnesses,vinisis acosta and rolando rojas.rojas was one of the men in the parking lot when the police arrived and acosta,mercado of five years,lived at bodell avenue in an apartment overlooking the parking lot.they testified that the police arrested mercado because they found his name in the jacket,not because he had been holding a gun.
after less than a day of deliberation,the jury returned a guilty verdict.the district court then sentenced mercado under the guidelines to months in prison,the statutory cap,followed by three years of supervised release.
acosta testified on direct examination that the police initially arrested an unidentified man,and handcuffed mercado only after they found his name in the jacket and asked which of the men present was luis mercado.she also testified that when officer perez called her the following day to ask if she had any information about the incident,she falsely told him that she did not because she was afraid of the police.on,the prosecutor established that acosta had dated mercado for approximately five years,that she still cared about him,and that she remained in regular contact with him after his arrest.the prosecution then attempted to impeach acosta by asking why she had not come forward earlier with exculpatory information about her,for whom she still cared

q and you did place any phone calls to providence pd that night to see what your of five years had been arrested for and to see what was going on with him either,did you

q and you did call any federal agent,the bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms,and let them know what it is you say you saw on february,did you 
q and you did call anyone at the attorney office to tell them what you saw either,did you 
the government also returned to this theme in its closing argument,asking the jury to consider why a witness with exculpatory information about someone she cared for would wait nine months to come forward.
mercado timely objected to the questions about state charges on the ground that the o ther charges are irrelevant.they irrelevant and prejudicial.the court asked what the state charge was,and the government responded that 
i t the same charge.the point is that we know that in the state charge of possessing this gun there were bail hearings,there were violation hearings.i do intend to get into the nature of those hearings,but my point is that this is a woman who could come forward and say something and presumably does do it in various court proceedings over various months so if you have this information,why are you coming forward it clearly relevant in this incident.
the court then overruled mercado objection and allowed the questioning on state charges,so long as the government clarified that both charges arose from the same incident.before closing arguments,the court gave a limiting instruction to the jury on the use of this testimony,emphasizing that the state charges and proceedings were only relevant to action or inaction by acosta and should have absolutely no bearing on the determination you make in this case.
mercado now mounts two challenges based on the acosta.first,he alleges prosecutorial misconduct in the government representation that there had been bail and violation hearings in connection with the state court charges,claiming that there were no such proceedings at which acosta could have testified.second,mercado asserts that the references to state charges were impermissible under federal rule of evidence.we consider these arguments in turn.
prosecutorial misconduct 
although mercado objected to the references to state charges and proceedings at trial,his objections were not based on the prosecutorial misconduct claim he raises on appeal.it is well established that an objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.negron caleb brett,cir.our review is therefore only for plain error.see united states moran,cir.to prevail under this standard,mercado must show that an error occurred,the error was clear or obvious,the error affected his substantial rights,and the error also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at.
mercado assigns error to the prosecutor representation that there had been bail and violation hearings on the related state charges.he contends that the state court docket demonstrates that there were no such hearings at which acosta could have testified,and that the prosecutor therefore could have no basis for asserting otherwise.although the state court docket is not part of the record in this case,mercado urges us to take judicial notice of it,emphasizing that courts are entitled to take notice of the records of relevant court proceedings.united states florentino,cir,vacated on other grounds,d.
we agree that we can take judicial notice of the state court records.as the government points out,however,the docket entries that mercado relies on are less than illuminating on the contention that no hearings occurred.these entries indicate that violation hearings relating to the state charges were scheduled and rescheduled numerous times,without specifying whether these hearings ever took place.yet the government points to other docket entries suggesting that there may have been bail hearings related to the state charges.in light of these uncertainties,we find that the state court docket entries are inconclusive on the point for which mercado cites them.
in any event,regardless of whether there was a state proceeding at which acosta could have testified,there was no plain error here.mercado argument that he was prejudiced by the references to ongoing state proceedings assumes that the district court would not have allowed questions relating to the state court charges but for the prosecutor representation that there had been violation and bail hearings connected to those charges where acosta could have testified to help mercado.there is no evidence to support that position.
the prosecutor was designed to impeach acosta by showing that she was aware of the pending state charges and yet took no steps to share with state authorities the exculpatory version of events that she presented in the federal trial.in ruling on mercado objection to any reference to the state charges,the court sought to verify that the state and federal charges stemmed from the same incident.it presumably did so because if the state charges did not relate to the february incident,acosta would have no reason to tell state authorities what she saw on that night and the line of questioning would be irrelevant.the prosecutor explained that both the federal and state possession charges were based on the february incident,and mercado did not contend otherwise.the court therefore allowed references to the state charges,with the caveat that the government had to clarify that they the same charges as this.nothing in the record suggests that the court would have reached a different decision about the appropriateness of the absent the prosecutor statement that there had been bail and violation hearings on the state charges.irrespective of any such hearings where she might have testified,acosta would have still had an incentive to share with state authorities her exculpatory information about mercado.there was thus no prejudice from the prosecutor allusion to bail and violation hearings.
mercado also asserts that references to the state court charges were prejudicial and irrelevant,and therefore should not have been permitted.because this objection was preserved at trial,we review the court evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion.united states,cir.this is a deferential standard o nly in extraordinarily compelling we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states perrotta,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
federal rule of evidence provides that,
a lthough relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
mercado argues that the state charges were irrelevant to acosta testimony and unfairly prejudicial.we disagree on both counts.
other courts have approved of impeachment techniques similar to the one used here,see,united states carr,cir questioning a defense witness about his failure to come forward with exculpatory evidence before trial was proper people tauber,th,d,t he fact a witness is aware of the potentially exculpatory nature of facts but fails to reveal that evidence to the authorities before trial is relevant to the witness credibility.where it is natural to come forward with exculpatory information,the failure to promptly present that evidence makes suspect its later presentation at trial.id.
that logic applies here.the prosecutor established that acosta had been mercado girlfriend for five years,that she remained in contact with him after his arrest,and that she still cared for him.while acosta to explain to the jury why she did not volunteer her testimony in the context of the state charges,her failure to come forward with allegedly exculpatory information makes it less probable that she in fact had such information.references to the state charges were therefore relevant.see.evidence is relevant if it makes a fact of consequence more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.
of course,there could be a good explanation for this silence.on direct examination,acosta testified that she lied to officer perez when he called to interview her the day after mercado arrest because i was afraid of the police i do know if he might be able to take any reprisal against me,so i did not tell him what i had seen.acosta elaborated during the,citing an incident in which a woman was killed because she was going to be a witness.she continued,you never know what can happen if you say that what somebody else is saying is not true.you are running a risk.as this explanation demonstrates,there may well be situations where a witness in acosta position would have reason to be wary of stepping forward.commonwealth brown,some individuals may believe that the disclosure of their information to the police would be futile.it is therefore critical that a witness facing this kind of have an opportunity to explain on the stand a delay in volunteering exculpatory evidence.acosta had such an opportunity in this case.
mercado also argues that the repeated references to state charges were unfairly prejudicial because the jury may have inferred that if both state and federal officials decided to prosecute for the same conduct,the charges must be meritorious.we see little danger that this reasoning colored the jury verdict.the government alluded to the state charges solely in the context of questioning acosta credibility it never suggested that the state proceedings validated the federal charges.moreover,the court expressly instructed the jury on this point at the close of acosta testimony 
y ou heard reference to certain state charges that had been brought and certain proceedings with respect to those charges that had been brought as against mercado.i instruct you that you may consider that information only insofar as it relates to what acosta testified she did or did not do with respect to the testimony that she has presented here in this court proceeding.further,you should take no significance and should not consider the fact that state charges may have been brought as an indication as to what your verdict should be in this case.that,as i say,is a separate matter and has absolutely no bearing on the determination that you make in this case.as i say,it is relevant only insofar as it may relate to action or inaction by acosta.
this instruction directly refutes mercado assertion that the district court did not address the taint inherent in mentioning the fact that two different government entities had charged defendant with the same crime.the court indicated not only that the pending state charges were relevant solely to acosta credibility,but also that the state charges had no bearing on the merits of the federal case.reinforcing this point,the court also reminded the in the context of the federal an indictment does not lead to an inference of guilt.
the court instructions adequately addressed any prejudice that may have resulted from repeated references to the state charges see united states van horn,cir.nothing in the record remotely suggests a basis to suppose that the jurors disregarded the trial judge limiting instruction and departed on a frolic of their own.id.
