anthony silva was convicted in district court of possessing with intent to defraud counterfeit united states currency in violation of.on appeal,silva claims that the district court erred in admitting evidence seized by police during and after his arrest,denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal based on the insufficiency of the evidence,and issuing a prejudicial jury instruction on the statutory element of fraudulent intent.because we find no error in the district court evidentiary rulings or jury instructions,we affirm.
facts and background 
arrest and search 
on july,daniel pelletier came to the derry police department to report a complaint against his acquaintance anthony silva.pelletier told officer that silva had just given him in counterfeit currency in exchange for worth of repairs that pelletier had performed on his car,which pelletier produced for the officer in a plastic bag.pelletier related that silva was producing counterfeit bills as well as counterfeit drivers licenses,and that silva had to more in counterfeit currency in a white sovereign bank envelope.he also reported that silva was living out of his silver cadillac sedan,in which silva kept all of his belongings and was currently parked in a lot at linlew drive.asked why he had come forward with this information,pelletier informed that he had been burned by silva in past business transactions and was fed up with his behavior.
although was unaware of it at the time,this was not the first time that pelletier had complained to the derry police department regarding alleged incidents.over the previous years,pelletier had contacted the police on numerous occasions,claiming to have been cheated out of the ownership of several gas stations.in,he claimed to have been beaten by six unidentified men and reported a into his home.none of the ensuing investigations yielded any evidence corroborating pelletier claims.pelletier would also later claim to have won ten million dollars in the lottery in,although in fact he currently lives with his mother and has shown no evidence of receiving such winnings.
in response to pelletier report,sergeant muncey and officer phillips of the derry police were dispatched to linlew drive.as reported by pelletier,the officers observed a silver cadillac sedan full of personal belongings,occupied by a shirtless man sitting in the driver seat.muncey and phillips approached the car and asked the individual for his driver license.when the individual refused to produce his license,muncey threatened to arrest him for failing to comply with an order from a policeman.the individual subsequently produced a new hampshire driver license identifying him as anthony silva.based on that license,phillips radioed in silva information and was informed by the dispatcher that silva had an outstanding bench warrant for an unpaid motor vehicle fine.
acting on silva outstanding warrant,the officers ordered him to exit the car and placed him under arrest.when they conducted a search of his person incident to arrest,the officers found a fake new york driver license with silva photograph,as well as and bills that phillips believed to be counterfeit based on their texture,coloring,and missing watermarks.after silva was taken to the police station,he waived his miranda rights and told the officers that he must have obtained the counterfeit bills during a transaction at a nearby walmart or gas station.he refused to give the police consent to search his car.
in the absence of consent,the police arranged to have silva car towed to the police station.the officers did not immediately search the car,instead assigning detective muise to apply for a search warrant.that afternoon,muise spoke with pelletier in order to gain probable cause for the search warrant.pelletier informed the detective that silva had called him following his arrest and lamented that he was screwed because he had worth of counterfeit bills in his trunk.
because silva arrest involved counterfeiting of united states currency,the derry prosecutor passed the case to the secret service.muise shared the information she had collected on silva with special agent brian coffee,including pelletier initial report and her conversation.it is unclear whether she knew or shared information about pelletier history of false reports.coffee submitted an application for a search warrant that included pelletier accusations against silva,but no information regarding pelletier mental health or his personal antipathy towards silva.coffee wrote that pelletier information was trustworthy and reliable.after a warrant was executed,secret service agents discovered in counterfeit money,a,and a paper cutter in the trunk,as well as in counterfeit money in the glove compartment.
the government charged silva with possession with intent to defraud of counterfeit united states currency in violation of.before trial,silva moved to suppress any evidence discovered during his arrest and the subsequent search of his car.he further moved to invalidate the search warrant for his car on the basis that coffee application concealed material facts bearing on pelletier credibility.the district court denied the motion to suppress and,after holding a franks hearing on the matter of the warrant,denied silva motion to invalidate.
at trial,the prosecution presented substantially the same information described above,as well as evidence that the serial numbers on silva counterfeit bills matched the numbers on counterfeit bills recently passed in nearby towns.after the presentation of evidence,silva moved for a judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence to establish the statutory element of intent to defraud.the district court denied the motion.during the charging conference,it proposed the following jury instruction with respect to that element 
because it is impossible to know a person intentions or subjective beliefs,the government need not directly prove the defendant intent to defraud another person.rather,it may prove his intent by circumstantial evidence.that is to say,you may infer the defendant intent from the surrounding facts and circumstances.so,for example,in determining whether the defendant had the requisite intent to defraud,you may consider things such as whether he possessed a substantial number variety of counterfeit federal reserve notes.you may also consider whether those counterfeit federal reserve notes were of such a quality that they would be likely to be accepted in a transaction since the more closely counterfeit notes resemble genuine currency,the more likely you might find that the defendant intended to use those notes fraudulently to receive goods or services.
silva challenged the proposed instruction on the grounds that the court references to the amount of currency as potential evidence of intent endorsed the government theory of proof.the court overruled the objection.
the jury returned a conviction on the charge of possession with intent to defraud.silva now appeals to this court.
ii.discussion 
with the exception of silva challenge to the jury instructions,which are reviewed for abuse of discretion,united states sasso,cir,we review silva challenges to the admissibility of seized evidence and the judgment of acquittal de novo.ornelas united states,holding that reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations are reviewed de novo united states grace,cir reviewing sufficiency of the evidence determinations de novo.we review the district court factual findings only for clear error.united states wright,cir.
a.the investigative stop 
silva alleges that the derry police officers violated his fourth amendment right when they seized him at linlew road based on pelletier allegedly unreliable complaint.the parties do not dispute that the police officers seized silva when they approached his car and demanded his driver license.the only question is whether the officers had a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to justify their actions.
under the supreme court precedent in terry ohio,a police officer may perform a brief investigatory stop of an individual if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot.united states am,cir see also united states arvizu,t he fourth amendment is satisfied if the officer action is supported by reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a permissible investigatory stop must satisfy two requirements 
first,the police officer must have a reasonable,articulable suspicion of an individual involvement in some criminal activity.united states ruidíaz,cir.a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity requires some particularized and objective basis for suspecting a stopped individual of legal wrongdoing.united states pontoo,cir quoting united states cortez.it entails more than a mere hunch but less than probable cause.ruidíaz,at.the first circuit recognizes that reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a terry stop may arise when presumptively reliable information about criminal activity is provided by third parties.id.
second,the officer actions undertaken pursuant to that stop must be reasonably related in scope to the stop unless the police have a basis for expanding their investigation.id.at quoting unites states henderson,cir.it is well settled that a police officer conducting an investigatory stop may request the stopped individual to produce identifying information.asking questions is an essential part of police investigations.in the ordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the fourth amendment.hiibel sixth judicial dist.court of,humboldt.where circumstances give officers reasonable grounds to suspect that a defendant may have a criminal history,they may also run a routine background and warrant check without exceeding the scope of an investigatory stop.klaucke daly,cir foley kiely,cir.
at the time officers muncey and phillips approached silva,they had received information from a third party alleging that silva was producing and in possession of counterfeit currency.the officers who received pelletier complaint had no knowledge of pelletier prior eccentricities that may have led them to question the reliability of his account.pelletier accusations were corroborated by the fact that he produced an exemplar of counterfeit currency allegedly handed to him by silva,as well as by the officers own observations of silva car at linlew road.even if pelletier account would not have provided probable cause for a search of silva and his vehicle,the partially corroborated complaint created a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the police actions in approaching silva and requesting basic identification.at that point,silva refusal to provide his driver license coupled with pelletier specific allegations that silva was producing counterfeit police officers reasonable grounds to run a routine warrant check on his license.see klaucke,at defendant refusal to produce a license reasonably roused a suspicion that his was driven by other considerations,like an outstanding warrant for his arrest foley,at defendant inability or unwillingness to provide his social security number,combined with his initial attempt to avoid contact with the police,provided reasonable grounds to investigate his criminal history.
the district court did not err in admitting evidence seized on silva during the arrest ensuing from the officers investigative stop.
b.the seizure of the car 
second,silva argues that the derry police lacked probable cause to seize his vehicle following his arrest.he insists that pelletier history of delusional reports undermined the credibility of his information,and that the police attempts to obtain further information for a search warrant prior to actually searching the car demonstrate their lack of probable cause at the time of seizure.
under the automobile exception to the fourth amendment,police officers may seize and search an automobile prior to obtaining a warrant where they have probable cause to believe that the automobile contains contraband.robinson cook,cir,cert.denied.see also florida white,w hen federal officers have probable cause to believe that an automobile contains contraband,the fourth amendment does not require them to obtain a warrant prior to searching the car for and seizing the contraband.
probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances as to which police have reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that evidence of a crime will be found.robinson,at see also florida harris,a police officer has probable cause to conduct a search when the facts available to him would warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime is present.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the standard is satisfied when the totality of the circumstances create a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.united states hicks,cir internal quotation mark and citation omitted.
in this case,the record suggests that at the time the police seized silva vehicle they had ample evidence supporting a finding of probable cause for a search.after the officers discovered silva outstanding warrant,their search incident to arrest yielded several counterfeit bills and a counterfeit driver license in silva wallet.the seized material corroborated pelletier complaint,in which pelletier had insisted that silva was producing both counterfeit currency and counterfeit identification.furthermore,the officers observations of silva car,which suggested that the defendant was currently living out of the vehicle,gave them reason to believe that further evidence of counterfeiting might be found inside the vehicle.together with pelletier initial report,which alleged that silva had an additional of counterfeit bills in his glove compartment,this evidence more than sufficed to suggest there existed a fair probability that searching silva car would lead officers to further contraband.
silva insists that the officers decision to forestall searching his car until they had obtained a proper warrant reveals their own doubts as to whether they had probable cause at the time of seizure.setting aside the fact that the officers procedural diligence in obtaining a warrant hardly proves their subjective uncertainty about the quality of their evidence,silva argument misreads the law of probable cause.in evaluating probable cause,a court looks at the objective facts,not at the actors subjective intent.united states sánchez,cir.consequently,an officer subjective belief that he or she lacked probable cause is not dispositive where the facts support an objective finding that the standard has been satisfied.see united states pardue,cir although the police officer testimony calls into doubt whether he believed that the information about throwing the lighter amounted to probable cause,an officer subjective belief is not dispositive of whether probable cause existed.the practice of awaiting a magistrate warrant prior to conducting a search,even where officers feel confident in their own assessment of probable cause,is one that should be commended,not punished with exclusion.
the district court properly found that the police had probable cause to seize silva vehicle following his arrest.
c.the warrant application 
third,silva argues that agent coffee failure to include pelletier history of delusional complaints or his animus against silva in the warrant application,both of which may have undermined the magistrate finding of probable cause,renders the ensuing warrant and search of silva car invalid.silva insists that coffee failure to note pelletier potential motives to fabricate evidence,as well as his entirely speculative assertions that pelletier was trustworthy and reliable,constituted a reckless disregard for truth or falsity.
a defendant who seeks a franks hearing to suppress evidence obtained through an invalid warrant must make two showings.first,the defendant must show that the warrant application included a false statement or omission that was made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth.united states rigaud,cir see also frank
