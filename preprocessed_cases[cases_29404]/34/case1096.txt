eva temple appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,insofar as it adjudicates her,in accordance with a jury verdict of conviction,guilty of forcibly assaulting,resisting,or impeding an officer of the united states engaged in official duties,in violation of.the government cross appeals from the same judgment insofar as it grants temple motion for a judgment of acquittal following her conviction by the same jury for willfully oppressing a person under color of law while acting in connection with the revenue laws of the united states,in violation of.
for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment in all respects,resulting in a dismissal of the assault count and reinstatement of the guilty verdict on the oppression count.we remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.
background 
temple was employed by the internal revenue service irs as a quality analyst at the time of the incidents giving rise to the criminal charges filed against her in this case.she had been employed for approximately eighteen years prior to her termination for misconduct at the age of.
i.a threat of investigation 
on march,new york city police detectives montes and magaldi arrived at the irs office in manhattan to arrest temple on a charge of aggravated harassment.the charge arose from threats of harm allegedly made by temple to her landlord management employees.efforts by the police to have temple surrender herself had proved fruitless.upon arrival at the irs office building,the detectives were met by an agent of the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta.the agent escorted the detectives to the floor of the building where temple office was located.temple was not at her desk when the detectives arrived but,when she returned,montes identified himself and informed temple that they were there to arrest her.the detectives asked temple to accompany them out of the building voluntarily to spare her the embarrassment of an arrest.detective montes testified that,as they approached the area of the elevator bank on the way out,temple 
became very violent.she became abusive.she used foul language.she jumped in front of my face.her arms were flailing.she yelled at the tigta agent,myself she specifically said that we had no fucking case,that this was a dispute between herself and the management company,and i had no business being there.
fearing an escalation of temple violent conduct,the detectives physically restrained and handcuffed her and,with the assistance of the tigta agent,brought her down in the elevator and out the front door of the irs office building.once outside the building,the detectives placed temple in the back seat of their car and closed the car door.temple opened the door and tried to get out.she was,the car safety locks were engaged and montes sat in the back seat as magaldi drove to the precinct police headquarters in queens.
as she was being transported,temple continued to scream and yell abusive epithets.at one point,she kicked montes as they sat in the back seat.during the trip,she told the detectives that she was an irs employee,with the ability to initiate investigations and audits into the tax histories of the detectives.she also stated that there were a number of brothers and sisters who held a grudge against the nypd and that she would contact those employees to audit the detectives tax returns because of the arrest.montes reported these threats to agent mcgowen of the tigta the next day.montes testified that he took the threats to be true and gave the following reasons why he considered the threats significant enough to pass along to agent mcgowen 
m yself and detective magaldi were a little concerned that this woman having been an irs employee for that amount of time,coupled with the behavior that we saw,and the belligerence,we became a little worried that perhaps she did have the ability to initiate audits and investigate into our tax histories.
temple continued to be physically and verbally abusive after she arrived at the police station.according to montes,temple said numerous times throughout that day that the charges themselves were bullshit,that the complaining witnesses themselves were all hispanic bitches,that i being a hispanic myself am taking their side and that this was all a racist,i guess you could say a racist scheme against her.temple complained about her arrest even after she had been placed in a cell.during the booking process,certain comments that temple made in response to pedigree questions were so outrageous that they made some people in the office laugh.after the booking,temple was transmitted for psychiatric evaluation by the emergency service unit of the new york police department.subsequently,a psychiatric evaluation was ordered by the district court,and temple was found competent to stand trial.
ii.a threat of harm 
approximately two months after detectives montes and magaldi arrested temple for aggravated harassment,the irs fired temple for misconduct unrelated to the arrest.the termination of employment was impelled by an incident at the entrance to the irs office in the william green federal building in philadelphia on october.temple was in philadelphia to attend a meeting.a magnetometer began to ring as she passed through it to enter the building.when the federal protective officer at the magnetometer asked temple to remove any metal objects on her person,she became angry and started to argue with him.when asked to submit her photo id,she shouted at the officer and pushed her id up close to his face.as he attempted to grab the id,she snatched it from him and left.she returned thirty minutes later,reentered the building,and loudly bombarded the officer with an obscene tirade.three other officers of the federal protective service were summoned,and one of them asked temple to reenter the magnetometer.she responded i am a government employee and should not be inconvenienced.ultimately,two of the officers escorted temple to her meeting.
a letter from the irs manager proposing the termination of temple employment referred to the incident in philadelphia as the reason for the termination and advised temple as follows 
i am also taking into account the fact that you were suspended for one day on january,for disruptive behavior.you were suspended for nine days beginning november,for insubordination and disruptive behavior.again,you were suspended for calendar days beginning on march,for disruptive behavior in a bank with which the irs does business and for misuse of your position and failing to meet your financial obligations.
the letter notified temple that further information was available from senior labor relations specialist james petherbridge.it was petherbridge who recommended and implemented the decision to terminate temple,and he was familiar with her entire history at the irs as well as the circumstances involved in her arrest by the new york city detectives.
when temple was terminated from her employment,effective may,she did not turn in her irs badge identification as requested.she presented that identification to a bank manager at the bank of new york on june.the manager called petherbridge to verify that the person he was meeting was in fact eva temple.petherbridge could hear temple yelling in the background.he confirmed her identity but told the bank manager to keep the identification badge,which temple was not entitled to have.the manager was unable to confiscate the badge because temple had already retrieved it from him when the telephone call was made.
upon arriving at work on the morning of june,petherbridge found a message that had been placed on his office telephone voicemail by temple on the afternoon of june.the message was placed at,after petherbridge had left work for the day.the message was as follows yeah,you faggot ass bitch ass stupid faggot fuck.i gon na fuck you up,you faggot bitch.
petherbridge testified that he was basically petrified after he heard the message and explained his fear as follows i was well aware of her actions when she was arrested,her beating up the detectives in the car and the fact that she had threatened to hurt or kill her former landlord and child.so that led me to have great concerns about my own safety.petherbridge immediately notified his manager as well as agent mcgowen of the tigta about the message.mcgowen testified that,when he interviewed him,petherbridge appeared nervous,scared,and was concerned that temple was going to assault him.in his testimony,petherbridge said that he basically was afraid and had lunch the next week in his office because he was really afraid to go out.it does not appear that he had any further contact with temple.
iii.indictment and subsequent proceedings 
temple was charged in a indictment dated july.in count one,she was charged with a violation of in that she,as an employee of the irs,
acting in connection with the revenue laws of the united states,did willfully oppress a person under color of law,to wit,the defendant unlawfully,willfully and knowingly threatened two new york city police officers,who were arresting her for aggravated harassment and other charges,to wit,she threatened that she would initiate an irs audit of their tax returns as a way to seek revenge.
in count ii,temple was charged with a violation of in that she 
unlawfully,willfully and knowingly did forcibly assault,resist,oppose,impede,intimidate and interfere with a person designated in while engaged in and on account of the performance of official duties,to wit,eva temple left a threatening message on the voicemail of the internal revenue service officer handl ing her termination from irs employment and thereafter sought to have the defendant irs employee identification confiscated.
following her conviction on both counts by jury verdict on july,temple moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts pursuant to.she moved in the alternative for a new trial pursuant to.in a written opinion,the district court granted the rule motion as to count one and denied both motions as to count two.see united states temple,d.in its analysis of the count one conviction,the district court observed that the government is required to prove three elements to establish a violation of a f irst,at the time of the acts alleged,the defendant was an officer or employee of the united states second,the defendant was acting in connection with a revenue law of the united states and third,the defendant willfully oppressed a person under color of law.id.at.the district court determined that there was no dispute as to the first temple was an employee of the irs.id.the district court determined as to the second element that a reasonable jury could have found that temple was acting in connection with the revenue laws because her threat to the detectives involved irs audits.id.with respect to the third element,the district court determined that willful oppression under color of law was not established.id.at.
with respect to the government failure to establish the third element,the court reasoned as follows 
although temple clearly acted willfully and in an attempt to interfere with the detectives efforts to arrest her and transport her to the precinct,her actions were not clothed with authority and she was not acting under color of law in any meaningful sense.her tantrum was not part of the performance of any actual or pretended duty,and she was not or even punish the officers for arresting her.
to the contrary,temple had no power or authority,and it was clear in the circumstances here that she did not.indeed,she had already been placed under arrest and handcuffed.she engaged in an incoherent outburst and eventually was treated as an emotionally disturbed person a police department emergency services unit was summoned,and the unit considered using a taser gun to subdue her.the officers were laughing at temple and eventually they took her to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation and treatment.throughout this series of events,temple called one of the detectives by the wrong name.
in further support of its conclusion that no reasonable jury could have found that temple willfully oppressed the detectives under color of law,id.at,the district court noted the following factors that temple was on notice that the irs was proposing to remove her from service that she had been previously disciplined for other incidents that her employment was therefore precarious even prior to her arrest and that there was nothing in the record to show that her employment as a program analyst enabled her to initiate audits of tax returns.id.at.
in its discussion of the count two conviction,the district court enumerated four elements that require proof by the government 
first,the targeted individual was a federal officer or employee second,the defendant forcibly assaulted,resisted,opposed,impeded,intimidated,or interfered with the federal officer or employee third,the defendant acted knowingly and willfully and fourth,the federal officer or employee was engaged in the performance of his official duties or that the assault or interference occurred on account of the performance of his official duties.
id.at.finding no dispute as to the first,third,and fourth elements,the district court focused on the second element.id.noting that an immediate threat of force is sufficient to meet the forcible requirement of the second element,the district court framed the issue as follows 
ultimately,the issue is whether the government evidence showed that temple forcibly intimidated or interfered with petherbridge in or because of the performance of his duties.that turns,in part,on whether the voicemail left by temple posed an immediate or imminent threat to petherbridge.
in finding that the requirement was met,the district court determined that the words i gon na fuck you up were an expression of an immediate or imminent threat of harm in view of the surrounding circumstances.id.these circumstances included the following that the message tone was angry and harsh that there was a sense of immediacy in temple voice that temple knew the location of petherbridge office and had the ability to gain access to it and that the telephone call was made on the same day that temple presented her expired irs credentials to a bank.id.the district court concluded that a reasonable jury could have found that temple might very well have been in the building or across the street or somewhere else nearby,waiting for petherbridge to leave work at the close of the business day,when she placed the telephone call.id.the district court also found it significant in this regard that petherbridge actually was intimidated by the voicemail,and that temple actions were clearly of the type the statute was designed to protect,id.at.
on december,the district court sentenced temple on count two,a class a misdemeanor,to time served imprisonment for approximately seven weeks,supervised release for one year,and a mandatory assessment of.
i.the rule standard 
federal rule of criminal procedure a allows a district court to enter a judgment of acquittal with respect to any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.we review the grant or denial of a judgment of acquittal de novo,and we apply the same standards governing the sufficiency of the evidence as are applied by a district court.united states jackson,cir united states reyes,cir.accordingly,the very nature of motions for acquittal pursuant to rule is to question the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.united states gjurashaj,cir.the test established by the supreme court requires us to determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.put another way,a court may enter a judgment of acquittal only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged is nonexistent or so meager that no reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states guadagna,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in assessing the evidence,a court is constrained to bear in mind that rule does not provide it with an opportunity to substitute its own determination of the weight of the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn for that of the jury.id.at internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.where a jury has rendered a verdict of guilty,the duty of a court passing on a rule motion is to review all of the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that the jury might have drawn in favor of the government.united states walker,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a heavy burden therefore must be borne by one who would challenge a guilty verdict.united states si lu tian,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
where a court concludes after a full analysis of the evidence in connection with a rule motion that either of the two results,a reasonable doubt or no reasonable doubt,is fairly possible,the court must let the jury decide the matter.united states autuori,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.conversely,in passing upon a motion for directed verdict of acquittal,if there is no evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,the motion must be granted.united states taylor,cir quoting curley united states.
ii.the oppression count 
applying the foregoing principles,we conclude that the district court erred in granting a judgment of acquittal following the jury verdict of guilty on count one of the indictment.count one charges a violation of,which provides in pertinent part as follows 
any officer or employee of the united states acting in connection with any revenue law of the united states who is guilty of willful oppression under color of law shall be dismissed from office or discharged from employment and,upon conviction thereof,shall be imprisoned not more than five years 
the district court properly determined that there was evidentiary support for a jury finding that the first two elements of the offense were satisfied,viz.that temple was an employee of the united states and that she was acting in connection with the revenue laws by threatening the detectives with an irs audit.the district court erred,however,in concluding that there was a lack of evidentiary support for the third oppression of the detectives under color of law.since this is a case of first impression in regard to the interpretation of willful oppression under color of law in the context of a criminal prosecution under a,we turn to some commonly held concepts to illuminate the phrase.
willful repeatedly has been defined in the criminal context as intentional,purposeful,and voluntary,as distinguished from accidental or negligent.see black law dictionary ed.evil intent or bad purpose are not implicit in this definition.id.oppression includes the unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power.third new international dictionary,unabridged.in criminal law,it is a n abuse of office committed by a public official.oxford english dictionary online.search for oppression definition from the june draft revision to the second edition last visited february.for a definition of the phrase under color of law,we turn to the cases interpreting and,the criminal and civil statutes prohibiting the deprivation under color of law of rights protected by the constitution and laws of the united states.while color of law under these statutes refers to actions taken under color of state law,we think that the tests established in the cases pertinent to these statutes are helpful in determining whether an action is taken under color of federal law for purposes of a.we therefore substitute federal for state when quoting from the cases.
we have noted that 
t he supreme court has broadly interpreted the color of law requirement,concluding that m isuse of power,possessed by virtue of federal law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of federal law,is action taken under color of federal law.
united states walsh,cir quoting united states classic.color of law and pretense of law are synonymous,and acts of officers engaged in personal pursuits are not included.see screws united states.although no bright line separates actions taken under color of law from personal pursuits,pitchell callan,cir,the relevant question in determining whether an action was taken under color of law is not whether the action was part of the defendant official duties but,rather,whether the action was made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of federal law,walsh,at quoting classic,at.one who abuses a position given to him or her by the government is said to act under color of law.west atkins,d.such is the case,for example,where a police officer,albeit,nonetheless invokes the real or apparent power of the police department.pitchell,at.
in determining that the color of law requirement had not been met,the district court relied on hughes halifax county sch,cir.in hughes,the plaintiff claimed that he was assaulted,battered,and subjected to intentional emotional distress under color of state law because he was accosted by county employees.id.at.the county employees were employed by the maintenance department of the school district.in rejecting a claim that the were acting under color of law,the court in hughes distinguished cases involving judges and police officers the judges were figuratively and literally clothed in state power,and the officers were acting behind badges.the were wearing,at best,county coveralls.the indicia of state authority just is the same.id.at.
hughes is not analogous to the case at bar.temple employment by the irs clothed her with the indicia of authority while the employment in positions of equal rank with the plaintiff in hughes did not.the district court also found that temple had no power or authority because she was arrested and handcuffed when she threatened the detectives.temple,d at.but this fact does not establish that the threats were not made under color of law.the district court also found it significant that,some time after the threat was made,some personnel at the police precinct laughed while temple was responding to pedigree questions,and that she was at one point treated as an emotionally disturbed person.id.these events perhaps indicate in retrospect that the detectives should not have taken temple threats seriously.yet,they testified that they did in fact take the threats quite seriously.moreover,these later events do not gainsay the fact that the detectives knew of temple employment with the irs and had no reason to doubt that she would carry out her threats as she made them in the police car on the way to the precinct.recently,in united states giordano,cir,a case involving sexual abuse of minors by a mayor,we held that the mayor acted under color of law by actively and deliberately us ing his apparent authority as mayor to ensure that the victims did not resist or report the ongoing abuse.id.at.the evidence here,insofar as it pertains to color of law,is even more compelling than it was in giordano.here,there was a specific and direct threat under the guise of apparent authority,while in giordano it appears that no specific and direct threat to invoke official authority ever was made.
in this regard,the district court temple was on notice that the irs had proposed to remove her from service,that she had been disciplined several times,that her employment was precarious when she was arrested,and that there was no basis in the record to conclude that temple had authority to initiate an audit of the detectives returns,temple,d at not support the conclusion that temple was not clothed with the authority of federal law.the detectives were unaware of any of these matters as they transported temple and as she made her threats.they knew only that she was an employee of the irs.to them,she was authorized to speak as a representative of her agency.her oppressive conduct was indeed made possible by her perceived ability to invoke the real or apparent authority of her department.
we have said,in another context,that section imposes sanctions on revenue agents for departures from the high standards of conduct demanded by those holding that office.united states stern,cir per curiam.temple egregious,obnoxious,unprofessional,and,indeed,oppressive behavior represent a significant departure from those standards.in any event,we are unwilling,under the circumstances revealed,to agree with the district court that no rational jury could find that temple acted under color of law.see united states tarpley,cir holding that,in case involving an assault by an police officer on his wife boyfriend,a rational jury could find that the officer acted under color of law.
iii.the forcible intimidation count 
a penalizes anyone who 
forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates or interferes with any officer or employee of the united states while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.
we have said that this provision must be read as prohibiting any acts or threats of bodily harm that might reasonably deter a federal official from the performance of his or her duties.united states walker,cir.although a touching is not required within the meaning of and a threat of physical injury is sufficient,the threat must be accompanied by an apparent present ability to inflict the injury and a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.united states chestaro,cir emphasis supplied.
where the evidence permits an inference that a reasonable person standing in the place of the threatened official would have feared imminent bodily harm,the official state of mind need not be established by explicit testimony.united states walker,at emphasis supplied.an implied threat to use force sometime in the indefinite future does not fill the bill.id.at.
in walker,with respect to the requirement of immediacy,we approved an instruction,given in the following terms,that the threat must be of present harm 
t he threat of bodily harm in the was some testimony about i will get you after work,that is not the kind of thing that would be sufficient under the law.you have to find that there was a present threat,immediate threat for you to find the forcible requirement to be met.
in denying the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the section count,the district court found sufficient evidence of immediacy in temple threat to petherbridge i gon na fuck you up,you faggot bitch.temple,d at.this finding was informed by the tone of the message and the sense of immediacy conveyed by it as well as by temple knowledge of the location of petherbridge office,temple ability to gain access to that office,and the timing of the telephone call.id.from these factors,the district court concluded indeed,a reasonable jury could have found that temple might very well have been in the building or across the street or somewhere else nearby,waiting for petherbridge to leave work at the close of the business day,when she placed the telephone call.id.the district court finding was further informed by its observations that the evidence showed that petherbridge was actually intimidated by the voicemail,and that temple actions were clearly the type of conduct seeks to prevent,id.at.
we think that the voicemail message did not pose the sort of immediate or imminent threat required by the statute.we see little difference between temple message and the i will get you after work message considered insufficient as an immediate threat in walker.a sense of immediacy in a tone of voice can not substitute for evidence of actual immediacy and mere knowledge of someone location can not give rise to an inference of the physical proximity necessary to fulfill the immediacy requirement.in any event,there was no evidence whatsoever as to temple location when she left the voicemail message.the requisite apparent present ability to carry out a threat is absent here.the district court contrary conclusion is founded largely in speculation.
the cases affirming convictions generally involve encounters.see,united states street,cir united states shedlock,cir united states schrader,cir united states fernandez,cir united states fallen,cir affirming a conviction where the defendant was located on one side of door with police officers on the other side.here,the threat was not presented to petherbridge until he listened to his voicemail some nineteen hours after the message was placed there and,although the subjective fear described by petherbridge is relevant,it is not controlling.the test is an objective one,viz whether imminent bodily harm would have been feared by a reasonable person standing in petherbridge shoes.walker,at emphasis supplied.that test was not met in this case,for,although petherbridge may reasonably have feared harm,he had no objective basis to fear imminent harm.we therefore can not agree with the district court that temple conduct was of the type that was designed to prevent and conclude accordingly that the district court erred in failing to grant a judgment of acquittal on count two of the indictment.since we dispose of this count on the basis of evidentiary insufficiency,we see no need to pass on temple evidentiary challenges made in relation to this count.
we have considered temple claim of retroactive misjoinder resulting in prejudicial spillover and find it meritless.see united states hamilton,cir.
conclusion 
we reverse the judgment of acquittal as to count one of the indictment and reinstate the jury verdict of guilty thereon.we reverse the judgment of conviction on count two and direct the entry of a judgment of acquittal thereon.we remand the case for the of the defendant and the entry of an appropriate judgment consistent with the foregoing.
i concur in the court reinstatement of temple conviction under a and its reversal of her conviction for impeding an officer of the united states engaged in official duties under.i write to express my concern that as a result of this case and united states giordano,cir,this court appears to have allowed a victim subjective beliefs or fears about a defendant ability or willingness to use his or her public position to cause harm to serve as the basis for finding that a defendant was acting under color of law.there is no basis for allowing subjective impressions,beliefs,or fears to cloud,much less drive,analysis,and doing so will make consistent application of statutes in this circuit difficult,if not impossible.
when two new york police department nypd detectives arrested temple,she asserted that she was an irs employee with the ability to initiate investigations and audits into the detectives tax histories,and that there were a number of brothers and sisters in the irs who held a grudge against the nypd.the majority opinion concludes these threats were under color of law.i do not quarrel with much of the majority opinion,including this conclusion,but i would hold that temple threats were under the color of law without regard to the detectives subjective beliefs or fears of whether temple either did or did not have the ability or the willingness to carry out her threats.it is temple use of her status as an irs employee to effectuate the harm the officers is,to willfully oppress by threatening to initiate or have others initiate an made her threats under color of law.it was the nexus between temple status and the harm,as evidenced by her objective manifestations,that render her acts under color of law,and therefore a violation of a.
existing case law,including cases dealing with and its prior versions,as well as scholarly commentary,supports the conclusion that temple threats were made under color of law.temple threats departed from the irs high standards of conduct demanded of those holding that office,united states stern,cir,irrespective of the detectives beliefs or fears.yet i worry that the majority opinion may be read as implying that the detectives subjective beliefs or fears that temple could or would carry out her threats are relevant,even though there is no reason to interject this subjective component into the analysis.majority op.as we have held,reliance on a victim subjective reaction misses the essence of the color of law requirement.pitchell callan,cir.
in my view,a determination that a defendant acted under color of law should be based on objective criteria.in other words,in personal capacity
