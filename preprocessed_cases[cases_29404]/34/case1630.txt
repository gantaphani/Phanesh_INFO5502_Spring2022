defendant terrell allen appeals from his conviction in the district of maryland for contravening g by knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony.on appeal,allen maintains that evidence used against him should have been suppressed and that he was erroneously denied a franks hearing concerning a search warrant affidavit.see franks delaware,holding that,in limited circumstances,accused is entitled to evidentiary hearing on veracity of search warrant affidavit.after the district court declined to suppress the evidence and denied his request for a franks hearing,allen entered a conditional guilty plea to a single g offense,reserving his right to appeal the court adverse suppression rulings.as explained below,we affirm.
on july,a grand jury in the district of maryland returned a single count indictment against allen,charging that he had contravened g by knowingly possessing a caliber revolver after having been convicted of a felony the firearm offense.a superseding indictment was returned on february,containing a second g count that charged allen with knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony the ammunition offense.the revolver underlying the firearm offense was seized on may,during a warranted search of the allen family appliance store the afa store,or the store located on north gay street in baltimore,maryland.the ammunition underlying the ammunition offense was seized two months later,during a warranted search of allen residence on punjab circle in baltimore county.
allen filed pretrial motions seeking suppression of the evidence underlying both counts of the superseding indictment,and also requesting that the district court conduct a franks hearing on the veracity of information contained in the search warrant affidavit leading to the seizure of the revolver.after the court denied his suppression motions,allen entered a conditional guilty his right to appeal the court adverse suppression rulings.
the events leading to the warranted seizures of the revolver and the ammunition serve as the factual predicate of this appeal and are not in dispute.at approximately on may,baltimore police officers responded to calls relating to multiple shootings in the street outside the afa store,which was owned and operated by allen and his family.allen,along with his father,his,and a man named reginald davis,were apparently attending a barbeque outside the store when the shootings occurred all four were shot and taken to nearby hospitals.allen and davis survived,but allen father and died.
shooting detectives of the baltimore police department were the first officers to respond to the firefight near the afa store it was apparent to the shooting detectives that some of the victims would not survive,and they immediately requested the assistance of the homicide unit,which in turn dispatched homicide detective gary niedermeier to the scene.niedermeier arrived at the chaotic scene outside the store approximately twenty minutes after the homicide unit was called.
at the crime scene,detective niedermeier observed approximately twenty spent shell casings and fragments that were strewn about the area,indicating that multiple firearms had been discharged in the firefight.niedermeier also observed several blood trails,one of which led directly into the afa store.he followed the blood trail inside the store,which led to a filing cabinet.one of the cabinet drawers was slightly ajar,and niedermeier opened it and observed a silver revolver.he promptly relayed this information to the shooting detectives at the scene.
in the aftermath of these events,the baltimore and federal authorities sought and obtained three separate search warrants the first warrant,issued on the evening of the,authorized a search of the afa store for firearms and other evidence the first warrant the second warrant,issued on june,authorized the collection of allen dna the second warrant and the third warrant,issued on june,authorized the search of allen residence for firearms and other evidence the third warrant.the revolver underlying the firearm offense was seized during the search of the store pursuant to the first warrant,and the ammunition underlying the ammunition offense was recovered during the search of allen residence pursuant to the third warrant.the events surrounding the acquisition and execution of the three warrants is essential to a proper understanding of this appeal.
on may,the date of the firefight,baltimore detective chris wade sought and obtained the first warrant from a state court judge.the first warrant authorized the search of the afa store for firearms,dna,and other evidence related to the shootings that occurred outside the store.wade had not personally been to the crime scene,and much of the information included in his affidavit had been relayed from officers on the scene.wade affidavit accurately described the multiple victims,the many shell casings,and various other aspects of the crime scene outside the store.the affidavit also related the following 
a blood trail was located going inside the afa store on the first floor and going up the steps to the second floor.on the first floor to the right of the blood trail laying in plain view on top of a file cabinet was a handgun.
based on wade affidavit,the first warrant was issued and the search was executed at the store on the evening of may,less than five hours after the firefight.during the search,the officers seized the revolver from the filing cabinet,plus dna samples.
three weeks later,on june,detective niedermeier sought and obtained the second warrant,also from a state court judge,authorizing the seizure of dna samples from allen.the affidavit supporting the second warrant detailed the chaotic scene outside the afa store following the shootings,and explained that the revolver and dna samples had been seized during the warranted search of the store.the affidavit specified that niedermeier had observed a silver revolver in a filing cabinet at the store before the revolver was seized 
y our affiant located a blood trail which led from the initial scene into the store.as your affiant followed the blood trail,it led to a four drawer filing cabinet with the second drawer from the top slightly open.y our affiant opened the drawer and observed a silver revolver 
the second warrant was executed on june,and allen dna was obtained.his dna matched that found on the revolver seized from the store and,as a result,allen was charged with the firearm offense.
on june,atf agent noah slackman sought and obtained the third warrant,from a federal magistrate judge,authorizing the search of allen residence for firearms and related paraphernalia.slackman affidavit specified that the home on punjab circle in baltimore county was allen residence,detailed allen prior felony convictions,recounted the may,crime scene similar to the details in niedermeier affidavit supporting the second warrant,and indicated that the dna samples found on the revolver matched allen dna.the principal basis for the search of allen residence,however,was information provided by a confidential informant the ci according to the ci,the may,shootings had been committed by a gang of allen drug distribution rivals,in retaliation for a kidnapping orchestrated by allen.the ci also explained that allen had made statements that he intended to commit acts of violence toward anybody related to his rivals who committed the may shootings,and in that regard members of allen gang have been and will be armed with weapons for that purpose.
the federal magistrate judge issued the third warrant on june,and it was executed on july.a box of ammunition was seized from the punjab circle residence during the search,and,as a result,allen was charged with the ammunition offense.
in pretrial proceedings in the district court,allen sought suppression of the evidence seized pursuant to the three search warrants.in regard to the revolver and dna recovered from the afa store,allen maintained that detective niedermeier opening of the cabinet drawer constituted an unconstitutional search not justified by any exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement,and that niedermeier observation of the silver revolver in the drawer prompted the decision of the authorities to seek the first warrant.thus,allen asserted that the revolver and dna seized pursuant to the first warrant,as well as allen dna obtained pursuant to the second warrant,should be suppressed.additionally,allen maintained that the conflicts between detective wade affidavit supporting the first warrant and niedermeier affidavit supporting the second is,the revolver being in plain view according to wade but inside a closed filing cabinet drawer according to niedermeier justified a franks hearing.finally,allen sought to suppress the ammunition seized from his punjab circle residence because agent slackman affidavit supporting the third warrant was tainted by the constitutional infirmities of the first and second warrants.allen also asserted that the affidavit failed to show a nexus between the punjab circle residence and the items to be seized,and that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause.
in responding to the allen suppression motions,the prosecution conceded that niedermeier went outside the scope of the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement by opening the filing cabinet drawer in the afa store.the prosecution maintained,however,that suppression of the revolver was not warranted because it would have been discovered inevitably in any event.the prosecution also maintained that a franks hearing was not required because wade accurately described the crime scene and blood trails leading into the afa sufficient probable cause for the first warrant,even with the statements about the revolver excised.finally,the prosecution contended that agent slackman affidavit provided ample probable cause for issuance of the third warrant.
on may,the district court conducted a hearing on allen suppression motions.the prosecution called detective niedermeier to testify,and he related that he had arrived at the crime scene about twenty minutes after the responding officers requested assistance from the homicide unit.niedermeier described the chaotic scene of the shootings and recounted following a blood trail into the afa store.niedermeier explained that he did not know whether other officers had already been inside the store,but that his duties include searching a crime scene for victims and suspects.he agreed,however,that he followed the blood trail into the store to gather evidence and to determine what had happened because these four individuals had been shot.niedermeier explained that the silver revolver was observed inside a cabinet drawer,and was not in plain view as stated in detective wade affidavit.niedermeier also said,however,that he had never spoken directly to wade about the revolver and had advised the other officers at the scene just generally about it.id.at.
after detective niedermeier testified,the district court denied allen motion to suppress the revolver,as well as his request for a franks hearing.the court explained that such relief was not warranted because the revolver would inevitably have been found and the inevitable discovery rule trumps.the court explained that clearly you got a shooting scene there,you got blood going inside,clearly what you going to do is get a warrant.and that would have happened,and the gun would have been found.id.at.furthermore,and even if you excise all references to the revolver in detective wade affidavit it seems to me that you still got probable cause.id.at.after this ruling,allen conceded that if the f irst w arrant stands,then quite obviously the s econd w arrant would stand as well.id.at.
moving to the third warrant,allen requested suppression of the ammunition seized during the warranted search of his punjab circle residence.allen maintained that the information supplied by the ci in agent slackman affidavit constituted puffing,and that the affidavit was facially insufficient to show probable cause for a search of the punjab circle residence.from the bench,the district court denied allen motion to suppress and concluded that slackman affidavit contained sufficient probable cause for issuance of the third warrant 
i t seems to me there ample probable cause.i mean,you got the fact of the shootings.you got,in the streets of baltimore,you had four people shot,two people killed in that shooting,two other people injured.you got the dna matching.you got the firearm i do think it puffing.i wish it were puffing in the city of baltimore,it not t here was probable cause to believe that allen had a firearm,wherever he was,in his residence.and as i say there was a particular history of violence leading to this,which was the alleged kidnapping.then the shooting and i think,frankly,the officers did exactly the right thing and the issuing magistrate judge did exactly the right thing in signing the warrant.
on september,after his suppression motions and request for a franks hearing had been denied,allen entered a conditional guilty plea to the ammunition offense.the plea agreement preserved allen right to appeal the district court adverse suppression rulings.on december,the court sentenced allen to months in prison and three years of supervised release 
allen has timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we assess de novo the legal determinations underlying a district court suppression rulings,including the denial of a franks hearing,and we review the court factual findings relating to such rulings for clear error.see united states blatstein,cir.a determination of probable cause is an issue of law that is reviewed de novo.see united states wilhelm,cir.
on appeal,allen makes three contentions.first,he maintains that the district court erred in denying his request for a franks hearing on the inaccurate statements contained in detective wade affidavit supporting the first warrant.second,he asserts that the first warrant is void because detective niedermeier warrantless entry into the afa store was not justified by exigent circumstances finally,allen contends that agent slackman affidavit supporting the third warrant was insufficient to justify a probable cause finding,and that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule,see united states leon,does not apply.we assess allen contentions in turn.
allen contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a franks hearing.more specifically,he maintains that the inaccurate statements in detective wade affidavit supporting of the first,that the firearm in the afa store was in plain view were included intentionally or recklessly.with those statements excised,according to allen,the affidavit would not support a probable cause determination.
an accused is generally not entitled to challenge the veracity of a facially valid search warrant affidavit.in its decision in franks delaware,however,the supreme court carved out a narrow exception to this rule,whereby an accused is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the veracity of statements in the affidavit.see.to be entitled to a franks hearing,however,the accused must make a substantial preliminary showing that false statements were either knowingly or recklessly included in an affidavit supporting a search warrant and that,without those false statements,the affidavit can not support a probable cause finding.see id.therefore,if the allegedly false statements are not necessary for the probable cause finding,the accused is not entitled to a franks hearing.see id.
as we have recognized,the concept of probable cause is not subject to a precise definition.see united states richardson,cir.nevertheless,the supreme court has explained that probable cause plainly exist s where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.ornelas united states.an assessment of the presence of probable cause must be based on the totality of the relevant circumstances,rather than on the technical or rigid demands of a formulaic legal test.see illinois gates,united states blackwood,cir.in making a probable cause assessment,a judicial officer must simp
