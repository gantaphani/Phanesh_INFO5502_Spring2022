opinion of the court 
edward kellogg kellogg appeals from a judgment of conviction following a jury verdict finding him guilty on counts of mail fraud pursuant to and.the primary issue before us is whether the district court erred by allowing the government to a character witness with a question based on the assumption of kellogg guilt.finding no error,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
kellogg was the owner,president,and quality control officer of johnston laboratories,johnston laboratories,located in new cumberland,pennsylvania.johnston laboratories provided environmental testing services,specifically,analytical testing of environmental samples,including water and wastewater,in order to determine the presence and concentration of contaminants.many of johnston laboratories customers were required to comply with environmental laws and regulations administered by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pa dep.among the tests that customers ordered from johnston laboratories were those for volatile organic chemicals voc,contaminants whose presence in water is regulated by the epa and pa dep.in particular,johnston laboratories customers required testing under an epa protocol called method,which tests for approximately contaminants,as opposed to epa method,which tests for approximately thirty contaminants.
from may to march,johnston laboratories did not possess the appropriately operating equipment to perform voc testing under epa method.during that time period,johnston laboratories subcontracted its voc testing and analysis to another environmental testing laboratory,associates.however,kellogg knew that also could not and did not perform voc testing under epa method,as required by johnston laboratories customers,but instead used epa method.nonetheless,kellogg authorized to test the water samples of johnston laboratories customers using the less sensitive method.
kellogg caused johnston laboratories to mail to its customers reports falsely stating that epa method had been used to test the samples,even though only epa method had been used.kellogg,also through johnston laboratories,fraudulently billed customers for the results of environmental voc testing that was not performed according to the methods ordered by those customers.
in all,kellogg was charged with causing separate,false and fraudulent voc environmental test reports and billing statements for those reports to be delivered by mail to johnston laboratories customers from may to march,in violation of and.following a three week jury trial,kellogg was found guilty on all counts.he appeals the judgment of the district court,entered march.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
of opinion character witnesses 
kellogg claims his right to due process was violated when the district court allowed the government to certain of his character witnesses using a hypothetical that assumed he was guilty of the crimes charged in this case.we review a district court ruling on the scope of for abuse of discretion.united states serafini,cir united states furst,cir.as to the district court legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence and its ruling on kellogg due process claim,our review is plenary.see united states bobb,cir united states mack,cir citation omitted.
kellogg raises identical issues with respect to two of his character malik and fred pennington.the circumstances of the of each is reviewed in turn.
saleh malik 
defense witness saleh malik gave testimony supporting kellogg character as a citizen.during the government of malik,kellogg objected to the following question 
do you have any knowledge about the way kellogg ran his environmental laboratory back in 
the district court overruled the objection and said that t he government may test the opinions concerning character,and the testimony concerning reputation,by testing the witness knowledge of the defendant and his business appx.
on appeal,kellogg argues that the challenged question was improper.more specifically,kellogg position is that the was impermissible because it assumed the criminal conduct at issue in this case had in fact occurred and that the question thereby violated his right to due process by undermining the presumption of innocence.the government responds that the question was unobjectionable because the prosecution was entitled to test the extent of malik knowledge of kellogg business practices.
control of is largely within the trial court discretion.see michelson united states.r arely,and only on a clear showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion,will courts of appeals disturb the ruling of trial courts on this subject.federal rule of evidence a expressly allows the government to character witnesses regarding their knowledge of specific instances of the defendant conduct.a in all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of character of a person is admissible,proof may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion.on,inquiry is allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.such may help the jury evaluate the reliability of the character testimony.united states shwayder,cir.
here,the government simply asked malik whether he knew how kellogg ran his business,a question which plainly falls within the purview of rule a.we are unpersuaded by kellogg argument that the government question to malik was in essence a hypothetical.the question does not assume kellogg guilt it does not refer even obliquely to the conduct that formed the basis of the charged crimes.rather,because malik offered his personal opinion about kellogg character,the district court properly allowed the prosecution to test the foundation for that opinion by asking a question that could elicit a response demonstrating how well malik knew kellogg in the relevant arena of business.therefore,the district court did not err by allowing the challenged question put to malik.
fred pennington.
kellogg also argues that the government of fred pennington,contained an impermissible hypothetical.like malik,pennington testified to kellogg character as a citizen.kellogg objected when the government,during,posed the following line of questions 
sir,would you agree with me that a person who knows that a laboratory used one particular analytical method,but then who reports out a completely different analytical method on final reports of analysis to its customers,would your opinion be different about that person being a law abiding citizen 
is this a hypothetical question,or is this specific to this case 
i asking you a hypothetical question.
i think my opinion would be different.
appx.the court overruled kellogg objection and,immediately after the quoted line of questioning,sua sponte instructed the jury as follows 
this question and answer that was just asked of this witness to test his opinion was offered for a limited purpose and i have to briefly explain to you the limitations of what it was presented for and what it was not presented for.
this witness on direct examination expressed opinion that the defendant had a defendant character was consistent with that of being a law abiding citizen.he also testified that he knows people who know the defendant,and that the defendant reputation among others for being a law abiding citizen is excellent.so he gave both what we call opinion evidence and reputation evidence on the defendant character for being a law abiding citizen.in his opinion,he a law abiding citizen,and his reputation in the community for being a law abiding citizen is excellent according to the testimony.
now,as is the case of any witness,you must decide whether you believe or you do believe the testimony of the witness.we will give you more detailed instructions at the end of the trial about what you do with opinion evidence and what you do with reputation evidence,and how that might affect your final decision in your verdict in the case.for now it only necessary and important for me to indicate to you that the which was heard by you is on the opinion evidence.it is not on the reputation evidence.in other words,he expressed the opinion that the person,the defendant has a character is consistent with being a law abiding citizen,and so he was permitted to be asked someone used a particular analytical method,but reported to a customer that he used a different analytical method,would that hypothetical circumstance change your opinion or result in your a different opinion,and his answer was yes.
so you may consider that in weighing the opinion testimony of this particular witness opinion,but you may not consider that answer,and it not being offered,on his other testimony that the defendant has a reputation,excellent reputation in the community for being law abiding,because that reputation is based on the views and opinions of others,not of this individual.those others ca be by this question,that why we limit it.
as detailed herein,the district court subsequently stated its reasons for overruling kellogg objection on the record,outside of the presence of the jury,prior to giving this limiting instruction.
permissibility of a hypothetical 
kellogg argues that the district court violated his right to due process and erred under federal rule of evidence a by permitting the government to pose a question that assumed kellogg is guilty of the charged offense.
the district court relied primarily on united states curtis,cir,in overruling kellogg objection to the question posed to pennington.there we recognized that rule a provides that proof of character may be made by testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion and emphasized the necessity for keeping separate the two different types of character evidence permitted under the being reputation character evidence and opinion character evidence.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.in sum,reputation character evidence is that of the defendant reputation in the community for the character trait at issue,id.at,while opinion character evidence is elicited when a defendant character witness provides his or her own personal opinion of any facet of the defendant character,id.at.the district court also considered united states mason,cir,in which the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit held that a hypothetical is improper regardless of whether the government is a reputation or an opinion character witness.however,the district court declined to follow mason because it found the fourth circuit approach contrary to federal rule of evidence a and our decision in curtis.
as noted in the district court limiting instruction,there is a distinction between reputation character evidence and opinion character evidence.see curtis,at rule a has not effected a merger between reputation and opinion evidence.however,that distinction has not been significant to a majority of the courts of appeals that have addressed the propriety of hypotheticals.without necessarily distinguishing whether the issue involved an opinion witness or a reputation witness,those courts have broadly held such questions are improper.see united states shwayder,cir the prosecution use of hypothetical questions on of shwayder character witnesses constituted error.united states guzman,cir the government may not pose hypothetical questions that assume the guilt of the accused in the very case at bar.united states mason,cir hypotheticals are not proper and should not have been allowed united states oshatz,cir a hypothetical question based on the assumption of guilt should not be asked.internal quotation marks and citation omitted united states williams,cir we hold that permitting this line of hypotheticals over objection was error,and we see no reason to treat reputation and opinion witnesses differently in this regard.citation omitted united states mcguire,cir it would be error to allow the prosecution to ask the character witness to assume defendant guilt of the offenses for which he is then on trial.but see united states white,using hypotheticals during of character witnesses who give their own opinion of the defendant character is not error.generally,the reason given for these holdings is that a hypothetical impairs the presumption of innocence and thus violates the defendant due process rights.guzman,at mason,at oshatz,at shwayder,at williams,at.
a few courts have also noted that an alternative basis for holding hypotheticals are improper is that they are unfairly prejudicial to the defendant,oshatz,at,williams,at,which would indeed seem to follow necessarily from a conclusion that there had been a due process violation.the second circuit has acknowledged that a hypothetical may elicit evidence of some probative value,particularly when posed to an opinion character witness,since s teadfast adherence to a favorable opinion by a witness asked to assume the defendant guilt might provide some basis for concluding that the witness is simply supporting the defendant,rather than providing credible testimony about his character.oshatz,at.however,the court concluded that any probative value was outweighed by the risk that after a jury has repeatedly heard a prosecutor assure a trial judge that he has a good faith basis for asking permitted hypothetical questions,the jury might infer from the judge permission to ask a hypothetical question that the prosecutor has evidence of guilt beyond the evidence in the record.id.the seventh circuit also commented on the potentially prejudicial impact of a hypothetical,suggesting that such questions allow the prosecution to foist its theory of the case repeatedly on the jury.williams,at.
several other courts of appeals have had the opportunity to consider hypotheticals,but only in the context of reputation testimony,where such questions are uniformly held to be impermissible.see united states barta,cir united states polsinelli,cir united states,cir.these courts too have reasoned that allowing the prosecution to ask a question that assumes the defendant guilt would infringe upon the presumption of innocence.barta,at,at.the fifth circuit has provided the further persuasive explanation that a hypothetical can not sensibly be asked of a reputation witness because reputation testimony is based on what the witness heard in the community about the defendant,and o bviously the character witness had heard nothing in the community about the defendant post conviction reputation when he had been convicted of nothing whatsoever,at.
the district court did not err 
with these views of our sister circuits in mind,we turn to the main issue presented by kellogg arguments on appeal whether the government question to pennington was impermissible.the answer to that question turns on the meaningful distinction between reputation and opinion character witnesses we agree with the consensus of the courts of appeals that posing a hypothetical to a reputation character witness is improper.curtis,at a reputation witness can only be examined on matters reasonably proximate to the time of the alleged offense and likely to have been known to the relevant community at that time.because a reputation character witness,by definition,can only provide testimony about the defendant reputation in the community,a person testifying regarding the defendant reputation at the time of the crime can only speculate about how information regarding the crime would affect the community assessment of the defendant,and a witness speculation in that regard is of no probative value at all.
as to of opinion character witnesses,however,while we recognize that a question like the one posed by the government in this case may prove problematic if it arises in circumstances that implicate the presumption of innocence or otherwise undermine due process,such circumstances are a possibility and by no means a certainty.in our view,there is nothing inherent in hypotheticals,in the abstract,that makes them unfairly prejudicial,let alone so prejudicial as to constitute a per se violation of due process.we therefore see no need to adopt a rule prohibiting a potentially probative type of inquiry.generally speaking,a person testifying regarding a present opinion should be open to on how additional facts would affect that opinion.in the context of opinion character testimony about the charged crime tests both the witness bias and the witness own standards by asking whether the witness would retain a favorable opinion of the defendant even if the evidence at trial proved guilt.oshatz,at mukasey,concurring.such evidence may aid in the jury ultimate credibility determinations and in deciding how much weight to give to a defendant character evidence.
in this case,the district court did not err by permitting the government to pursue the challenged of pennington.united states palmere,cir a ny reversal here would have to rest on a determination that one asking of such questions hypotheticals constitutes plain error.we conclude that it does not.the parties agree that the question posed to pennington was relevant and its hypothetical nature was so emphasized as to allay any real concern about undermining the presumption of kellogg innocence.further,because it was but one question posed to one witness during the course of a trial,this is not a situation where kellogg was unfairly prejudiced by the prosecution repeatedly foist ing its theory of the case on the jury.williams,at.nor was this a scenario,such as the one contemplated in oshatz,where the jury repeatedly hear d the prosecutor assure the trial judge that he ha d a good faith basis for asking permitted hypothetical questions and thus infer red that the prosecutor ha d evidence of guilt beyond the evidence in the record.at.finally,while the asking of a hypothetical has been found to be reversible error when the case involved a swearing contest between the defendant and a key government witness,see,united states polsinelli,cir finding reversible error where the case was,in a sense,a situation,it was the word of the defendant against the word of mcfarland,the key government witness,that plainly was not the case here.to be clear,we are not suggesting,let alone holding,that hypotheticals can properly be asked of opinion character witnesses in every case.however,in light of the facts and circumstances of this case,the district court did not err by permitting the government of pennington with the hypothetical at issue 
ii.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence offered pursuant to rule b 
kellogg also argues that the district court erred by allowing the government to introduce certain evidence pursuant to federal rule of evidence b when considering the district court decisions on the admission of evidence,we review for abuse of discretion.united states jemal,cir.rule b is a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion.united states givan,cir citing jemal,at see also united states copple,cir proving specific intent in mail fraud cases is difficult,and,as a result,a liberal policy has developed to allow the government to introduce evidence that even peripherally bears on the question of intent.hence,t rial court rulings under rule b may be reversed only when they are clearly contrary to reason and not justified by the evidence.united states balter,cir citing united states bethancourt,cir,cert.denied,d citation omitted.similarly,in order to justify reversal of a district court balancing of probative and unfairly prejudicial qualities of evidence under rule,the district court analysis and resulting conclusion must be arbitrary or irrational.united states universal rehabilitation services pa,cir citation omitted.indeed,i f judicial is ever desirable,it is when a rule analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.id.citation omitted.given these standards,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in this case.
the district court admitted evidence that pa dep revoked johnston laboratories certification for testing drinking water.it also admitted the testimony of two former johnston laboratories employees regarding deficient procedures at johnston laboratories and it admitted evidence of certain misrepresentations kellogg made to pa dep.the challenged evidence was offered by the government as proof of kellogg knowledge and fraudulent intent,pursuant to rule b.we address each of those sets of evidence in turn.
a.the decertification evidence 
kellogg argues that the decertification evidence was irrelevant to the charges in this case,as it pertained only to johnston laboratories decertification for drinking water testing,as opposed to water testing.kellogg also argues that the evidence is impermissible under rule b because it is being offered for an improper purpose and not for one of the specific reasons articulated by the rule.
the decertification evidence was provided by james yoder and richard sheibley.yoder,an employee in the lab certification section of pa dep bureau of laboratories,testified as an expert in environmental lab certification and stated that he knew kellogg because johnston laboratories applied to be a certified lab in the pa dep drinking water program yoder conducted a february,inspection of johnston laboratories and wrote a report regarding that inspection on march,which he subsequently sent to kellogg.yoder provided detailed testimony on the numerous deviations set forth in his written report,including problems with the laboratory relating to voc analysis.
yoder returned to johnston laboratories for another inspection on january and,and prepared a february,report about that inspection that was also sent to kellogg.some of the deviations found during the february,inspection were not corrected and remained as deficiencies during the january inspection,particularly those related to quality control and quality assurance.the pa dep inspectors discussed these continuing deficiencies with kellogg.
richard sheibley,the chief of the pa dep laboratory accreditation program,testified as an expert on laboratory accreditation.sheibley knew about yoder inspection of johnston laboratories in february,and sheibley personally participated in the january and,inspection of johnston laboratories.he met with kellogg and other johnston laboratories employees to discuss the inspection procedure before the actual inspection on january.during the two day inspection,deviations were found.sheibley testified that the inspectors conducted an exit interview with kellogg during which they discussed the numerous deviations and required corrective actions.sheibley further testified that,due to the number of deviations found during the inspection,pa dep decided to decertify johnston laboratories,or,in other words,to remove it from the list of labs approved to do drinking water testing.
sheibley testified that the decision to decertify johnston laboratories was based,in part,on the need to protect the public health,safety and welfare.he stated that johnston laboratories did not follow its own required quality control procedures,that kellogg,as the laboratory supervisor,was responsible for assuring that johnston laboratories met the required quality assurance and regulatory criteria,and that kellogg ultimately failed in carrying out that responsibility.
the government gave pretrial notice of its intent to introduce evidence pursuant to rule b relating to the inspection of johnston laboratories conducted by pa dep in january,the subsequent revocation of johnston laboratories certification for testing drinking water,and johnston laboratories allegedly deficient laboratory practices.during a september,hearing,the district court held that this evidence was admissible.
with respect to the decertification evidence,the district court determined that the evidence was relevant to the government case pursuant to federal rules of evidence and,and that,under rule,the potential for unfair prejudice did not outweigh the probative value of the evidence.as to relevance,the district court stated 
the decertification gives the defendant evidence that something is wrong at johnston laboratories.if kellogg received that information and takes no affirmative action,a jury can,but does not have to,infer that the defendant intended to defraud.the jury can,although it does not have to,draw this inference.but if it can draw this inference,the evidence has relevance.appx.
the district court also agreed with the government argument that the decertification evidence was admissible to prove kellogg knowledge and intent.recognizing and applying the guidelines for admissibility under rule b set forth by the supreme court in huddleston united states,d,and conducting the necessary rule weighing,the district court reasoned as follows 
applying these guidelines to the facts of this case,the first prong,requiring other crimes evidence to have a proper purpose,here,the proper purpose is to establish the knowledge and intent of the defendant.
two,the proffered evidence must be relevant.well,it is relevant because the decertification gives the defendant evidence that something is wrong,and if he took no affirmative action,the jury could infer from that that he intended to defraud his customers.
the third guideline is that the probative value must outweigh its potential for unfair prejudice.the potential for prejudice is there only if the jury concludes that because defendant was negligent and he deceived the pa dep regarding the decertification for drinking water testing,therefore,he must have defrauded in the test results for the,which is the subject of this criminal action.t hat will be inappropriately concluding,in other words,that because he did something wrong in the past,he did something wrong presently.that would be unfair prejudice.and that potential is eliminated by complying with prong four,which is the giving of a limiting instruction.
so if we assume in the balancing test that a limiting instruction will be heard,understood and followed by the jury,then that will eliminate or diminish the potential for unfair prejudice to the degree that the relevance will outweigh any potential for unfair prejudice.
the district court analysis is sound.the rule b evidence showed that,in similar matters close in time to the charged conduct,kellogg acted deceitfully in the management of his business.in,after pa dep found numerous shortcomings at johnston laboratories,kellogg represented that the problems were corrected.these representations were proved false when pa dep conducted another inspection in january.the inadequacies at johnston laboratories were so significant that the laboratory was decertified in february.that kellogg deceived state inspectors was probative of his fraudulent intent.the district court properly applied the law,and its decision to admit the decertification evidence was well within the proper exercise of its discretion.
evidence of kellogg misrepresentations to pa dep 
the government also presented evidence of johnston laboratories lack of quality control,and kellogg misrepresentations to pa dep,through two former johnston laboratories andrae and stephen williams.kellogg objected to this evidence,stating that it was only being offered to prove his bad character,and again,not for any permissible purpose articulated by rule b.
andrae testified that certain quality assurance and quality control procedures must be followed to validate the data produced in the laboratory,and he also emphasized the importance of a quality assurance plan and a quality control plan in a laboratory,in general.andrae further testified that johnston laboratories had a quality assurance plan in effect in which was signed and approved by kellogg.andrae then testified about numerous aspects of the johnston laboratories quality assurance plan,written by kellogg,which were supposed to be followed but were not.
williams testified that kellogg hired him in for another of kellogg companies,spectra services,to perform underground storage tank removals and to serve as a project manager he further testified that he did not perform any services for johnston laboratories,nor did he have anything to do with quality assurance or quality control at johnston laboratories.despite the fact the williams had no responsibility for these matters at johnston laboratories,kellogg asked williams,just prior to the january pa dep inspection,whether he could put williams name down as the quality control officer on the list of positions at johnston laboratories.kellogg did not tell williams that kellogg planned to provide the positions list to pa dep,nor did williams give kellogg permission to so characterize him to pa dep.nevertheless,kellogg listed williams as the quality control officer in information he provided to pa dep,even though williams never performed any services in that capacity.
kellogg specifically objected to the government use of williams testimony at trial,arguing that the evidence violated rule b because it showed only bad character in that kellogg fraudulently listed williams as quality control officer in connection with a pa dep audit and was irrelevant to the charged conduct.the defense argued that the jury would impermissibly infer that,because kellogg made misrepresentations to pa dep,then he must have prepared fraudulent reports and made misrepresentations to johnston laboratories customers.after conducting a lengthy colloquy with government and defense counsel,the district court overruled the objection,first incorporating by reference the reasons articulated during the september,hearing on this issue,and then stating 
i did separately perform the balancing test required by,concerning today evidence 
because of the similarities of the extrinsic evidence to crimes charged there is a considerable amount of probative value.it is close in time to the charged offense,the charged offenses having allegedly taken place between april and july and the extrinsic evidence,here,having taken place in february.very shortly before the alleged crimes here.
also this is some fraud or alleged fraud or deception by the defendant in some totally unrelated matter,at some bank when he was trying to get a mortgage or bilking some investors who he was trying to bring into some investment scheme,none of which this defendant is charged with doing.
there is a very close nexus between the extrinsic evidence and the crimes charged here.there is a temporal connection,there is a subject matter connection,the same type of fraud or the fraud of listing someone as a quality control officer who was the quality control officer.
again,the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this evidence under rule b.the challenged evidence demonstrates that kellogg made material misrepresentations to pa dep when he identified williams as the quality assurance quality control officer,though williams,in fact,never held that position,and supports the government contention that kellogg was equally knowledgeable when,just months later,he began a lengthy course of misinforming customers that johnston laboratories was performing tests which it in fact did not have the capability to perform and had not subcontracted to anyone who could.during the relevant time period,kellogg made false statements in order to save his business,which is relevant to the charged conduct that he prepared and mailed false laboratory reports and billing statements to his customers.
in reaching its decision to admit the government rule b evidence,the district court conducted a careful analysis,more than once.it applied the proper guidelines under huddleston,at.at,and the law of this circuit to the facts before it,and undertook the appropriate balancing test under rule,see scarfo,at,each time kellogg raised an objection to the government rule b evidence.further,the district court provided the jury with explicit instructions defining the permissible and impermissible uses of the rule b evidence the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of fraudulent acts to prove later knowledge and intent in the charged offenses.
iii.sufficiency of the evidence 
finally,kellogg argues that his conviction is not supported by substantial evidence.we apply a particularly deferential standard of review when deciding whether a jury verdict rests on legally sufficient evidence.united states dent,cir citations omitted.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and will sustain the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reas
