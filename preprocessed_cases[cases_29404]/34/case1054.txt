solomon kaplan appeals from a judgment of conviction,entered following a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,on all seven counts of an indictment charging kaplan participation in an insurance fraud scheme counts one through five and kaplan interference with an investigation into that scheme counts six and seven.specifically,the indictment charged kaplan with one count of conspiracy in violation of count one two counts of mail fraud in violation of and counts two and three one count of making false statements in connection with health care matters in violation of and count four one count of health care fraud in violation of and count five one count of witness tampering in violation of b and count six and one count of making false statements to an agent of the federal bureau of investigation fbi in violation of count seven.
on appeal,kaplan principal contentions are that i his conviction on the insurance fraud counts counts one through five must be vacated because the district court erred in admitting a lay opinion testimony regarding his knowledge of the fraud and b testimony concerning others knowledge of the fraud and ii his conviction on the interference counts counts six and seven must be vacated because a the district court jury instruction on count six was erroneous in light of the supreme court supervening decision in arthur andersen llp united states,d b the district court improperly gave a conscious avoidance jury instruction on count six and c variance between a bill of particulars and proof at trial concerning count seven constituted a constructive amendment of the indictment or a prejudicial variance.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree that kaplan conviction on counts one through five must be vacated because the district court erred in admitting,without adequate foundation,lay opinion testimony regarding kaplan knowledge of the fraud and testimony regarding others knowledge of the fraud,and that at least the first of these errors was not harmless.however,we affirm his conviction on counts six and seven because these evidentiary errors were harmless as to those counts,which relied on strong independent evidence of the crimes charged in those counts,and because we find no merit in kaplan other arguments on appeal.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
viewed in the light most favorable to the government,see jackson virginia,d,the evidence showed the following.
josef sherman,a medical doctor,and his brother,yevgeny sherman,operated a medical clinic in brooklyn,new york the clinic.the clinic hired runners to recruit patients by staging automobile accidents and identifying individuals who had been in legitimate accidents but were willing to exaggerate their injuries.at the clinic,these accident participants received unnecessary treatment for their feigned injuries and were compensated with a kickback.the clinic then submitted fraudulent insurance claims for medical expenses to collect money under new york state insurance law.
the accident participants were also referred to a cooperating law office,which submitted on the participants behalf false or inflated insurance claims for bodily injury.from january until july,most of the clinic cases were referred to a law office the law office operated in the name of alexander galkovich,a lawyer hired by the shermans and their associate gennady gene medvedovsky to serve as counsel of record in the referred cases.the accident participants signed a retainer agreement providing that the law office received of any insurance settlement as well as expenses.medvedovsky,although not an attorney,managed the law office on behalf of the shermans through a management company called starlin executive management.galkovich paid almost all of the proceeds he received from the insurance company settlements to starlin management,and received per week as salary and occasional bonuses.the shermans and medvedovsky extracted the insurance proceeds from the law office principally by submitting to starlin management fraudulent bills from fictitious entities or by paying themselves salaries from starlin management.
by,the law office had more than active cases,and was receiving approximately to new cases per month,a significant portion of which came from the sherman clinic.approximately five to percent of the cases at the law office resulted from staged accidents,and to percent of the cases involved clients who exaggerated or faked the injuries.
in july,galkovich was arrested by the fbi and charged with filing false and fraudulent claims and coaching clients to lie to the insurance companies.because galkovich thus stood to lose his law license,the shermans and medvedovsky sought a replacement to serve as in the fraudulent cases.they settled on kaplan,with whom they were familiar because a few of the clinic cases had previously been referred to him.an employee of the clinic,alexander burman,testified that the cases referred to kaplan were those that had been rejected by other lawyers because they were considered too obviously fraudulent.
in september,kaplan began representing of galkovich clients.the shermans and medvedovsky,worried that the transfer of all cases from galkovich to kaplan would look suspicious,arranged for kaplan to formally purchase the law firm from galkovich.to make the deal appear legitimate,they hired a lawyer to draft a contract and conduct a closing,and kaplan wrote several checks to galkovich totaling,including a check at the closing.but at least some of the money came from the shermans and medvedovsky and was later returned to them by galkovich.thus,the shermans and medvedovsky essentially bought the law office from themselves,but structured the transaction to look as if kaplan had bought it from galkovich.
galkovich testified that on the way to the closing in october,kaplan and galkovich discussed the sale of the law office,and kaplan stated that he had handled cases like this before,which galkovich understood to mean that kaplan had previously handled fake accident cases.
the law office continued to operate much as it had before,with kaplan now formally representing almost all of galkovich clients.medvedovsky and others,including emik aguronov,who was responsible for drafting false medical narratives to be submitted to insurance companies on behalf of clients seeking settlements,remained.medvedovsky formed a new entity called prostaff support services,which performed the same functions that starlin management had.from october through march,the law office had revenues of approximately.the proceeds of the fraud were transferred to medvedovsky and the shermans through prostaff,which was paid over per month to manage the law office.kaplan received approximately in payments from the law office.
kaplan,the shermans,and medvedovsky all agreed that kaplan would stay away from the law office and appear only to sign checks and for essential meetings.a photograph of kaplan office at the law office,kaplan appointment book,and the testimony of fbi special agent rothe revealed that kaplan was rarely present at the law office.
following the sale of the law office to kaplan,galkovich began cooperating with the fbi.between approximately december,and february,galkovich recorded his conversations with the shermans,medvedovsky,and kaplan on approximately separate occasions.in addition to general discussions about the operations of the law office,the conversations recorded by galkovich detailed the efforts by the shermans,medvedovsky,and kaplan to prevent galkovich from cooperating with law enforcement authorities in its investigation of the sherman clinic and the law office.specifically,after galkovich informed his that he had been arrested and that the fbi had inquired about the shermans,a meeting was arranged with galkovich on january.medvedovsky told galkovich that the purpose of the meeting was to sit down and decide everything about galkovich case.josef sherman and gene medvedovsky initially met with galkovich alone and questioned him about the statement he had given to the fbi at the time of his arrest.later,at galkovich request,kaplan joined the meeting,and galkovich told kaplan that they needed to discuss the transition of my practice to yours and this thing that i going to need for possibly for court or possibly for the disciplinary committee.medvedovsky,sherman,and kaplan suggested a variety of false stories to explain the law office transfer.
in march,kaplan,the shermans,and medvedovsky were arrested by the fbi.immediately following his arrest,kaplan agreed to be interviewed by the fbi.during that interview,kaplan made a number of statements that the government contends were false,including that in august he was introduced to galkovich and medvedovsky by a vladimir scheckman that,as part of his purchase of the law office,he was to receive only files that he did not recall who gave him the check used to purchase the law office that the law office was sold to him for that he was assured by medvedovsky and galkovich that the charges against galkovich meant nothing because galkovich had done nothing wrong that he just stopped by the january meeting between galkovich,medvedovsky,and sherman without planning in advance to participate and that he did not take the conversation on january seriously and they were just joking around.
in august,josef sherman,eugene sherman,and medvedovsky pled guilty to a information charging them with conspiracy,mail fraud,and witness tampering.kaplan was tried on the indictment against him described above.after an approximately trial,the jury found kaplan guilty on all counts.in august,the district court sentenced kaplan principally to months of imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and in restitution,but granted bail pending appeal pursuant to b.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
counts one through five the insurance fraud scheme 
turning first to the insurance fraud counts counts one through five,kaplan argues on appeal,among other things,that his conviction must be vacated because the district court erred in admitting a lay opinion testimony regarding his knowledge of the fraud and b testimony concerning others knowledge of the fraud.we consider each of his arguments in turn.
admission of galkovich lay opinion testimony 
the first issue before us concerns the district court admission of lay opinion testimony regarding kaplan knowledge of the fraud.kaplan principally objects to two colloquies in which galkovich recounted a conversation he and kaplan had as they drove together to the meeting in october to finalize the sale of the law office to kaplan.after describing the conversation,galkovich was allowed to offer his lay opinion testimony regarding kaplan knowledge of the fraud.first,on direct examination,galkovich testified as follows 
prosecutor did you have any discussions in the car ride on the way to davis office 
galkovich yes.it was actually the first time we really talked,me and solomon kaplan.and i asked him,what do you do what kind of work do you do are you familiar with car accident cases,with the process of settlement and what it takes to settle and he explained,yes he has handled cases like this before.yes,he has settled cases before.
he explained that he has experience with these kinds of cases.
prosecutor what did you understand him to mean when he said these kinds of cases 
defense counsel objection.
the court i will allow it.
galkovich that he understood that these were car accident cases where people exaggerated their injuries,where it was crucial to have a narrative report that exaggerated the injuries,that these reports were bought for the best of prices to get the best of reports and that you could settle these cases for very good money in a short period of time.
joint appendix ja.then,on redirect,galkovich elaborated 
prosecutor what happened in this conversation 
galkovich i asked him what experience he had with the car accident cases and generally what kind of experience he had,and he told me that he knew about these car accidents,he knew how to handle these cases,he knew how to maximize potential recoveries,and what is supposed to be in the files,how they are supposed to be worked up.
prosecutor what was your purpose in asking kaplan this question 
galkovich i wanted to know how much he knew about the fraudulent office that he is participating in.
prosecutor and after you got this answer from kaplan,what did you think 
galkovich i think he knew exactly what he was getting into.
we review a district court decision to admit evidence,including lay opinion testimony,for abuse of discretion.see united states yuri garcia,cir citing old chief united states,d.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir footnotes omitted.
the federal rules of evidence,in a sharp departure from the common law,see asplundh div.benton harbor eng g,cir becker,permit lay witnesses to testify in the form of opinions to address a problem identified by judge learned hand many years ago 
every judge of experience in the trial of causes has again and again seen the whole story garbled,because of insistence upon a form with which the witness can not comply,since,like most men,he is unaware of the extent to which inference enters into his perceptions.he is telling the facts in the only way that he knows how,and the result of nagging and checking him is often to choke him altogether,which is,indeed,usually its purpose.
central of monahan,cir see also yuri garcia,at eyewitnesses sometimes find it difficult to describe the appearance or relationship of persons,the atmosphere of a place,or the value of an object by reference only to objective facts.accordingly,rule of the federal rules of evidence was adopted to accommodate and ameliorate these difficulties by permitting lay witnesses,in appropriate circumstances,to testify in language with which they are comfortable.jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence joseph mclaughlin,ed.
but to ensure that lay opinion testimony is reliable and does not usurp the jury role as,rule imposes certain foundation requirements that must be satisfied if such testimony is to be admitted 
if the witness is not testifying as an expert,the witness testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are a rationally based on the perception of the witness,b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.
in interpreting these requirements,we have observed that a the requirement is the familiar requirement of knowledge or observation,united states rea,cir quoting.advisory committee note on proposed rules b the helpfulness requirement is principally designed to provide assurance against the admission of opinions which would merely tell the jury what result to reach,id.quoting.advisory committee note on proposed rules and c the not based on specialized knowledge requirement requires that a lay opinion must be the product of reasoning processes familiar to the average person in everyday life,yuri garcia,at see also.advisory committee note on amendments.
the government evidence failed to demonstrate that galkovich lay opinion testimony was rationally based on the perception of the witness.fed evid.a.we note that rule a requires that lay opinion testimony be both a based on the witness perceptions and b rationally derived from those perceptions.
as to the first of these requirements,rule a reflects,in part,the rules more general requirement that a witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.see also united states durham,cir opinion testimony of lay witnesses must be predicated upon concrete facts within their own observation and is facts perceived from their own senses,as distinguished from their opinions or conclusions drawn from such facts internal quotation marks omitted.when galkovich was asked to articulate the basis for his opinion,he answered,i based it on the only thing i could base it on,which is my experience there,what people said about kaplan,my conversation with kaplan,everything that i had been involved in.that what my opinion could be based on.ja.although galkovich asserts that his testimony was based in part on his prior experiences at the law office and his conversation with response was extremely vague.thus,galkovich testimony failed to show that his opinion as to kaplan knowledge was rationally based on facts he had observed.
we are therefore unable to conclude,as we must under rule,that the opinion he offered was rationally based on his own perceptions.see rea,at when a witness has not identified the objective bases for his opinion,the proffered opinion obviously fails completely to meet the requirements of rule because there is no way for the court to assess whether it is rationally based on the witness perceptions.we applied this requirement to similar facts in rea,and observed that lay opinion testimony regarding a defendant knowledge will,in most cases,only satisfy the requirement if the witness has personal knowledge of one or more objective factual bases from which it is possible to infer with some confidence that a person knows a given fact includ ing what the person was told directly,what he was in a position to see or hear,what statements he himself made to others,conduct in which he engaged,and what his background and experience were.at.because the government did not lay an adequate foundation,galkovich testimony expressing his opinion as to kaplan knowledge was not admissible.
accordingly,having found that galkovich lay opinion testimony does not satisfy rule,we conclude that the district court erred in admitting it.
admission of galkovich additional testimony regarding his and others knowledge 
kaplan asserts that it was error for the district court to admit galkovich additional testimony regarding galkovich and others knowledge of the fraud as circumstantial evidence of kaplan knowledge.specifically,galkovich was permitted to testify that when he first saw the building in which the law office was located,he thought,t his is where i am going to get arrested,ja everyone he spoke with told him not to buy the law office,ja the fraud was done very subtly because this whole industry was a very big sham and it was big lies,ja the fraud was not discussed explicitly because it was kind of like hear no evil,see no evil,and he was warned to be very careful in what you say,ja e veryone knew what was going on,but you do say it,ja at a christmas party at the law office,eugene sherman read a poem about clients getting paid for sham injuries,ja and steven rosenberg,a lawyer at the law office,quit because he saw a file with blatant fraud,ja,and michael brummer,another lawyer at the law office,was very sensitive and nervous about what was going on in the office and was always very nervous when we were skirting the issue of fraud,ja.
as previously noted,we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see yuri garcia,at citing old chief,at.kaplan argues that the district court abused its discretion because the evidence was irrelevant and should have been excluded under.or,in the alternative,that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should have been excluded under.the government argues that the testimony was relevant to the question of whether kaplan was aware of the fraud because evidence that the fraud was obvious and tended to make it more probable that kaplan also knew about it.as the prosecutor argued to the jury,kaplan had to know.everybody else did.
the parties vigorously dispute which of two states patrisso,cir,and united states schultz,cir controls this case.in patrisso,a truckload of television tubes was hijacked patrisso,who knew they were stolen,sold them to ellis,who also knew ellis,in turn,sold them to postrel finally,postrel sold of them to defendant mankes.at.we reversed mankes conviction,finding that the district court had erred by,inter alia,allowing the government to introduce postrel knowledge of the theft without evidence that postrel,or anyone else,had communicated that fact to mankes.id.at.over four decades later,in schultz,we distinguished patrisso in upholding the admission of testimony regarding other individuals knowledge of a particular egyptian law to prove the defendant knowledge of the law,finding that it was relevant both to explain the practice of the industry in which this prosecution arose and to establish what someone with defendant extended background in the industry probably would know.at quoting united states leo,cir.
we believe that patrisso and schultz,though they reach different outcomes,stand for the same principle evidence regarding the knowledge of individuals other than the defendant should be admitted only if there is some other evidence in the,for example,the nature of the fraud or the relationship of the which to conclude that the defendant would have the same knowledge.indeed,the schultz court noted that the principal difference between the two cases was the nature of the knowledge involved schultz was likely to have the same knowledge,the defendant in patrisso was.at.what of kaplan 
we turn first to relevance.relevant evidence includes any evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.see also.implicit in that definition are two distinct requirements t he evidence must be probative of the proposition it is offered to prove,and the proposition to be proved must be one that is of consequence to the determination of the action.united states diaz,cir.as the supreme court has observed,t he rules basic standard of relevance is a liberal one.daubert merrell dow,d.despite this liberal standard,we think this evidence had little relevance in the circumstances of kaplan case.evidence of others knowledge would have been highly relevant had it been supplemented by evidence supporting the conclusion that such knowledge was communicated to kaplan,or that kaplan had been exposed to the same sources from which these others derived their knowledge of the fraud.in the absence of such evidence,the relevance of others knowledge was at best minimal in proving kaplan knowledge.
nor does our inquiry end as to evidence that is plainly relevant,the trial judge retains discretion to exclude the evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.this evidence was of minimal probative value for two reasons.first,as noted,the government failed to offer evidence that would connect the third parties knowledge of the fraud to kaplan.under the government own theory of the case,kaplan spent very little time at the law office and reviewed very few claims directly.moreover,the government proffered no evidence that anyone who allegedly was aware of the fraudulent scheme actually had communicated his knowledge to kaplan.in fact,galkovich testified that the participants in the fraud were careful not to speak openly about the fraudulent nature of the injury claims he testified that clients did not directly admit to the firm that their accidents were staged,but rather that generally it was done very subtly,and that he did not have explicit conversations about the fraud with clients or other people in the office because you do want to get in trouble it is kind of like,you know,hear no evil,see no evil everyone knew what was going on,but you do say it.this was not an office where the illegal nature of the business was necessarily visible and audible to everyone who worked there.in that sense,we think this case is more analogous to patrisso than to schultz as in patrisso,the government failed to offer evidence that would explain how defendant kaplan would have obtained the third parties knowledge of the criminal scheme.
second,much of the testimony concerning knowledge of the fraud was so speculative or flawed in other respects that it had little or no probative value.for example,the government did not lay a proper foundation for galkovich statement that it was his understanding that this whole business was very whole industry was a very big sham and it was big lies galkovich was not qualified as one having special knowledge of the personal injury industry,so it is difficult to see how galkovich had sufficient knowledge of the industry to testify competently on its criminal nature.see.a witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.woodman,cir affirming district court decision to exclude plaintiff testimony that her age was well known throughout the industry on ground that plaintiff was hardly competent to testify to how others in the broadcast community perceived her age citing.galkovich testimony concerning the alleged knowledge of rosenberg,another lawyer in the office,was hearsay upon hearsay rosenberg allegedly made statements to a secretary in the office,who allegedly told galkovich,who offered the jury the conclusion that rosenberg had quit his job because of fraud.brown keane,cir an assertion of fact based on conjecture and surmise,to which the declarant would not be allowed to testify if called to the witness box,does not become admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.
we conclude,furthermore,that this limited probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.although relevant evidence is always prejudicial to one side,we conclude that the risk of unfair prejudice particular,the likelihood that jurors would render a decision on an improper basis by giving this testimony undue weight or improperly holding kaplan liable because they believed he should have known of the great.the jury was required to draw a series of inferences,unsupported by other evidence,to connect galkovich testimony about his guilty knowledge and that of others to kaplan own knowledge,the ultimate issue in the case.under the circumstances,the district court should have concluded that whatever slight probative value the testimony might have had was outweighed by the risk that the jury would draw improper inferences from the testimony.united states ravich,cir friendly,the length of the chain of inferences necessary to connect the evidence with the ultimate fact to be proved necessarily lessens the probative value of the evidence,and may therefore render it more susceptible to exclusion as unduly confusing,prejudicial,or.moreover,galkovich testimony that the entire industry in which kaplan operated was a very big sham and it was big lies was so inflammatory that it should have been excluded as prejudicial under the circumstances.furthermore,the likelihood of prejudice was increased by the government improper use of the evidence of others knowledge.in summation,the prosecutor argued,kaplan had to know.everybody else did.as noted,the evidence did not support any such inference.
accordingly,with respect to galkovich testimony regarding his and others knowledge of the fraud,we conclude that the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the limited probative value,and hold that the district court erred in receiving this evidence.
harmless error analysis 
we will reverse on account of these evidentiary errors only if they affect substantial rights.see.a.a yuri garcia,at.in kotteakos united states,the supreme court set forth the analysis for determining whether a error is harmless 
if,when all is said and done,the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury,or had but very slight effect,the verdict and the judgment should stand,except perhaps where the departure is from a constitutional norm or a specific command of congress but if one can not say,with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.the inquiry can not be merely whether there was enough to support the result,apart from the phase affected by the error.it is rather,even so,whether the error itself had substantial influence.if so,or if one is left in grave doubt,the conviction can not stand.
footnote omitted see also united states dukagjini,cir holding that error affects substantial rights if it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.but we are not required to conclude that it could not have had any effect whatever the error is harmless if we can conclude that that testimony was unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question,as revealed in the record.rea,at quoting yates evatt,d.in conducting this inquiry,we principally consider the overall strength of the prosecution case the prosecutor conduct with respect to the improperly admitted evidence the importance of the wrongly admitted testimony and whether such evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.zappulla new york,cir.
applying these factors,it is clear that galkovich lay opinion testimony may have substantially swayed,kotteakos,at,the jury verdict on counts one through five because it was not unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question.the government case on those five counts rested principally on the following evidence the recorded conversations during which kaplan,sherman,and medvedovsky told galkovich to lie,kaplan sham purchase of the law office,kaplan disinterest in cases filed by the law office in his name,kaplan absence from the law office,the arrangement between the law office and prostaff and medvedovsky,kaplan receipt of over for his limited services at the law office,and his false statements upon his arrest.although the government may,of course,prove its case exclusively with such circumstantial evidence,their case with respect to those counts was not strong.
as a result,and because kaplan knowledge of the fraud was the central disputed issue in the case,galkovich lay opinion testimony was vitally the sort of evidence that might well sway a jury confronted with a marginal circumstantial case.our concern is heightened by the government trial strategy with respect to the evidence the government repeatedly called the jury attention to galkovich lay opinion testimony.in its opening statement,the government told the jury that galkovich will recount for you conversations he had with kaplan during the sale in which they discussed the fraudulent nature of the law practice.in its closing,the government reminded the jury that galkovich explained to you that that conversation,and kaplan comments,satisfied galkovich that kaplan understood all about the fraud,and that w e know from the testimony of the witnesses,that solomon kaplan knew,undeniably knew,about the fraud at the law firm.in rebuttal,the government stated that kaplan essentially admitted to galkovich that he knew what was going on at this law office.that was how galkovich understood what he said.it is not his opinion.he was there.he had the conversation.and,finally,we observe that this evidence was unique and thus was not cumulative of properly admitted evidence.
because we can not,in light of the foregoing,say with fair assurance that galkovich lay opinion testimony did not substantially sway the jury verdict as to counts one,two,three,four,and five,we conclude that this error was not harmless and therefore vacate kaplan conviction on those counts.
ii.counts six and seven interfering with the investigation 
we turn next to kaplan arguments challenging his conviction for interfering with the investigation by tampering with a witness count six and giving false statements to the fbi count seven.he argues on appeal,among other things,that his conviction on those two counts must be vacated due to the district court witness tampering and conscious avoidance jury instructions and a constructive amendment of,or prejudicial variance from,the indictment,as clarified by a bill of particulars we address his arguments in turn.
witness tampering jury instruction 
kaplan contends that the district court jury instruction on count six,alleging witness tampering,is deficient in light of the supreme court decision in arthur andersen llp united states,d,decided after his conviction.
kaplan made no objection to this aspect of the jury instruction.therefore,we review his argument under the plain error standard of.b.we have ruled that when the claim of error derives from a supervening decision altering a settled rule of law in the circuit,as it does here,the claimed error should be assessed under a standard of modified.see united states viola,cir.ordinarily,the defendant asserting plain error bears the burden of persuasion as to prejudice,but under our modified review,the government bears that burden.see id.at.in this case it makes no difference whether the standard applied is the conventional or the modified plain error standard because any error in the charge was inconsequential and did not rise to the level of either standard 
count six alleges violations of b and b,which provide that 
b whoever knowingly uses intimidation,threatens or corruptly persuades another person,or attempts to do so,or engages in misleading conduct toward another person,with intent to 
influence,delay or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding 
hinder,delay,or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense or a violation of conditions of probation,supervised release,parole,or release pending judicial proceedings 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
in arthur andersen,the supreme court found the district court instructions were deficient in two failed to convey the requirements of b of mens rea and nexus to an official proceeding.as to the first of these deficiencies,the district court in arthur andersen instructed the jury that it could convict arthur andersen of witness tampering in relation to an official proceeding if it found that arthur andersen intended to subvert,undermine,or impede governmental factfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforce the document retention policy,and that even if arthur andersen honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful,you may find arthur andersen guilty.at.these instructions,the supreme court held,did not properly convey the mens rea required for a violation of b they diluted the meaning of corruptly so that it covered innocent conduct,o nly persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to knowingly corruptly persuad e,id.emphasis supplied.
as to the second the nexus requirement the supreme court in arthur andersen found the instructions deficient because a knowingly corrup t persuade r can not be someone who persuades others to shred documents under a document retention policy when he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which those documents might be material,id.at,and the district court instructions led the jury to believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the persua sion to destroy documents and any particular proceeding,id.at.united states arthur andersen,cir reciting district court charge in arthur andersen defining official proceeding.instead,a knowingly corrupt persuader must believe that his actions are likely to affect a particular,existing or foreseeable official proceeding.see arthur andersen,at.see also united states quattrone,cir holding that arthur andersen requires that there be some nexus between the effort to tamper pertaining to the relevant proceeding and awareness that such conduct was likely to affect the proceeding.
kaplan contends that the district court instructions in this case are similarly deficient.the district court instructed the jury on count six as follows 
the first element the government must prove is that the defendant corruptly persuaded a person,or attempted to do so.
the word corruptly simply means having an improper purpose.an intent to subvert or undermine the factfinding ability of an official proceeding is an improper purpose 
the second element that the government must prove is that the defendant acted knowingly and with the specific intent to influence the testimony of another person in an official federal proceeding.
an act is done knowingly if it is done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.
by specific intent,i meant that the defendant must have acted knowingly and with the unlawful intent to influence the testimony of another person in an official federal proceeding or to hinder,delay or prevent the communication to a federal law enforcement officer or judge information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense.
applying the lessons of arthur andersen,we find that the charge adequately conveyed the statute mens rea requirement.viewing the charge as whole,the district court conveyed the substantial equivalent of arthur andersen holding that the defendant must be conscious of wrongdoing by instructing the jury to convict only if it found that the defendant acted with an improper purpose and acted knowingly and with the unlawful intent to influence the testimony.we note that the supreme court in arthur andersen expressly faulted the jury instructions in that case for specifying that the jury could convict if it found that arthur andersen intended to subvert,undermine,or impede emphasis added because impede has broader connotations than subvert or even undermine,and many of these connotations do not incorporate any corruptness at all,at.brackets omitted,and instructing the jury that even if arthur andersen honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful,you may find arthur andersen guilty,id.at.the district court here charged nothing of the sort.to convict,the jury had to find that kaplan acted with an improper purpose and with unlawful intent.
second,with regard to kaplan argument that the district court instructions were erroneous in light of arthur andersen discussion of the statute nexus requirement,we note first that the charges in arthur andersen were brought under two clauses of b,both of which explicitly include as an element that the obstruction or tampering relate to an official proceeding,see id.at.kaplan,however,was charged under b and.with respect to b,it is unclear whether arthur andersen nexus requirement is applicable because b does not explicitly refer to an official proceeding.see united states byrne,cir.we need not decide this issue,because even if the nexus requirement is applicable to prosecutions under b,and the district court instructions under b were erroneous for failure to discuss nexus,any such error was harmless in the circumstances of this case for the reasons discussed below.
kaplan was,as noted,also charged under b,which does contain an explicitly stated element of an official proceeding.the jury instructions on this charge undoubtedly needed to comply with the nexus requirement discussed in arthur andersen.the district court instructed the jury that the government must prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent to influence the testimony of another person in an official federal proceeding.the instructions did not identify the official proceeding.in view of the supreme court discussion in arthur andersen,at.finding the instructions infirm because they led the jury to believe that it did not have to find any nexus between the persuasion to destroy documents and any particular proceeding,it would surely have been more prudent,even where the evidence only points to one federal proceeding,for the district judge to identify the particular federal proceeding that the defendant intended to obstruct.we need not decide whether the failure to do so in this case was error,because as we note below,it was harmless in any event.
furthermore,in quattrone,at,the district court,following the supreme court formulation of the nexus requirement in united states aguilar,d,described ne
