on november,at approximately,noiyota swinson and ann depolo arrived at logan airport on a flight originating in jamaica.customs officials observed swinson place two pieces of checked luggage on depolo luggage cart,and became suspicious when the two women then went in separate directions.when individually interrogated,swinson and depolo initially denied traveling together.the customs agents then opened the women luggage,revealing shampoo bottles containing more than kilograms of cocaine.upon further interrogation,swinson and depolo separately stated that they were planning to meet a black man known as whoopy in a black lexus or bmw outside the international terminal.swinson had a piece of paper with a phone number in her possession at the time of her apprehension.
when customs officials went outside the terminal,they observed campbell,a black male,in a black bmw.campbell,at the request of the customs officials,accompanied them into the international arrivals building.he stated that he was there to meet a friend,who was purportedly arriving on an flight,outside the klm ticket counter.the customs officials soon ascertained that there was no such incoming flight.when told that he was possibly implicated in a seizure of drugs from two women who had just arrived from jamaica,campbell denied knowing the women.but while he was being interviewed,the door to one of the search rooms opened and swinson and depolo positively identified the defendant as whoopy and as the person who had provided them with the shampoo bottles and their tickets to and from jamaica.an interrogating agent asked campbell for his pager number,which matched the number on the piece of paper in swinson possession.in addition,although campbell denied going by the name whoopy,he had a note in his possession addressed to whops.
although campbell was not detained at the airport,a grand jury subsequently returned a superseding indictment,charging him with the three counts on which,after a trial,he was ultimately convicted to months imprisonment,to be served concurrently,followed by months supervised release.the defendant appealed both his convictions and his sentence.
campbell maintains that the district court improperly allowed the jury to consider statements made by unindicted coconspirators who were unavailable to testify at trial.pursuant to.d e,a statement made by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not considered hearsay,and may be considered by the jury for the truth of the matter asserted.because of concerns about the reliability of these statements,however,the supreme court in bourjaily united states,d,announced that,prior to admitting a coconspirator statement over an objection,a court must be satisfied that the statement actually falls within the definition of the rule,meaning that t here must be evidence that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the party,and that the statement was made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.at.the party wishing to offer these statements to the jury must first demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements fall within the purview of the rule.see id.at.see also id.at.noting that preliminary questions concerning the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court,and the existence of a conspiracy is one such preliminary question quoting.a.district courts in this circuit,guided by united states petrozziello,cir,which was decided prior to,but consistently with the supreme court pronouncement in bourjaily,make these preliminary determinations regarding the admissibility of coconspirator statements during petrozziello hearings.
because the defendant failed to object to the district court ultimate determination that the statements were,in fact,declarations by a coconspirator,we review the district court decision for clear error.see united states,cir.during swinson testimony,but prior to the issue being raised formally by the defendant,the trial judge explained to counsel at a sidebar conference how he would proceed in deciding any questions regarding coconspirator statements 
now,at this point,my attention has not been called,i believe to any coconspirator statement that will make it necessary for me to have such a hearing.i do know whether it will or not,but in any event,on the basis of the evidence i have heard thus far,the proffer suggested in the government opening statement,it appears to me very likely,most probable,that if i hold a petrozziello hearing,it will support findings by a preponderance of the evidence which is a standard i am supposed to use in making the findings of conspiracy.so unless you can call my attention to some particular problem that i am not aware of,i think the appropriate thing for me to do is to receive in this evidence over objection at this point.
see trans.vol.afternoon at.as demonstrated by this excerpt from the transcript,the trial judge correctly anticipated this issue and demonstrated his awareness of the appropriate legal standard for making his determination.
when swinson began to recount for the jury the statements made to her by corey,an alleged coconspirator with the defendant the government made the following proffer in response to defendant objection 
respectfully,this statement is being offered as a coconspirator declaration under federal rules of evidence d e,corey is a coconspirator,and the court has already heard testimony that corey instructed the girls at wollaston beach they were bringing back flav in conjunction with whoppy sic,and we would submit that this is a probative statement.it is being offered for the truth of the matter asserted as a coconspirator declaration.
id.at.at that point,the trial court announced that it had already heard enough to have a view that it is more likely than not after i have heard all the evidence and hold a petrozziello hearing,that i will make findings that this is admissible as that sic coconspirator statement id.consequently,the judge lifted the limiting instruction that he had previously given to the jury regarding the consideration of this testimony.when swinson testified regarding statements made by carl,dred,and culture,who were also alleged conspiracy participants residing in jamaica,the defendant renewed his objection and again requested a limiting instruction.the trial court,however,accepted the government argument that these statements were also covered by rule d e,and told counsel,if you see a problem that i have not ruled on,you may let me know.see trans.vol.at.upon the conclusion of the evidence,and after charging the jury,the trial judge reiterated his decision to admit the coconspirator testimony without limitation,and confirmed with counsel that a formal petrozziello hearing would not be necessary 
as explained in united states ortiz,cir,the jurisprudence of our circuit requires that the district court make its petrozziello determination at the close of all the evidence.id.at quoting united states ciampaglia,cir,cert.denied,d.howe
