bobbi jo barker tipped off the police that her boyfriend,michael lovely,was engaged with ryan butterworth in a drug trafficking partnership carried on from an apartment shared by lovely and butterworth in westbrook,maine.agents searched trash bags outside the building,found evidence of drugs,obtaining a the apartment,finding bags of marijuana and crack and a scale bearing drug residue.
the two men were indicted for federal drug offenses and a joint trial began in federal district court in maine.after the first day,lovely changed his plea to guilty and butterworth moved for a mistrial the district court instead offered a curative instruction to the jury.the evidence at trial against butterworth was presented through the agents who had conducted the trash pull and search,and through witnesses who had observed or participated in the drug dealing.
the latter included destiny doucette,a former fianc√©e of lovely adam ruffino,a high school student and customer of butterworth barker,who had initially alerted the authorities and fred mcmann,a subordinate participant in the conspiracy who testified pursuant to a plea bargain.these witnesses testified to seeing the drugs in the westbrook apartment,to observing or participating in sales made by butterworth and to further details concerning the venture.
less forthcoming testimony was presented through crystal alexander,a of butterworth.alexander had testified before the grand jury as to the workings of the operation and butterworth central role in it,based on her firsthand observations of the drugs and transactions.at trial,under arrest as a material witness and testifying under a compulsion order,she was much less cooperative and her grand jury testimony was used by the prosecution both to refresh and as evidence.
butterworth was convicted on two drug trafficking counts possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and marijuana,and conspiracy to do the same.a.based on the quantities of drugs involved and a prior drug conviction,he was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of months in prison.id.b b.he now appeals,challenging both the convictions and the sentence.
butterworth first objects to the trial court decision to allow alexander grand jury testimony to be read into the record,arguing that this violated federal evidence rules and the sixth amendment confrontation clause.the former,with exceptions,bar as hearsay statements made by the declarant outside the courtroom.the hearsay rationale is thin where the declarant is now present and can be but traditionally the hearsay label still attaches absent an exception.
the confrontation clause,protecting the right to confront witnesses,was not traditionally viewed as a bar to hearsay testimony but in recent years the supreme court has invoked it to preclude the use of testimonial statements unless the absent declarant is unavailable and the defense had a previous opportunity for.crawford washington,d.the hearsay and confrontation bars often overlap but are not.
the district court determined that alexander grand jury testimony was not hearsay under the federal definition,which excepts a statement if t he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to concerning the statement,and the statement is a inconsistent with the declarant testimony,and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial,hearing,or other proceeding,or in a deposition.d.
statements made before a grand jury are given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial,hearing,or other proceeding.see united states hemmer,cir,cert.denied,d.so the issue is whether alexander grand jury testimony was inconsistent with her trial testimony.consistency is necessarily a matter of degree so long as people speak in nonmathematical languages such as english.united states williams,cir,cert.denied,d.
before the grand jury,alexander testified that butterworth sold weed and crack or whatever it was.she described the partnership formation to foot more and make more her encouragement of butterworth to sell crack because that where all the money is and her discovery that he had begun to do so,by his admission and the large sums he made.the crack was supplied by a man known alternatively as x,xavier,and,whom alexander had met ten,times.
according to alexander,butterworth would meet the supplier in private,but would return with a quarter of a quarter ounce.alexander claimed that butterworth had boasted of earning like,bucks a night selling to customers in the same building.she agreed with the government description of pretty constant traffic through the apartment and acknowledged witnessing the sales.
at trial,alexander contradicted her grand jury testimony on some ten example,as to how much money butterworth had a little money how many times she had met the crack supplier known as x three,four times how much crack butterworth would receive not very much how frequent the sales were few times but on each occasion the prosecutor would ask her to refresh her recollection by examining the grand jury transcript.
although alexander would then somewhat reluctantly adopt her earlier grand jury answers,her trial testimony was peppered with claims that she did not know or could not remember the answers she gave to the grand jury.for example,when asked how much money butterworth had earned from his crack dealing,she replied i do know,bucks.i have no idea.when asked how much marijuana butterworth supplier would deliver per visit,she responded i do know exactly.quite a bit i do remember,couple of ounces.
further,she repeatedly denied remembering what she had told the grand jury i guess if that what i said,then that what i said.i do remember what i said before at all t hat why i have to keep reading that thing.under,alexander claimed that she had been under the influence of drugs when she testified to the grand jury.in response to a defense question she agreed that she could even vouch for what she said at the grand jury.
alexander trial testimony does not contradict her grand jury testimony in every respect,but testimony need not be diametrically opposed or logically incompatible to be considered inconsistent under the rule.williams,at.even evasive answers or silence can be enough,united states dennis,cir,as can claimed memory loss,united states distler,cir,cert.denied,d particularly if the judge senses a reluctance to testify honestly,united states mornan,cir,as was plainly the case here.
the reason for so reading the rule is apparent.prior testimony given under oath is relative to unsworn statements comparatively reliable but,where the witness is present at trial,consistent and forthcoming,the testimony is preferred.where instead the witness contradicts the prior testimony or purports no longer to remember because of friendship or prior testimony is no longer redundant the witness can still be questioned in court about its accuracy and the balance favors its admission 
there is one other wrinkle.some of the grand jury testimony was heard when the government sought to refresh alexander memory on,but the grand jury transcript itself was formally read into the record on government motion after she had stepped down.butterworth says that she was therefore not subject to concerning the statement s as required by the evidence rule because they were not admitted until after she left the stand.
this gist of this argument is virtually the same as butterworth confrontation clause claim,and they can be considered together.under modern supreme court precedent,admitting an statement does not violate the clause when the declarant appears for at trial,crawford,at,because the constitution requires only an opportunity for full and effective.california green,d.
here,alexander was present at trial and was available for for the defense.the subject matter of the grand jury testimony was the focus of the government direct examination,and the defense was free to cover the same subject matter on and did so.this is not a case where the defense has a legitimate claim of surprise.accord alexander conveyors dumpers,cir.nor did the defense ask that alexander be recalled when the grand jury testimo
