two police officers,in a marked patrol cruiser,closely followed a car from a public road onto private property,and then blocked the car exit.the officers observed no traffic violation.the only assertedly suspicious activity they saw was the car presence in a neighborhood with tags.these facts alone led the officers to suspect that the car occupants,four african american men,were involved in drug trafficking.immediately after the driver,frederick jones,exited his car,the officers approached him and asked that he lift his shirt,which he did.the officers then asked him to consent to a pat down search,which he did.
after neither the shirt lift nor the search revealed anything,the officers discovered that jones had committed a traffic violation,and so detained him.subsequently,they found he possessed a firearm and a small quantity of marijuana.the district court denied jones motion to suppress this evidence,reasoning that the initial encounter prior to the discovery of the traffic violation was consensual and therefore did not infringe on jones fourth amendment rights.because a reasonable person in jones position would not have felt free to terminate the initial encounter with the officers,we must reverse.
the parties do not seriously dispute the facts of this case.during the early evening of august,detective edward aeschlimann and his partner,officer adrienne rice,were patrolling the block of afton avenue in richmond,virginia.aeschlimann patrolled this area as part of the focus mission team to interdict illegal drugs and firearms and deter robberies and burglaries.he had been on this assignment for six months and had been with the richmond police department for five years.
at approximately,in the daylight hours of the early evening,aeschlimann saw a dark blue dodge avenger,which he did not recognize,traveling on afton avenue.aeschlimann explained that the car caught his attention because it had new york tags,and drugs are frequently trafficked between richmond,florida and new york on interstate.he further explained that his interest was piqued because he thought that that vehicle did not belong there and that the people in the vehicle did belong there.four african american men occupied the vehicle.
although initially driving in front of the car,aeschlimann turned around possibly in a roundabout at the end of afton avenue and pulled behind the car so as to follow it in his marked police patrol car aeschlimann,although looking for a traffic violation,was unable to see any equipment violations that he could have stopped the vehicle for.
apartment complexes line afton avenue on both sides.shortly after aeschlimann began following the car,it turned into the driveway of one such complex the graystone apartments.the detective followed the car into the driveway of the graystone apartments,which has a no trespassing sign posted on the property.aeschlimann testified that he suspected the men in the vehicle were trespassing and that in that area it was his common practice to follow any car with an tag to determine whether the occupants of the vehicle were trespassing.the detective did not activate the lights or sirens of his marked police cruiser.he did,however,stay close to the car losing sight of it only for a second as it rounded a corner because he wanted to try to make contact with the folks inside the vehicle to see if they lived there because it private property.
the driveway of the graystone apartments is a roadway with a row of diagonal parking spaces on one side.the car pulled into a diagonal parking space,and the four men emerged from it,including the driver,jones.at this time,aeschlimann pulled to a stop and parked the police cruiser in the lane of traffic rather than pulling into one of the diagonal parking spaces.the detective believed that he had no option other than to park where he did to ensure that he would have the opportunity to make contact with the occupants of the vehicle.
aeschlimann conceded that he had no basis to stop jones,or his car,but testified that to make things what we term a consensual encounter,he pulled past where jones had parked assertedly leaving jones vehicle unobstructed to back out of the parking spot if that something that he chose to do.however,the detective acknowledged that his police patrol car obstructed them from leaving the driveway.as aeschlimann described the situation,g iven that our vehicle was parked on a driveway that had parking stalls to the side and bushes and doors to the other row of apartments on the side,had they immediately backed their vehicle out or gotten back into their car and backed the vehicle out,my vehicle down the driveway probably would have obstructed them from leaving the driveway.thus,the detective acknowledged the placement of the police cruiser presented jones with the options of back ing his vehicle back up the driveway going in the wrong direction or requesting that the officers move their patrol car.despite the do not enter sign posted at the entrance to the driveway,aeschlimann testified that he would not have prevented jones from backing his car up the roadway in the wrong direction.
as aeschlimann and officer rice exited their patrol car,but before they reached the vehicle,they saw two of the vehicle passengers leave on foot.one of the passengers entered a nearby apartment.the officers did not see where the other man went.the officers did not pursue either man,nor did they attempt to speak to them.instead,the officers proceeded immediately to speak to jones,who had just emerged from and was still standing by the driver door.at this time,the remaining passenger walked over to stand with jones.jones was returning from the store and held a slice of pizza in his hand.
the officers approached jones and his companion the officers stood at the rear of the car with their side arms holstered.aeschlimann asked jones and his companion whether they live out here.jones answered that he did.aeschlimann testified that r ight when i made contact with jones and the other party,i said,hey,guys,can you do me a favor just lift your shirt for me so i can see you have no guns.the detective further testified that this was his common practice,especially in high crime areas.aeschlimann acknowledged that jones and his companion promptly complied by lifting their shirts,as requested.then aeschlimann said,hey,guys,would you mind if i pat you down for weapons jones and his companion turned around and raised their arms.the detective performed a quick pat down search and felt no weapons.
jones testified that between the time the officers approached him and he was asked to lift his shirt,he asked why the officers were stopping us,and aeschlimann responded because it a drug area.aeschlimann did not contradict this account during his previous testimony and the government did not recall him to refute jones statement.jones testified that at no point did he feel free to go.he explained that he did what the detective asked because he believed that the detectives were looking for us to do something wrong at the time.he further explained that it was not just the presence of the police officers but their manner that led him to conclude that he was not free to go it was just like how are you doing hey,how is your day going it was like that.it was all of a sudden,lift your shirt.can i pat you down from the beginning.
not until after the shirt lift and pat down did aeschlimann ask jones for identification.jones replied that he left his license at home.aeschlimann testified that beginning at that point in the encounter,jones would not have been free to leave,but rather was being detained for driving a motor vehicle without having his driver license with him in violation of state law.see.aeschlimann then asked jones for his personal information,and jones gave him a false name,date of birth,and social security number.unable to find this information in any of the state databases,aeschlimann confronted jones.jones then provided his true name and date of birth.either just before or just after jones gave his true information,one of the officers placed him in handcuffs.aeschlimann then returned to the police cruiser and ran jones information through the state databases he learned that jones license had been revoked.
while aeschlimann was running jones information,officer rice conducted another pat down of jones,and discovered a handgun in the crotch area of his pants.aeschlimann then placed jones under arrest.during a search of jones person incident to arrest,one of the officers discovered a small bag of marijuana in jones front pants pocket.
on july,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging jones with one count of possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of controlled substances,in violation of g.jones moved to suppress the gun and marijuana and subsequent statements to the police,alleging that the officers had illegally seized him when aeschlimann asked him first to lift his shirt and then submit to a pat down search.the government opposed the motion,contending that during the shirt lift and pat down the officers merely engaged in a consensual encounter with jones.after the district court held a hearing on the matter,it denied jones motion in an oral ruling.the court concluded that the encounter was consensual up until the police learned that jones was driving without a license,a traffic violation that provided the officer with reasonable suspicion to detain jones.
a jury subsequently convicted jones of the single charged crime,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and a year term of supervised release.jones timely filed this appeal challenging the district court denial of his suppression motion.when considering a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review the court factual findings for clear error and all legal conclusions de novo.united states weaver,cir.
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable seizures.const.amend.iv.this guarantee does not extend to all encounters.rather,as the supreme court has instructed,o nly when the officer,by means of physical force or show of authority,has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a seizure has occurred.terry ohio,d.encounters that are consensual require no justification,but those that are not consensual impose a detention on a citizen and so must be supported by an officer reasonable,articulable suspicion.see florida bostick,d terry,at.
as a general matter,law enforcement officers do not effectuate a detention or seizure merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them.united states drayton,d.but,an officer authority to initiate an encounter with a citizen rather than detain him is no greater than the authority of an ordinary citizen to approach another on the street and ask questions.united states burton,cir.
i n order to determine whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure,a court must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter to determine whether the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to decline the officers requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.bostick,at.in resolving this question,we,like our sister circuits,have followed the standard set forth in united states mendenhall,d plurality op,asking whether in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.united states gray,cir quoting mendenhall,at.plurality op.
this reasonable person standard is an objective one,thus its proper application is a question of law.weaver,at quoting united states sullivan,cir.we review such questions of law de novo.see ornelas united states,d holding objective determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed de novo on appeal mendenhall,at.describing issue as a matter of law 
a court considers a number of factors in determining whether an officer conduct would convey to a reasonable person that he is not free to leave.these include,but are not limited to,the number of police officers present during the encounter,whether they were in uniform or displayed their weapons,whether they touched the defendant,whether they attempted to block his departure or restrain his movement,whether the officers questioning was,and whether they treated the defendant as though they suspected him of illegal activity rather than treating the encounter as routine in nature.gray,at.
with these governing principles in mind,we consider the totality of the circumstances in this case to determine whether the initial encounter between the police officers and jones was consensual.see lattimore,at.
from the outset,the encounter in this case differs in a significant respect from the mine run of cases,on which the government relies,which hold the challenged encounter consensual.unlike those cases,the encounter here began with a citizen knowing that the police officers were conspicuously following him,rather than a citizen,previously unaware of the police,being approached by officers seemingly at random.united states black,cir officer spoke to defendant as he was walking along passenger side of police car,which had just arrived on the scene weaver,at officer approached defendant on the street and asked if he could speak with him united states analla,cir two officers approached defendant while he was using a public pay phone and asked to speak with him when he was through gray,at,plainclothes officer approached defendant in terminal area of airport,identified himself,and asked to speak with defendant 
indeed,in this case,the defendant,jones,saw the officers turn their marked patrol cruiser around to follow his car,pulling in behind it on a public roadway,and following it onto private property.according to aeschlimann own account,he followed jones closely enough to look for but not find equipment failure on the car that would justify a traffic stop.although the detective never initiated the marked police cruiser lights or sirens,he and officer rice were in uniform and armed.moreover,in aeschlimann haste to speak with jones he pulled the police cruiser to a stop in the lane of traffic and parked there,effectively blocking jones from moving his vehicle.accordingly,before the verbal encounter even began,this case lacked a traditional hallmark of a consensual encounter the seemingly routine approach of the police officer.see bostick,at.l aw enforcement officers do not violate the fourth amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place,by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions,or by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen internal quotation marks omitted.
that this was not a routine encounter,but one targeted at jones seems to us particularly significant given that the officers blocked in jones car to effectuate the encounter in united states green,cir,the seventh circuit considered a very similar case.there,as here,the police followed a car into a driveway where the driver parked the car,and there,as here,the defendant then exited his car.id.at.the seventh circuit concluded that,although the driver was no longer in his car,and indeed was walking away from his car toward a house,when the officers pulled their car in behind the defendant car,blocking the car exit a reasonable person would not feel that he was free to leave.id.at.accordingly,the court found that the police had seized not only the passenger who remained in the car but also the driver who had left it.id.
this holding comports with that of numerous other courts considering similar facts.see,united states see,cir given the fact that the officer blocked the defendant parked car with his marked patrol car,a reasonable person in his position would not have felt free to leave.united states kerr,cir reversing district court holding that police blockage of defendant,who could have driven around the police car,was not detention because officer a rriving in uniform and in a marked patrol car unquestionably appeared to be acting in an official capacity and,i nstead of waiting at the roadside,blocked defendant car thus precipitat ing the confrontation riley state,concluding that when police approached defendant car with their badges and flashlights,after having parked their police vehicle so as to prevent defendant from driving away,a seizure had taken place for purposes of fourth amendment analysis commonwealth helme,finding investigatory stop occurred when officer parked the police cruiser so as to block the defendant parked automobile and prevent it from leaving the parking lot state roberts,holding seizure occurred when officer,armed and in uniform,followed defendant car without activating lights or sirens,blocked the car from backing out of a driveway,and made an additional show of authority in immediately exiting his patrol car and approaching defendant who had exited his car simultaneously and was standing by the car door state garcia cantu,relying on fact that officer parked his patrol car such that it boxed in defendant parked truck,preventing him from voluntarily leaving and noting that m ost courts have held that when an officer boxes in a car to prevent its voluntary departure,this conduct constitutes a fourth amendment seizure state jestice,w hen a police cruiser completely blocks a motorist car from leaving,courts generally find a seizure t he fact that it was possible for the couple to back and maneuver their car past the patrol car and out of the trailhead parking lot does not convince us that this was a consensual encounter mcchesney state,noting fact that officer blocked in defendant car has been found sufficient to constitute a seizure.
we agree that when an officer blocks a defendant car from leaving the scene,particularly when,as here,the officer has followed the car,the officer demonstrates a greater show of authority than does an officer who just happens to be on the scene and engages a citizen in conversation.for this reason,the three cases on which the government relies are inapposite.see united states thompson,cir united states kim,cir united states pajari,cir.in those cases,unlike the one at hand,the officers did not target and follow the defendant car before blocking it in.the officers here did not merely come upon an already parked car as they did in kim,at,or approach incognito from behind the defendant parked car as they did in pajari,at.nor did the police merely ask to speak with a pedestrian who happened to be walking toward his car,as the officer did in thompson,at.rather,jones saw the officers follow his car from a public street onto private property and then block the car from exiting in their haste to speak with him.
the government contends that the placement of the police cruiser has minimal relevance because,as the police approached,two of jones companions walked away from the car one into an apartment and one in the other direction and the officers did not chase after them or call them back.but it is not altogether clear to us which way this fact cuts.on the one hand,that the officers allowed two passengers to walk away from the vehicle could convey to a reasonable person that he,too,was free to walk away.
but,on the other hand,a reasonable person,whose car has been followed by police officers and who then saw the officers apparent lack of interest in his passengers,might just as likely believe that the police wanted to question only him.operating under this assumption,seeing two passengers walk away does nothing to quell,and may even enhance,a driver reasonable suspicion that the police are targeting him see united states williams,cir relying,in part,on fact that,although two officers did not draw their weapons or touch the defendant,they were in uniform and arrived in a marked police car,and immediately focused their attention on one person,the defendant in a group of four or five which contributed to their show of authority.indeed,the officers in this case proceeded immediately to the driver side of the car where jones was standing after just emerging from the driver side door.see united states jones,cir weighing fact that police officer exited his patrol car and engaged defendant outside the vehicle in favor of finding encounter was.
furthermore,when the officers approached jones,they did not ask if they could speak with him,which,based on a review of our cases,appears to be the routine practice of officers seeking to engage in a consensual encounter when they approach an individual on foot.see,weaver,at analla,at gray,at.nor did the officers explain their function of conducting a routine patrol in the area.drayton,at.describing how officer walked from the rear of the bus toward the front explaining to each passenger he was conducting routine drug and weapons interdiction efforts gray,at finding no detention when officers who approached defendant in an airport initially informed him of the dea purpose and function,and treated the questioning as a matter of routine,rather than as a particularized investigation of the defendant.
rather,in speaking to jones,the officers clearly continued their show of authority.according to aeschlimann himself,right when he made contact with jones,he asked jones to lift his shirt to see whether jones possessed a weapon.not satisfied with the shirt lift,aeschlimann then asked jones to consent to a pat down search,further implying that the officer suspected that jones a person the police had followed onto private property might be armed.thus,their immediate verbal exchange with jones did nothing to lessen a reasonable person suspicion that he was the target of a criminal investigation,and,in light of the totality of the circumstances,only enhanced it.
the government makes much of the fact that aeschlimann requested,rather than ordered,jones to lift his shirt and consent to a pat down search.a request certainly is not an order,but a request two requests in this case that conveys the requisite show of authority may be enough to make a reasonable person feel that he would not be free to leave.united states richardson,cir.
for example,in richardson,after completing a traffic stop,a police officer made a single request that the driver just hang out right here for me,okay id.at.despite the fact that the officer did not display an intimidating demeanor or use coercive language,the court held that the officer words alone were enough to make a reasonable person feel that he would not be free to walk away and ignore the request.see also united states smith,cir holding police officer detained defendant,whose path was not blocked,when officer asked him to stop johnson campbell,cir holding officer second request to roll down car window constituted a seizure by ma king it clear that the defendant was not free to ignore the officer.
here,too,under the circumstances of this case,we conclude that a reasonable person would not have felt free to walk away and ignore aeschlimann nearly immediate requests that the person first lift his shirt and then submit to a pat down search.by making such intrusive requests almost immediately upon approaching jones and his companion,aeschlimann communicated,through his conduct,that this was not just a routine encounter with the police.see terry,at.explaining that a careful exploration of the outer surfaces of a person clothing all over his or her body in an attempt to find weapons performed in public by a policeman while the citizen stands helpless inflicts a serious intrusion upon the sanctity of the person 
the two supreme court bus cases,on which the government relies,drayton and bostick,are readily distinguishable.in both cases,the court held there was no per se rule about when encounters on a bus constitute a seizure.drayton,at.bostick,at.but in both,the officers were,as they carefully told the passengers,conducting routine drug and weapons interdiction efforts during scheduled bus stops.moreover,unlike the case at hand,in neither case did the officers exhibit any conduct to suggest a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing among any of the passengers questioned.see state pitts.rather,in drayton,an officer approached the defendant passenger in a manner,working his way from the rear of the bus and explaining to each passenger that the officers were conducting bus interdiction,at.thu
