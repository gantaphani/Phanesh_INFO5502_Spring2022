background 
nelson jimenez was arrested and pled guilty to distribution and possession with the intent to distribute grams or more of heroin,in violation of and a,b b.during his plea allocution,jimenez admitted to all relevant facts in support of the charged offense,including the fact that he planned to distribute,and was found in possession of,approximately grams of heroin.jimenez was informed that,under the statute to which he pled guilty,he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment based on the quantity of heroin attributed to him.see b b.
in anticipation of jimenez sentencing,the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report.based on adjustments that have not been challenged on this appeal,the probation office determined that jimenez total offense level was.because jimenez criminal history fell within criminal history category i,he faced a guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.the bottom end of jimenez sentencing range,however,was further proscribed by the statute,which called for a sentence of months imprisonment.b b.as a result,the probation office concluded that jimenez sentencing range was between and months imprisonment.the probation office did not recommend that jimenez receive relief from the sentence pursuant to the provision codified at f,and it recommended that jimenez receive a term of imprisonment.
prior to his sentencing,jimenez filed a memorandum with the district court,in which he argued both that he was eligible for a sentence beneath the sentence,based on the provision,and for an additional reduction to his total offense level based on former guideline b,which provided for such a reduction where a defendant satisfied each of the five criteria for relief according to jimenez,there was no on prior submissions between the he met each of the first four criteria for relief.as to the fifth criterion for relief,which provides that a defendant must have truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan,f a,jimenez argued that he had fully disclosed to the government all the information that he had concerning his involvement in the distribution of heroin.jimenez stated that his involvement was limited solely to the conduct that gave rise to his arrest the government simply refused to accept the fact that he had no prior involvement in the drug trade.
jimenez sentencing arguments were premised on statements that he had made to the government during a interview and two separate proffer sessions.during these meetings,jimenez provided the following account to the government a jimenez met an individual known as primo while employed as a livery cab driver b although he had only met primo briefly on two separate occasions and was not sure whether primo was a drug dealer,jimenez decided to ask primo if he could help him sell heroin to an acquaintance who later turned out to be a confidential informant c primo told jimenez that he would be willing to provide jimenez with heroin to sell to his acquaintance d because primo was highly suspicious of surveillance,however,primo would not meet jimenez acquaintance until after another individual first met with jimenez and jimenez acquaintance e another individual,who posed as a fake primo,met with jimenez and his acquaintance f during the course of this meeting,jimenez discussed the subject of mules smugglers who sometimes ingest narcotics,but only to enhance his credibility with his acquaintance the confidential informant g the fake primo reported to primo that jimenez acquaintance could not be trusted h despite the fake primo suspicions,primo agreed to provide heroin to jimenez acquaintance i in february,jimenez provided the confidential informant with grams of heroin j later,in may,jimenez traveled by plane from new york to houston,texas,in order to pick up approximately grams of heroin,which he intended to sell to the confidential informant on primo behalf k jimenez intended to return by train,but because of the of police activity at the train station,he decided to rent a car to make the return trip l lacking a credit card,jimenez called a friend in new york and offered to pay to fly his friend to houston so that his friend could rent a car to make the return trip m jimenez friend who according to jimenez had no knowledge about the nature of jimenez trip agreed,flew to houston,and rented the car on jimenez behalf n despite all his difficulties,jimenez was assured only by primo for making the trip,which was less than the cost of his plane tickets and other travel expenses o jimenez was arrested on may,when he attempted to sell to the confidential informant the heroin that he had picked up in houston.jimenez maintained that,with the exception of the two transactions that gave rise to his arrest,he had never engaged in drug dealing.
in a responsive letter filed with the district court,the government argued that jimenez was not eligible for relief because he had not provided complete and truthful information about his involvement in the offense and his,which rendered him ineligible for a sentence less than five years imprisonment and also deprived him of a reduction to his offense level pursuant to former guideline b.in the government view,jimenez account of his offense lack ed credibility.in support of this proposition,the government argued a although jimenez contended that he had neither any prior experience in the drug trade nor any prior relationship with primo,he was entrusted with the responsibility for dealing approximately in heroin without supervision b despite his apparent concern about police surveillance,primo was willing to deal with both jimenez and jimenez acquaintance,even though primo had only met jimenez on two prior occasions,and even though primo was apparently warned by the fake primo that jimenez acquaintance could not be trusted c jimenez story about the fake primo sounded contrived,and it was more likely that jimenez invented the fake primo story in order to try to protect primo from prosecution d given the limited amount of money that jimenez claimed he was entitled to receive based on his trip to texas and the fact that jimenez friend agreed to fly down to texas to rent a car without any knowledge of the nature of jimenez trip,jimenez account of his trip to texas sound ed similarly contrived and designed to protect himself and his friend and e it was difficult to believe that jimenez lacked specific knowledge of the transportation of drug swallowers,given the specific factual assertions made by jimenez during his meeting with the confidential informant and the fake primo.in the government view,there were simply too many coincidences and unlikely events in jimenez story for it to be believed.the government concluded
