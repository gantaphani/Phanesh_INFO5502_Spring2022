after a district judge denied gary farlow motion to suppress the fruits of an allegedly illegal search of his home computer,farlow pled guilty to one count of unlawful transportation of child pornography,a.his guilty plea was conditioned on his ability to bring this appeal broadly challenging the denial of his motion to suppress.farlow appeal raises some interesting arguments,but in the end they can not carry the day for the reasons that follow,we affirm the denial of his motion to suppress,and his conviction therefore stands.
from february through april,a person using the aol screen name farlowmecasa contacted a putative year old aol user who was actually detective peter badalucco,a member of new york nassau county police department.farlowmecasa sent several explicit messages to badalucco,including proposals to meet in person for sex badalucco believed these messages constituted the crimes of disseminating indecent materials to minors in the first degree penal law and endangering the welfare of a child penal law.also,on march farlowmecasa sent badalucco an image of a bodybuilder,saying it was an image of himself this act,though apparently not criminal,will be relevant later.
while farlowmecasa was sending these messages,badalucco was looking into the person behind the screen name.he subpoenaed aol for farlowmecasa subscriber information,and aol informed him that the account belonged to gary farlow of litchfield,maine.on april,badalucco contacted detective laurie northrup to obtain and execute a search warrant of farlow residence.northrup determined that a gary farlow,born in,indeed resided in litchfield,maine.she also determined that farlow had been convicted of public lewdness in,disorderly conduct in a crime that had originally been charged as indecent conduct,and indecent conduct in.
based on farlow criminal history and his alleged attempts to solicit sex from badalucco who,again,had presented himself as a year old,northrup prepared an application for a search warrant.a maine state judge signed off on the warrant,authorizing police to search farlow home for the following 
computers and computer equipment such as monitors,keyboards,compact disk sic drives,zip disk drives,usb drives,digital cameras,players,electronic data storage devices such as hard drives,floppy disks,zip disks,compact disks sic,digital video disks sic,memory sticks,flash memory cards,software,and written materials relating to the operation of the computer such as names of online accounts,screen names,passwords,manuals,computer reference books,guides and notes.
computer records or data,whether in printed or electronic form,that are evidence of the crimes of dissemination of indecent materials to minors or endangering the welfare of a child,including but not limited to records of internet use such as internet browser history,search engine history,temporary internet files,electronic communications such as email and email attachments,records or data pertaining to online chat room communications,file transfer logs,text messages,writings created on word processing software or notepads,stored data files and folders,graphic visual images such as photographs,movie clips and scanned images,software or programs for file sharing or networks,personal calendars or diaries,and any records or data that demonstrate the identity of the person s who exercised dominion or control over the computer or its contents.
the warrant specified that all of this material constitute s evidence of the new york state crimes noted above.
on april,the maine state police executed the search warrant,appearing at farlow home while he was chatting online with badalucco.the police seized farlow computer and other electronic equipment.a police search of the computer using a forensic program to open image files in a gallery view turned up some child pornography.the police sought and obtained a second warrant geared specifically toward this new discovery a subsequent search yielded images of child pornography,emails sent from the computer with child pornography attachments,and emails received with child pornography attachments.these images and emails led to farlow march,indictment on twelve charges.
on august,farlow moved to suppress the fruits of the search authorized by the first warrant including the second warrant.he argued that the first warrant facially authorized an essentially unfettered search of his computer and therefore failed the fourth amendment and particularity requirements.additionally,he argued,the actual search of his computer could not be saved by various exceptions to the warrant requirement,and even if the warrant had been valid the search had still exceeded the scope of its authorization.finally,he requested an evidentiary hearing to explore the propriety of the warrant and search.the government responded that the warrant was in fact limited to computers,computer equipment and computer records or data that are evidence of two specific crimes.further,the government argued,the search itself complied,as it must,with the terms of the warrant.in any event,it said,images of child pornography unavoidably came within the searching officer plain view during a reasonable search for the bodybuilder image and were therefore exempted from the warrant requirement.and because both the warrant and the search were plainly legal,it said,there was no need for a hearing.
a magistrate judge tasked with reviewing farlow suppression motion penned a report and recommendation suggesting that the district court deny the motion.the magistrate judge determined that the warrant was founded on probable cause,it was sufficiently particular,it authorized the search as conducted,no hearing was necessary,and suppression was not appropriate.in a separate written opinion dated december,a district judge adopted and affirmed the magistrate judge recommendation in full.
after several continuances,on november,farlow entered a guilty plea on one count of the indictment,conditioned on his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.following one more false start farlow moved to withdraw his plea the motion was denied,farlow was sentenced to ten years in prison followed by supervised release for life.
farlow now appeals,arguing that we must suppress the evidence of child pornography because the warrant allowed a search that was overbroad given the narrow scope of the government probable cause the computer search unlawfully exceeded even the broad scope of the warrant the and exceptions to the warrant requirement do not apply and even if we disagree with him on the first three issues,we should nevertheless remand for a hearing on the validity of the warrant and search.the government responds among other things that there was probable cause to believe farlow had committed new york state indecency crimes,the warrant was tailored to allow police to search for evidence of those crimes,and the police reasonably executed such a search to produce that evidence given the ease of disguising computer files.in reviewing the denial of farlow suppression motion,we apply review to any factual disputes and consider legal issues de novo,united states materas,cir we review the denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion,united states mitchell hunter,cir.
we begin with farlow argument that the first warrant was not supported by probable cause.probable cause exists when,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit,there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.united states crespo r√≠os,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.farlow claims that the government had no probable cause to collect any electronic image other than the single nonpornographic image of a bodybuilder.the government responds that farlow focus on the bodybuilder image is too myopic farlow proposal that badalucco meet him in person for sex and his prior convictions for deviant behavior provided probable cause for a much broader search.
we agree with the government the affidavits submitted in support of the warrant established a fair probability that farlow computer and ot
