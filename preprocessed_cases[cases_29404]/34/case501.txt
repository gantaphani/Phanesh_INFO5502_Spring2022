appellant christopher smith was charged,pursuant to a,with having falsely stated on a federal firearms transaction record that he had never been committed to a mental hospital.he sought to suppress the record of his involuntary mental health commitment on the ground that it had been obtained through police records that were protected from disclosure by state law.additionally,he argued that federal regulations governing records at federally assisted drug abuse treatment programs precluded disclosure of the record of his involuntary commitment.
after his suppression motion was denied,smith entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal the denial.he now exercises that right and also appeals on the ground that the plea hearing,conducted by the district court pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,was deficient.we hold that state law was not violated by the disclosures in this case and that the order of commitment is not a record to which the federal regulations governing records at federally assisted drug abuse treatment programs apply.we also find that no error occurred during smith rule hearing.we therefore affirm.
the following facts are undisputed.on april,smith was involuntarily admitted to acadia hospital,a psychiatric hospital in bangor,maine.this involuntary admission was precipitated by his admission to the intensive care unit at eastern maine medical center emmc following a drug overdose.in the application section of an application for emergency involuntary admission to a mental hospital a blue paper emmc nurse practitioner donna huff explained 
i believe christopher smith has a mental illness and due to mental illness,poses a likelihood of serious harm on the basis that smith has a hx history of violent outbursts,threatening others and himself.he is here at emmc in the icu status post overdose on a variety of medications.the last time he was admitted he fled before he was admitted.he is a flight risk.therefore requesting bangor pd.
victor kelmenson completed the certification portion of smith blue paper,concluding that he pose d a likelihood of serious harm due to a mental illness because of amphetamine overdosed psychosis,hx history of suicidal ideation and paranoia,and violent outbursts.later the same day,the penobscot county probate judge completed the judicial review and endorsement section of the blue paper and authorized the bangor police to transport smith to acadia hospital.smith was subsequently hospitalized for about two weeks.
less than four months later,on july,smith went to frati the pawnbrokers,a federally licensed firearms dealer in bangor,and completed atf form in anticipation of purchasing a gun.question.f on the form asked have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective which includes having been adjudicated incompetent to manage your own affairs or have you ever been committed to a mental institution smith answered,no.on july,erik tall,a bangor police detective assigned to an atf task force,reviewed smith atf form.tall discovered from computerized records at the bangor police department that smith had been transported by two officers on april.he then obtained a copy of the police report indicating that smith had been transported from emmc to acadia hospital for involuntary admission.
on july,tall interviewed smith and his mother,who both confirmed that smith had been involuntarily committed in april.the government then sought a court order,pursuant to regulations under the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa,f,and maine law.ann.tit,c,directing acadia hospital to turn over a copy of the blue paper authorizing smith involuntary admission.a magistrate judge granted this request,and the government received a copy of smith blue paper on august,confirming his involuntary admission and the inaccuracy of his answer on the atf form.
following his indictment on september,for knowingly making a false statement on the atf form,smith moved to suppress the police reports related to his transportation to acadia hospital and the blue paper evidencing his involuntary admission.he argued that the police reports should be suppressed because they were obtained in violation of maine law designating all orders of commitment,medical and administrative records,application and reports,and facts contained in them as confidential records.ann.tit.he contended that the blue paper should be suppressed as a fruit of the illegally obtained police report and as a drug abuse treatment record,designated as confidential under the federal public health service act,
the same magistrate judge who issued the order directing the hospital to turn over the blue paper recommended that smith motion to suppress be denied,and the district court adopted her recommendation.smith then agreed to enter a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal on the suppression issue.the district court conducted a plea hearing,described in further detail below,and accepted smith plea,sentencing him to fifteen months in prison and three years supervised release.smith now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress the police report and the blue paper.he also appeals on the ground that the judge conducting his rule hearing improperly relied on a written document instead of directly and personally addressing him in open court about his understanding of the charge against him.
we review the denial of a motion to suppress under a bifurcated standard questions of law are reviewed de novo,while findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.united states charles,cir.the facts underlying the motion to suppress in this case are not in dispute.as a result,our review is de novo.
smith argues that tall violated state law,specifically maine revised statutes title,when he reviewed computer records and a police report related to the transportation of smith from emmc to acadia hospital.section,located in a chapter governing the department of behavioral and developmental services,provides 
generally.all orders of commitment,medical and administrative records,applications and reports,and facts contained in them,pertaining to any client shall be kept confidential and may not be disclosed by any person,except that 
information may be disclosed if ordered by a court of record 
smith argues that tall violated maine law by improperly obtaining and disclosing to federal prosecutors,without a court order,the police report documenting the bangor police department transport of smith to acadia hospital.this argument fails because the police report is not a report pertaining to a client covered by.a client is defined in this title of the maine statutes as a person receiving services from the department of behavioral and developmental services,from any state institution or from any agency licensed or funded to provide services falling under the jurisdiction of the department.id.given that the bangor police department is not a state agency or institution under this definition,smith can not be the police department client.thus,the police report is not a report pertaining to a client.it follows that tall acquisition of the police report and his disclosure of it to federal prosecutors was not a violation of state law.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of smith motion to suppress the police report.because the police report was not illegally obtained,we also reject smith theory that the blue paper should be suppressed as a fruit of the police report.
federal law 
smith also argues that the blue paper should be suppressed on federal law grounds.the public health service act phsa makes certain drug abuse records confidential 
records of the identity,diagnosis,prognosis,or treatment of any patient which are maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to substance abuse treatment or rehabilitation which is conducted,regulated,or directly or indirectly assisted by any department or agency of the united states shall be confidential and be disclosed only for the purposes and under the circumstances expressly authorized 
the regulations promulgated pursuant to this statute define records to mean any information,whether recorded or not,relating to a patient received or acquired by a federally assisted alcohol or drug program.a patient is defined as any individual who has applied for or been given diagnosis or treatment for alcohol or drug abuse at a federally assisted program.id.drug abuse is broadly defined to encompass the use of a psychoactive substance for other than medicinal purposes which impairs the physical,mental,emotional,or social of the user.id.
the application and certificate on smith blue paper contain diagnoses referencing drug abuse status post overdose on a variety of medications and amphetamine overdosed psychosis and therefore are,arguably,records within the regulatory definition the phsa permits the use of such records to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against a patient when authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor.b c,c.the statute prescribes a general balancing test for assessing good cause,instructing the court to weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the patient,to the relationship,and to the treatment services.id.however,the regulations promulgated under the statute articulate a more specific five factor test to be applied when the records are sought for use in a criminal investigation or a criminal prosecution 
a court may authorize the disclosure and use of patient records for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation or prosecution of a patient only if the court finds that all of the following criteria are met 
the crime involved is extremely serious,such as one which causes or directly threatens loss of life or serious bodily injury including homicide,rape,kidnapping,armed robbery,assault with a deadly weapon,and child abuse and neglect.
there is a reasonable likelihood that the records will disclose information of substantial value in the investigation or prosecution.
other ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective.
the potential injury to the patient,to the relationship and to the ability of the program to provide services to other patients is outweighed by the public interest and the need for the disclosure.
if the applicant is a person performing a law enforcement function that 
i the person holding the records has been afforded the opportunity to be represented by independent counsel 
although a court order was granted authorizing the release of the blue paper for use in the government investigation and prosecution of smith,none of the findings required by the regulations were made.the explanation for this lack of findings is simple neither the government nor the magistrate judge granting the order had any reason to believe,at the time,that the blue paper referenced a drug abuse diagnosis and thus arguably included drug abuse information under.the magistrate judge explained in her ruling on the suppression motion that her order authorizing release of the commitment record was made pursuant to the hipaa regulations,a permitting disclosure of health records pursuant to court order,and applicable state law.ann.tit,permitting disclosure of orders of commitment pursuant to court order.she noted that when considering the government request for an order authorizing disclosure of the blue paper,she never for one moment considered whether the application might mention the word drugs and therefore became a patient record within the meaning of d.
however,to resolve the suppression issue before us,we need not decide whether the application and certificate portions of the blue paper are patient records,nor whether the government would have been able to show that all five criteria required by d were satisfied in this case.instead,we focus only on the judicial endorsement portion of the blue paper.we do so for two reasons.first,the maine law authorizing emergency admission,described supra note,suggests that the procedure involves three different forms an application,a certificate,and a judicial endorsement.although maine has decided to use a single piece of paper to consolidate the application,certification,and endorsement steps of the procedure,this happenstance does not necessarily mean that the three discrete portions of the form,filled out by three separate people,are all part of single record for the purpose of the phsa.in other words,the practical convenience of putting these three forms on a single piece of paper does not transform the judicial endorsement from a judicial order into a patient record.
second,the government has no interest in introducing evidence of smith drug abuse at trial.its only interest is the introduction of evidence of the fact of smith involuntary commitment to a mental hospital.that fact could be shown with a redacted copy of the blue paper that includes only the judicial endorsement thus,even assuming an error was made in ordering disclosure of the entire,unredacted blue paper and we intimate no view on that question,the dispositive issue is whether the judicial endorsement on smith blue paper,with the application and certificate redacted,could be used to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against smith without the findings necessitated by the five factor test under the phsa regulations.accordingly,we must determine whether the judicial endorsement is a record to which the psha regulations restricting use apply.we hold that it is not.
the applicability statement in the phsa regulations limits the broad definition of records when the use of information in a criminal case is at issue 
the restriction on use of information to initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against a patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of a patient applies to any information,which is drug abuse information obtained by a federally assisted drug abuse program after march,for the purpose of treating drug abuse,making a diagnosis for the treatment,or making a referral for the treatment.
a emphasis added internal citation omitted.the judicial endorsement on smith blue paper reads 
upon review pursuant to,i find this application and certificate to be regular and in accordance with the law,and i hereby authorize bangor police dept to take christopher smith into custody and transport him to the acadia hospital.
it is dated and signed by the probate judge and indicates the address of the probate court.this endorsement contains no information that was obtained for the purpose of treatment,diagnosis,or referral indeed,it contains no medical information at all and no reference to drugs.instead,it contains the statement of a judge authorizing the police to transport a patient to a hospital for emergency commitment.it is properly characterized as a judicial order and,as such,is far more akin to a court record than to a patient record of drug treatment the endorsement was obtained for the purpose of complying with maine emergency involuntary commitment statute,rather than for treatment,diagnosis,or referral.because the endorsement contains no information to which the phsa regulatory restrictions on use apply,it is not a record within the purview of those regulations as a result,the judicial endorsement may be used to prosecute smith without the findings required by d.accordingly,smith appeal of the denial of his motion to suppress the blue paper is denied.
smith asserts a violation of federal rule of criminal procedure for the first time on appeal.he did not object during the plea colloquy,nor did he move at any time to withdraw his plea.as a result,our review is for plain error.united states vonn,d united states,cir.to establish plain error,smith bears the burden of demonstrating that there was error the error was plain the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at quoting united states riggs,cir.
federal rule of criminal procedure requires a court to conduct a plea colloquy,advising the defendant of his rights and questioning him to establish that the plea is knowing and voluntary.b.the rule requires the court
