in these consolidated criminal appeals,defendants charles brown,charles isler,and bilal abdul rashid challenge their convictions and sentences for participating in a cocaine base distribution conspiracy.we affirm the convictions and brown sentence,but vacate isler and rashid sentences.
we present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdicts.see united states boulerice,cir.
on the afternoon of june,detective scott partridge of the providence police department was surveilling the rear of brown house from an adjacent yard.the house had previously been the subject of extensive surveillance,and the providence police had executed a number of controlled buys of cocaine base from the first floor apartment.as partridge watched,brown pulled his car into his house yard,which was empty except for an old junk car.brown exited the car carrying a cheese puff container and a brown paper bag.partridge saw brown remove a plastic bag containing a white substance from the paper bag and place it in the false bottom of the container.brown then returned the container to his car and entered the first floor apartment with the bag and its remaining contents.no one else entered or left the house.
approximately half an hour later,partridge and several other officers executed a search warrant for the apartment.two of the officers covered the front door,and the rest entered through the back.all were clad in black windbreakers bearing the legend providence police in large,yellow letters.partridge team proceeded to the rear door of the first floor apartment,announced its presence,received no response,and then forcibly entered.the entry took considerable effort the rear door was heavily fortified with steel bars,had no handle,and could be opened from either side only with a key for the heavy deadbolt lock.also,a second interior door was wedged in tightly inside the fortified exterior door.notably,the exterior door contained a four by six inch cut out and a large kitchen knife was hidden in the door interior panel.
brown,isler,and rashid were standing near the kitchen table when the officers entered through the back entrance,and attempted to flee through the front door.but upon hearing the other officers outside,they reversed field and attempted to force their way past the original entry team.a violent struggle ensued,and the defendants were subdued.brown had upon his person,rashid had,and isler had.
the apartment was small and sparsely furnished,except for the kitchen.on the kitchen table,surrounded by three chairs,the officers found monitors for a sophisticated surveillance system comprised of several cameras,a motion sensor,an intercom,and a pair of exterior red and the other green.on the same table was the paper bag that brown had carried into the apartment.inside the paper bag were two plastic bags containing grams of cocaine base.also on the table were a digital scale,plastic bags,plastic bags with their corners snipped off,scissors,baking soda,a razor,a cooking plate with cocaine base residue,in cash,two cell phones,a pager,and isler wallet and keys.the only key for the deadbolt lock on the fortified rear door hung on a hook near the table.
the officers also collected small packages containing grams of cocaine base from an overflowing toilet in a nearby bathroom.a search of brown car yielded the cheese puff container,which contained an additional grams of cocaine base.
all three defendants were charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute or more grams of cocaine base count i,see,and possession with intent to distribute or more grams of cocaine base count ii,see a b a.in addition,based on the narcotics found in his car,brown was charged with possession with intent to distribute or more grams of cocaine base count iii,see a b b.
at trial,the government called several officers and forensic specialists,and the government case included expert testimony that the surveillance equipment,barricaded doors,and cut out on the exterior door were indicative of a drug house.only brown testified for the defense.he testified that he had been let in by three unidentified men who left moments before the raid that he was present only to collect rent from his tenant that there were no drugs in the house or his car that he had never seen rashid or isler before the raid that rashid was there to purchase his tenant minivan that isler was sitting in a bedroom possibly listening to music that there were at least four cars in the yard at the time of the raid that he tried to let the police in when they knocked but they ordered him away from the door that the defendants did not try to flee or resist and that the security and surveillance equipment had been installed by the previous owner was typical for homes in the area.
the jury convicted brown on all counts.the jury also convicted both isler and rashid,but held them responsible for less than grams of cocaine base on both counts and not for the or more grams originally charged in the indictment.isler and rashid were sentenced to and months imprisonment,respectively.brown received a mandatory life sentence because he had two prior felony narcotics convictions.see b a.
the defendants challenge their convictions and sentences on several grounds.the primary appellate issues are whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain isler and rashid convictions whether the district court erroneously permitted detailed concerning brown prior convictions whether the court abused its discretion when it admitted testimony from one of the government experts whether the government closing argument was inappropriate and prejudicial whether the court should have applied the rule of lenity to sentence brown to a shorter prison term because the relevant provisions of are ambiguous and whether the defendants are entitled to resentencing under united states booker,d 
sufficiency of the evidence 
rashid and isler claim that the district court erroneously denied their motions for acquittal because the government demonstrated only that they were merely present at the drug raid see united states llinas,cir government must prove more than mere presence to obtain drug conspiracy conviction.isler and rashid maintain that they did not own the house,that the three defendants had never met before the raid,that neither rashid nor isler was ever in the house before the raid,and that there was no evidence that they possessed or agreed to possess the narcotics.
we review the denial of a motion for acquittal de novo.see boulerice,at.we will affirm if,after reviewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,we conclude that a rational jury could find the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
isler and rashid argue as though only direct evidence can support their convictions.but of course,this is not so indeed the government may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence to prove the charged offense.see united states soler,cir see also united states,cir a conspiracy can be demonstrated by a development and a collocation of circumstances internal citation and quotation omitted.as we have explained 
the defendant presence at a place where contraband is found may or may not be purely coincidental.the attendant circumstances tell the the culpability of a defendant presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.in other words,a defendant mere presence argument will fail in situations where the mere is lacking.

the facts surrounding isler and rashid arrest permitted the jury to find that they were more than merely present.detective partridge saw brown bring a substance that proved to be cocaine base into the house.when the officers burst through the heavily fortified back door,isler,rashid,and brown were the only persons in the apartment and were standing near the kitchen table with three chairs.on the kitchen table were the monitors for an elaborate surveillance system,a quantity of cocaine base suggestive of narcotics distribution and not personal use,cash,isler wallet and keys,and various drug packaging paraphernalia.in the bathroom,a few feet away,was evidence of a hasty and unsuccessful attempt to flush more cocaine base down the toilet.compare soler,at echeverri,at,at.
further,the house was a fortress,with heavily reinforced doors and an extensive surveillance system.from this evidence,the jury could have inferred that the dealers wished to conduct their business in absolute secrecy and security,and that only the conspiracy participants would be permitted into the apartment.see generally llinas,at criminal conspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal united states,cir criminals do not welcome innocent bystanders as witnesses to their crimes united states ortiz,cir criminals rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before audiences.
finally,the defendants fled from the police,and,when cornered,engaged a violent struggle with the officers.in appropriate circumstances,flight can be probative of guilt.see united states carpenter,cir united states,cir.
in sum,the district court properly concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions 
prior convictions 
brown contends that the district court abused its discretion and prejudiced his defense by permitting the government to him in detail about his prior convictions before later ruling that the evidence was inadmissible.
brown had three prior felony narcotics convictions,all involving marijuana.before trial,the government filed a notice of intent to introduce the prior convictions for impeachment,see,and as admissible other bad act evidence,see.b,in anticipation of a mere presence defense.brown never objected to the notice or filed a motion in limine to exclude the evidence.on direct examination,brown testified about the basic facts of his prior convictions on,the government these basic facts and then inquired,under rule b,about the historical facts underlying his record.during the government rebuttal argument,the prosecutor made reference to brown testimony about his prior convictions and brown objected.after a bench conference,the court ruled that the b evidence of prior convictions was not allowed and instructed the prosecutor to refrain from making additional reference to it.the court did not,however,strike the prior testimony concerning the details of the prior convictions.brown argues that he was prejudiced by the court failure to exclude the b evidence.the government contends that there was no abuse of discretion and,in any event,the challenged testimony was harmless.
we choose to proceed directly to the harmless error inquiry.t he admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.united states,cir.a harmless error analysis is case specific,and requires consideration of such factors as the centrality of the tainted evidence,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the use to which the evidence was put,and the relative strengths of the parties cases.id.
brown focuses on the admission of three facts that he did not remember the weight of the marijuana involved in one offense but the prosecutor suggested ten pounds his exculpatory account of his involvement in one offense essentially that brown threw the marijuana in the trash at someone behest and that he was arrested for one offense with on his person.in the circumstances of this case,we conclude that these facts did not sway the jury.
the challenged facts added little to the basic facts of convictions,which had been recounted twice on direct and.moreover,they were not highlighted in the prosecution argument,and were inconsequential when evaluated against the balance of the prosecution considerable evidence any error in the admission of this evidence was harmless.
brown argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting certain testimony from officer angelo,one of the government expert witnesses,concerning the features of a drug house.brown does not challenge qualifications as an expert.rather,he challenges the relevance of his testimony to brown house.specifically,brown complains that was permitted to testify that the security and surveillance at brown house was something that he had never previously seen according to brown,this testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial because it permitted the prosecutor to argue that the defendants were unusually sophisticated criminals.brown concedes that our review is for plain error only.a plain error must be clear or obvious,affect substantial rights,and seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,at.
brown argument fails for many reasons,the most basic of which is that he misstates the essence of testimony.prior to the challenged testimony,had testified at length that the barricades and surveillance features on brown house were consistent with those at other drug houses that he had raided.the routine patrol questions were intended to show that normal houses in the area did not have such features.this testimony was responsive to brown defense that he was merely present at the crime scene,which brown supported with his testimony that his house was just like any other house in that part of providence.in short,simply did not testify that he was unfamiliar with the equipment at brown house.there was no error in the admission of testimony,plain or otherwise 
prosecutorial misconduct 
isler claims that the prosecutor,during her closing argument,twice improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendants and improperly vouched for the government witnesses.
in the first challenged remark,the prosecutor was discussing brown testimony regarding the house security features 
charles brown would have you believe that this is to protect people from burglary,that this is all over the place.in fact,it in the other apartment that he owns.well,where is the documentary proof of that,ladies and gentlemen none.you just have charles brown word.
brown counsel objected,and the district judge sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the remark.
the second challenged remark concerned brown claim that he was merely present at the crime scene to collect rent from his tenant 
and he tells you that he went in to collect the rent.well,if he went to collect the rent,why did he take his rent receipt book with him you know why,ladies and gentlemen.because there is no rent receipt book,because he was there to collect the rent,because there was no tenant,because again,ladies and gentlemen,other than charles brown word,there is no proof of anthony wilson as a tenant.his name is not on the utility bills.
the district court again sustained defense counsel objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement.the prosecutor then stated 
so you have to choose in whom you going to place your trust,ladies and gentlemen,and you know in whom the defense placed their trust.they embraced the testimony 
defense counsel interrupted the prosecutor with an objection,which the court sustained.
none of these lines of argument was improper.isler burden shifting claim disregards the fact that brown testified at length and that all the defendants endorsed brown testimony in their closings.w hen a defendant puts his credibility at issue by testifying,the prosecution can comment on the implausibility of his testimony or its lack of evidentiary foundation.boulerice,at.here,the prosecutor merely called attention to the lack of supporting evidence for brown implausible assertions and attempted to highlight the fact that rival accounts had been presented to the jury.
in addition to burden shifting claims,isler also argues that the prosecutor improperly placed her prestige as a government officer behind the testimony of the police officers.the challenged comment came on the heels of suggestions by defense counsel that the officers testimony in particular partridge contained gaping inconsistencies which were indicative of fabrication.
the prosecutor began by recounting that the officers all remembered the significant matters the same way,that the differences in recollection were trivial,and that the jury should be more concerned if there wer
