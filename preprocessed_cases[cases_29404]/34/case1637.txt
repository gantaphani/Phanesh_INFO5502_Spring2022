a jury convicted lamont clinton king of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances,possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,and two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm.on appeal,king challenges his convictions on several grounds.we vacate one of his convictions and the accompanying sentence for being a felon in possession and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm in all other respects.
king convictions stem from two separate incidents,one occurring in greenville,north carolina and the other in wilmington,north carolina.we set forth the facts of each incident and then describe the pretrial and trial proceedings that followed.
on march,greenville police officers received information that two men planned to use a gray ford explorer to transport a large amount of heroin from the local bus station.the officers initiated surveillance of the station and observed two men drive away from the station in a gray ford explorer.the police followed the explorer to a nearby strip mall,at which the men left the car and entered a laundromat.shortly thereafter,the men returned with king and,after king placed a green gym bag in the explorer,the three men drove away together.when the officers stopped and searched the explorer,they found the green gym bag,which contained dosage units of heroin packaged in wax paper.the police arrested king and the other men.
two detectives then returned to the laundromat from which king had emerged and spoke with nina woods.after learning that woods shared an apartment with king,the detectives obtained her consent to search that apartment.within its sole bedroom,they found approximately plastic bags of cocaine and seven dosage units of heroin packaged in the same wax paper as the heroin found in the green gym bag that king had placed in the explorer.they also found cutting agent,one gram of marijuana packaged in a plastic bag,and a firearm.in the bedroom closet,they found two coffee grinders which drug traffickers often use to mix drugs and cutting agents,two boxes of bullets,and two more firearms.
the police subsequently interviewed king,and he admitted ownership of the cocaine,heroin,coffee grinders,cutting agent,and firearms.king was charged with various violations of state law,and after agreeing to cooperate with the police,king secured his release on bail.
nine months later,on december,shatiek bilal reported to wilmington police officers that king had kidnapped and assaulted him.bilal also told the officers that king rented an apartment at which bilal was living and that king kept drugs and guns at the apartment and in a separate storage unit.based on bilal information,the officers obtained a search warrant to the apartment,in which both king and bilal lived,and to the storage unit,to which only king had access.
after watching the apartment for approximately four hours,the police saw king enter the apartment with a woman at about on december.the officers then executed the search warrant.in a bedroom,in which king was lying near the bed,they found a box containing grams of crack cocaine packed in green dime bags,grams of heroin,and bags of marijuana.nearby they found digital scales,a heat sealer,and a handgun.in the same room they also found king identification card and state registration card bearing the apartment address.in another bedroom,containing bilal personal effects,the officers found one green dime bag of marijuana and a larger clear plastic bag containing similar green bags.the officers found no contraband in the storage unit.
when the officers interviewed king,he told the police that he knew nothing about the kidnapping or beating of bilal,and he denied responsibility for the contraband in the apartment.nevertheless,king was charged with bilal kidnapping and assault,along with drug trafficking and firearm possession in violation of state law.neither federal nor state authorities charged bilal with any crime arising from evidence found in the search.
a year later,all state charges against king were dismissed when a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging him with six federal crimes.the first three pertain to the greenville incident possession with intent to distribute cocaine,heroin,and marijuana in violation of a count one possession of three firearms after being convicted of a felony,in violation of g count two and using,carrying,and possessing a firearm,during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a i count three.the remaining three counts allege crimes assertedly committed in wilmington possession of crack cocaine,heroin,and marijuana with intent to distribute,in violation of a count four possession of a firearm after being convicted of a felony,in violation of g count five and using,carrying,and possessing a firearm,during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a i count six.the government did not bring any federal charges against king for his alleged assault and kidnapping of bilal.
from the outset of the wilmington proceedings,king moved to compel disclosure of all information regarding bilal and his cooperation with the police.the district court found king first motion for this evidence moot because the government already has been engaging in virtual open file document discovery.
months later,after this court consolidated the various charges pending against king and assigned the cases to another district judge,king renewed his motion to compel disclosure of all documents regarding bilal,including bilal grand jury testimony king also maintained that the government had suppressed exculpatory information regarding bilal trafficking charges and alleged perjury in new york.
with respect to the latter information,the government acknowledged that bilal had told a new york prosecutor something to the effect of i do want to go to north carolina.i was involved in anything down there.the government lawyer contended,however,that she had kept king prior defense counsel informed of bilal activities in new york.
as for bilal grand jury testimony,the prosecutor admitted that the government possessed,but had refused to produce,that testimony.the prosecutor maintained that the grand jury testimony contained no exculpatory information.the district court suggested that the government might want to disclose bilal grand jury testimony out of an abundance of precaution,but declined to order such disclosure because it did know what in the testimony regarding bilal and we have to rely on the government good faith in these situations.at no point did the court examine the grand jury transcript or rule on the materiality of the information contained in it.
at trial,the police officers testified to the evidence recovered in the greenville and wilmington searches,as outlined above.king testified in his own defense.
with respect to the greenville offenses,king admitted that he owned the cocaine and heroin,that he had cut and packaged the cocaine for distribution the night before its seizure,and that,although he knew he was a convicted felon,he owned two of the three firearms but king denied any link between the firearms and drug distribution,claiming that he had acquired the guns for protection after he had been burglarized.
as to the wilmington charges,king denied responsibility for the drugs and firearms found in the apartment he shared with bilal he claimed that bilal owned all of the contraband.king testified that although he paid rent on the apartment in which the police found him,only bilal lived there permanently.king further maintained that,on the night in question,he entered the apartment only to have relations with his female companion.although bilal had testified before the grand jury,he did not testify at trial.
the jury convicted king of all three greenville crimes counts one,two,and three and one of the wilmington crimes count five.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss counts four and six on which the jury could not reach agreement.at sentencing,the court applied an enhancement based on king alleged kidnapping of bilal and then imposed an aggregate sentence of months of imprisonment.
on appeal,king challenges two of his convictions growing out of the greenville search and the sole conviction arising from the wilmington search.
with respect to the greenville offenses,king contends that the charges as to counts one and three were duplicitous and that count three did not charge him with a crime.he also maintains that the convictions on both counts rested on insufficient evidence.all of these arguments lack merit.
at the outset,we note that king has waived his duplicity challenges because he failed to raise them prior to trial.see.b b requiring defendants to bring a motion alleging a defect in the indictment before trial united states price,cir finding duplicity challenge waived when brought after trial.only upon a showing of good cause can a defendant avoid waiving a forfeited duplicity claim.e.king has not even attempted to make such a showing here.
we must also reject king contention that count three failed to charge a violation of c.because this argument attacks the sufficiency of the indictment,and not merely its alleged duplicity,king failure to raise this argument before trial does not waive it.see.b b.but this failure restricts our review to plain error.see united states cotton,d.to demonstrate plain error,a defendant must demonstrate error that is plain and that affects his substantial rights.see united states olano,d.we will then exercise our discretion to reverse only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation omitted.moreover,we will construe the indictment liberally and indulge every intendment in support of its sufficiency.united states sutton,cir internal quotation omitted.
section c mandates that a court increase by five years the sentence of a drug offender who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm.c a.the statute thus penalizes two separate types of conduct the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a drug trafficking crime or the possession of a firearm in furtherance of such a crime.the indictment in this case omitted the statute in furtherance of language,alleging only that king used,carried,and possessed a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking.king argues that this impermissibly relaxed the nexus to trafficking required for conviction under the statute.
given the rigorous plain error standard,king can not prevail.an error qualifies as plain only if it contravenes the settled law of the supreme court or this circuit.united states reid,cir internal quotation omitted.king has not pointed to,nor has our research revealed,any binding precedent supporting his claim that the language omitted from the indictment creates plain error in fact,our sister circuits disagree on whether an indictment mixing of the elements of c use and carry and possession prongs constitutes reversible error.compare united states combs,cir reversing conviction because the indictment confused the elements of c prongs with united states harvey,cir affirming conviction united states avery,cir same.given the dearth of binding authority,king can not possibly demonstrate plain error.
accordingly,king challenges to the indictment fail.
king additionally maintains that his convictions on counts one and three rest on insufficient evidence.in assessing sufficiency of the evidence,we affirm if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the verdict is supported by substantial evidence.united states smith,cir quoting united states burgos,cir en banc.substantial evidence consists of evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting burgos,at.throughout our review,we assume that the jury resolved any conflicting evidence in the prosecution favor.united states jeffers,cir.
king argues that we should reverse his conviction on count one for possession with intent to distribute cocaine,heroin,and marijuana because the jury unreasonably concluded that the evidence established intent to distribute marijuana.he points out that at trial the police officers admitted that the quantity of marijuana found in his greenville apartment was consistent with personal use and that they found no marijuana packaging material.
this argument also fails.this is so because of the overwhelming king own his intent to distribute illegal narcotics.indeed,the police seized from king bedroom plastic bags of cocaine,seven dosage units of heroin,cutting agent,and three firearms,one of which was found close to the bag of marijuana.after his arrest,king admitted ownership of the cocaine,heroin,cutting agent,and firearms,and he later testified that he intended to distribute the cocaine.this undisputed evidence of king cocaine trafficking tended to show the existence of a continuing narcotics business and therefore to show king knowledge of the drug trade.united states hodge,cir.from this evidence of king participation in the drug trade,the jury could draw an inference that king intended to sell all of the drugs in his the marijuana see united states rooks,cir.the presence of the firearm next to the marijuana further supports this inference of distribution.see united states fisher,cir.
accordingly,although a small amount of marijuana found alone would not itself justify a finding of distribution,see united states fountain,cir,the evidence in this case,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,suffices to sustain the jury verdict.
sufficient evidence similarly supports king conviction on count three for violation of c,use of a firearm in a drug offense.we have made clear that there are many factors that might lead a fact finder to conclude that a connection existed between a firearm and drug trafficking activity.united states lomax,cir.these include the type of weapon,the status of the possession legitimate or illegal,and the firearm proximity to drugs.id.internal quotation omitted.
all three of these factors support the jury verdict on count three in this case.first,all of the firearms were handguns and so uniquely suited for drug transactions.see united states lipford,cir.second,king admitted that he knew his prior felony conviction barred him from legally possessing firearms.third,king stored the firearms in the same room as the drugs,and one gun rested on the headboard of the bed next to the marijuana.based on this evidence,the jury was entitled to conclude that king possessed the firearms in furtherance of his drug trafficking crimes.
finally,we turn to king challenge to count five possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,the only conviction growing out of the wilmington search.throughout this case,king has steadfastly contended that the gun and other contraband in the wilmington apartment belonged not to him,but to bilal.and king has repeatedly asked the government to reveal its information about bilal,which king believes will substantiate his claim.king maintains that the government failure to do so violates brady maryland,d,which requires a court to vacate a conviction and order a new trial if it finds that the prosecution suppressed materially exculpatory evidence.to secure relief under brady,a defendant must identify the existence of evidence favorable to the accused show that the government suppressed the evidence and demonstrate that the suppression was material.monroe angelone,cir.the burden of proof rests with the defendant.see united states stokes,cir.in reviewing the district court denial of king brady motion,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.walker kelly,cir.
king first contends that the prosecution violated brady by failing to timely disclose bilal arraignment on drug trafficking charges in new york,bilal alleged perjury at his brother assault trial,and bilal statement to the new york district attorney that he was involved in anything down in north carolina.king assertions on these points
