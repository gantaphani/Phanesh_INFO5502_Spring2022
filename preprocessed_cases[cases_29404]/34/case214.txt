plaintiff appellant frank gay gay appeals from the denial of a new trial in this insurance coverage case.he argues that the district court erred when it permitted a defense expert witness to present testimony claimed to be beyond the scope of his expert report.there was a verdict for defendant,stonebridge life insurance company stonebridge.gay motion was denied by the district court,and on appeal he presents the same argument.after review,we affirm.
background 
gay is the brother of the late anita gay anita and executor of her estate.her death occurred during a trip she took to a casino in lincoln,rhode island.while at the casino,anita fell.when medical personnel arrived to treat her,she was unconscious and appeared to have suffered a head injury from the fall.she was transported to a local hospital,but when her condition deteriorated she was transferred to rhode island hospital in providence.she died the next day.
the hospital records listed anita death as an accident,and stated that she died as the result of a nonsurvivable closed head injury that caused extensive bleeding in her brain.her body was released to the rhode island office of state medical examiners to determine a more precise cause of death.an autopsy was performed by george lauro,a forensic pathologist with that office.the limited autopsy report that he prepared recorded the cause of death as fractured skull with subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage following acute cerebral hemorrhage.the death certificate prepared by lauro reports the same cause of death.the autopsy report stated that anita manner of death was an accident,from having collapsed at race track.
gay made a timely demand for payment of benefits under three insurance policies issued to anita by stonebridge.gay sought to recover the amount due under the policies,plus payment for one day of hospitalization,for a total of.each of the polices provided for payment only in the event of accidental death which was a direct and independent cause of death.in the event of accidental death,the aggregate value of the policies totaled,plus an additional for each day of hospitalization.stonebridge denied the benefit based on its conclusion that anita death was not accidental within the meaning of the policies.it determined that the occurrence of a stroke which likely caused the fall pushed her claim outside the accidental death coverage of the policies.
gay filed suit for breach of contract,arguing that anita death was accidental as documented by the hospital records and autopsy reports.stonebridge countered that those records in fact demonstrated that anita did not die from an accident,but that her death was caused primarily by the stroke that she suffered.stonebridge indicated that it intended to call an expert witness,paul rizzoli,to testify that her death was attributable to the stroke,and timely disclosed rizzoli report.see.a b.in relevant part,rizzoli opined that it is difficult to be clear based on the autopsy description,however,the amount of bleeding described seems out of proportion to that which could be expected on the basis of trauma alone.cerebral hemorrhage can range from unapparent to fatal in its manifestations.thus,it is difficult to separate out which aspects of this situation related to which issue.however,that cerebral hemorrhage presented in this case seems certain.i t indeed is correct to conclude that a preceding stroke did in fact lead to unconsciousness,that as a result,the patient fell sustaining a serious head injury,and that the stroke was a contributing cause of death.
emphasis added.
the central issue in dispute was whether the circumstances of anita death precluded coverage under the policies.the insurance policies provided for coverage if the death was caused by an accident directly and independently of all other causes,and denied coverage if the death was caused by an injury due to disease,bodily or mental infirmity,or medical or surgical treatment of these.at the final pretrial hearing,the court ruled that this policy language required gay to prove that the skull fracture resulting from the fall was the direct cause of anita death independent of any preceding medical condition that is,that the fall,as opposed to the stroke,was the dominant cause of her death.because the evidence indicated that more than one factor contributed to anita death the stroke and the skull fracture gay bore the burden of separating out the consequential causes from the inconsequential causes of her death.
the court explained that if gay proved the accident was the prime or dominant cause of death even if an illness or preexisting disease such as a stroke had contributed to the accident he would be entitled to recover under the policies.that ruling is not the subject of this appeal.
at trial,gay argued that the head injury caused by anita fall was the dominant cause of death.in support of this claim,he presented the death certificate,the deposition transcript of the coroner,lauro,and the testimony of a neurologist,matthew gold.each of these sources provided evidence that the skull fracture was the cause of anita death.
in response,stonebridge expert,rizzoli,opined that the skull fracture contributed to anita death,but was not a major cause of death.he elaborated,testifying that the skull fracture as described does seem like a mortal wound.gay moved to strike this testimony because rizzoli had only been asked whether the skull fracture had contributed to causing anita death,not whether it had been a major cause of her death,but the motion was denied.on,rizzoli conceded that his report did not expressly indicate that the skull fracture was not a mortal wound,or that the stroke was a major,as opposed to a contributing,cause of anita death.gay renewed his motion to strike rizzoli testimony,which again was denied.at the end of the trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of stonebridge.gay moved for a new trial pursuant to.a,arguing that stonebridge had failed to adequately disclose rizzoli opinion prior to trial as required by.a b,which rendered rizzoli conclusion that the skull fracture was not a major cause of death inadmissable under.c.the district court denied the motion,finding that the conclusion had been adequately presented in the report and that there was neither error nor prejudice resulting from the admission of rizzoli testimony.
gay argues now that the testimony was erroneously admitted and that,but for this error,he may have prevailed in what he describes as an extremely close case.he asserts that he would have presented his case differently had he known that stonebridge intended to introduce live expert witness testimony that the skull fracture was not the dominant cause of anita death.in particular,he contends that rather than simply rebutting rizzoli testimony by reading lauro deposition transcript,he would have called lauro as a witness to supplement gold testimony.

gay contends that rizzoli exceeded the bounds of his report when he testified that the skull fracture was not a major cause of anita death because it was not a mortal wound he contends that this testimony was inconsistent with rizzoli previous description of anita skull fracture as a significant and serious injury.gay submits that rizzoli report was limited to the conclusion that the stroke was a contributing cause of anita death,which implied nothing about the relative significance of the skull fracture or the dominant cause of death.to bolster this argument,gay relies on rizzoli statement that it is difficult to separate out which aspect of this situation related to which issue.gay argues that rizzoli testimony should have been limited to just opining that the stroke contributed to anita death,nothing more.gay claims that when rizzoli testified that the skull fracture was not a major cause of death,he necessarily implied that the stroke anita allegedly suffered was the dominant cause of her death.because that conclusion was never disclosed in the expert report,gay concludes,the district court erred in allowing this testimony.
the district court disagreed,finding that rizzoli report adequately presaged his trial testimony and,therefore,that rule was satisfied.the court determined that rizzoli report was sufficiently thorough to indicate the general boundaries of his direct examination and to put the plaintiff on notice that the stroke was the primary cause of gay death emphasis added.after carefully reviewing both the expert report and the trial testimony,we readily conclude that the district court did not err in admitting rizzoli testimony,because it fell within the scope of his previously disclosed report.neither the expert report nor the trial testimony are as limited as gay claims.rizzoli expert report concluded,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that anita suffered a cerebral hemorrhage which led to unconsciousness and that this event led to a fall with head injury.to support that conclusion,rizzoli cited anita preexisting hypertension,her reported nausea before the events,which is symptomatic of deep brain hemorrhage,her significant injury,which suggested that she had lost consciousness before falling,and the amount of bleeding in the autopsy report,which seemed out of proportion to that which could be expected on the basis of trauma alone.the district court summarized rizzoli report as containing at least three relevant conclusions 
that cerebral hemorrhage presented in this case seems certain 
the amount of bleeding described seems out of proportion to that which could be expected on the basis of trauma alone and 
it is my opinion that a preceding hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage did in fact lead to unconsciousness,that as a result the patient fell sustaining a serious head injury,and that the hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage was a contributing cause of death.
gay focuses on the last portion of the third conclusion that the hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage was a contributing cause of death to argue that rizzoli had no opinion about whether the stroke was the dominant cause of anita death,but instead had only concluded that the stroke was a contributing cause of her death.gay argument asks us to all but ignore the information conveyed by the other conclusions.it is clear that rizzoli opinion expressed in the report was that fundamentally anita suffered from a stroke.while his report suggested that both the stroke and the skull fracture contributed to anita death,and never explicitly stated that the stroke was the dominant cause of death,rizzoli report clearly focused on the stroke 
although his testimony uses different words than the expert report,it was a reasonable elaboration of the opinion disclosed in the report,that the amount of bleeding described seems out of proportion to that which would be expected on the basis of trauma alone.see muldrow ex rel.muldrow re direct,explaining how rule permits an expert to supplement,explain and elaborate on material contained in his report see also thompson doane pet care,cir same.
we fail to see any abuse of discretion in the district court determination that,based on the expert report,gay reasonably could have anticipated rizzoli testimony and,therefore,could not have been unfairly surprised to warrant striking the challenged testimony.see licciardi tig ins.grp,cir excluding expert witness testimony when the expert has changed his opinion on an important aspect of the case.
because we conclude that the district court did not err when it decided to admit rizzoli testimony,there is no need to assess whatever harm that evidence allegedly caused.still,we agree with the district court finding that gay was not prejudiced by any differences in rizzoli report and his testimony,given all of the evidence of anita stroke.gay in fact offset rizzoli opinion with substantial evidence of his own,including the opinions of two other doctors,the death certificate,the autopsy report,and the records from both hospitals which treated anita following her fall,to support his position that anita had died from a nonsurvivable closed head injury.nor was there any offer of proof that lauro would testify as unequivocally as gay hypothesizes.given the totality of the evidence,including the difficult credibility assessments that the jury necessarily resolved,rizzoli testimony can not reasonably be understood as the pivotal evidence that tipped the verdict in favor of stonebridge.see rubert torres,at.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the parties agree that acute cerebral hemorrhage means stroke,as the latter term is commonly used.the parties agree that acute cerebral hemorrhage means stroke,as the latter term is commonly used.
