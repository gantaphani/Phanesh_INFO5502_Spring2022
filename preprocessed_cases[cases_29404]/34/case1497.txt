following a bench trial,the district court convicted defendant karen kimble of numerous charges stemming from her submission of fraudulent immigration and tax filings to various state and federal agencies over a nearly span.seeking to overturn her conviction,defendant argues that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence obtained following a search of her home pursuant to a validly issued warrant.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court correctly admitted this evidence,which together with additional evidence offered at trial provided sufficient support for the trial court guilty verdict on each of the government charges against defendant.accordingly,we affirm.
a summary of the facts proven at trial,as found by the district court,follows.between and,defendant perpetrated a series of schemes that ultimately led to her indictment on charges ranging from tax and visa application fraud to aggravated identity theft.first,in the fall of,defendant participated in a marriage and immigration fraud scheme with tamim mamah,a native of ghana.according to the government,after mamah earlier attempt to obtain a green card by means of a fraudulent marriage failed,defendant filed,under mamah first wife name,for a divorce from mamah.thereafter,defendant submitted a new green card application on mamah behalf using a marriage certificate listing herself as mamah wife.
during roughly the same period,in september,defendant committed perjury in connection with her testimony in the criminal trial of mamah brother,who was charged with importing heroin in his luggage on a flight from ghana.at that trial,defendant testified that she traveled with mamah brother to ghana in.in particular,defendant testified that,during that trip,she observed numerous individuals visit the brother home,which she asserted was customary in ghana.the defense relied on defendant testimony as evidence that someone other than mamah brother packed his luggage and placed the heroin in his bag.however,a subsequent review of defendant travel records revealed that she did not travel to africa during the period in question.
finally,beginning in february and continuing through at least april,defendant submitted numerous fraudulent tax returns for herself and others.in addition to inflating her own refunds,defendant who falsely held herself out as a certified tax preparer filed returns on behalf of others that included artificially inflated credits and deductions.defendant provided the taxpayers with versions of the returns that did not include the inflated figures and kept the excess refunds,which totaled roughly.during the course of her tax fraud scheme,defendant committed identity theft on at least four occasions.
in july,the department of homeland security homeland security obtained a search warrant in connection with its investigation of defendant marriage and immigration fraud and perjury.in an accompanying affidavit,the government asserted probable cause to believe that defendant home contained evidence of perjury,marriage and immigration fraud,and false statements,in violation of,and and c.entitled items to be seized from defendant residence,attachment b to the warrant affidavit averred that the requested search would enable the government to seize a ny and all records and documents relating to the travel of defendant to ghana in including but not limited to documents,correspondence,notes,statements,receipts or other records that reference or indicate the fraudulent activity and items evidencing the obtaining,secreting,transferring,concealment expenditure of illegal proceeds and currency to include cash.
homeland security agents executed the search warrant on july.at the beginning of the search,the agents asked defendant if she had any valuables in the house,to which defendant replied that there was some cash in a laundry basket.defendant then led the agents to the cash,which was contained in a bag in a laundry basket in the home and totaled more than.when the agents inquired as to the source of the funds,defendant told the agents that the cash did not belong to her.rather,she said that,at mamah request,she had retrieved the cash from a stranger about a week earlier and was holding it for mamah.aware mamah was detained on unrelated narcotics distribution charges,the agents seized the cash on suspicion that it derived from mamah alleged drug activity.
several months later,defendant filed a claim to recover the seized funds.at odds with the explanation she gave at the time of the initial seizure,defendant claimed that the cash was proceeds of an insurance claim she filed after her home was damaged in a fire.their suspicions piqued by defendant revised account,investigators subpoenaed defendant bank records in an attempt to confirm the source of the seized funds.after reviewing the records,however,investigators found numerous deposits from the internal revenue service,which they later determined to be the inflated refunds obtained through defendant tax fraud scheme.
after further investigation,the government charged defendant in a indictment with six counts of wire fraud,in violation of five counts of making a false statement on a tax return,in violation of five counts of aiding and assisting in the making of a false tax return,in violation of four counts of aggravated identity theft,in violation of and one count of visa application fraud,in violation of a 
on may,defendant moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the july search of her home.specifically,defendant argued that the warrant supporting that search addressed only the government investigation of her alleged perjury,such that much of the property seized during the search in particular,the in cash exceeded the scope of the warrant.in defendant view,because the cash was improperly seized,any evidence obtained as result of her subsequent efforts to reclaim the seized funds,bank records and other tax records documenting defendant submission of fraudulent tax returns amounted to fruit of the illegal seizure and therefore was subject to exclusion at trial.after defendant waived her right to a jury trial,the district court elected to hear evidence and argument regarding the suppression motion at trial.
a bench trial followed,during which the district court heard testimony from defendant alleged victims and officials from the various federal agencies involved in the investigations that precipitated defendant prosecution.among those witnesses,homeland security special agent eli bupp testified that,in executing the search of defendant residence,agents sought to obtain d ocuments and evidence related to marriage fraud and visa fraud,and other travel documents.bupp characterized the heading in attachment b,which focused on documents and records relating to defendant purported travel to ghana,as a drafting error that was not meant to limit the scope of the search.the government also emphasized that the affidavit supporting the warrant included representations regarding the government basis for believing that defendant not only committed perjury,but also committed visa and marriage fraud and made false statements to authorities.
at the close of evidence,defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.defendant subsequently withdrew her rule motion as to the immigration fraud charge,and the district court denied defendant motion as to the remaining charges.the district court further denied defendant motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the july search and,in a comprehensive written opinion,convicted defendant on all counts.the district court later sentenced defendant to a total of months incarceration,prompting this timely appeal.
defendant raises two issues on appeal.first,she argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress the in cash seized from her home in the course of the july search,as well as any incriminating evidence obtained as a result of that initial seizure.second,defendant challenges the denial of her motion for judgment of acquittal on the government wire and tax fraud charges.we consider these proposed grounds for reversal in turn.
we turn first to the parties evidentiary dispute.defendant does not challenge the validity of the warrant authorizing the search of her home in july.instead,defendant argues that the valid warrant did not permit the agents to seize the cash found in the laundry basket.defendant challenge thus calls on us to consider whether the seizure exceeded the scope of the warrant.in so doing,we review the district court legal conclusions regarding the scope of the warrant de novo and the factual findings underlying those conclusions for clear error.united states phillips,cir.
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures and provides that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.although the fourth amendment does not expressly preclud e the use of evidence obtained in violation of its protections,arizona evans,courts have long relied on the judicially created exclusionary rule to ensure that evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment can not be used in a criminal proceeding against the victim of the illegal search and seizure,united states calandra,citing authorities.this prohibition applies as well to the fruits of any illegally seized evidence.id.
it is axiomatic that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant is limited in scope by the terms of the warrant authorization.phillips,at citing authorities.thus,a valid warrant must particularly describe the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.united states uzenski,cir.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states robinson,cir.this particularity requirement protects against a general,exploratory rummaging in a person belongings,to the extent that a valid warrant leaves nothing to the discretion of the officers performing the search.id.quoting robinson,at.as such,even when law enforcement officers conduct a search pursuant to a valid warrant,the officers can not grossly exceed the scope of a search warrant in seizing property.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
at the same time,we have long recognized that a search warrant is not a constitutional strait jacket.phillips,at quoting united states dornhofer,cir.rather,we employ a commonsense and realistic approach in interpreting warrants,and avoid hypertechnical scrutiny lest police officers be encouraged to forgo the warrant application process altogether.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also united states williams,cir.same.
defendant argues that the agents seizure of the cash in this case violated the fourth amendment because the warrant permitted the agents to seize evidence relating only to her purported travel to ghana with her the subject of her perjured testimony.in support,defendant points to the prefatory language in attachment b to the warrant,which included a list of items to be seized preceded by the phrase a ny and all records and documents relating to the travel of defendant to ghana in.defendant argues that the seizure of the cash which,at the time of the seizure,the agents admittedly believed to be linked to unrelated drug activity exceeded the scope of the warrant because it could not have related to defendant alleged perjury.defendant further contends that the additional evidence developed by investigators after defendant later sought to reclaim the seized funds must be suppressed as fruit of the illegal seizure.appellant br.at.
in response,the government emphasizes that,in determining whether a search or seizure exceeds the scope of a warrant,our inquiry is one of practical,rather than hypertechnical,accuracy.appellee br.at citing united states gary,cir.read holistically,the government argues,the warrant and supporting affidavit make clear that investigators were authorized to seize evidence of perjury and marriage or immigration fraud during their search.we agree.
on its face,the warrant application indicates that the proposed search is related to a violation of not only the federal statutes criminalizing perjury and false declarations before a grand jury the offenses related to defendant purported travel to ghana but also marriage fraud,false statement s,and procurement of cit i zenship or naturalization unlawfully.likewise,the warrant itself lists the property to be seized as the f ruits,evidence and instrumentalities of marriage fraud,false statement s,unlawful procurement of citizenship,and perjury.
to be sure,both the government application and the resulting warrant also incorporate by reference attachment b when describing the property to be seized during the course of the government search.and defendant correctly notes that the attachment refers most directly to evidence of defendant purported travel to ghana.nonetheless,its prefatory language notwithstanding,attachment b did not limit the items subject to seizure to potential evidence of defendant alleged misrepresentations regarding her overseas travel.for example,among the items identified as subject to seizure are records of vehicles titled in defendant or mamah name documents and correspondence referring to or indicating fraudulent activity and all manner of financial records or other evidence of obtaining,concealing,or spending illegal proceeds.
much the same,the affidavit supporting the warrant application not only includes detailed allegations regarding defendant perjury,but also describes at length the government investigation of defendant efforts to fraudulently obtain a green card for mamah.that section of the affidavit concludes,your affiant believes that in defendant home there is evidence of violations of various federal marriage and visa fraud statutes.in sum,a practical and reading of the warrant establishes that the government authority in executing the search was not as limited as defendant maintains.instead,by its express terms,the warrant permitted the government to seize from defendant residence potential evidence of both defendant false statements in connection with her september testimony about her purported trip to ghana and her marriage and immigration fraud.
apart from seeking to narrow the scope of the warrant,defendant argues that even if the warrant encompassed evidence related to her alleged marriage and immigration fraud the seizure of the cash violated the fourth amendment because the agents initially seized it as evidence of suspected drug activity,not as evidence of any of the offenses set forth in the warrant.we disagree.
t he scope of a search conducted pursuant to a warrant is defined objectively by the terms of the warrant and the evidence sought,not by the subjective motivations of an officer.williams,at citing authorities see also united states srivastava,cir.in analyzing the constitutionality of a search warrant execution,we must conduct an objective assessment of the executing officer actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,rather than make a subjective evaluation of the officer actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted quoting maryland macon.accordingly,to determine whether the agents lawfully seized the cash in defendant laundry basket,we must consider whether the seized cash objectively constituted potential f ruits,evidence and instrumentalities of marriage fraud,false statement s,unlawful procurement of citizenship,or perjury.or,as set out in attachment b,whether a reasonable officer conducting the search could believe the cash to constitute potential evidenc e of the obtaining,secreting,transferring,concealment expenditure of illegal proceeds of such crimes.we conclude that a reasonable officer could.
although not every item that falls within the language of the warrant will prove probative in a future criminal prosecution,the evidentiary significance of each and every item may not be instantly apparent during the course of a search.phillips,at.as a result,items
