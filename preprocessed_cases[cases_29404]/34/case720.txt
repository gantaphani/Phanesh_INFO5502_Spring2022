dale chester browne,a citizen of kitts,was indicted along with a number of other defendants in federal district court in puerto rico.by a superseding indictment filed on april,the grand jury charged browne in five counts with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,bank fraud,two deliveries of a controlled substance,and conspiracy to engage in money laundering.a,a b i ii,h.in substance,browne was charged with participating over an extended period in a cocaine importation scheme and in the concealment of proceeds.
on november,browne pled guilty to the two conspiracy drug conspiracy and the money laundering to a plea agreement.under the agreement,the remaining counts were dismissed and the parties stipulated to the quantity of cocaine and laundered funds and to various upward and downward adjustments.the guilty plea encompassed the usual proceedings including browne agreement to facts establishing a basis for the plea.see.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.sentencing was set for may.
on march,four months after the guilty plea and two months before sentencing,browne counsel filed a written motion on his behalf to withdraw his guilty plea.the motion contained a melange of general claims unsupported by facts,defendant was not afforded adequate opportunity to prepare for trial,was denied adequate opportunity to obtain necessary information.included among them,also without any details,was the assertion that the government discriminated against browne during negotiations for being black,and a citizen of another country.
the government responded by denying in the strongest terms possible that browne race or citizenship entered into its plea negotiations but pointed out that the lack of detail in browne motion made it impossible to offer a more detailed response.the district court denied browne motion without further proceedings.in its detailed opinion,the court noted inter alia that browne motion offered nothing but unsupported allegations,that the plea transcript showed that his plea had been fully discussed and was voluntary,and that the delay in making the motion counted against it.
at the sentencing hearing on may,the district court sentenced browne to years imprisonment,consistent with the facts in the plea agreement.as the judge closed the hearing,browne stated to the judge you violate the rights.you violate the rights here.the judge warned browne that he might be subjecting himself to contempt if he continued.then,apparently as the marshal was leading browne out of the courtroom,browne said son of a bitch,damn it.
the judge then directed the marshal to bring browne back in court.browne counsel asked,may we approach the bench in response,the judge stated 
no sir,you may not approach the bench.bring the defendant back to court.let the record reflect that after we finished his sentence,the defendant was handcuffed and as he was being led out by the marshals,he started saying out loud to everybody in the courtroom,that his rights were being violated.at that time,the court did not take any action.nevertheless,when he was being led from the door of this courtroom to the holding pens which are across the hallway,he started saying that i am a son of a bitch and i am not going to stand for that from you or anybody else.we are a country of law and order.you have your rights.you can continue with the appeal if you are not satisfied with the sentence i imposed,but i am not going to tolerate that.having committed a crime in my presence,a criminal contempt for having called me a son of a bitch,you are hereby ordered and you are hereby detained and you are hereby sentenced to an additional six months in jail consecutive to the two hundred and months that i just sentenced you.
browne has now appealed from the judgment of conviction and sentence,urging that the district court erred in not affording him an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and that the contempt sentence should be vacated for two reasons that the district court erred in finding browne in contempt and that he was denied his alleged due process right to allocute in the contempt proceeding.we consider first the motion to withdraw and then the contempt proceeding.
a guilty plea entered after a full rule colloquy can not be withdrawn at will but only with the district court permission upon the showing of a fair and just reason for withdrawal.e.the cases provide criteria to be considered,united states,cir,but no discussion of them is required here because browne appellate claim is narrowly focused he claims that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing on his claim of discrimination on the part of the prosecutor.
we will assume arguendo,as we have in an earlier case,that newly discovered racial discrimination by the prosecutor in negotiating a guilty plea might well furnish a fair and just reason for a defendant to withdraw his prior guilty plea before sentencing.see united states,cir.and,although this is very doubtful,we will also assume for argument sake that browne did in fact ask for an evidentiary hearing on his discrimination charge the latter assumption affects only the choice between plenary and plain error review on appeal and,in this instance,there was no error under any standard.
ordinarily,the grant or denial of an evidentiary hearing in a plea withdrawal proceeding is said to be confided to the discretion of the trial judge and can be overturned only for abuse,united states winston,cir or,if no request was made,only for plain error,a yet more demanding test,see united states olano,d.in practice,one would expect the judge to take evidence in some not necessarily through a there were an adequate tender and if the facts to be adduced were critical to the proper disposition of the motion.in this case,the tender was not even arguably adequate to warrant a hearing,let alone to make its denial an abuse of discretion or plain error.
at best,browne motion hints that after his guilty plea he may have learned that the government did not prosecute certain persons mentioned as present during some transactions involved in browne drug conspiracy.nothing else of even a vaguely factual character appears in his motion to explain the basis for his charge of racial or nationality discrimination.nothing whatsoever is said as to what specifically browne expected to prove at any evidentiary hearing,who would be called,what areas would be covered,and why such a hearing might be expected to be productive.
this is so far from being an adequate basis for demanding an evidentiary proceeding that no fine lines need be drawn.no matter how serious the general charge,an evidentiary hearing is warranted only if it has some prospect of being productive.united states isom,cir.in this case,proof that the government did not prosecute some individuals who had been mentioned by one witness or other would prove nothing whatsoever as to racial discrimination.beyond that,browne request was simply a fishing expedition.
this brings us to the contempt issues.by statute,a federal court has authority to punish by fine or imprisonment several broadly framed classes of conduct as contempt of court one of these embraces m isbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.a jury trial is required if the sentence is for more than six months,see codispoti pennsylvania,d,but that limitation does not control this case.and contempt may be punished summarily where it occurs in the actual presence of the court.a.
summarily,in this context,means without delaying to provide for formal charges or a formal trial.nevertheless,rule a dictates certain procedures,in particular,a requirement for by the judge,not necessarily to the exclusion of other requirements not listed in the rule.although appellate review of summary contempt orders is sometimes described as for abuse of discretion,a more exact statement is that factual findings are reviewable for clear error,pure questions of law de novo,and mixed questions by a less certain standard.united states winter,cir,cert.denied,d.
in this case,browne offers both substantive and proce
