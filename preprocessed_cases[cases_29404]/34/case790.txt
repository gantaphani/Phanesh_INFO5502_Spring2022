freddie gonzalez appeals from his conviction,after a jury trial before judge scheindlin,on four counts of intentional murder while engaged in a trafficking crime involving five or more kilograms of cocaine,in violation of e and.he was sentenced to concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on each count.
appellant challenges his conviction on several grounds.through counsel,he argues that i his confession was obtained in violation of his fifth and sixth amendment rights ii judge scheindlin should not have excluded a potentially exculpatory statement by the child of one of the murder victims and iii his trial counsel failure to locate a potential defense witness constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.appellant,in a pro se brief,raises additional claims of allegedly improper witness identification procedures and destruction of physical evidence.we hold that appellant inculpatory statements were admissible under the safe harbor provided by c.his additional arguments have no merit.we therefore affirm.
background 
a the four murders 
because appellant was convicted by a jury,we view the evidence and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the government.see united states heras,cir citing jackson virginia.
the evidence against appellant included signed confessions he made to government agents while serving a term of imprisonment for an unrelated offense.we will discuss the circumstances of these statements in more detail infra.the government case also included the testimony of alejandro rodriguez,a cooperating witness from appellant former gang,and police reports and physical evidence from the murder investigations.
the murders took place over the course of five months in early and were part of a drug war between rival gangs in the bronx,new york.appellant,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,was a member of a gang that sold cocaine out of an apartment complex.the gang obtained its supply in part by robbing other dealers.two of the murders were of a rival drug dealer and his wife.the other murders took place during robberies.
the rival dealer,named carmelo vichan gonzalez,no relation to appellant hereinafter carmelo,had run a distribution ring out of the same apartment complex,but appellant had taken over that location for his own drug business.carmelo was trying to reestablish his business,and,believing that it was a situation,appellant sent two of his associates on an unsuccessful mission to kill carmelo in february.on august,appellant and members of his gang went to carmelo home,broke in,went up to carmelo room,and shot him and his wife to death while they were asleep in bed.carmelo young son was asleep in the next room with carmelo brother vincent.when the police arrived,they interviewed both vincent and the child.ballistics analysis and autopsies of carmelo and his wife revealed that they had been shot by four different weapons rare,bullets were recovered from each of them.
on september,appellant went with three associates to rob a suspected drug dealer named clement bedword.when bedword resisted getting into appellant minivan,appellant shot him and pulled him into the vehicle.the men took bedword to a wooded area in yonkers,threw him out of the van,and shot him again.the men then returned to his apartment and took drugs,guns,and money.the police found shell casings near bedword body and,upon entering his apartment,found a scale and a bulletproof vest but no drugs or money the apartment appeared to have been burglarized.bullet casings recovered from the woods matched those from the earlier bronx shooting.
the fourth and final murder was of carlos polanco,another drug dealer.on november,appellant,rodriguez,and several others went to polanco home to rob it.polanco refused entry,and the gang fatally shot him.the subsequent investigation uncovered several,bullets in polanco as well as caliber shells that matched those found at the carmelo murder site.
in october,appellant attempted to murder another drug dealer,henry perez,during a robbery on long island.appellant,rodriguez,and several other men drove to perez house.the men attempted to grab perez when he arrived,shooting him when he appeared to pull a gun.the bag perez was carrying turned out not to have drugs in it,and the men drove away.
b confessions 
years later,on july,appellant was indicted,and an arrest warrant for him was issued,for the murder of polanco.the next day,while incarcerated and being held for deportation at mcrae correctional facility in georgia on unrelated federal immigration offense,he was visited by federal and state agents.these were criminal investigator billy ralat of the united states attorney office,former nypd detective stefano braccini,and yonkers detectives john geiss and wilson gonzalez no relation to appellant.a writ ad prosequendum was lodged on july,the next business day.
ralat,who is bilingual,led the interview and initially spoke in spanish,which only he and detective gonzalez spoke.the door to the interview room was shut,but unlocked,although appellant claims that he did not know this.after an initial conversation,which began shortly after am,ralat gave appellant a miranda form.appellant indicated that he understood his rights but wrote no next to the inquiry as to whether he was willing to answer questions.the form was signed at am.according to the agents,ralat then told appellant that the interview was over,and the agents began to leave.one or more agents told appellant that they would see him in new york and that he would not be returning to the dominican republic.appellant then said he wanted to speak to the agents and told them not to leave.
the agents accounts of what happened next are slightly varied.each stated that they decided to read the miranda warnings to appellant again.ralat testified that he proceeded to describe the benefits of cooperation and appellant option of going to trial but did not question him for another minutes.ralat gave appellant a second miranda form,this one in english which appellant spoke,and appellant answered s√≠ to each question.this form was signed at pm.
appellant contends that he was questioned regarding the murders both before and after the first miranda form was signed.ralat stated,however,that questioning commenced only after the second miranda form was signed,after which point the conversation switched to english,with detective geiss,who spoke no spanish,participating as well.
appellant eventually signed three confessions written in spanish.the first confession,regarding the murder of polanco,was dated pm at the beginning and pm at the signature block.the second,regarding the murders of carmelo and his wife,notes times of and pm for its beginning and end.the final confession,regarding the murder of bedword,was noted as beginning at pm and ending at pm.appellant did not ask for an attorney during the interview.
c trial proceedings 
appellant moved to suppress the written confessions before trial,claiming that the interrogation had been coercive and that he had invoked his rights to counsel and to remain silent.after briefing and oral argument,the district court denied his motion.in a written opinion,the court held that appellant rights had not been violated because he had reinitiated contact after the first miranda form and the confession had been obtained before expiration of a safe harbor period for questioning between arrest and presentment.
the district court also granted the government motion in limine to exclude a police report containing the testimony of carmelo young son regarding the murder of carmelo and his wife.the court found that there was no evidence the child had actually seen the shooting and that the police officer had been improperly suggestive in his questioning.gonzalez was convicted by the jury on all four counts of murder,and the district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of life imprisonment on each count.
discussion 
we first discuss the arguments by counsel i that appellant confession was erroneously admitted because it was obtained in violation of his fifth and sixth amendment rights ii that the district court exclusion of the testimony of carmelo son was error and iii that his trial counsel failure to locate an eyewitness to the bedword murder constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
a admission of gonzalez confessions 
we review a district court decision on a suppression motion de novo on questions of law and for clear error in factual determinations.united states stewart,cir.under clear error review,we uphold findings of fact that are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.united states reilly,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer.
miranda analysis 
appellant claims first that his confessions were obtained in violation of his miranda rights,because he indicated on the first miranda waiver form that he was not willing to answer questions.see generally miranda arizona.statements obtained in violation of miranda are of course subject to a prophylactic rule of exclusion.dickerson united states.once miranda rights have been invoked,interrogation must stop and the invocation must be scrupulously honored.michigan mosley.however,a waiver can occur subsequent to an initial invocation of miranda rights if the suspect reinitiates communication.edwards arizona,wood ercole,cir.
the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant waiver of miranda rights was knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.colorado connelly,miranda,at.whether a waiver occurred is determined by viewing the totality of the circumstances,but for an invocation of miranda rights to trigger exclusion,the invocation must be unambiguous.berghuis thompkins,see also id.at waiver may be implicit moran burbine,totality of the circumstances must show that waiver was voluntary,knowing,and intelligent united states plugh,cir comparing invocation and waiver of miranda rights.
the district court credited the officers testimony that appellant was not questioned until after he signed the second form.appellant challenges these findings as clear error.however,his challenges take statements out of context and emphasize various phrases used by the officers without viewing their testimony as a whole.for example,ralat testified that appellant wanted him to ask more questions and continue to speak.appellant suggests that these phrases imply that ralat had already questioned him about the bedword murder.similarly,appellant notes detective gonzalez testimony that ralat told the others that appellant did not want to speak to them anymore,before they and interrogated him.braccini also stated that appellant said he wanted to continue to speak.however,all four detectives explicitly testified that appellant was not interrogated prior to waiving his rights on the miranda form.given that,we can not say the district court findings in this regard were clear error.
appellant also relies upon geiss notes,which indicate that ralat questioned him regarding the bedword murder after signing the first but before signing the second miranda form.however,geiss notes were not contemporaneous.his contemporaneous notes stated only rights and the times of appellant signing of the two miranda forms am and pm.moreover,geiss does not speak spanish and could not follow the initial conversation.appellant arguments,therefore,are insufficient to compel a ruling that the district court factual determination of what took place was clear error.
appellant claim that the second form was invalid turns on how contact was reinitiated.we need not determine whether appellant answer of no on the first miranda form constituted an unambiguous invocation of his miranda rights.plugh,at a refusal to waive rights,however unequivocal,is not necessarily equivalent to an unambiguous decision to invoke them.even assuming arguendo that the initial invocation was unambiguous,it was overridden by appellant subsequent decision to reinitiate the conversation by asking the agents not to leave,indicating that he wanted to speak with them.see edwards,at.
appellant,not the agents,reinitiated the contact before questioning began.prior to his reinitiation of the contact,the agents merely told appellant that he had already been indicted and would thus be taken to new york.this was not an interrogatory statement that was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.rhode island innis.it was not even a question,but simply an accurate statement of what was going to happen next.
moreover,appellant confession did not immediately follow,but instead came only after an extended explanation of his rights and options.there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agents engaged in a coercive conversation as,for example,in mosley,where the officers refus ed to discontinue the interrogation upon request or persist ed in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind.mosley,at.on the contrary,according to testimony credited by the district court,ralat stopped the interview once appellant wrote no on the first form.ralat began again only at appellant insistence and after going once more over appellant options and giving him the second waiver form.
speedy presentment analysis 
gonzalez also contends that his confession was obtained in violation of the duty to speedily present a defendant before a magistrate judge,see.a a,and should have been suppressed pursuant to.rule a a requires law enforcement to present arrestees without unnecessary delay,and we will exclude confessions obtained following an unnecessary or unreasonable delay in presentment,see corley united states.however,there is a safe harbor provided in c that bars suppression based on an unreasonable delay if the confession was made within six hours immediately following his arrest or other detention.if the confession was made outside that period,the court must decide whether delaying that long was unreasonable or unnecessary under the mcnabb mallory cases,and if it was,the confession is to be suppressed.corley,at citing the rule of mallory united states,and mcnabb united states.
whether or not his confession falls within the section c safe harbor therefore depends on when appellant was arrested for the purposes of section.appellant final incriminating statement was finished at pm,or approximately four hours after the agents first met with gonzalez at am that morning.appellant acknowledges that he was not formally arrested during the interview.he instead urges us to consider him constructively arrested at the moment when the government had the authority to effectuate the arrest,when the arrest warrant was issued on july.
section applies only after there is some obligation to bring the person before a federal judicial officer in the first place,generally pursuant to an arrest for a federal offense.united states alvarez sanchez,citing.a.few courts have had opportunity to determine precisely when this obligation is triggered in a context other than a formal arrest,but caselaw indicates that the indictment alone does not trigger it.see,united states nguyen,d,section and mcnabb mallory are exclusively concerned with delays between a defendant arrest or detention and his arraignment not delays between a defendant indictment and his arraignment defendant indictment did not give rise to an obligation to bring him in front of a judicial officer.
appellant attempts to distinguish these precedents,particularly alvarez sanchez,because,unlike the defendant in those cases,he was in federal,not state,custody.however,in alvarez sanchez,the majority opinion rested on the duty,obligation,or reason to bring the defendant in front of a judge for a given crime the distinction simply highlighted the lack of obligation in the context of that case.see alvarez sanchez,at.our inquiry,therefore,is when the obligation arose to present appellant for the murders with which he was charged.gonzalez federal detention until that point was on unrelated federal immigration charges,and neither his indictment nor the issuance of an arrest warrant altered the character of the defendant detention.we hold that section c was not immediately triggered by the present indictment and issuance of an arrest warrant.
nevertheless,we recognize the potential for some abuse in a system allowing unfettered interrogat
