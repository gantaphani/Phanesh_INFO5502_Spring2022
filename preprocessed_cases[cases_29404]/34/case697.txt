stephen balthazard and steven souve were convicted of participating in a conspiracy to manufacture more than marijuana plants.defendants challenge their convictions on a host of grounds,the most significant of which depend upon the premise that the government proved at most that they were involved in a series of uncharged marijuana growing conspiracies rather than the single conspiracy described in the indictment.arguing that this premise is incontestable,they assert that the trial court should have excluded all evidence of the uncharged conspiracies and granted their motions for judgment of acquittal.alternatively,they contend that the court erred in failing to give their proposed multiple conspiracy instruction.
we reject defendants multiple conspiracy arguments.as we explain below,the court properly admitted evidence concerning all of defendants marijuana growing operations and appropriately denied their motions for judgment of acquittal because the government produced sufficient evidence to permit a finding that all of the operations were part of the single conspiracy charged in the indictment.the court also did not err in refusing to give defendants proposed multiple conspiracy instruction because the proposed instruction was misleading.
defendants also complain that the trial court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings,committed misconduct,failed to instruct on a lesser included offense,and misapplied the sentencing guidelines.because none of these arguments warrant reversal or remand,we affirm.
on september,law enforcement agents raided a warehouse located at okie street in providence,rhode island.inside,they discovered evidence of a massive marijuana growing operation.the disclosure of the okie street operation resulted in an indictment charging that balthazard and souve had conspired with a third coconspirator,james jacques,to manufacture and possess with intent to distribute marijuana f rom a time unknown,but from at least on or about january,up to and including september.the government contended at trial that balthazard and jacques had been partners in the marijuana business throughout the and that souve joined the conspiracy in or.the conspirators allegedly grew marijuana hydroponically at several different locations and processed it three or four times per year using bud pickers who were paid for their services in marijuana.we describe the evidence supporting these contentions in the light most favorable to the verdicts rendered.united states portela,cir.
the government relied on testimony from several bud pickers to describe the early phases of the conspiracy.these witnesses claimed that they worked initially for balthazard and jacques and remained active participants in the conspiracy after souve became a member in or.they described the respective roles that balthazard,jacques,and souve played in the conspiracy and identified several different locations where the conspirators grew and processed marijuana.
the government also produced substantial evidence linking balthazard,jacques,and souve to the okie street growing operation.it established that balthazard rented the warehouse in his own name from until september and that he thereafter caused the lease to be transferred to a fictitious lessee.an electrician testified that jacques hired him in to install grow lights,wiring,and timers at the warehouse.several of the bud pickers and other coconspirators placed jacques,balthazard,and souve at the warehouse while marijuana was being grown at the site and at jacques rehoboth,massachusetts home while marijuana from the okie street operation was being processed there.jacques wife testified that she split profits generated by the marijuana growing business equally among herself,balthazard,and souve after her husband was arrested on unrelated charges in april.a ledger seized from jacques home both corroborated her testimony on this point and reflected the payment of additional drug sale proceeds to balthazard to reimburse him for rent on the warehouse.law enforcement witnesses also testified that balthazard fingerprints were found on transformer boxes attached to grow lights inside the warehouse and souve fingerprint was found on one of the grow light bulbs.
defendants three main arguments depend upon their contention that what the indictment charged as a single conspiracy was at most a series of distinct marijuana growing operations.arguing that only the okie street operation had any connection to the charged conspiracy,defendants first claim that the trial court erred in failing to exclude all evidence of the earlier marijuana growing operations.in the same vein,they next argue that the court should have granted their motions for judgment of acquittal because the government failed to prove that they were members of the overarching conspiracy described in the indictment.finally,they fault the trial court for failing to give their proposed multiple conspiracy instruction.we examine each argument in turn.
of other marijuana growing operations 
balthazard and souve first claim that the court should have excluded all evidence that implicated them in marijuana growing operations other than okie street.their theory is that the challenged evidence was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because the government failed to connect the operations to the conspiracy described in the indictment.this is primarily an argument about conditional relevancy that we evaluate under.b.when the relevancy of evidence is conditioned on the establishment of a this case,that the other marijuana growing operations were undertaken in furtherance of the charged offering party need only introduce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find the conditional fact by a preponderance of the evidence to establish that the evidence is relevant.huddleston united states,d.even relevant evidence should be excluded,however,if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and the prejudicial effect can not be addressed by a limiting instruction.see.this concern is particularly acute when the challenged evidence implicates a defendant in uncharged criminal activity because if such evidence is admitted improperly,there is a real danger that it could be misused.accordingly,even if the challenged evidence is conditionally relevant under rule b,we must also consider defendants contention that the evidence nevertheless should have been excluded under rule 
viewing the record in this light,the trial court decision to admit the challenged evidence is unassailable.several witnesses testified that balthazard and jacques worked together throughout the to grow,process,and sell marijuana and that souve joined the conspiracy in or.the conspirators used the same core group of bud pickers to assist them in their operations throughout this period and the conspirators goals and methods remained the same while the conspiracy was in existence.for these reasons,and because all of the challenged operations fell within the temporal limits of the charged conspiracy,we find little support for defendants contention.
balthazard and souve nevertheless argue that the prior marijuana growing operations could not have been a part of the charged conspiracy both because the conspirators grew and processed the marijuana at different sites and because the prior operations were completed before souve joined the conspiracy.neither argument has merit.a single conspiracy does not fracture into multiple conspiracies merely because the conspirators shift the locations at which they conduct their operations.see united states walker,cir see also united states brandon,cir.nor does one conspiracy necessarily end and a new one begin each time a new member joins the organization.see united states,cir.given the abundant evidence to support the government single conspiracy theory,the changes in the conspiracy that the defendants seek to highlight do not come close to raising a legitimate challenge under either rule b or rule 
of a charged conspiracy 
balthazard and souve next argue that the court erred in denying their motions for judgment of acquittal because the evidence proved only that they participated in multiple uncharged marijuana growing conspiracies rather than the overarching conspiracy described in the indictment.in assessing what is essentially a claim that the evidence varied materially from the crime charged in the indictment,we canvass the evidence direct and circumstantial in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom,enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.united states,cir quoting united states noah,cir.we consider all relevant circumstances in making this determination and pay particular attention to factors such as whether the alleged conspirators shared a common purpose,whether their actions demonstrated interdependency,and the extent to which participants overlapped during the life of the alleged conspiracy.see id.at the end of the day,a defendant can not succeed with a sufficiency challenge as long as a plausible reading of the record supports the jury implied finding that he knowingly participated in the charged conspiracy.id.
the same evidence that justifies the trial court decision to admit the evidence of other marijuana growing operations is more than sufficient to also permit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the operations were undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.more fundamentally,defendants could not prevail even if this were not the case.while the government was free to argue that all of the operations were part of the charged conspiracy,it was not required to prove this contention to establish defendants guilt.a multiple conspiracy claim undermines a conspiracy prosecution only when it creates doubt about whether the defendant is guilty of the charged conspiracy.in this case,the evidence of the okie street operation was sufficient by itself to prove that defendants were guilty of the multiple year conspiracy to manufacture more than marijuana plants that was described in the indictment.this is because the evidence demonstrated that balthazard,jacques,and later souve,used the okie street site to grow thousands of marijuana plants from at least until the conspiracy was broken up in september.evidence showing that the conspirators also grew marijuana at several other sites,while qualifying as additional evidence of the conspiracy,was by no means essential to the government case.thus,the trial court was justified in denying defendants motions for judgment of acquittal regardless of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the other marijuana growing operations were undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.
jury conspiracy defense 
defendants argument that the trial court erred in failing to give their proposed multiple conspiracy instruction at least in theory has a better chance of success than their two previous arguments because it is governed by a more favorable standard of review.a multiple conspiracy claim ordinarily presents a question of fact for the jury to resolve.see united states licausi,cir.thus,a court should instruct on the issue if,on the evidence adduced at trial,a reasonable jury could find more than one such illicit agreement,or could find an agreement different from the one charged.united states brandon,cir quoting united states boylan,cir.a court need not give a proposed jury charge,however,if it is incorrect,incomplete,or misleading.see united states lara,cir.this is the case here.
the trial court correctly instructed the jury that the defendants could not be found guilty unless the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the agreement or conspiracy specified in the indictment,and not some other agreement,or agreements existed,between at least two people to manufacture,possess,or distribute or more marijuana plants.the proposed instruction elaborates on this basic point by stating t he question of whether there is a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies is one of fact for the jury.it then lists several factors that the jury could consider in determining whether the evidence supported the defendants multiple conspiracy defense.while the factors listed in the instruction are all drawn from our prior decisions,the instruction adds little to the court instruction and,in any event,it is misleading because it fails to explain what jurors should do if the evidence suggests that some of the marijuana growing operations were the result of separate conspiracies.as a result,the proposed instruction leaves the misimpression that jurors should acquit if they have a reasonable doubt about whether any of the defendants marijuana growing operations were the product of separate conspiracies.as we have explained,multiple conspiracy is not a defense unless it creates a reasonable doubt about whether the defendant is guilty of the charged conspiracy.the government did not need to prove that all of the marijuana growing operations were undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy in order to establish the defendants guilt as long as they were able to demonstrate that the defendants were guilty of the charged conspiracy.because the proposed instruction suggests otherwise,it is misleading and the court was under no obligation to give it.
defendants argue that the trial court made a number of erroneous evidentiary rulings,committed misconduct,failed to instruct on a lesser included offense,and misapplied the sentencing guidelines.we briefly address each of the defendants arguments.
evidentiary issues 
rule b other crimes evidence 
fed evid.b provides that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.defendants point to several instances in which they claim that the trial court admitted evidence in violation of this rule.
a.other marijuana sales 
john elliot,one of the bud pickers,testified that he had known balthazard since the late and had worked for the conspirators from until the summer of.over balthazard objection,elliot answered yes to the prosecutor question h ave you ever received marijuana from balthazard balthazard argues that the court should have sustained his objection because the prosecutor failed to establish that elliot had received the marijuana from balthazard while the conspiracy was in existence.
while it is true that the jury could not determine from the prosecutor question and elliot answer precisely when elliot received marijuana from balthazard,elliot testimony nevertheless was admissible as evidence of the background,formation,and development of the illegal relationship between them even if elliot was not a member of the conspiracy when he received the marijuana.united states scott,cir quoting united states varoudakis,cir.the court ruling on the issue thus was correct.
prior theft of electricity conviction 
the prosecutor referred during his redirect examination of special agent kleber to the fact that kleber was aware of pawtucket police reports concerning theft of electricity in the early nineties.balthazard claims that this was an improper reference to his prior nolo contendere plea to a charge of theft of electricity.
we reject balthazard argument because we agree with the district court that he opened the door to questioning about the report.during cross examination,balthazard counsel suggested to special agent kleber that the only investigative report that linked balthazard to unrelated criminal activity was a report that concerned stolen auto parts.by seeking to create an impression in the minds of jurors that balthazard had had only limited prior contacts with law enforcement,balthazard counsel opened the door to questioning about additional reports that linked balthazard to other criminal activity.the trial court thus did not act inappropriately in allowing the government to follow up on an issue that balthazard himself had raised.see,united states,cir defendant opened the door to cross examination concerning rule b evidence by testifying about the subject on direct.
