olawale lateef oluwanisola appeals from a september,judgment convicting him,following a jury trial,of conspiring to import heroin into the united states,in violation of,a and b a,conspiring to possess with intent to distribute heroin,in violation of and b a,and possessing heroin with intent to distribute,in violation of a and b c.oluwanisola argues that the district court rulings with respect to whether certain evidence elicited at trial would open the door to admission of statements he had made at a proffer session improperly restricted his counsel effectiveness and deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment,and that there was insufficient evidence to establish the requisite quantity of heroin to support his convictions under b a and b a.we agree that the district court incorrectly applied united states barrow,cir,to the question of whether certain evidence elicited at trial would open the door to admission of the proffer statements.however,because we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient to support the verdict,we do not judgment of conviction,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
beginning in the summer of,customs personnel screening for narcotics at the mail processing facility at jfk airport found hundreds of envelopes,each containing approximately forty grams of heroin,similarly packaged,sent from india,and bound for eight addresses in queens,new york.the envelopes were addressed to various names,but none of the named individuals resided at any of the designated addresses.the buildings were all commercial buildings with store fronts and apartments and each had an unlocked mailbox,accessible to any passerby.
to catch the heroin importer,the government arranged a controlled delivery of three of the envelopes bound for one of the addresses on july.the government replaced the heroin in the envelopes with a substance that appeared similar to the drug.about ten minutes after the postal carrier delivered the envelopes,a surveillance team observed oluwanisola retrieve one of the envelopes and get into his car.oluwanisola then proceeded to another of the addresses at which packages containing heroin had been intercepted.oluwanisola checked the mailbox there and returned to his car.he then opened the planted envelope,activating an electronic beeper that had been placed inside by law enforcement officers.at that point,the officers moved in.in oluwanisola car,they found another unopened envelope containing heroin addressed to a third address that was also a destination for envelopes intercepted by customs.at the time of apprehension,oluwanisola was carrying in cash and a cell phone,which the records showed had been used to make multiple calls to india.he was arrested and charged with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.
oluwanisola did not admit to any activity at the time of his arrest.at trial,special agent michael kim testified that oluwanisola told officers that his brother,yike,had asked him to pick up the envelopes and would pay him per envelope.oluwanisola said he thought the envelopes contained documents.at trial,a postal carrier testified that for at least six months during the first half of,he observed oluwanisola watching mail deliveries at one of the addresses,each time taking the mail out of the box,looking through it,and then putting it back in the box.according to the government,over one kilogram of heroin had been destined for that address alone.at the time of his arrest,oluwanisola also admitted that he had handpicked the three addresses at which officers had observed him,as well as a fourth address,at the request of individuals he knew in india.this fourth address,like the others,had been the intended destination for envelopes from india intercepted by customs.according to the government,between and,law enforcement authorities seized at least two and a half net kilograms of heroin destined for the four addresses oluwanisola admitted he handpicked.
proffer sessions 
after his arraignment,oluwanisola retained counsel,leonard levenson,informed the government that oluwanisola wanted to participate in a proffer session in the hopes of obtaining a cooperation agreement.a proffer agreement was executed,which provided that the government would not use any of oluwanisola statements against him,except 
t he office may use any statements made by oluwanisola as substantive evidence to rebut,directly or indirectly,any evidence offered or elicited,or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of oluwanisola at any stage of a criminal prosecution 
oluwanisola participated in two proffer sessions,one on september,and one on october.during the proffer sessions,he admitted that he knew the envelopes contained heroin and that he was part of a heroin smuggling operation.with respect to the quantity of heroin,oluwanisola admitted to receiving envelopes containing heroin well in excess of one kilogram.
the government determined that oluwanisola was not fully truthful regarding the scope of his involvement with the conspiracy and did not offer him a cooperation agreement.as a result,oluwanisola declined to plead guilty and the case proceeded to trial.
proceedings 
the government raised the possible admission of the proffer statements prior to trial in a letter to the court,which stated that s hould an appropriate triggering assertion be made by defense counsel or a defense witness,the government will seek to introduce the defendant proffer statements which fairly rebut that statement.when the government raised the issue again prior to counsels opening statements,oluwanisola newly appointed counsel,daniel nobel,stated that he intended to open with the argument that the government could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element to this crime.the government responded that if it were those words alone spoken by counsel without alluding to specific facts or specific pieces of evidence that may come in,i think that would be appropriate,however,the government indicated that counsel could open the door to the proffer statements through references to certain pieces of evidence or to certain elements.the following colloquy ensued 
nobel i do intend to argue that there is insufficient evidence to tie my client to all of the envelopes that will be introduced and i intend to argue that there is insufficient evidence to prove that my client knowingly took possession of an envelope with heroin in it on july the of.
my understanding is as long as i frame the argument as to a specific sufficiency issue,i am entitled to make that argument.
the court well,i think you right but you just went a little bit beyond sufficiency,you said that your client did not knowingly 
the government interjected that if defense counsel began talking about the sufficiency of the government evidence with respect to dates or numbers of envelopes,for example,by arguing,you ca tie him to a year worth,you ca tie him to x number,it would open the door to the proffer statements.
after further discussion,the court stated,i do think you on the right side of the law,nobel.i do see how you can argue specific elements of the crime not being met when your client has proffer statements out there that satisfy some of those elements.nobel responded,t hen there nothing i can do in the courtroom,your honor,and as i read the case law,they do not put defense counsel in the position where he ca do anything.the court clarified,w ell,it depends on the facts of the case,of course i not going to tell you what your defenses are but i am going to say that you ca say,well,there is no proof in response,the government admitted that counsel could come up with statements which address the elements which possibly would open the door but reiterated its position that counsel could not refer to something as specific as the government failure to link oluwanisola to the conspiracy over the course of time.the court clarified that it was acceptable for defense counsel to generally tell the jury about the burden of proof and the necessity of the government proving all elements of the crime but if you going to tell them there no evidence of this element and that element that where i think you cross the line.
defense counsel then clarified that he also intended to argue that there is an insufficiency of proof on cross examination and during closing arguments as well.the court responded well,i let you know how i feel about the issue and how i likely to go.obviously this is the kind of issue where i have to hear exactly what nobel says to reach a determination whether the door is open but those are the considerations we operating under.
consistent with the court ruling,defense counsel did not argue that the government would present insufficient evidence with respect to certain elements in his opening statement that same day,defense counsel sent a letter to the district court arguing that under barrow,at,he was permitted to attack the sufficiency of the government evidence without triggering the waiver in the proffer agreement.
during oluwanisola trial,the government called employees from jfk mail facility,immigration and customs enforcement ice special agents,and postal service employees,who testified regarding the envelopes,the controlled delivery leading to oluwanisola arrest,and oluwanisola statements at the time of his arrest.the government also introduced over thirty of the seized envelopes as exhibits.oluwanisola did not call any witnesses.
the issue of barrow and the proffer statements was raised several times during the course of the trial.during of dennis coleman,a postal worker who testified that he had seen oluwanisola pick up mail at one of the suspect addresses and that he had reported oluwanisola behavior to his supervisor,defense counsel asked,do you know whether or not the supervisor made any written report of what it is you had told him the government objected,arguing that oluwanisola had admitted to picking up mail at the address since in his proffer,and a ny cross with this witness can only be to dispute the witness sic statements with regard to what he saw.defense counsel responded that the point of his question was not to dispute whether coleman had seen oluwanisola at all,but rather,to see if there was any written report that would establish the date.after the government pointed out that coleman had already testified that he had seen oluwanisola in january of,the court ruled that defense counsel could not ask about a written report without opening the door to the proffer statements because the sole purpose of verifying the date would be to question the credibility of the witness.the court stated that defense counsel could ask about the date generally,but that i f you go further than that in a way that questions his credibility inconsistent with what your client said in his proffer,then you going to have that problem.
later,the government called dhs special agent brent goodwin,an expert in the field of narcotics distribution and smuggling.during,the government objected to the following question 
would you say that it atypical or typical of a drug organization,that the person who is the lowest position in the organization would be the individual who would take the role that is most exposed to detection 
the government argued that oluwanisola admitted in his proffer to identifying the locations for the drug shipments and to actually speaking to people which goes far beyond the simple courier.the government was never admitted during his proffer that he was the person who identified locations for drug admitted this to officers at the time of his arrest,and the statement was introduced at trial.nonetheless,defense counsel agreed to ask only about the definition of a courier and to allow the witness to characterize it however he wants.at several other points,the government raised objections under barrow that the court overruled.
closing arguments 
prior to summations,the court again addressed the barrow issue,stating that it wanted to mention to the government,that based on some of the concerns you raised about barrow during the trial,it seemed to me that you have a somewhat more aggressive view of it than i do defense counsel stated that he had certainly tried to tailor my presentation by talking about lack of evidence rather than affirmative proof of something,but noted that there was a gray area between specific insufficiency arguments and affirmative assertions.defense counsel further stated that he intended to argue during his closing argument that the government evidence was insufficient with respect to drug quantity,notwithstanding oluwanisola admissions in the proffer session.the court replied 
you know,i not sure what i can tell you,nobel.i think you have identified the problem.i think the problem varies not only case by case but based on what the defense attorney says during the case and i really not in a position to go any further than giving advisory opinions than i have.
during closing argument,defense counsel made several statements regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,including arguments about the quantity of drugs linked to oluwanisola and his role in the drug conspiracy.at no point during the trial did the district court rule that oluwanisola had opened the door to the admission of his proffer statements.
the jury found oluwanisola guilty of all three counts of the indictment,answering special interrogatories regarding the type heroin and quantity more than a kilogram of narcotics.the district court sentenced oluwanisola to months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently.
discussion 
a proffer agreement 
rule of the federal rules of evidence provides that evidence of any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions.however,because rule constitutes an exception to the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible,its limitations are not to be read broadly,united states griffith,cir,and its protections are waivable,united states velez,cir.oluwanisola proffer agreement contained a partial waiver of his rights under rule,allowing the government to use statements made during the proffer sessions only as substantive evidence to rebut,directly or indirectly,any evidence offered or elicited,or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of oluwanisola 
oluwanisola argues that the district court took an overly expansive view of the waiver provision,causing his counsel to refrain from making key arguments at trial in order to avoid introduction of the proffer statements,and effectively denying him effective counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.specifically,oluwanisola argues that the district court erred by not allowing his counsel to make any argument with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence during his opening statement and by not allowing his counsel to elicit testimony during cross examination of the government witnesses to demonstrate the insufficiency of the government proof as to key issues.
in united states barrow,we looked at a proffer agreement with almost identical waiver language to that here and addressed the question of what factual assertions would trigger the waiver provision,cir we concluded that the clause any evidence offered or elicited,or factual assertions made,by or on behalf of the defendant applied to all factual assertions,including those made directly during opening argument or indirectly through.id.at.however,we stated that t he mere fact that a defendant pleads not guilty and stands trial is not a factual assertion that triggers the proffer agreement waiver.id.moreover,a defense argument that simply challenged the sufficiency of government proof on elements such as knowledge,intent,identity,would not trigger the waiver here at issue.id.at.
in this case,the district court made a distinction between generally tell ing the jury about the burden of proof and the necessity of the government proving all elements of the crime and arguing that specific elements of the crime have not be en met,ruling that while the former would not t
