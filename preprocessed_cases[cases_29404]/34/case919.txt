the government appeals from the ruling and order,dated august,of the united states district court for the district of connecticut chatigny,which granted thomas julius motion to suppress evidence in the form of a firearm seized in the course of his arrest for violation of his parole.see united states julius,d.the district court earlier denied julius motion to suppress ammunition seized during the search that occurred at a later point in time.that ruling is not at issue in this interlocutory appeal.we vacate the district court ruling and order and remand to give the district court the opportunity to reconsider its decision in light of the supreme court recent decision in herring united states.
on october,a federal grand jury sitting in new haven,connecticut,returned an indictment charging the defendant,thomas julius,with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,in violation of g and e.the indictment was based upon julius prior felony convictions under connecticut law.as set forth in the indictment,in,julius was convicted of one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell and two counts of unlawful restraint.in,he was convicted of one count of possession of narcotics with intent to sell and one count of carrying a pistol without a permit.he was sentenced,on january,in superior court for new haven county,to four years of imprisonment and four years of special parole.
julius began his term of special parole upon his release from prison in september.in connecticut,parole is administered by the board of pardons and paroles the board.see.the board is empowered to issue regulations for special parole,is given the authority to hold hearings to determine when special parole has been violated,and may commit a parole violator to prison for all or part of the balance of the term of his parole.see id.b,d f.
the conditions of julius special parole included,among other things,the requirement that he live at an approved residence,which his parole officer had the right to visit at any reasonable time,that he meet with his parole officer once a week,and that he attend regular counseling sessions.julius stresses that the conditions of his special parole did not include consent to searches by parole officers.in fact,as the district court noted,the board did not make consent to search a standard condition of parole until may.see julius,d at.
there is no serious dispute that julius was in violation of the conditions of his special parole when he was arrested on february,specifically,as early as,julius failed to attend counseling sessions and was found to have left the new haven residence where he was required to reside for an unknown location.julius parole officer,jose cartagena,held a number of telephone conversations with julius,but was unable to persuade him to disclose his location or turn himself in.on december,the board issued a warrant for julius arrest.
cartagena eventually traced julius to a residence at english street,in new haven,which was the home of shana moseley,apparently julius then girlfriend.on the morning of february,cartagena,another parole officer,daniel barry,and deputy marshal charles wood undertook to arrest julius at the english street residence.as described by the district court,the officers knocked on the door and the following events transpired 
at about,the officers heard moseley ask,who is it the officers replied,parole officers and police.moseley said she had to get dressed.a few minutes later,she opened the door officer barry showed her the photograph of the defendant,said they had a warrant for his arrest,and asked if he was inside moseley indicated that the defendant was in the rear of the apartment with her young son,asked the officers to be careful of her son,then moved to the side,permitting them to enter.
julius,d at.
wood and barry moved to the rear of the apartment,with guns drawn,and encountered julius,who was lying on a bed with his head close to the foot of the bed and his arms over his head.id.at.julius offered no resistance,was placed in handcuffs by barry and wood,and led out of the bedroom.and then the following took place 
as officer barry was escorting the defendant from the bedroom in handcuffs,
deputy wood undertook to search the area in the vicinity of the bed to see if the defendant had discarded a weapon,narcotics or other contraband.deputy wood commenced the search by looking through some clothing and other items that were strewn on the floor along the side of the bed where the defendant was taken into custody.nothing incriminating was found.next,he lifted the mattress on the bed,which hung over the edge of the box spring by about a foot.using both hands,he lifted the mattress eighteen inches or so,looked underneath,and saw a pistol.the handle of the pistol protruded slightly over the edge of the box spring.deputy wood yelled that he had found a gun,lowered the mattress and suspended the search.
at the hearing on julius motion to suppress,officer barry testified that he,wood,and cartagena were uncertain what to do at that point all we were there for was to find julius and take him into custody.we had done that.the weapon being found is out of our parameters or out of the scope of what we do.the officers decided to call for the assistance of the new haven police department.
the officers then asked moseley for permission to search the entire apartment.after consultation with her mother,who had by that time arrived at the house,moseley signed a form consenting to the search.new haven police officers arrived and resumed searching the bedroom and,after completely lifting the mattress from the box spring,discovered a clip of ammunition.d at.
as already noted,julius was subsequently indicted for possession of both the firearm and the ammunition.he moved to suppress both items as having been obtained as a result of an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment.the district court held a hearing on the motion on april,at which cartagena,wood and barry testified,and also a telephone conference with the parties on may.at the latter hearing,the district court orally ruled that moseley consent to search the english street residence was voluntary and that the ammunition found in the course of that search was properly obtained.as already noted,that decision has not been appealed.the district court,however,reserved decision as to the seizure of the firearm.
the district court subsequently ruled that the firearm had been improperly seized.it first rejected the government contention that deputy wood initial search of the bedroom was a permissible search incident to the arrest of julius.the district court found that because that search had taken place after julius had been handcuffed,the mattress under which the firearm was found was plainly beyond his control and therefore not subject to search.d at.the government does not challenge this portion of the district court ruling on appeal.
the district court also concluded that julius status as a parolee did not legitimize deputy wood initial search.citing samson california,the district court held that a search of a residence occupied by a parolee was subject to a standard of reasonable suspicion,rather than the usual probable cause standard applicable to residences in general.d at.even under this less demanding standard,however,the district court found that the initial search by deputy wood was improper 
the government argument that the officers had reasonable suspicion to search under the mattress boils down to this the defendant had a criminal record including convictions for possession of a firearm and narcotics the defendant was an absconder from parole moseley took ten minutes to respond to the officers knocking at her door and the mattress was askew.these factors,viewed collectively,did not provide reasonable suspicion that the defendant was hiding a weapon or narcotics under the mattress.the defendant criminal record and status as an absconder provided no particularized basis for suspecting that he was presently in possession of a weapon or narcotics.nor did the delay in opening the door.this leaves only the mattress being askew.the government
