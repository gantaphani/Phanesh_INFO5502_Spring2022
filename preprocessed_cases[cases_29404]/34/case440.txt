skerret carried and used a magnum revolver and mm luger pistol that belonged to camilla.skerret also had access to other weapons.videotapes in evidence showed skerret involved in the weapons and drug trade at los alamos on numerous occasions.rivera santiago and sujeilly castellano castro a former resident of los alamos who regularly witnessed drug transactions near her apartment cooperated with the government and provided testimony about skerret involvement in drug trafficking at los alamos.skerret had lookout points for detecting police in the area,used private channel radios,and had methods for getting rid of drugs quickly when the need arose.a watchman was on duty hours a day at the entrance of the housing project the watchman reported on every vehicle and the number of occupants as they entered los alamos.

ii.discussion 
skerret challenges the district court rejection of his guilty pleas,the admission of evidence,and some of the government statements during closing arguments.we do not find merit in any of these claims and address them in turn below.he also alleges that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel.because of an insufficiently developed evidentiary record,we will not review skerret ineffective assistance of counsel claim the proper forum is a collateral proceeding under.see united states woods,cir.
standard of review 
skerret failed to object below to the district court denial of his change of plea requests,to the admission of certain evidence,and to impugned closing arguments.we,therefore,review his claims for plain error.see united states,cir.review for plain error encompasses a test.we must determine whether an error occurred that was clear or obvious which affected the defendant substantial rights while also seriously impairing the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see united states duval,cir.
guilty pleas 
skerret first attempted to enter a guilty plea before the jury was empaneled he attempted a second time immediately thereafter.both times,the district court rejected his requests.skerret argues that these refusals resulted in a longer term of imprisonment than the sentence he would have received under a plea.
during skerret first attempted change of plea hearing,the district court asked skerret why he was pleading guilty.he said,well,because i do know.i mean,the lawyer has told me.the district court then inquired whether skerret felt forced to plead guilty and he said y es.skerret attorney then accepted the court decision that the case had to go to trial skerret acknowledgment that he felt forced to plead guilty is reason enough for the district court to reject his plea in fact,it is required.see.b.district courts must take steps to ensure that defendants are not coerced into pleading guilty.
during skerret second attempt to enter a guilty plea,the following colloquy took place 
the court well,what made you change your view as to whether you were going to plead or not because this morning you seemed not ready to plead.and,all of a sudden,we selected a jury and now you are ready to plead.why the change in less than two or three hours 
skerret well,with all due respect,your honor,i just want this not to be prolonged any more and just to get it over with as soon as possible.
the court but prolong what 
skerret well,the process and that i am a head of a household and i would like to be given the opportunity to be with my children.
the court how do you know that is going to be better that way 
skerret i do know.
the court counsel,frankly,i do know what to tell you.i do think that the easy way out would be to take his plea.but it seems to me,on the basis of my experience,that this man is not the kind of person that approaches a plea situation,a straight plea,without a plea agreement with full knowledge of consequences.it seems to do know what is in his mind,i do know.i ca put a finger on it.
the district court then denied skerret request to enter a straight plea.skerret argues that the colloquy demonstrates that the district court failed to articulate any sound reason for rejecting his plea attempt.
skerret does not have an absolute right to plead guilty,and it was within the district court discretion to reject his pleas.see santobello new york,d citing lynch overholser,d and.in re arvedon,cir.the district court must ensure that the defendant is provided with certain safeguards intended to assure that his rights are respected.see santobello,at.federal rule of criminal procedure requires the district court to address the defendant personally to assure that,inter alia,he understands the charge against him,the possible punishment,his right to an attorney,his right to plead not guilty,his right to a jury trial,and that his guilty plea,among other things,waives his right to a trial.see fed.crim b united states,cir.the district court must also ensure that the defendant plea is voluntary and not the result of force,threats,or promises.b see also,at.
the district court is also required to ascertain whether there is a factual basis for the defendant guilty plea.see.b.the purpose of this requirement is to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge,at citation omitted.accordingly,district courts must have a reasoned basis to believe that the defendant actually committed the crime to which he is admitting guilt.united states,cir citing united states cheal,cir.skerret denied any responsibility for the crimes for which he was charged.when the district court asked defense counsel why the appellant had changed his mind a few hours after the first attempt to plead guilty,counsel said that skerret has always denied par
