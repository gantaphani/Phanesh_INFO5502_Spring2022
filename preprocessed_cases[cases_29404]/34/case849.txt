this appeal arises from a denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.appellant nathaniel grayton was found guilty on january,after a jury trial,of murder in the second degree,penal law.he was sentenced to years to life imprisonment on february.he exhausted his state appeals.he then timely petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,arguing that his exclusion from a geraci hearing violated his constitutional right to presence at all material stages of the trial.geraci hearings are held in new york state courts to determine whether a defendant has procured a witness unavailability by misconduct and has thus forfeited his confrontation clause rights in regards to that witness.people geraci.the district court assumed arguendo that grayton had a federal constitutional right to be present at the hearing and then determined that he had waived that right.accordingly,it denied the writ.we now affirmatively hold that there is a right to be present at a geraci hearing.we also hold that right was waived in grayton case and so affirm the district court judgment.

background 
on november,isaiah rodriguez was shot to death in front of a residence in brooklyn during a confrontation with appellant nathaniel grayton.grayton was indicted and brought to trial in new york state supreme court,kings county.jessica osario,one of two eyewitnesses called to testify for the prosecution,had to be produced for the trial pursuant to a material witness order.after being brought to court,osario was provided a lawyer.without grayton or his counsel present,the judge began questioning osario about her reluctance to testify.osario counsel indicated his belief that osario was in extreme fear of the family of the defendant.he also indicated that if forced to testify,osario would say she did not remember anything.grayton and his counsel were only brought into the courtroom after the court offered to hear an application about the possibility of closing the courtroom for osario testimony.while both defense counsel and grayton were present,osario attorney repeated that osario was very frightened of having grayton family in the courtroom.osario refused to state what had made her fearful,saying only that she would absolutely refuse to testify and that they could take her in if necessary.the court found her in contempt and had her held overnight.
when proceedings began the next day,defense counsel appeared and stated,my client is produced but he not present.i waive his appearance for the purposes of conference for right now.some time after this waiver,grayton was brought into the courtroom.the court then broke for lunch.after the recess,the court noted,defense counsel is present.he is here without his client.grayton lawyer replied that correct,your honor.during this time,osario continued her refusal to testify.her counsel indicated that it was his understanding that the statements in the grand jury will differ substantially from her testimony on the stand in this particular case.
after more discussion between the parties,the prosecutor requested a geraci hearing.a geraci hearing is held in new york criminal cases to determine whether the defendant has procured a witness absence or unavailability through his own misconduct,and thereby forfeited any hearsay or confrontation clause objections to admitting the witness statements.cotto herbert,cir see also people geraci,the court responded to the prosecutor request by saying,n ow,just to be clear,we still have defense counsel here.we do not have the defendant present.the defendant is not entitled to be present at a gerac i hearing nor is his counsel,i believe.defense counsel did not object to this statement,but instead argued that there was no basis to hold the hearing,given osario counsel suggestion that his client feared perjury,not grayton.the court responded to this objection by telling defense counsel,i a little conflicted.i know that this hearing is meant to be held out of the presence of the defendant,but obviously if there is going to be any issue as to whether the defendant is responsible for any of these threats and how he can respond if his attorney is precluded,so i think we going to let you stay defense counsel.the court asked osario lawyer whether osario refusal has anything to do with threats or fear,to which he responded,n ot that i know of,judge.the court nonetheless decided to to give the prosecution the opportunity to present its evidence of misconduct in a geraci hearing.the court told defense counsel certainly your client is not going to be present.he replied,i t understood,your honor.
at the hearing,the prosecution called a detective,an assistant district attorney,osario,and osario mother to testify.grayton attorney did not call any witnesses or conduct any.he made only a summation,arguing to the court that misconduct was not demonstrated on the part of his client.defense counsel framed his role in the geraci hearing as having the opportunity to observe it.grayton was not present during the hearing.the next day,with grayton present,the court issued its decision.after discussing at length its finding that osario was made unavailable by grayton misconduct,the court indicated that osario grand jury testimony would be admissible in lieu of her live testimony at trial.
after the jury was reseated,the court reporter who originally transcribed osario grand jury testimony read it into the record.that testimony indicated that on the night of the incident,osario was standing in front of her building with three other people.while they were outside,isaiah rodriguez drove up in his car,made a and parked.he then went inside the apartment of genaia wright at that point grayton came outside,and he and rodriguez began arguing.osario reported grayton was putting his hands in rodriguez face,to which rodriguez responded by punching him.osario heard three or four gunshots and then ran.grayton left hand was in his pocket when he was arguing with rodriguez osario did not see a gun.after the shooting,grayton rode away on his bicycle,saying niggers think i playing.this testimony substantially corroborated the testimony of the other eyewitness who testified at trial.
grayton was found guilty of murder in the second degree,penal law,on january,and was sentenced to years to life imprisonment on february.on appeal to the second department of the appellate division of new york,appellant argued,as he does now,that his constitutional right to presence was violated by his exclusion from the geraci hearing.in a summary affirmance,the appellate division upheld grayton conviction,holding that his constitutional right to be present at a material stage of the trial was not violated.people grayton,dep t.a judge of the new york court of appeals denied grayton permission to appeal the appellate division order.people grayton,rosenblatt.grayton then turned to habeas.after a report and recommendation from a magistrate judge,the district court determined that even if grayton had a federal constitutional right to be present at the geraci hearing,he had expressly and impliedly waived that right.grayton ercole,cv,wl,at september.on appeal,grayton raises three main issues whether he had a right to be present at the geraci hearing whether that right was waived and whether any error was harmless.
discussion 
we review the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.loliscio goord,cir.the standard we apply in our de novo review is set forth by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,et.as relevant here,aedpa requires that where a claim was adjudicated on the a writ of habeas corpus must be denied unless the state court determination resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states d.grayton argues that he had a federally protected right to be present at the geraci hearing,though he does not specify whether he views his claim as falling under section d contrary to prong or its unreasonable application prong.the government argues that since the supreme court has not decided a case that is materially indistinguishable from this one,see williams taylor,d,any analysis must spring from the unreasonable application prong.we agree.while the supreme court has made clear that a defendant is guaranteed the right to be present at any stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome if his presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure,kentucky stincer,d,it has never addressed if a geraci hearing,or an equivalent,is such a stage.
our task then in reviewing grayton claim is to determine first whether the right to presence at a geraci hearing has been clearly established by the supreme court,and,if so,whether the state court acted unreasonably in applying that clearly established law.the fact that the supreme court has never expressly extended the right to presence to a geraci hearing does not foreclose analysis under aedpa.certain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise,the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.yarborough alvarado,d see also cotto,at noting that the lack of supreme court precedent addressing forfeiture of a particular constitutional right does not mean that any determination that such a fundamental right has been forfeited would survive habeas review internal quotation marks omitted omission in original gilchrist,cir.we can,then,and do reach the issue presented.
clearly established law 
a leading principle that pervades the entire law of criminal procedure is that,after indictment found,nothing shall be done in the absence of the prisoner.united states canady,cir quoting lewis united states.the right to presence is scarcely less important to the accused than the right of trial itself.diaz united states.it is rooted to a large extent in the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,united states gagnon,d per curiam,but due process also protects the right of a defendant to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation,reasonably substantial,to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge,snyder massachusetts,overruled in part on other grounds by malloy hogan,d.the right is not unqualified,and it does not exist where the defendant presence would be useless,or the benefit but a shadow.snyder,at.but at all stages of the proceedings where fundamental fairness might be thwarted by the defendant absence,there is a right to be present.faretta california,d 
applying these precedents,we note first that a geraci hearing itself is a proceeding,in which not only the admissibility of evidence is determined,but also whether a defendant has engaged in misconduct towards witnesses.there is an argument that the right to presence should attach to a geraci hearing for that reason alone.but even were we unconcerned with a defendant ability to defend against the charge of misconduct per se,a defendant would still have a right to presence at a geraci hearing because it bears a substantial relation to the fullness of a defendant opportunity to defend against the criminal charge.snyder,at.if a defendant loses his geraci hearing,he loses also his right to cross examine a witness,a fundamental right essential to a fair trial in a criminal prosecution.united states dhinsa,cir quoting pointer texas,d.
the opportunity for,protected by the confrontation clause,is critical for ensuring the integrity of the process.is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.stincer,at quoting davis alaska,d.it has been called the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.california green,d internal quotation marks omitted.these bedrock principles are doubly important in the geraci context,because a geraci hearing may,by removing the engine of from the trial,impair that trial reliability.more reliable geraci hearings may thus mean more reliable trials,making a defendant presence at such a hearing not only to his benefit,but to the benefit of the court and society as well.
this is not to say that a defendant should not be found to forfeit his confrontation clause rights when he has committed misconduct,but only that the determination of whether he has done so should be made with fundamental fairness in mind.just as t he basic purpose of a trial is the determination of truth,tehan united states ex rel.shott,d,so too is the purpose of a geraci hearing.argument that such a hearing should be made less reliable can not be countenanced.a geraci hearing is no mere formality it plays the valuable role of sentry,admitting statements not subject to only where the requisite link between the defendant misconduct and the witness silence has been established.people johnson.such a sentry is necessary before the right to presence and to confrontation is lost.of course,the right to confront and to is not absolute and may,in appropriate cases,bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.but its denial or significant diminution calls into question the ultimate integrity of the process and requires that the competing interest be closely examined.chambers mississippi,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
even against this backdrop,the government argues that grayton had no right to be present at the geraci hearing.but adopting the government position in this case would mean that a defendant confrontation clause and due process rights are forfeited not at a judicial finding of misconduct,but at the allegation of misconduct.if there is no right to presence at a geraci hearing,all a prosecutor need do is raise the inference of misconduct to deprive a defendant of his opportunity to and confront the witnesses against him.a defendant sixth amendment and due process rights can not evaporate at the moment he is accused,never to be recovered if a court finds misconduct to have occurred which,of course,it is more likely to do in his absence.as grayton argues,there is a double punishment inflicted on a defendant who is excluded from a geraci hearing,since preventing him from fully facing the charge of misconduct may well lead to the later loss of the essential trial right of confrontation.dhinsa,at.the supreme court precedents guide us here when the court first considered the admissibility of prior testimony by a witness who was made unavailable by misconduct,it allowed for the testimony admission because t he accused was himself personally present in court when the showing was made,and had full opportunity to account for the absence of the witness,if he would,or to deny under oath that he had kept her away.reynolds united states.none of the government arguments can support the denial of such a full opportunity,nor do they justify the significant diminution or loss of rights merely at a prosecutor charge,rather than his proof.
indeed,none of the government arguments compel another conclusion.it first contends that fundamental fairness was not thwarted by grayton absence because his counsel was present during the hearing.though the presence of counsel may in other circumstances be relevant to the extent of a deprivation,and thus to harmlessness,there is no support for the government suggestion that the presence of counsel is a substitute for the presence of the defendant himself where his presence is guaranteed by due process.the right is the right to personal presence,rushen spain,d emphasis added,and so we reject the government contention that the presence of counsel is necessarily a sufficient vindication of the right where it exists.
the government next argument is that the right to presence did not attach in this particular case because,in its view,grayton presence at the geraci hearing would not have contributed to the fairness of that proceeding.in particular,the government questions whether grayton would have been able meaningfully to assist his counsel in the witnesses who testified at the hearing.no such individualized showing is required,however,in this circumstance a defendant presence will always contribute to the fairness of a geraci hearing because it ensures a more reliable determination of whether that defendant alleged misconduct procured the witness absence.in every case in which a geraci hearing is held,the defendant will be in a unique position to know whether he or someone else on his behalf has in fact threatened a witness and the circumstances surrounding that misconduct if it occurred.the factual questions posed in a geraci hearing are,therefore,those the defendant is best equipped to answer.see,people dokes,in determining whether a defendant has a right to be present during a particular proceeding,a key factor is whether the proceeding involved factual matters about which defendant might have peculiar knowledge that would be useful in advancing the defendant or countering the people position.clark stinson,cir indicating that i f fact issues are presented it would seem that defendant has a right to be present quoting charles alan wright,federal practice and procedure at ed see also fed.pro.b indicating that a defendant need not be present at a conference or hearing upon a question of law.in some cases,as in this one,the defendant may also be personally familiar with the witnesses and aware of any motive they might have to fabricate,providing potentially fruitful areas for.
the government attempt to analogize a geraci hearing to the witness competency hearing in kentucky stincer,d,and to the ex parte communication between judge and juror that occurred in united states gagnon,d,does not persuade us otherwise.in both cases,the supreme court held that the defendant had no constitutional right to be present at the proceeding at issue.but neither stincer nor gagnon impaired the defendant fundamental right to the witnesses against him at trial.in stincer,although the defendant was not present during a hearing to determine the competency of two child witnesses,the defendant later had the opportunity for full and effective of those witnesses during the trial itself.at.and in gagnon,the judge had a brief ex parte communication with a juror who had expressed concern that one of the defendants had been sketching the jurors during trial.at.that communication did not involve discussion of any of the evidence presented in the case against the defendant,but was rather an inquir y into a minor occurrence.id.at.therefore,in neither stincer nor gagnon did the defendant absence from the proceeding bear a reasonably substantial relation to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the criminal charge.snyder,at.by contrast,in this case,the geraci hearing had a direct impact on grayton ability to defend himself the trial judge determination that grayton procured osario absence through his misconduct permitted the prosecutor to admit osario grand jury testimony and resulted in the forfeiture of grayton right to osario,a key witness for the prosecution.
the government next line of argument is also deeply flawed.the government suggests that because some courts have held there is no federal constitution right to attend a sandoval hearing,see people sandoval,that there is,analogously,no right to attend a geraci hearing.this argument is without merit.in new york,a sandoval hearing is held,upon a defendant request,to determine the extent to which he will be subject to impeachment by about prior bad acts if he testifies.williams mccoy,d.first,we note the government makes no argument as to why the two proceedings are or should be considered analogous,but only suggests that they are.second,our task in habeas is limited to applicable supreme court precedent,and so these cases can not factor into our determination of whether the supreme court has clearly established a right to presence at a geraci hearing.but even if the cases the government presents were cognizable,we would reject their applicability to this case.a geraci hearing is different in kind than a sandoval hearing because of the nature of the right at stake.a defendant facing a geraci hearing is facing the possibility that the crucial trial right of confrontation will be forfeited.a sandoval defendant,who himself requested the hearing,faces no such forfeiture there is no federal constitutional right not to be impeached.the lack of a right to be present in such circumstances can not support the denial of the right to presence in the geraci context 
a defendant presence at a geraci hearing has a substantial relationship to his ability to defend himself,both against the charge of misconduct and the actual criminal charge he is facing.fundamental fairness is surely thwarted by trying a defendant for misconduct in his unwaived absence and then punishing him with a forfeiture of crucial trial rights,without ever having provided him an opportunity to contest the charge in person.the federal constitution protects the right to presence at a geraci hearing,and a state court that determined otherwise would be in error.
unreasonable application.
our task in habeas does not end at a finding of error,because the writ may only issue where the state court application of the law was not only wrong,but unreasonable.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams taylor,d.the appellate division here correctly identified the governing legal principle in its decision as the right to be present when it held that grayton constitutional right to be present at a material stage of the trial was not violated.people grayton,dep t.there are two possible readings of such a holding,however that the right was not violated because it does not exist,or that the right was not violated because it was waived.where,as here,a state court decision is unaccompanied by an explanation,the habeas petitioner burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.harrington.at see also davis greiner,cir noting that where state courts summarily deny relief on the merits,we must focus on the ultimate decisions of those courts,rather than on the courts reasoning quoting aeid bennett,cir internal quotation marks omitted.though we hold that there is a right to be present at a geraci hearing,we find that it was reasonable for the state court to deny relief on the second ground,waiver.accordingly,we do not address whether it would have been reasonable for the state court to have denied relief in the absence of waiver.
it was reasonable for the state court to deny relief to grayton,because he waived his right to presence at the geraci hearing.though neither grayton nor his counsel expressly waived his right to be present,at a minimum,it would be reasonable for the state court to have found an implied waiver of that right.
grayton argues that waiver could not have been made by his counsel,blue but both the supreme court and our circuit have spoken clearly on this issue.what suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue for certain fundamental rights,the defendant must personally make an informed waiver.for other rights,however,waiver may be effected by action of counsel.new york hill,d citations omitted.decisions pertaining to the conduct of the trial belong to the attorney,as do those that concern strategic and tactical matters.united states plitman,cir.we have specifically included waiver of confrontation clause rights in such a category,holding that defense counsel may waive a defendant sixth amendment right to confrontation where the decision is one of trial tactics or strategy that might be considered sound.id.at.though direct waiver is preferable,our cases have also explicitly repudiated a rule that would require a defendant personal statement in court to bring about a constitutionally valid waiver of his right to be present.clark,at.this body of law establishes that the right to be present may be,in some circumstances,waived by counsel,and we decline appellant invitation to revisit it.
as to whether counsel did in fact make such a waiver in this case,the government urges us to find that defense counsel may have waived grayton presence because of the possibility that grayton presence at the hearing would have provided the court with definitive evidence that it was indeed grayton of whom osario was so afraid.grayton responds that n o valid strategic reasons justifying his absence from the geraci hearing was voiced by his counsel.we agree that the record does not reflect counsel reason for not objecting to his client exclusion,but the most obvious reason for such a waiver that suggested by the government is unlikely to ever make its way into the record.an attorney can hardly inform the court that he waives his client presence for fear that his presence will create demonstrative evidence of misconduct.there is a very real possibility in all but the most egregiously called for geraci hearings that a defendant presence will only confirm a court suspicions,and a lawyer may reasonably decide that such is a risk that he and his client can not bear.we can not say that waiver of presence in such circumstances is not the sort of trial strategy and tactical matter that our precedent places in the hands of counsel.
turning to whether counsel,having the power to do so,did actually waive in this case,we find that there was no express waiver made by counsel.the government makes much of defense counsel statement,my client is produced,but he not present.i waive his appearance for the purpose of conference for right now.but what the government does not discuss nor disclose in its briefing is that grayton was present in the courtroom after this statement was made.after this waiver,but before the geraci hearing began,the court note d for the record that the defendant was present.shortly after,the court broke for lunch when it reconvened,defense counsel was present without his client.only at this point did the prosecutor request,and the court grant,the geraci hearing.defense counsel express waiver of his client presence can not extend past the point the defendant was actually present in court.after grayton appeared,his counsel waiver for the purpose of conference for right now ended and so did not extend to the geraci hearing.
even in the absence of an express waiver,we find that a state court conclusion that grayton and his counsel both implicitly waived the right to be present would be reasonable.a waiver of a constitutional right must be voluntary,knowing and intelligent,that is,the act of waiver must be shown to have been done with awareness of its consequences.united states morgan,cir.such a voluntary and knowing waiver of the right to be present can be implied from the defendant conduct.clark,at quoting united states nichols,cir.a right may also be waived by counsel failure to object if a defendant is entitled to attend certain stages of the trial and those stages take place without the defendant presence,the defendant or his counsel must object at the time of the violation or the defendant right to be present will be deemed waived.united states jones,cir.
it would be reasonable for the state court to have found that constitutionally valid waiver was made by implication.neither appellant nor his counsel ever objected to the former exclusion from the hearing.defense counsel not only repeatedly failed to object,but also expressly acquiesced in the court statements that grayton would not be present.when the court told defense counsel,certainly your client is not going to be present,counsel replied i t understood,your honor.under these circumstances,t he judge could reasonably conclude that if grayton was being deprived of any right his counsel would have said so.cardinal gorczyk,cir.defense counsel had a right to waive grayton presence,and the state court would have not have been unreasonable to conclude that he did so.
the state court could also have found that appellant himself implicitly waived his right to presence.grayton argues that he had no way of knowing that a geraci hearing was to take place and so he could not have waived his right to presence.but we have squarely held that where a defendant does not assert his right to be present at a proceeding,any objections to his exclusion are waived,even if the defendant does not know about the proceeding until after it has taken place.in jones,we held that a defendant waived his right to be present at his attorney disqualification hearings because he never objected to his absence from the hearings,even though he was present during the subsequent hearing in open court when the court made its ruling.at see also united states rosario,cir finding waiver of the right to be present when neither defendant nor counsel objected to defendant exclusion.though the defendant in jones,like appellant in this case,argued that he did not know the hearings were taking place,and so could not have objected,we nonetheless found waiver because he could have objected after the alleged violation took place.at.our precedent is in line with the supreme court,which has likewise indicated that failure to assert the right to be present will waive it.see gagnon,at finding rule right to presence waived where n o objections of any sort were lodged,either before or after the alleged violation emphasis added.
grayton was undisputedly present in court when the court gave a detailed account of its findings regarding his misconduct.the court discussed the reliability of the previous testimony osario demeanor during the hearing,along with her testimony and credibility the relevant legal standards and its ultimate determination that osario was intimidated as a result of threats directed from grayton and that grand jury testimony of osario should be admitted under the people direct case.though grayton may not have been able to object during or before the hearing,the state court was not required to ignore the fact that he could have objected after the alleged violation took place.jones,at emphasis omitted.
grayton does not address this precedent,but claims he can not have been expected to object,because he did not know what a geraci hearing was,what the consequences of such a hearing could mean to his case,or what the legal consequences were of the prosecution evidence.the record belies such an argument.on january,before voir dire even began,with grayton present,defense counsel indicated that he had been informed by the prosecutor that witnesses had been threatened.he also indicated that the prosecutor had not yet connected these threats to appellant,which the prosecutor confirmed.the court,in response,said 
and i would just note,for the defendant benefit,since the issue has been raised that in the event there is a witness who has previously given inculpatory information then on the witness stand declines to respond to questions and it can be established that that refusal to respond and cooperate is a direct result of threats or other actions taken by the defendant meant to intimidate those witnesses that there are ways in which that can be determined and that evidence previously given if under oath can be used instead of the live testimony which means that you would not be successful in avoiding the evidence for one thing and of course,there always the possibility of a separate prosecution,should there be such action taken.
grayton,then,was explicitly warned,in open court,in plain language,that there were ways in which misconduct related to witnesses could be ferreted out,and that if misconduct was found to have occurred,a witness previous testimony could be admitted in place of his or her live testimony.grayton was also present in court alongside osario when her counsel stated that osario was extremely frightened she very much concerned and frightened of having the defendant family present in the court.the court thoroughly warned appellant about the circumstances which would precipitate a geraci hearing,and he was present later when those events began to occur.he can not now claim to have had no idea of the nature of the hearing or the consequences it might have had.
it may be true,as grayton argues,that he had not an inkling that he had a constitutional right to be present at the hearing.but that is not what our law requires to find waiver.the
