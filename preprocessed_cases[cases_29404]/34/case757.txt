wendy golenbock,cheryl stein and susan otis were each charged in an indictment with one count of bankruptcy fraud in violation of and one count of conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud in violation of.the charges arose from their alleged concealment of golenbocks and steins ownership interest in a summer home in wellfleet,massachusetts,which they placed in otis name in trust during bankruptcy proceedings.after a jury trial in the district court,golenbock and stein were convicted on both counts,and otis was convicted on the conspiracy count.we affirm the convictions and sentences.
at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings,golenbock and otis were lawyers golenbock and stein worked and lived together in weston,and were,at times,in the business of real estate development and management.otis was a close personal friend of both.
a.the wellfleet property 
on october,golenbock and a friend named ellen ratner purchased a parcel of land on bond street in south wellfleet,massachusetts the wellfleet property for to build a house on the property,they borrowed from the cape cod five cent savings bank cape cod five,secured by a mortgage on the property.in,ratner sold her interest in the wellfleet property to golenbock and stein for.the cape cod five was notified of the transfer,and released ratner from the mortgage.shortly thereafter,golenbock and stein obtained an additional line of credit from the cape cod five,secured by a second mortgage on the wellfleet property.golenbock and stein used the house on the wellfleet property as a vacation home,and sometimes rented it out.
b.the transfer of the wellfleet property to otis 
on september,golenbock and stein filed separate chapter bankruptcy petitions.they did not list the wellfleet property as an asset in their bankruptcy schedules or in their statement of financial affairs.neither did golenbock and stein list the cape cod five as a creditor of theirs,state that they had conveyed the wellfleet property to anyone else in the year before bankruptcy,nor identify the wellfleet property as being held or managed for someone else.stein did not disclose an ongoing civil action she had brought relating to a hot tub she and golenbock had had installed at the wellfleet property.
two days after golenbock and stein filed their bankruptcy petitions,golenbock gave otis a check.on october,a deed was filed with the barnstable country registry of deeds conveying the wellfleet property from golenbock and stein to otis under the name of alekman as sole trustee of the realty trust,for a stated consideration of.the deed on its face was dated and notarized december.stein testified at trial that the deed was signed in andover,essex december,but the deed reflects that the signatures were notarized in middlesex county,where golenbock and stein both lived.
at the same time as the deed was recorded,a declaration of trust for the realty trust was also recorded.two dates appeared on the declaration as indicating when it was executed august,and august.
despite the stated consideration of,otis did not pay any such sum to golenbock and stein.the mortgagor,cape cod five,was not notified of the transaction.golenbock and stein continued to make regular mortgage and line of credit payments,often by postal money orders,bank checks or cash.the postal money orders and bank checks were obtained by employees of golenbock and stein,at their instruction and using cash provided by them.later payments were made using accounts controlled by golenbock and stein.they made all the payments until the property was sold in june.
in addition to paying the mortgage,golenbock and stein also paid the telephone,electric,and trash pickup bills for the wellfleet property while it was in otis name in trust.the accounts for those bills were changed to otis name beginning in.however,the mailing address for the bills always remained golenbock and steins post office box,which otis did not use.mail sent to the wellfleet address was routed to golenbocks and steins offices.
golenbock and stein also handled and paid for the insurance on the property after the title was transferred.in june,a year and a half after the date on the deed to otis,and nine months after the deed was recorded,golenbock and stein applied for new homeowners insurance for the property in their names only,with no reference to otis or the trust.the insurance for the wellfleet property was designated for personal use,not commercial use.in july,they had otis and the trust added to the policy as additional insureds.only golenbock and stein,however,were insured for the contents of the wellfleet property and for the loss of use.all the payments made for the wellfleet property expenses were paid for or directed to be paid by golenbock and stein and their handwriting appears on checks and bills relating to those expenses.
only golenbock and stein dealt with the real estate broker for the rental of the property.the income tax forms for the rental were mailed only to golenbock and steins post office box.the tax form for the rent for the year was issued to golenbock.the name was changed to otis in,at golenbocks direction.rental income checks from the real estate broker were payable to otis in,but were endorsed by golenbock.
golenbock and steins bankruptcy proceedings 
in november,several weeks after filing their bankruptcy petitions,golenbock testified under oath at a bankruptcy meeting of creditors meeting that she had not conveyed any property within the prior year to an insider or good friend.she did not include the cape cod five when listing the banks to which she owed money.stein attended a meeting in,and both golenbock and stein attended another meeting in june.at none of those meetings did either disclose to the representative of the trustees office,who was conducting their examinations,an ownership interest in the wellfleet property,its transfer in the year before the bankruptcy,or the existence of the cape cod five debt.golenbock and steins regular reports and cash flow statements submitted to the trustees office did not reflect the payments they were making in connection with the wellfleet property expenses.
in november,golenbock testified in a bankruptcy deposition conducted by one of her creditors.after being confronted with the creditors knowledge of her prior interest in the wellfleet property,she admitted that she had owned it.she stated,however,that it had been sold in to otis.golenbock further testified that she had transferred the property because she could not pay the mortgage.
in,after golenbock and steins bankruptcy cases had been converted to chapter liquidations,another meeting was conducted,this time by their appointed bankruptcy trustee.both stein and golenbock testified under oath at that meeting.they affirmed that the only property they still owned was their primary residence,and did not disclose any interest in the wellfleet property.the trustee only learned about their involvement in the wellfleet property in,when he heard it from the trustees office.
in april,golenbock and stein received their bankruptcy discharges.by august,while title to the wellfleet property was still in otis name in trust,golenbock and stein resumed making the mortgage payments directly from golenbocks bank account.in march,both bankruptcy cases were closed.
d.the sale of the wellfleet property 
in early,golenbock contacted a real estate broker to list the wellfleet property for sale.golenbock and stein,not otis,dealt directly with the real estate broker during the sale process.in june,the wellfleet property was sold for,and a check for,most of the profits,was issued to otis.she endorsed it to golenbock on behalf of max,golenbock and steins son.
although the funds were deposited in golenbocks client trust account in maxs name,the account was used for golenbock and steins personal and business purposes.for example,was paid from the account to stein for new england school of law,which stein was attending,and nearly in checks were paid from the account to golenbock personally,for no stated purpose.the account was also used to deposit a settlement check received from an insurance company for one of golenbocks law clients,and to issue the disbursement check to the client.the rest of the profits from the sale,in the form of two checks totaling over,were issued to otis by the real estate broker.otis also endorsed those over and they were deposited into golenbocks master client account.
e.the testimony 
before any criminal charges were filed against golenbock,the massachusetts board of bar overseers initiated an investigation of her professional conduct with regard to a number of matters.on december,golenbock testified in the first of seven depositions before the massachusetts board of bar overseers.she did not know of any potential criminal investigation at that time,and answered questions about clients she had represented and the handling of funds,as well as her bankruptcy filing.there were no references to the wellfleet property in this deposition.
on or around january,before the next scheduled deposition,the notified golenbock by letter that it was concerned about certain aspects of her bankruptcy proceeding.this letter did not mention the wellfleet property.golenbocks attorney became concerned about the possibility of a criminal proceeding,and advised her to assert her fifth amendment privilege.on april,golenbock again appeared before the again,none of the questions referred to the wellfleet property.golenbock declined to answer any questions,asserting her fifth amendment privilege.
golenbock then changed attorneys,retaining edward barshak for his expertise in practice.barshak advised her as follows,as recounted in his affidavit 
i told her that if she continued to remain silent,she would be penalized.the penalty would be that the bbo would hold her silence against her.specifically,the bbo would be allowed to draw from her silence any adverse inferences relating to any area of the investigation she refused to discuss.i also told her that those adverse inferences would mean that the bbo would find against her in relation to those areas of the investigation and that as a result,she would be disbarred or suspended.
on november,golenbock again appeared before the,and this time chose to forego her fifth amendment privilege and to answer the questions put to her.she answered additional questions on november.the testimony in these depositions concerned the wellfleet property and other matters relevant to the subsequent criminal case against her.
otis also testified before the on multiple occasions beginning in january.there,she stated that she became aware of golenbocks and steins bankruptcy filings at some point.in,otis had submitted to the internal revenue service a pleading from golenbocks and steins bankruptcy cases,as well as a copy of the deed,in response to an inquiry concerning her tax return.otis also told the that she made none of the mortgage payments and provided none of the funds to do so.however,she and her husband reported the income and mortgage payments on the wellfleet property in their federal income tax returns for the years.otis also testified that all the expenses of the wellfleet property were being paid from its rental income.her tax returns,however,reflected that there was no rental income for several years.in,the one year in which there was reported rental income,it amounted to less than half of the mortgage payments.
f.the motion to suppress 
on march,all three defendants were charged with one count of bankruptcy fraud in violation of and one count of conspiracy to commit bankruptcy fraud in violation of.a superseding indictment charging the same offenses was returned on august.
the government sought to offer in evidence some of the statements that golenbock had made to the on july,golenbock moved to suppress those statements.she contended that she had been coerced to answer questions by the threat that assertion of her fifth amendment privilege would be used against her in the proceeding.stein did not join in the motion or file a separate motion to suppress.in support of her motion,golenbock submitted her affidavit and that of barshak,quoted supra.
on august,the district court denied golenbocks motion in a written decision,stating 
in this case,golenbock did not face the ominous choice between the rock and the whirlpool,because,although she was subject to a negative inference based upon her silence,she was not subject to automatic disbarment.instead,in the proceeding she,like defendants in any civil proceeding,had to choose between remaining silent and risking an adverse inference on the one hand,and giving testimony that could be used against her in a subsequent criminal proceeding on the other.because golenbocks testimony was not coerced,as that term is defined in garrity new jersey,d,her motion to suppress statements made to the will be denied.
at trial,the government introduced excerpts from pages of testimony,which were admitted in evidence against golenbock.the excerpts included golenbocks testimony concerning her payment of the mortgage,tax and other payments on the wellfleet property,as well as the proceeds of the sale of the property.neither golenbock nor stein made a contemporaneous objection.
g.the criminal trial 
the jury trial of all three defendants commenced in march.at trial,an expert testified that the value of the wellfleet property,as of october,was.there were two mortgages totaling approximately and approximately worth of tax liens.
by way of defense at the trial,golenbock and stein contended that they did not have to list the conveyance of the wellfleet property in their bankruptcy schedules because the transfer was in the ordinary course of business real estate development.after the property was conveyed to otis,defendants contended,golenbock managed the property and stein looked after necessary repairs and made sure the bills were paid.the mortgage was paid with monies otis provided to golenbock in her role as property manager.the main source of income for these payments was the adams street realty trust,composed of rental properties in lowell,massachusetts.golenbock and stein had transferred their beneficial interest in those properties to otis in november,with the bankruptcy courts permission.the tenants of the lowell properties often paid in cash,defendants asserted,which accounted for golenbock and steins cash payments for the mortgage and other expenses associated with the wellfleet property.stein was the only defendant who testified at trial.
stein and otis moved for acquittal under.at the close of the governments case.the court denied both motions.
neither stein nor otis renewed her motion for acquittal after the close of her defense.on april,the jury found golenbock and stein guilty of both counts.otis was convicted on the conspiracy count and acquitted on the substantive bankruptcy fraud count.
sentencing 
on july,the trial court determined that golenbock and stein each had an adjusted offense level of.the computation was based on a base offense level of,with upward adjustments for their roles in the offense as leaders,supervisors,organizers,or managers of otis for more than minimal planning and more than one victim and for the amount of the intended loss,which was determined to be.
golenbock and stein were each sentenced to months of imprisonment followed by months of supervised release.otis received a sentence of five months in prison and months of supervised release.
in these consolidated appeals,the defendants advance various arguments.first,golenbock and stein assert that the district court erred in not suppressing at trial testimony provided by golenbock in proceedings conducted by the board of bar overseers.golenbock and stein also dispute the courts sentencing enhancement based on the intended loss for which they were responsible.stein and otis contend the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.stein further maintains that her sentence should not have been enhanced to reflect a leadership role in the offense.finally,otis argues that the indictment was deficient as to the charges against her.we find no reversible error as to any of these matters,and affirm the defendants convictions and sentences.
golenbocks testimony golenbock and stein 
golenbock and stein both contend that because golenbocks testimony was coerced,it should have been suppressed at their criminal trial in reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,and its conclusions of law and rulings on the constitutionality of the government conduct de novo.see united states,cir.
golenbock argues that she reasonably believed that if she refused to testify before the,she could be subject to an adverse inference as to the matters at issue in that proceeding,with the practical outcome being her disbarment.she contends that this impending threat of disbarment rendered her testimony involuntary and thus inadmissible at her criminal trial.we think,however,that the penalty of adverse inference and possible disbarment was too conditional to establish a conclusion that her testimony was compelled in contravention of the fifth amendment.
the fifth amendment secures an individuals privilege to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will,and to suffer no penalty for such silence.spevack klein,d douglas,plurality opinion quoting malloy hogan,d.the fifth amendment not only protects against being involuntarily called as a witness against oneself in a criminal prosecution,
but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding,civil or criminal,formal or informal,where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.
lefkowitz turley,d.
the fifth amendment has been held to protect individuals from the threat of substantial economic sanction for exercising their rights.see id.at.state contractors barred from state business for five years for refusal to testify before grand jury gardner broderick,d police officer discharged for refusal to testify before grand jury.in spevack,the court held that an attorneys refusal,on grounds of,to produce financial records and to testify at a judicial inquiry in a disciplinary proceeding was not a constitutionally permissible basis for his disbarment.four members of the court described disbarment as a costly sanction within the meaning of the fifth amendment,and went on to state 
the threat of disbarment and the loss of professional standing,professional reputation,and of livelihood are powerful forms of compulsion to make a lawyer relinquish the fifth amendment privilege.
spevack,at.
on the same day,the court similarly held that statements elicited as a result of compelling a choice between and the loss of a public job were inadmissible in a later criminal proceeding.see garrity new jersey,d.there,police officers were summoned to appear before a state investigative body examining irregularities in criminal cases.they were informed that anything they said could be used against them in subsequent criminal proceedings,but if they refused to answer they would be subject to removal from office.id.at.the officers answered the questions.later,they were indicted and tried for crimes relating to the earlier questioning,and their statements were used at trial.id.at.the supreme court reversed their convictions on the ground that their testimony was involuntary because it was under threat of job termination.id.at.
where,however,invocation of the fifth amendment does not,by itself,result in forfeiture of the job or license in question,the fact that claiming the fifth may,as a practical matter,result in damage to ones chances of retaining the privilege at stake does not necessarily establish a constitutional violation.the effect must be capable of forcing the which the amendment forbids.lefkowitz cunningham,d see also flint mullen,cir n ot every undesirable consequence which may follow from the exercise of the privilege against can be characterized as a penalty.
hence the supreme court has adhered to the prevailing rule that the fifth amendment does not forbid allowing adverse inferences to be drawn against parties to civil actions from their refusal to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.baxter palmigiano,d.in baxter,the court held that permitting the drawing of an adverse inference from a prisoners silence in a prison disciplinary hearing was constitutionally permissible.see id.at.the baxter court differentiated the effects of the prisoners silence from the automatic penalties at issue in other cases 
in this respect,this case is very different from the circumstances before the court in the decisions,where refusal to submit to interrogation and to waive the fifth amendment privilege,standing alone and without regard to the other evidence,resulted in loss of employment or opportunity to contract with the state.there,failure to respond to interrogation was treated as a final admission of guilt.
id.at.the supreme court later distinguished its holding in baxter from a case in which,pursuant to a new york statute,an attorney was divested of his state political party offices when he refused to waive his constitutional immunity before a special grand jury 
baxter did no more than permit an inference to be drawn in a civil case from a party refusal to testify.respondent silence in baxter was only one of a number of factors to be considered by the finder of fact in assessing a penalty,and was given no more probative value than the facts of the case warranted here,refusal to waive the fifth amendment leads automatically and without more to imposition of sanctions.
lefkowitz cunningham,d.
relying on garrity,golenbock insists that she was forced to choose between her livelihood as an attorney and incriminating herself in the investigation.unlike the police officers in garrity,however,golenbock was not subject to automatic loss of her position if she asserted her right not to testify.while refusal to waive the fifth amendment might increase the risk that she would be disbarred,disbarment would not result automatically and without more.hence,she was not threatened with a penalty within the meaning of garrity for invoking her fifth amendment privilege.
attorney barshak affidavit makes this point clear.he stated that the would be allowed to draw from her silence any adverse inferences relating to any area of the investigation she refused to discuss.emphasis added.it is true that barshak went on to opine to his client that those adverse inferences would mean that the would find against her in relation to those areas of investigation and that as a result,she would be disbarred or suspended.his prediction of disbarment,however,rested on his estimate of how the would exercise its ability to draw adverse inferences.barshak did not suggest that the was required to disbar her as an automatic sanction for golenbocks failure to waive her constitutional rights.
the own rules and practice make it plain that golenbock was not faced with an automatic sanction.the makes its decisions based on a preponderance of the evidence,with the bar counsel bearing the burden of proof.see rules of the board of bar overseers.nothing in the record suggests that the has either a formal rule or an unwritten policy or practice to disbar or suspend attorneys simply for invoking fifth amendment privileges.hence,the consequences of golenbocks assertion of the privilege before the were the same as in any civil proceeding,in that the was not required an adverse inference from such an assertion.see baxter,at.see also federal deposit ins.elio,cir.
golenbock contends,nevertheless,that the risk of disbarment arising from her refusal to testify was sufficiently coercive to render her testimony inadmissible.this argument ignores the reasoning of baxter,on which this court has relied to distinguish between the threat of automatic loss of ones livelihood and the threat of an inference that might lead to such a loss.in united states indorato,cir,we held that a state police officers statements made during a theft investigation were not coerced,where nothing in relevant police department rules mandated dismissal for invoking fifth amendment rights.we observed 
in all of the cases flowing from garrity,there are two common features the person being investigated is explicitly told that failure to waive his constitutional right against will result in his discharge from public employment or a similarly severe sanction imposed in the case of private citizens and there is a statute or municipal ordinance mandating such procedure.
id.at.in indorato,we said that absent elements of this nature,fear of punishment as a consequence of claiming ones rights does not protect one from the governments subsequent use of statements in a criminal trial see id.
as said,there is no evidence of any rule mandating that claiming ones constitutional right to remain silent must necessarily result in disbarment.golenbock could have asserted her fifth amendment privilege and later argued to the that the evidence against her,as a whole,was inadequate to warrant disbarment.we conclude that n either garrity nor any of its progeny brings defendant within the ambit of the coerced testimony doctrine.indorato,at.we affirm the district courts denial of golenbocks motion to suppress.
intended loss calculation golenbock and stein 
the district court increased golenbock and steins base offense levels by six levels because of the amount of the intended loss for which they were responsible the court determined that the intended loss was approximately,which it characterized as the amount of the net gain over the mortgage and expenses.the district courts findings were based on the facts that the wellfleet property was sold in june,for,and that remained after the mortgages,tax obligation and brokerage commission were deducted from the escrow.
we review a district court intended loss findings for clear error.see united states robbio,cir see also united states cali,cir clear error standard applied to sentence enhancements even where defendant objected in district court.courts can,and frequently do,deal with rough estimates,and as such,a party dissatisfied with a sentencing court quantification of the amount of loss must go a long way to demonstrate clear error.united states rowe,cir internal citations omitted.
golenbock and stein argue that the district courts calculation was flawed because it did not take into account the more than five years of carrying costs that defendants had paid while the property grew in value from its purchase price in to its sale price in.during this time period,golenbock and stein made insurance and mortgage payments totaling approximately.golenbock and stein argue that the creditors reaped the benefit of an increase in the value of the property that was created by golenbock and steins payments.golenbock and stein argue there was no intended loss whatsoever,because the amount they paid to carry the property over the five years approximately equaled the net value in.had they kept the sales proceeds,their net would be zero after subtracting the payments they made.
but we believe the district courts intended loss calculation was justifiable and well within the standards of the sentencing guidelines and relevant case law.section of the guidelines provides that an offense level shall be increased by six levels if the loss or intended loss amounts to more than.intended loss need not be determined with precision t he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.united states pervaz,cir quoting,cmt.see also united states parsons,cir loss is a proxy for the seriousness of the offense.section does not otherwise specify or restrict the means by which intended loss may be calculated in a bankruptcy case.compare cmt.providing special rules for calculating loss in particular types of cases,including loan fraud 
here,it was reasonable for the district court to treat the net gain realized on the sale of the property as the measure of the creditors intended loss.for each of the five previous years during which golenbock and stein held it,their exclusive control gave them the economic use of the property in addition to the profit they later realized when the property was sold.golenbock and stein could rent the property to others and on occasion did so.in lieu of renting it,they could and did themselves enjoy its use.in either event the property,during all of the years when they were paying the carrying charges,had immediate value to those who controlled it,just as ownership of ones home provides continuous economic value distinct from the capital gain when the home is eventually sold.in the circumstances,we think the district court could reasonably treat the economic value of the property during the years golenbock and stein fraudulently withheld it from their creditors as offsetting its carrying expenses,leaving the net gain on the sale as the amount golenbock and stein would have realized had the fraud succeeded and,conversely,as the loss the fraud would have caused to the creditors had the scheme worked.golenbock and stein clearly never intended by paying the mortgage and other expenses to benefit their creditors during this period they alone retained the exclusive right to the property use.we do not find clear error in the district courts refusal to subtract golenbock and steins annual payments from the.
nor is there error in the fact that the court evaluated the intended loss at the time golenbock and stein sold the wellfleet property,rather than at the time they filed for bankruptcy.like conspiracy,bankruptcy concealment has been described as a continuing offense.see united states gilbert,cir sultan united states,cir noting that,in addition to describing a statute of limitations,has substantive consequences.c oncealment by its nature is an act which goes on until detected or its consequences are purged.sultan,at.the fraud was still ongoing at the time the wellfleet property was sold,as the concealment had not yet been revealed at that point.hence,it was proper for the court to base its intended loss findings on the value of the property at the time of the sale.
sentencing enhancement stein 
the district court found that stein was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor for the purposes of c,and accordingly added two levels to her base offense level.stein argues that the evidence does not support the district court conclusion.because a sentencing court determination is necessarily,we review deferentially and only for clear error or mistake of law.see united states alicea,cir.
the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that stein role satisfies the requirements of c.see id.at.a increase pursuant to c is justified 
if the sentencing court supportably finds that the criminal enterprise involved at least two complicit participants of whom the defendant may be counted as one,and the defendant,in committing the offense,exercised control over,organized,or was otherwise responsible for superintending the activities of,at least one of those other persons.
united states cruz,cir en banc.in determining whether the defendant qualifies for the enhancement,the sentencing guidelines instruct courts to consider seven factors 
the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of participation in the commission of the offense,the recruitment of accomplices,the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,the nature and scope of the illegal activity,and the degree of control exercised over others.
cmt.this list of factors is representative rather than exhaustive.united states,cir.
stein opposed this enhancement in objections to the presentence report psr and at sentencing.on appeal,stein makes a very brief and general argument that the sentencing enhancement was erroneous because there was no evidence that she supervised or managed otis criminal conduct.we perceive no clear error.
the court could have reasonably found that stein,together with golenbock,devised and carried out a plan to conceal the wellfleet property from bankruptcy creditors and the trustee by having otis hold it for them in trust.stein signed the backdated deed of the wellfleet property to otis.stein met with the bankruptcy attorney,provided the information for her filing and attended the meetings of creditors.after they conveyed title to otis,stein and golenbock forwarded the tax forms to her.
the testimony of steins and golenbocks secretaries reflects that stein as well as golenbock exercised continuing authority with respect to the wellfleet property.stein paid or authorized the payment of bills,sometimes with handwritten directions on the bills.and with golenbock,stein received tax documents and insurance forms at her address.stein and golenbock made the arrangements with the real estate broker when the property was being sold.when the proceeds for the sale of the wellfleet property were issued to otis,amounting to more than,otis signed them over to accounts from which stein benefitted.
it is true that there is little evidence that stein,acting separately from golenbock directed otis activity related to the concealment.however,stein does not contend that two organizers can not act jointly to direct the activity of another,and we have found no authority so stating.hence,we perceive no clear error in the district courts determination that stein was a leader,supervisor,organizer or manager of otis.
sufficiency of the evidence stein and otis 
on appeal,stein and otis challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented against them.it is that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence after a conviction,the defendant must have preserved her rule motion by moving for an acquittal at the close of the defense evidence at trial.see united states,cir united states concemi,cir.
absent a renewal of the motion for acquittal after presenting the case for the defense,the motion for acquittal is considered waived.hence,in order to prevail on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,the defendants must then demonstrate clear and gross injustice.
concemi,at internal citations omitted.
here,stein and otis moved for acquittal under.at the close of the government evidence.neither afterward renewed her rule motion at the close of the defense evidence.hence,we apply the clear and gross injustice standard to this portion of stein and otis appeal.see id.after careful review,we conclude that the evidence presented at trial against stein and otis was sufficient to support a guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.
stein argues that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction because she simply followed golenbocks lead at every step of the way,without knowing that golenbock was concealing the property from the bankruptcy trustee.she contends that the evidence showed that only golenbock and otis controlled the property.there is no support for the conclusion,stein argues,that she knowingly retained an interest in the wellfleet property or that she intentionally concealed or conspired to conceal it from her bankruptcy creditors.we disagree,based on reasonable inferences from other evidence described in section,supra,as well as from the following evidence.
stein filed her bankruptcy separately from golenbocks.steins bankruptcy schedules and statement of financial affairs not only failed to list the wellfleet property as a property in which she held an interest,but also failed to list the cape cod five as a creditor,failed to disclose as the forms required had steins interest been transferred,as claimed,the previous december that she had previously been a part owner of the wellfleet property within the year before she filed for bankruptcy,and failed to disclose the civil litigation relating to a hot tub at the wellfleet property.in other words,there is evidence that even if stein was unaware that she had retained a continuing interest in the wellfleet property after the alleged december,transfer to otis,she failed to make appropriate disclosure as to multiple relevant aspects of her relationship to the wellfleet property,including her involvement before the transfer.
stein attended meetings and answered questions,affirming that the information contained in the schedules was truthful and accurate.her bankruptcy attorney,jeffrey schreiber,testified that all the information on the schedules was obtained from stein or golenbock.schreiber testified that he did not learn of the wellfleet property from stein or golenbock,however,but from a attorney only a couple of years before the trial in this case.
stein contended at trial that the wellfleet property in fact was legitimately and wholly conveyed to otis nine months before the bankruptcy filing.sufficient evidence would have enabled a reasonable jury to conclude otherwise,however.first,while the deed to otis was dated and notarized nine months earlier,it was not recorded until october,a week after the filing of the individual bankruptcy petitions by stein and golenbock.stein testimony as to where the deed was signed and notarized was confused.she testified that the deed was signed and notarized in andover,which is in essex county,but on its face the deed indicates that it was executed and notarized in middlesex county,where golenbock and stein resided.second,golenbock and stein continued to pay the mortgage and other expenses relating to the property after december,strongly suggesting no actual transfer to otis.they did not receive the stated consideration for the transfer.their names were not changed on bills relating to the property until.stein conceded that she had never attempted to list the property for sale with a real estate broker,but had just talked to otis,a close friend,about it.additionally,the declaration of trust for the realty trust,of which otis was supposedly the trustee,was recorded only at the time the deed was recorded this document was purported to have been executed on august of either or both dates appeared on it.from this evidence,the jury could have concluded that stein had never transferred nor intended to transfer her interest in trust to otis on december,prior to the bankruptcy.indeed,the jury could have determined that,even if prepared on that date,the deed was not delivered then or that it may even have been made later and backdated,after golenbock and stein had filed for bankruptcy.in any case,the evidence suggests that the deed had been fabricated as part of defendants scheme to conceal the property from bankruptcy creditors.
stein testified that between and,the wellfleet property payments were all made from the adams street trust account because otis had purchased the beneficial interest in that trust.this testimony was corroborated by that of her secretary,beverly rubin.however,neither stein nor rubin provided any supporting documents.furthermore,there was contradictory evidence checks and other payments relating to the wellfleet property,made during that time period,from accounts and sources other than the adams street trust account,including their bankruptcy checking account.in addition,steins signature appears on street trust checks in the early on payments for the wellfleet property,after the property was sold to otis.furthermore,after stein and golenbock received their bankruptcy discharges,but while their bankruptcy cases were still open,they began paying the cape cod five loans directly from an account in golenbocks name.two of those checks were signed by stein in october.moreover,despite the stated consideration of,no funds appear to have changed hands as between otis and the purported sellers,nor was the cape cod five notified of the purported sale to otis.
hence,the jury could have concluded that the sale to otis was a sham and that golenbock and stein paid the wellfleet expenses from their own funds,and that steins testimony at trial about the payments was false.see united states,cir the jury could legitimately have presumed that the fabrication was all the more proof of defendants guilt.as the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that stein knowingly and fraudulently concealed her interest in the wellfleet property from her bankruptcy creditors,and conspired with golenbock and otis to do so,there was no clear and gross injustice in her conviction.
otis argues that there was insufficient evidence that she willfully joined the conspiracy to conceal the wellfleet property from golenbock and stein bankruptcy creditors.she contends that she was unaware of any improprieties throughout the concealment scheme,and hence lacke
