a jury convicted talvin taquane lawing lawing of one count of possession of ammunition by a convicted felon in violation of g and a for which lawing was sentenced to months imprisonment.lawing conviction and sentence stem from the discovery of a sawed off shotgun and ammunition in his vehicle following a police stop initiated by a tip from a confidential informant ci.on appeal,lawing challenges the denial of his motion to suppress all evidence found during the stop and search of his vehicle and alleges multiplicitous counts of the indictment he claims each error warrants reversal of his conviction.he also argues,in the alternative,that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on may,the ci informed detective jerry alderman alderman of the special investigations unit in the rowan county,north carolina sheriff office rcso that he knew a man selling crack cocaine that afternoon,the ci met with alderman and told the detective that he had previously purchased crack cocaine from an individual the ci identified as drew.the ci described drew as a black male with short hair in his late twenties or early thirties.in the presence of detective alderman and detective kevin lee myers myers,the ci telephoned drew and ordered a quantity of crack cocaine,which drew agreed to shortly bring to the ci residence the officers recorded the telephone call between drew and the ci.
the ci informed the detectives that drew would deliver the crack cocaine to the ci residence in about minutes and that he would be driving a grey lexus automobile.the ci also told the detectives that drew would travel to his residence by driving along old concord road and turning left at old beatty ford road.
alderman and myers waited with the ci at his residence for drew to arrive and positioned a team of rcso officers in marked and unmarked cars along drew expected route of travel.these officers were provided with drew physical description,a description of drew vehicle,the predicted route,and expected arrival time at the ci residence.
about twenty minutes later,deputy jason naves naves,observed a grey lexus,driven by a black male matching the ci description of drew,turn left off old concord road onto old beatty ford road.naves followed the vehicle and effected a traffic stop of the vehicle about a half mile from the ci residence when naves ran the license tag to check the registration of the lexus,he determined the registration had expired and that the car was registered to lawing,not a person with the given name of drew.naves then approached the lexus and obtained the drivers licenses of the driver,which bore lawing name,and the passenger,which bore monica lowe name.
a few minutes later,detective gregory bacote bacote,arrived at the scene and also approached lawing vehicle.because the driver license of the driver of the lexus did not reflect the name of drew,bacote determined it was necessary to determine if lawing was indeed drew given that all the other predictive information from the had now been verified by the events leading to the stop of the lexus.bacote called the same telephone number the ci had used to call drew.lawing cell phone rang within five seconds of when bacote placed the call soon after,alderman and myers arrived at the scene.alderman then called the telephone number used by the ci to call drew and,once again,lawing cell phone rang immediately.after lawing phone rang a second time,officers concluded that drew was in fact lawing and requested a drug sniffing dog.the police officers then frisked and detained lawing and began to search his vehicle.
in the course of searching the vehicle,alderman found a loaded gauge shotgun under the carpet covering the spare tire in the trunk with one shell in the chamber.two additional shotgun shells were found in the vehicle glove box.no narcotics were found in the vehicle however,naves found a small specimen of white powder,in a compartment near the steering wheel,which field tested positive for cocaine.
lawing was then arrested and later charged in a superseding indictment with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g and a count i possession of ammunition by a convicted felon,also in violation of g and a count ii and possession of an unregistered shotgun modified having an overall length of less than inches,in violation of,d,and count iii.
lawing filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized during the stop and search of his vehicle under the fourth and fourteenth amendments the district court denied lawing motion based on its findings that the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the officers had a reasonable,articulable suspicion sufficient to stop lawing car,established that lawing was the person with whom the ci arranged the drug deal,and consequently,had probable cause to search lawing vehicle.the district court also found that the police did not search lawing cell phone for any information but only seized it temporarily to confirm that lawing was drew.
during trial,the government called naves,myers,and alderman,who had also testified at the suppression hearing,as witnesses.the officers testified about the stop and search of lawing vehicle,and their testimony echoed that provided during the suppression hearing.the government also called special agent darren soloman to testify about the manufacturers of the shotgun and ammunition to establish an interstate nexus to the offense.
upon the conclusion of the government case in chief,lawing moved to dismiss all charges under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure contending the evidence was insufficient to prove his guilt.the district court denied the motion,finding that the government evidence was sufficient upon which a reasonable jury could convict lawing.
lawing then presented his evidence by calling passenger monica lowe,who testified that two other people had recently driven the lexus before the day of lawing arrest and that she had never seen lawing possess a firearm or ammunition.lawing again made a rule motion to dismiss all charges,which the district court also denied,and the case went to the jury on all three counts.the jury returned a verdict finding lawing guilty of count ii possession of ammunition by a convicted felon,but acquitted him of counts i and iii.
the presentence investigation report psr determined that because lawing offense involved a firearm described in a,and because lawing committed the offense subsequent to two felony convictions for a crime of violence,his base offense level,for sentencing guidelines purposes was.united states sentencing guidelines manual ussg a.the psr gave no enhancements or adjustments to the base offense level which,when combined with a criminal history category of iv,resulted in an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
at sentencing,lawing objected to the psr calculation of his base offense level as and argued instead that his base offense level should be.the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that lawing conduct involved a firearm as described in a,and thus adopted the base offense level of as recommended in the psr.the district court then adopted the psr without change,including the to months imprisonment guidelines range.the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment.
lawing noted a timely appeal,and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
on appeal,lawing raises four issues the district court committed reversible error by denying his motion to suppress all evidence seized during the search of his car the district court erred in denying his rule motions the district court plainly erred by allowing the government to proceed at trial on two counts under g and the district court abused its discretion at sentencing in finding by a preponderance of the evidence that his offense involved the possession of a shotgun as described by a.
an appellate court reviews a district court factual findings in a motion to suppress for clear error and its legal findings de novo.united states day,cir.when the district court denies a motion to suppress,the appellate court views the facts in the light most favorable to the government.united states matthews,cir.
lawing first argues the district court committed reversible error by denying his motion to suppress all evidence seized during the search of his car including the ammunition that formed the basis for the sole count of conviction under count ii.we conclude the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress because the government demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that police had a reasonable,articulable suspicion sufficient to stop lawing car established that lawing was drew,the person with whom the ci arranged the drug deal and had probable cause to search lawing vehicle.
stop of lawing vehicle 
law enforcement can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot,even if the officer lacks probable cause.united states christmas,cir quoting united states sololow,d.reasonable suspicion is simply a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity.ornelas united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.it is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence even though t he fourth amendment still requires at least a minimal level of objective justification for making the stop.illinois wardlow,d.
here,the police had reasonable suspicion,supported by articulable facts,to believe that criminal activity was afoot when it conducted the stop of lawing vehicle.the ci had relayed information to the police in a setting thereby affording them the clear ability to judge his credibility and corroborate the information he provided.see united states perkins,cir stating that law enforcement in a encounter with an informant,can judge the credibility of the tipster firsthand and thus confirm whether the tip is sufficiently reliable to support reasonable suspicion.informants who report tips are more trustworthy and reliable than an anonymous tip because law enforcement can hold the informant accountable for false statements.christmas,at.moreover,informants who make statements adverse to their own penal interests may bolster their credibility.see united states harris,d stating a dmissions of crime carry their own indicia of credibility.
the totality of the circumstances in the case at bar afforded the police reasonable suspicion to stop lawing car.police had a encounter with the informant,who provided substantial and verifiable details that established the necessary indicia of reliability lawing drove the car that the ci said he would drive lawing took the route that the ci said he would take lawing appeared at the time the ci said he would arrive,in a place close to the intended delivery address.
this course of events allowed law enforcement to corroborate the ci account of the time and circumstances of the intended cocaine delivery.by exposing himself to potential criminal liability in telling the police he had previously purchased crack cocaine from drew,the ci further enhanced his credibility.
despite significant factual distinctions between what occurred in this case and the facts in florida,d,lawing cites as support for his argument that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop his vehicle.however,the facts in stand in such contrast to those in the case at bar that actually supports the holding of the district court and the position of the government in this appeal.
in,an anonymous informant in an unknown location provided police the present location of a person alleged to possess a firearm.the police carried out a stop of,recovered a firearm,and moved to suppress.id.at.the supreme court agreed that the motion to suppress was properly granted.the court held that the police needed more than just an anonymous tip lacking indicia of reliability to stop and detain id.at.because the police knew neither the identity nor the location of the informant,police could not assess the informant credibility nor hold the informant responsible for fabricated information.as the court explained,a ll the police had to go on was the bare report of an unknown,unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about id.at.the anonymous tip in,without more,was insufficient as a matter of law because reasonable suspicion requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality,not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.id.at.
the facts of the case at bar,however,are materially different from those in here,police had ample indicia that the ci tip was credible.unlike in,the ci here was known to police.and unlike in,the ci ordered cocaine base from the defendant in the presence of the officers,thus providing the police with a credible assertion that lawing was engaged in illegal activity.furthermore,the ci tip here contained predictive information that the supreme court found lacking in id.at.in sum,the ci tip in this case had a tendency to identify a determinate person,lawing,and was reliable in its assertion of illegality.id.accordingly,we reject lawing contention that requires reversal of the district court,and readily conclude that the stop of lawing vehicle was appropriate.
ii.seizure of lawing cell phone 
lawing also contends his cell phone was illegally seized without probable cause.accordingly,he argues any evidence discovered subsequent to the seizure should have been suppressed.
after stopping the lexus lawing was driving,deputy naves examined his driver license,which did not reflect the name of the driver as drew.in view of the other information from the ci on the make and color of the car,its precise route and timing,the physical description of the driver,all of which the police had now verified,they undertook to determine whether lawing was indeed drew.to do so,officers simply called the telephone number that the ci had earlier used to place the crack cocaine order with drew.
the supreme court has stated in appropriate circumstances the fourth amendment allows a properly limited search or seizure on facts that do not constitute probable cause to arrest or to search for contraband or evidence of crime.united states brignoni ponce,d.a court determines the lawfulness of such a limited seizure by balancing the right of the individual to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures with the opposing interests of law enforcement.united states place,d.when law enforcement has substantial interests in carrying out a search or seizure,it may carry out minimally intrusive seizures based on reasonable suspicion.id.at.
at the outset,we note that lawing,in his brief,characterizes the officers actions as a search of his cell phone.the district court,however,found the o fficers did not search lawing cell phone for any information.we agree with the district court assessment,as nothing in the record supports lawing claim that his cell phone was the subject of a search.the police did not attempt to retrieve any information from within the phone.instead,the officers possession of lawing cell phone was limited to quickly determining whether lawing phone would ring when drew number was dialed.detective bacote did not seize lawing cell phone to gain information from within the phone and possessed it for no other purpose than confirming lawing identity as drew.
this limited seizure of the cell phone was justified.although lawing provided a driver license that did not bear the name drew,the totality of the circumstances afforded the police officers reasonable suspicion to take minimal steps to determine whether lawing was drew.
this seizure was minimally intrusive,and the strong countervailing governmental interests,place,at,of preventing the trafficking and distribution of outweighed lawing possessory interest in his cell phone during the brief duration of the stop.law enforcement momentary seizure of lawing phone was permissible in the limited and specific context in which it occurred and did not violate the fourth amendment
