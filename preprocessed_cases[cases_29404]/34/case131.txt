following a trial,a jury convicted the defendants on conspiracy and drug possession charges stemming from their role in a criminal organization operating a hour drug point in the jesus piñero public housing project in canóvanas,puerto rico.each of the three defendants was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute at least grams of cocaine base,at least kilograms of cocaine,and a measurable quantity of marijuana within feet of a protected zone and of aiding and abetting the same in violation of a,b a iii,and,and.defendant jesús díaz correa was also convicted of conspiracy to possess firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking crimes in violation of o.each defendant received a lengthy term of incarceration díaz correa was sentenced to months,juan santos rivera to months,and jeffery carrasquillo ocasio to months.the jury also imposed a forfeiture under.
defendants díaz correa and carrasquillo ocasio challenge their convictions,asserting that the district court erred in denying their motions under federal rule of criminal procedure for a judgment of acquittal.díaz correa also argues in the alternative that his conviction was irreparably tainted by prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.carrasquillo ocasio and santos rivera both challenge their sentences.
although there was an instance of prosecutorial misconduct here,it is saved by harmless error.hence,we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
we turn to the trial record for the following background,presenting the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states gómez rosario,cir.
the three defendants in this case were indicted,along with,for their role in a substantial,organized drug trafficking conspiracy operating out of the jesús piñero public housing project piñero in canóvanas,puerto rico from to.according to the testimony at trial,the drug point operated around the clock,moving at least vials of crack cocaine,bags of powder cocaine,and bags of marijuana on a daily basis.
the piñero operation was sufficiently organized so that each had a prescribed,specialized role within the operation.santos rivera was a pusher,meaning he sold drugs at the drug point on behalf of the organization and received a commission on those sales.carrasquillo ocasio was also a pusher for the organization,but during the relevant period he was promoted and became a runner for the bags of cocaine.as such,he was in charge of delivering cocaine from the stash points to the sellers working the drug point,and he had to collect and tally cash at the end of shifts,distribute to the sellers their commission,and return that money to the drug point administrators.díaz correa was an administrator of the piñero drug point.he was responsible for overseeing the operations of the drug point and hosting meetings with other leaders to organize and plan the conspiracy unlawful business.
to support the charge of a drug trafficking conspiracy,the government introduced drugs and weapons seized from piñero,surveillance photographs and video recordings of the drug point in operation,and recordings of conversations between various.to tie the three to the conspiracy,the government relied primarily on the testimony of two confessed former gretchen villafañe,the common law wife of the organization incarcerated former leader,and daniel nuñez rivera,also known as danny sellés,an active member of the piñero drug operation who became a confidential informant sometime in.the jury convicted the defendants on every count charged in the indictment.
we first discuss the challenges to the convictions,beginning with díaz correa and carrasquillo ocasio sufficiency challenges and then address díaz correa allegation of prosecutorial misconduct.we close with a discussion of carrasquillo ocasio and santos rivera challenges to their sentencing.
ii.challenges to the convictions 
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review de novo the district court denial of a motion made under rule for judgment of acquittal.united states fernández hernández,cir.in our review,w e examine the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.we do not assess the credibility of witnesses,as that role is reserved for the jury.nor need we be convinced that the government succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant innocence.rather,we must decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom,would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.united states.troy,cir citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.this standard of review is formidable and defendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.united states lipscomb,cir citation omitted internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also united states polanco,cir noting that a sufficiency challenge is a tough sell.
drug trafficking charges 
to prove a drug conspiracy charge under,the government is obliged to show that a conspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it,intending to commit the underlying substantive offense.united states baltas,cir citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.because neither can seriously contend that a drug conspiracy did not exist at piñero,both defendants attack the evidence demonstrating their agreement to participate in the operation there.specifically,they argue that the testimony of the government key witnesses,nuñez rivera and villafañe,was too conclusory and unreliable for a reasonable factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that díaz correa and carrasquillo ocasio were involved in the drug trafficking conspiracy and drug distribution activities at piñero.we discuss díaz correa sufficiency challenge before turning to carrasquillo ocasio.
díaz correa 
díaz correa offers three interrelated arguments in support of his sufficiency challenge.first,he argues that because no physical evidence offered at trial linked him to the piñero conspiracy,the testimony of two is per se insufficient to support a conviction.second,he argues that even if a conviction could in some instances be supported by testimony,nuñez rivera and villafañe testimony was insufficient in his case to establish that he participated in the piñero conspiracy.finally,he argues that even if the testimony taken at face value would be sufficient to support his conviction,their testimony was not credible.
díaz correa argument that the testimony of,standing alone,is never sufficient to support a conviction is foreclosed by our case law.we have previously upheld drug conspiracy and aiding and abetting convictions where the evidence tying the defendant to the conspiracy was provided primarily by the testimony of a single who became a paid government informant.see united states gonzález vázquez,cir see also united states fernández hernández,cir.indeed,we have consistently reaffirmed that a conviction may be based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of a confidential informant so long as the testimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.gonzález vázquez,at quoting united states ciocca,cir.
díaz correa second argument that villafañe and nuñez rivera testimony amounts to vague generalizations is equally unavailing.during their testimony,both nuñez rivera and villafañe demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the piñero drug conspiracy.for example,when shown photographs of several,nuñez rivera knew their names,their roles in the conspiracy,where they worked,and what drugs they supplied.he testified as to the shift schedule for pushers working at the drug point and the general flow of operations at piñero,including which times of day,days of the week,and days of the month were usually busy and which ones were slow.for her part,villafañe testified as to how she would hide weapons and drugs for the conspiracy in her home.she also described meetings she attended with the organization leaders and could identify which were in charge of the money,of cooking the crack cocaine,and of packaging and weighing the drugs.
the testimony of the two witnesses as to díaz correa specific role in the conspiracy was likewise more than sufficiently detailed to sustain his conviction.in particular,both nuñez rivera and villafañe described díaz correa rise to power in.ismael heredia,the organization incarcerated leader,became dissatisfied with his former drug point administrator and determined to replace him with díaz correa.nuñez rivera testified that díaz correa frequently came to piñero in person to administer his drug point,and that once he had established himself as the administrator of the piñero drug point,he began to operate the drug point in a similar manner to his predecessor,including hosting organizational meetings at a place called la selva.this testimony was also confirmed in part by recorded conversations between villafañe and heredia,during which they discussed díaz correa.
credibility is a question for the jury,which on appeal must be resolved in favor of the government.see united states ayala garcía,cir.although díaz correa attempts to save his argument for evidentiary insufficiency by pointing to a few minor inconsistencies between nuñez rivera and villafañe testimony,such minor inconsistencies in otherwise lengthy and corroborated testimony will not undermine the witness credibility.see united states rodriguez,cir.
carrasquillo ocasio 
in an echo of díaz correa argument,carrasquillo ocasio asserts that nuñez rivera testimony against him amounted to nothing more than vague generalizations.but,again,the record reveals that nuñez rivera gave detailed testimony based on his personal experiences selling drugs with carrasquillo ocasio.nuñez rivera could recall the specific timing of the shifts he worked with carrasquillo ocasio and what drugs they sold.when shown a map of the piñero complex,nuñez rivera pointed out the exact locations where he and carrasquillo ocasio sold drugs together.nuñez rivera recalled carrasquillo ocasio promotion to a runner,and he described the process carrasquillo ocasio would use when delivering the cocaine to the drug point and when collecting the cash revenues at the end of the shifts and delivering them to the organization leaders.this testimony was consistent with villafañe testimony that she personally delivered cash to carrasquillo ocasio which he in turn delivered to the drug point leaders.
in short,nuñez rivera and villafañe testimony was not incredible or insubstantial on its face,ciocca,at,and was more than enough to enable a reasonable factfinder to determine carrasquillo ocasio guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
díaz correa conviction under section o 
díaz correa argument that there was insufficient evidence to convict him under o is similarly unpersuasive.where a defendant is charged under o the jury does not even need to find that the defendant himself ever used or possessed a firearm in furtherance of the drug conspiracy.it would be sufficient to find that he was part of an agreement to do so.united states flores de jesús,cir.as previously discussed,there was more than sufficient evidence in this case that díaz correa was a leader of the drug conspiracy at piñero.thus,to sustain a conviction under section o,the government need only show that díaz correa was part of an agreement to use firearms in furtherance of the piñero organization interests.
at trial,the government offered testimony and real evidence demonstrating that firearms were used regularly in furtherance of the piñero drug conspiracy.firearms and ammunition which had been seized from members of the piñero drug trafficking operation were entered into evidence,including a rifle,a sig sauer pistol,a colt revolver,a glock pistol,and a smith wesson caliber revolver.many of these weapons were seized from sellers operating at piñero during a single raid.
villafañe and nuñez rivera testimony also established that guns were a regular part of the operation of the piñero drug conspiracy.for example,villafañe testified that she stored guns on behalf of the organization and she testified that certain always carried guns while at piñero.
nuñez rivera also testified that he had seen díaz correa himself carry guns while administering the drug point.according to nuñez rivera,when díaz correa was promoted to administrator at the drug point 
a manuel let us know that the housing project no longer was ismael,that it was his.and he was he wanted no fucking around with his stuff.
q sir,was manuel armed that day 
q did manuel carry firearms aside from that day 
a yes.you could not see it,but you could notice the bulge in his waist and also darren.
q aside from seeing the bulge,did you ever see a firearm 
a yes.once in a car manuel and darren were counting some money and i approached and asked him for.
q what type of firearm did you see 
a he had a beretta on top of his right thigh inside the car.
nuñez rivera and villafañe testimony and the real evidence offered at trial provided more than enough evidence for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that díaz correa had agreed with other leaders of the organization to use firearms to promote their operation.
prosecutor misconduct during closing argument 
díaz correa argues that the prosecutor conduct during closing argument was so inflammatory that it amounted to misconduct.we briefly review the events at closing argument before discussing the propriety of the prosecutor actions.
in his closing argument,counsel for díaz correa suggested that the bulge that nuñez rivera testified he had seen in díaz correa waistband at piñero was not necessarily the beretta that nuñez rivera saw later in díaz correa lap.defense counsel suggested that the bulge could have been created by another object,such as a cell phone.
to respond to this suggestion during her rebuttal,the prosecuting attorney went to the evidence table and selected a pistol that had been entered into evidence.the pistol she selected was not a beretta,and there was no evidence or allegation that it had ever been owned or carried by díaz correa.nevertheless,the prosecuting attorney held the gun in front of the jury and said 
and let talk about the bulge.you heard an argument that the bulge in the waist cover was a cell phone.consider this,compare this cell phone with this pistol.and use your common sense.
counsel for díaz correa objected,and the district court agreed that the prosecutor use of the gun was inappropriate,particularly given that the firearm selected was not the beretta díaz correa allegedly possessed.the district court then instructed the jury not to consider the pistol that was shown,but allowed the prosecutor to make her point that a cell phone was unlikely to cause the bulge seen by nuñez rivera.
the term prosecutorial misconduct covers a broad swath of improper conduct by the state attorney that may impair an accused constitutional rights to a fair trial,such as commenting on an accused decision to remain silent,witness vouching,and introducing inadmissible evidence through.see,doyle ohio,holding that it is improper for prosecutor to comment on accused silence united states vázquez botet,cir discussing improper witness vouching united states hall,cir discussing improper introduction of hearsay evidence through artful and collecting cases.in the closing argument context,a prosecutor remarks or actions are improper where they serve no purpose other than to inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury,and to interject issues broader than the guilt or innocence of the accused.arrieta agressot united states,cir citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.we are particularly sensitive to inappropriate conduct during rebuttal,when the improper remarks are among the last words spoken to the jury by the trial attorneys.ayala garcía,at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.where,as here,defendant counsel makes a timely objection to the prosecutor conduct,we review de novo whether the remarks amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.id.at.
the prosecutor actions in this case are an example of prosecutorial misconduct.under these circumstances,taking a gun from the evidence table and brandishing it before the jury during rebuttal is obviously inflammatory.it should have been evident to the prosecutor that she should have broached with the judge the idea of presenting the gun to the jury in this provocative manner,thereby allowing the defense to register its objection.the court would have proscribed or modified the demonstration and the ensuing problems could have easily been avoided.given that the gun used in the demonstration was not even the one allegedly owned or used by díaz correa,a fact that the prosecutor knew,the prosecutor behavior is all the more troubling.
it is also troubling that this demonstration was unnecessary.as the district court suggested,the prosecutor could have made her point that a cell phone was too small to create the bulge just as easily by displaying the cell phone without the gun and asking the jury to use its common sense.moreover,even without nuñez rivera testimony that he had seen a bulge in díaz correa waistband,there was more than enough evidence for the jury to conclude that díaz correa had conspired to use guns in furtherance of the piñero drug operation.indeed,shortly after his testimony about the bulge,nuñez rivera testified that he had seen the beretta in díaz correa possession on another occasion.it is important for a prosecutor to know when the potential costs of an argument to the jury or a demonstration far outweigh the need for it.here,an impulsive and unnecessary decision by a prosecutor risked undermining all of the hard work of a jury trial,which was itself the product of a investigation.
nevertheless,the supreme court has stated that where the record,viewed in the aggregate,presents overwhelming evidence establishing the defendant guilt we are compelled to conclude that the prosecutor improper remarks did not so poison the well that the trial outcome was likely affected.united states andújar basco,cir quoting united states henderson,cir see also vázquez botet,at w e are mindful of the supreme court admonition that we not set guilty persons free simply to punish prosecutorial misconduct.united states auch,cir w e heed the supreme court admonition against letting the guilty go free to punish prosecutorial misconduct.citing united states hastings.in this case,we are convinced that the evidence was so overwhelmingly on the government side that the jury would have convicted regardless of the prosecutor misguided demonstration.as such,the prosecutor error was harmless,and we affirm the conviction.
iii.sentencing challenges 
carrasquillo ocasio 
after conviction,carrasquillo ocasio faced a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of years and a sentencing guidelines recommendation of months to life.finding that the sentence recommended under the guidelines was greater than necessary,the district court sentenced carrasquillo ocasio to years of imprisonment.carrasquillo ocasio appeals,arguing that his sentence should be remanded because of the fair sentencing act and the district court failure to make an individualized drug quantity determination.we examine each argument in turn.
fair sentencing act 
on august,president obama signed the fair sentencing act of fsa,stat,which reduced the disparity in sentencing between offenses involving crack cocaine and those involving powder cocaine.the fsa itself did not address retroactivity,but in united states goncalves,cir,cert.denied,we joined ten of our fellow circuit courts of appeal in concluding that the fsa is not retroactive for the benefit of a defendant like carrasquillo ocasio,whose criminal conduct and sentencing occurred before the fsa became law.see id.at see also united states curet,cir that the fsa does not apply to individuals who were sentenced before the fsa was signed into law.
carrasquillo ocasio was sentenced on july,shortly before the fsa became law.on appeal,carrasquillo ocasio urges us to overturn our decision in goncalves,and hold that the fsa should be applied retroactively to reduce the sentences of those who,like him,were sentenced under the harsher mandatory minimums for offenses and whose appeals were still pending on august,
there are only two circumstances,however,when a panel of this court may overturn the holding of a previous panel.united states malouf,cir.the first is where supervening authority,such as an en banc decision,an opinion of the supreme court,or newly passed legislation undermines the decision of a previous panel.see united states holloway,cir united states allen,f d,cir.the second,which we have described as hen teeth rare,occurs where authority that postdates the original decision,although not directly controlling,may offer a compelling reason for believing that the former panel,in light of new developments,would change its collective mind.malouf,at internal quotation marks omitted.as carrasquillo ocasio admits that no supervening authority exists and points to no compelling reason why the former panel would have changed its collective mind,we decline to revisit goncalves.
individualized drug quantity and credibility determination 
when sentencing a participant in a conspiracy,the district court must make an individualized finding concerning the quantity of drugs attributable to,or reasonably foreseeable by,the offender.united states cintrón echautegui,cir footnote omitted see also united states colon solis,cir noting that in a drug conspiracy case a determination of drug quantity is a required benchmark for individualized sentencing under the guidelines.we review the question of whether the sentencing judge made an individual quantity determination at all de novo if we determine that an individualized determination was made,our review is only for clear error.see cintrón echautegui,at.
at the sentencing hearing,the court made a clear individualized quantity determination,concluding that carrasquillo ocasio was responsible for the entire drug quantity sold during the time he participated in the piñero conspiracy from sometime in until early,rather than the entire lifespan of the conspiracy.the court stated a s to the specific drug amount i f it had been,it would have been greater,but it specific to his participation during the time he was present and let me note,it different from other defendants this one specifically narrowed to his presence to early.
carrasquillo ocasio argues that it was error to attribute to him the entire quantity of drugs moved by the conspiracy during the time he participated in the piñero operation,rather than merely the drugs he personally sold or delivered.this argument misunderstands carrasquillo ocasio liability.as a member of a conspiracy,he was liable not only for the drugs attributable to him,but also to those reasonably foreseeable by him.id.evidence at trial indicated that carrasquillo ocasio not only sold drugs at the drug point,but also that he was a runner,responsible for moving drugs from the stash house to the drug point and for collecting and delivering cash revenues from the conspiracy.the district court was thus well within the bounds of reasonableness to conclude that the entire drug quantity moved through piñero was reasonably foreseeable by carrasquillo ocasio.there was no error.
carrasquillo ocasio further asserts that our decision in united states correy,cir,requires us to remand his case for resentencing because the district court failed to make an explicit credibility assessment of nuñez rivera testimony,which was the primary evidence given at trial as to specific drug quantities.in correy,also a conspiracy conviction under section where specific drug quantities were adduced from the testimony of a single witness,we remanded for resentencing because the district court judge failed to make a credibility assessment of that witness testimony.see id.at.
despite these facial similarities,carrasquillo ocasio reliance on correy is misplaced.the factors that gave rise to our concerns in correy are not present in this case.in correy,a judge who had not presided over the trial presided over sentencing,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing suggested that the sentencing judge was not fami
