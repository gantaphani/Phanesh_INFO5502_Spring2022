in two prior appeals to this court,appellant juan manuel cruzado successfully raised claims that required remand to the district court for recalculation of his sentence.a third sentencing hearing was held in april,nearly four years after cruzado was convicted on charges.he now attempts a new round of challenges to his month term of imprisonment and the related imposition of restitution and a fine.finding no merit in any of these claims,we affirm all aspects of his sentence.
the factual background of appellant crimes was fully detailed in our two prior opinions.see united states,cir cruzado ii united states,cir cruzado i.it suffices to say here that cruzado,the former mayor of vega alta,puerto rico,was convicted by a jury in june on charges of embezzlement,extortion,money laundering and witness tampering stemming from conduct undertaken while he was in office,including demanding kickbacks on municipal contracts.the district court imposed a term of imprisonment and a fine,and subsequently ordered cruzado to pay restitution in the amount of.
in his first appeal,we rejected various challenges to his conviction,but remanded for resentencing because the district court had applied the wrong version of the sentencing guidelines.after a new calculation on remand,the court again imposed a term,which was the bottom of the new guidelines range of months,and reinstated the same fine and restitution amounts.see cruzado ii,at.cruzado filed a second appeal challenging the district court application of several guidelines provisions.we detected a single the court erroneously had applied an enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust under.id.at.we therefore again remanded for resentencing,noting that we do not intend to intimate that the length of the sentence should necessarily be changed.id.at.we also stated that cruzado challenges to the district court imposition of restitution,a fine and supervised release were too perfunctory to permit us to evaluate the merits of those aspects of his punishment,citing our well established precedent that issues unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation are deemed waived,id.at quoting united states zannino,cir.
a third sentencing hearing was held on april.cruzado and the government agreed on the criminal history category i and the total base offense level,which resulted in a guidelines range of to months of imprisonment.cruzado argued at the hearing that the district court could reconsider all aspects of his sentence,including restitution,because the appeals court had not explicitly limited the remand to a reassessment of the correct term of imprisonment without the enhancement.he also sought to present witnesses to prove that he was actually innocent,that he had been subject to malicious prosecution,and that there were no victims of his hence no need for no loss had occurred.the district court determined that it could consider only the appropriate sentence within the applicable guidelines range.it agreed,however,to hear character testimony from four witnesses,and it allowed cruzado to submit the questions his counsel had planned to ask of those witnesses and the five additional witnesses he had wanted to call.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court again imposed a term and also the same restitution and fine.
cruzado has once again appealed his sentence,raising five claims of error the district court improperly refused to conduct a de novo hearing even if a full de novo resentencing was barred,the court should have made new findings on the restitution and fine amounts because they are integral elements of every sentence the court impermissibly his lack of acceptance of responsibility appellant should have been allowed to present victim testimony in mitigation of his punishment and bias on the part of the sentencing judge denied appellant due process,requiring resentencing before a different judge.we briefly explain why each of these contentions fails 
scope of and fine 
appellant argues that the district court improperly limited the scope of his latest sentencing hearing to a decision on the appropriate term of imprisonment within the recalculated guidelines range,which was corrected from months to months.cruzado asserts that resentencings after remand should be conducted as de novo proceedings and that his entire the amount of therefore open to reconsideration.although some circuits do generally allow de novo resentencing on remand,see,united states duso,cir united states smith,cir,the first circuit does not.in united states ticchiarelli,cir,we held 
u pon a resentencing occasioned by a remand,unless the court of appeals has expressly directed otherwise,the district court may consider only such new arguments or new facts as are made newly relevant by the court of appeals by the reasoning or by the result.
id.at quoting united states whren.
appellant acknowledges this precedent,which gives the panel remanding the case for resentencing the responsibility for altering the normal scope of the new sentencing hearing.hence,he appears to concede that the issue of de novo resentencing is not,as a general principle,properly before us.see naser jewelers,concord,cir noting that a subsequent panel lacks power to overrule the decision of an earlier panel.the issue is raised,he explains,to preserve it for en banc and supreme court review.
however,as a separate challenge,he contends that restitution and a fine are such integral parts of a sentence that,even in a remand limited to correcting the error,they are within the exception carved out in ticchiarelli for matters made newly relevant by the court of appeals decision.at.in effect,he argues that whenever a court resentences a defendant,it must reconsider any related restitution and fine.
this attempt to avoid the holding in ticchiarelli is unavailing in this case.cruzado contested restitution at his second sentencing hearing and challenged both restitution and the fine in his prior appeal.however,as noted above,we deemed those challenges waived because the claims were inadequately developed.the need to correct the error has not given new merit to his opposition to those assessments.in this appeal,he argues that restitution was improper because no victim had a loss and that the fine was improper because he had no resources to pay it.these assertions are unrelated to the issue and had no relationship to the issue before the court on appropriate length of the sentence under the guidelines.see,united states elizondo,cir holding that a remand for resentencing in light of united states booker,d,did not the issue of restitution.
cruzado also suggests that,given the lower base offense level resulting from his second appeal,the district court should have considered imposing lower amounts of restitution and fine.however,defense counsel acknowledged at the sentencing hearing that the fine imposed,was the lowest point of a range that went up to.the restitution order was based on specific findings of loss and not on guidelines sentencing ranges.because neither the amount of restitution nor the size of the fine was made newly relevant by the court of appeals decision,appellant is not entitled to another opportunity to assert these claims.ticchiarelli,at quoting whren,at.
the district court therefore properly limited the scope of the latest sentencing hearing to consideration of the appropriate sentence within the applicable guidelines range,and our review is likewise restricted to issues related to appellant term of imprisonment.
double counting of failure to express remorse 
appellant argues that the district court improperly considered his lack of remorse in deciding to a term of imprisonment,which had become the high end of the applicable guidelines range after the court eliminated the erroneous enhancement for abuse of trust.at his previous sentencing,months was the low end of the applicable range.appellant contends that using his lack of remorse to justify a sentence amounted to impermissible because his refusal to admit guilt already was taken into account when he did not receive a decrease in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under.
