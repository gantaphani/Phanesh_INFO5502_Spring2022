after a trial,a federal jury convicted leo felton and erica chase of a number of offenses centering around a bank robbery,counterfeiting,and the planned construction of an explosive device.the district court then directed a judgment of acquittal for both defendants on one of these a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.the defendants now appeal from their convictions and felton from his sentence as well the united states from the judgment of acquittal ordered by the district court.
we begin with a summary of the background facts.although the facts are commonly stated in the light most favorable to the verdict,this perspective strictly applies only for challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence other claims,including most of those made here,prejudicial evidence,may require a more balanced treatment.see gray genlyte group,cir,cert.denied,d.however,in this case,most of the raw facts are not reasonably disputable.
while serving a prison sentence in new jersey,avowed white plotting with other prisoners to set up a small cell when he was released in january.the goal of the cell was to incite a racial holy war through violent actions such as murders and bombings of targets associated with racial and religious minorities.among the other prisoners involved in these plans were thomas struss,wesley dellinger,and michael reid.
by early,chase had begun corresponding with felton through a prison outreach program run by the world church of the white supremacist group to which chase belonged.in their letters felton and chase discussed their racist ideologies,and felton began to suggest his plans for violent action after his release,although he did not mention anything specific.upon his release,felton returned to his wife in ipswich,massachusetts,and began putting his plans into action.
from prison,felton had suggested that his wife purchase a for her own protection.she purchased a caliber revolver when he returned to ipswich,felton took over the gun and obliterated the serial number.he also purchased software and printing supplies to begin producing counterfeit bills on his home computer.in february,when struss was released from prison,felton invited struss to stay with him in massachusetts and begin their cell operations in earnest.
upon struss arrival,struss and felton agreed that bank robberies,armored car robberies,and counterfeiting were all viable options for acquiring funds,and that with the funds thus acquired,the two would go underground and begin to incite interracial violence by bombing jewish targets or killing jewish,black,or civil rights leaders.felton told struss that chase was dedicated to their cause and would be joining their cell and helping with counterfeiting.he also mentioned the possibility of using fertilizer bombs to carry out their plans.
at the close of the evening,the two men decided that they would start off with an easy robbery designed to build trust between them.the next morning,struss entered a bank in copley square scouted by both men,slipped the teller a demand note,and made off with approximately in cash as felton waited outside with his wife gun the two then fled.after dividing the proceeds,felton gave struss the gun and the two split up,planning to reunite in a few days time.
not long after,struss was arrested in new jersey in an attempted in preparation for an armored car robbery with another cell member in the area.when struss was released on bail,felton told him by telephone to return to boston to assume a new identity,noting that chase had progressed with the counterfeiting operations and could provide him with a safe house.struss never returned to boston,choosing eventually to cooperate with the authorities and testify against felton and chase at trial.
chase,meanwhile,had continued her correspondence with felton,and the two had begun speaking frequently on the phone after his release.they started to coordinate the specifics of their counterfeiting operation,and chase began to plan to move to boston and join felton.chase confided in a friend and fellow white supremacist,james niemczura,that she intended to blow up a holocaust or black history museum,and that felton was planning on robbing banks and blowing stuff up after his release and did not expect to live for more than a year.
in late february,chase stole money from niemczura and sent it to felton to finance the startup costs of the counterfeiting operation in ipswich.by,she had purchased a caliber iberia pistol,and had tried to purchase a second handgun but was unable to do so.chase confided to niemczura that she had purchased the gun for protection f rom anyone trying to interfere with her plan with felton.
she said that their plan was to burn off their fingerprints with hot oil and assume the identities of missing children so that they could g o around and be terrorists,but she would not specify any further details for fear that niemczura would be questioned by law enforcement.chase did say that niemczura would read about their exploits in the papers,and that she and felton would go down in history.
in early april,chase arrived in boston and moved into an apartment leased by felton.the two began to pass counterfeit bills and gather the materials for a fertilizer bomb,including a to use as a timing device and a bag of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,both of which were stored in the apartment.felton ordered explosive devices,to be delivered to his ipswich residence,to ignite the bomb.when felton told one of chase close friends that they were making a bomb,chase nodded in assent.chase confided in the same friend that she and felton were counterfeiting,and she referred to the bomb as her future with felton.
on april,felton and chase were arrested when chase attempted to pass a counterfeit bill.thereafter,chase asked her close friend to remove from the boston apartment the fertilizer bag,the wiring from the disassembled,items associated with the counterfeiting including uncut bills and software,a box of chase correspondence and keepsakes,white supremacist paraphernalia,and chase lay loaded on the nightstand in the same room as the fertilizer.felton told his wife in ipswich to destroy his computer hard drive.
chase and felton were charged with conspiring to make and possess a destructive device in violation of,see also f,d f possessing a firearm in furtherance of that offense,c a counterfeiting and conspiracy to do so,id,and conspiring to obstruct,and obstructing,justice,id.b b.felton alone was charged with attempting to receive explosives to injure,kill,or destroy property,id.d two counts of being a felon in possession,id.g and two counts relating to bank robbery and hobbs act robbery,id.
at the ensuing trial,the jury convicted both defendants on all counts,save that it acquitted chase on the counterfeiting count.having reserved the issue during trial,the district court granted motions for acquittal of both defendants on the charge of possessing a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy the court deemed the evidence insufficient to establish the in furtherance element.united states chase,d.felton was sentenced to months in prison and chase to months.
on defendants appeals,a central argument by the sole argument to which chase devoted her opening that the district court erred by admitting evidence of the defendants ideological beliefs.specifically,defendants object to the introduction of evidence linking them to white supremacist organizations or activities,including testimony regarding chase association with matthew hale and a photograph of chase engaging in a nazi salute while standing with hale a world church of the creator pamphlet containing an article written by chase about white power rallies she had attended and a separate pamphlet by the church that discussed an apocalyptic future in which white women were publicly by negroids.
the argument is that this evidence was highly prejudicial in the sense that it tended to inflame the jury and encourage it to decide other than on the merits that its probative value in proving the offenses charged was small and that because its prejudicial impact greatly outweighed its probative value,it should have been excluded under the calculus contained in.the district court assessment in such a case is reviewed under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.united states smith,cir,cert.denied,d.
unfortunately for the defendants,evidence of their beliefs and associations was highly relevant.chase scarcely denied counterfeiting but sought to separate herself from the enterprise showing her motive to engage in the latter was thus important to the government case.and while felton involvement in the bomb preparations was obvious,his motive was crucial in establishing that,as required by the statute prohibiting attempted receipt of explosives,d,his purpose was to kill or injure persons or destroy property.
that defendants beliefs and associations tended to show such motives is obvious,and the government had no similarly potent,but less prejudicial,means of closing the evidentiary gap.the material was certainly inflammatory and its potential for prejudice remained,even though dampened in some measure by the district court efforts to minimize the risk,primarily by repeated cautionary directions to the jury.but probative value was not clearly outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,and the admission of the evidence was not error at all,let alone so clearly so as to be an abuse of discretion.
the passage deserves separate comment.the prosecutor not only introduced a pamphlet containing the language quoted above,but also had a witness read it to the jury until a defense objection was made.it is hard to justify this tactic of isolating and repeating this lurid remote from anything at issue in this the defense objection was immediately sustained.given the weight of the evidence,it is virtually certain that reading this single passage did not cause the guilty verdicts.
felton and chase claim that evidence introduced against them of letters and other statements of struss,dellinger,and reid was inadmissible hearsay.under the governing rule,the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such out of court statements were from a member of a conspiracy with necessarily the one were made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.d e see bourjaily united states,d.proof must go beyond the content of the statements themselves.united states portela,cir,cert.denied,d.
our review of these essentially factual determinations by the district court is for clear error,portela,at,and we find none.the contents of the letters,coupled with independent evidence such as struss testimony,strongly suggest that all three men played an active role in an unlawful conspiracy with defendants,whether or not the conspiracy extended as far as the one for which defendants were convicted.struss played a central role in such a conspiracy from his release until his arrest.dellinger and reid support was limited by their imprisonment,but both provided advice and recruitment for the conspiracy from within prison.
felton further claim that the introduction of statements violates the sixth amendment is without merit.under the supreme court decision in ohio roberts,d,the statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,so their admission does not violate felton sixth amendment rights.see id.at.see also united states inadi,d sixth amendment does not require proof of unavailability of declarant for admission of statements 
separately,felton claims that the government improperly used the word terrorist throughout trial to describe the defendants and their actions.it is hard to lay down a general rule as to epithet and rhetoric because the considerations are matters of degree these include accuracy in description,threat of unfair prejudice,frequency of use,and alternative means of description.such judgments turn on particular facts,and much latitude has to be given to the trial judge on the spot to strike the proper balance.see united states tierney,cir,cert.denied,d.
here,terrorist is obviously a provocative term,freighted with images of terrible events.the defendants were not charged with offenses so labeled,see et,but the of the contents of such sections and instructed on the elements of the crimes here not have thought otherwise.the jurors surely understood the references in their lay sense as summarizing the central conduct with which the defendants were charged a conspiracy to build a bomb to attack civilian targets to advance an ideological cause.
to describe such plans and the individuals who pursued them as terrorist was certainly an accurate lay use of the term terrorist,and it is not easy to think of some softer description to summarize the gist of what the government evidence suggested.that the term is highly pejorative is this is a function of the acts that the defendants engaged in,not the government inaccurate description of those acts.united states jordan,cir.
technical accuracy is perhaps not conclusive.one can imagine situations in which an epithet carries connotations well beyond the crime charged,murderer in a case of negligent homicide,or cases in which the description is gratuitously inflammatory,serving no reasonable purpose in summarizing the government position.but neither fault is present here,and,realistically,the terrorism label can have added little prejudice compared to the evidence of the bomb building itself.once again,absent egregious circumstances these are matters for the trial judge judgment.
finally,as to one of his convictions for violation of the felon in possession statute,g,felton claims that the prohibition against possessing firearms in or affecting commerce should be construed to apply to only those firearms whose possession has an actual impact on commerce.felton interpretation is defeated by case law stating that a firearm travel in interstate commerce is sufficient to satisfy the statute.see,united states adams,cir united states colon osorio,cir united states weems,cir,cert.denied,d.
this brings us to the government appeal of the district court judgment of acquittal.the charge in question against both defendants was that they had possessed chase iberia pistol in furtherance of their conspiracy to make and possess a destructive device.we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo,in the light most favorable to the jury finding of guilt.the district court acquittal can be upheld only if no reasonable jury could find the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.
the provision in c a of the criminal nominally concerned with penalties for federal crimes defined elsewhere,and it provides in pertinent part that a minimum term here,not less than years applies if the firearm was possessed in furtherance of any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.in this case,the government position,submitted to the jury,was that chase and felton possessed chase iberia pistol in furtherance of the conspiracy 
to support a conviction under section c a,the government need not prove that the defendants actively employed the firearm in furtherance of the charged crime of violence,but it must prove that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the commission of the underlying offense,united states grace,cir mere presence of a firearm,it is said,is not enough,id.one question is what the statute and these quoted glosses mean the other is whether the evidence was sufficient to convict each defendant.
one might expect with such a common criminal offense that the legal framework would be well settled,but,as is so often the case with general statutory terms,it is not.one could argue,in particular,about whether the in furtherance requirement refers to subjective purpose or objective potential or whether either would do.statutory language,legislative history,model jury instructions and case law do not cleanly resolve the issue nor did the instruction given in this case do so explicitly 
to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime means that the firearm helped to facilitate,forward,advance or promote the commission of the specific crime charged in count.in this case,it is not sufficient for the government to prove simply that a defendant possessed a firearm during the same time that conspiracy to possess a d
