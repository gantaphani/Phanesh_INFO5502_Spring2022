this appeal presents two unrelated issues,which we decide together only because they arise within the confines of a single criminal case.the first issue hinges on whether the supreme court decision in hudson michigan,establishes categorically that exclusion of seized evidence is not available as a remedy for violations of the rule.the second issue involves sentencing its resolution depends on whether the aggravating role adjustment contained in section b of the federal sentencing guidelines authorizes a upward enhancement when the defendant,although a manager or supervisor in a criminal activity comprising five or more participants,oversees fewer than five persons.after answering both of these inquiries in the affirmative,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
in february of,a confidential informant furnished information to law enforcement officers in manchester,new hampshire,that led to the unmasking of a massive operation.the enterprise had long tentacles,reaching out to a myriad of suppliers,couriers,wholesalers,and dealers.
an intensive investigation ensued.in due course,task force agents apprehended renaury ramirez garcia ramirez while he was endeavoring to purchase ten kilograms of cocaine from an undercover officer.ramirez admitted that he and juan garcia hernandez were partners in what amounted to a franchise of the larger ring.according to ramirez,the defendant principal responsibilities were the procurement of cocaine from sources higher up the chain of command and the transportation of the acquired contraband to new hampshire from that point forward,ramirez oversaw the distribution of the drugs in the northeast.
after ramirez told the agents that the local franchise was expecting a cocaine delivery in,they enlisted ramirez paramour,nicole kalantzis,to assist in the probe.in the course of meetings and telephone calls with kalantzis,the defendant indicated that he expected the delivery of cocaine to occur on april.he also stated that kalantzis could get a portion of the shipment to sell to ramirez customers.to that end,the defendant and his girlfriend gave kalantzis specific instructions on how to manage distribution of the drugs in ramirez absence.
armed with this intelligence,the agents obtained a warrant to search the defendant residence.they planned to execute the warrant on april.on that morning easter sunday the officers sent kalantzis into the house to confirm that the shipment had arrived.when kalantzis left the house with a suitcase containing kilograms of cocaine,the agents executed the search warrant.
the manner in which the authorities executed the warrant is,for present purposes,of particular pertinence.one officer drove an armored vehicle onto the lawn and parked in front of a picture window.another breached the front door with a battering ram.others detonated devices,causing windows in the residence to shatter.the main body of searchers,several carrying assault rifles,stormed into the residence.
all in all,officers and a dog participated in the mission.inside the home,they found eight adults including the defendant and three children.the search yielded drug paraphernalia,multiple cell phones,small quantities of cocaine and marijuana,and approximately in cash.
the defendant cadillac was parked outside the residence.the police obtained an additional search warrant for it.that ancillary search recovered kilograms of cocaine stowed in garbage bags in the vehicle trunk.
the defendant was arrested and eventually charged with distribution of,and conspiracy to distribute,in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.see a.he moved to suppress the seized evidence on the ground that the search party had violated the rule by failing to alert the occupants prior to forcing entry into the dwelling.he posited that the manner in which the officers executed the search warrant in his words,a military assault was so egregious as to demand exclusion of the fruits of the search.
the district court mcauliffe,denied the motion to suppress on alternative grounds first,it concluded that the officers failure to knock and announce their presence was not fatal because the execution of the warrant fell within an exception permitting a entry where notice of the imminent ingress presents a great risk of danger or a likelihood that evidence would be destroyed.the court also concluded,citing hudson,that suppression was not an available remedy for a violation of the rule.
the defendant proceeded to enter a conditional guilty plea,see.a,reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.the district court accepted this plea and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report.
at the disposition hearing,the district court barbadoro,set the defendant base offense level at,adjusted downward by three levels for acceptance of responsibility,see ussg a b,and adjusted upward by three levels for the defendant role in the offense,see id.b.this last adjustment was premised upon a determination that the defendant had acted as a manager or supervisor in an extensive criminal activity.
these and other findings yielded an advisory guideline sentencing range of to months.the court imposed a month incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the defendant challenges both the denial of his motion to suppress and the court deployment of the upward adjustment.we address these challenges separately.
suppression.
in reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we assess factual findings for clear error and evaluate legal rulings de novo.united states fagan,cir.this is a deferential standard of review when the district court chooses to draw a reasonable though not inevitable inference from a particular combination of facts,that inference is entitled to respect.united states hughes,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the argument for suppression is anchored in a perceived violation of the rule.that rule,developed at common law,is now codified in a federal statute.see see also wilson arkansas,discussing the rule evolution.it requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence and authority prior to effecting a entry into a dwelling.united states pelletier,cir.
the rule,however,is not absolute.it is well established that,in certain circumstances,officers executing a search warrant may be justified in declining to knock and announce their presence.for instance,a failure will not violate the rule when officers have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence,under the particular circumstances,would be dangerous or futile,or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by,for example,allowing the destruction of evidence.richards wisconsin.
the parties joust over whether the entry into the defendant abode violated the rule.the defendant argues that officers had no reason to believe that he presented any danger,as was made manifest by the dispatch of the unarmed informant into the house.the government counters that a entry was justified by the exigencies of the situation.we need not sort out the parties conflicting positions about whether the entry into the defendant home transgressed the rule.assuming arguendo that it did,suppression is not an available remedy.
the key precedent is hudson.there,the supreme court squarely addressed whether a violation of the rule might justify the exclusion of evidence seized.noting that exclusion of evidence has always been a last resort,not a first impulse,at,the court held the exclusionary rule inapplicable to violations,id.at.
in taking this position,the court noted two independent requirements for applying the exclusionary rule and explained why a violation could never meet those requirements.
to begin,the court deemed causation a necessary condition for suppression.id.at.in other words,there must be a causal link between the constitutional violation alleged and the discovery of the evidence seized.in the court view,a violation of the rule could never achieve this benchmark whether the officers knocked or not,the evidence would inevitably be discovered during the subsequent valid search.id.
