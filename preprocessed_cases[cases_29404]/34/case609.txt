acting on amando monteiro pretrial motion,the district court suppressed from evidence two guns the police obtained during a vehicle stop.the government sought our review pursuant to,which authorizes interlocutory appeals in situations such as this.we affirm.
in an appeal from a suppression order,the district court findings of fact govern absent a showing of clear error.ornelas united states,d.neither party suggests that the district court made such an error,so we recite the facts as the district court found them.we also add a few undisputed details from the record.
shortly after on march,boston police responded to reports of gunfire on eastman street,in the dorchester section of the city.the target of the shooting,who escaped unharmed,was antonio cabral.the police knew that cabral was associated with a gang and that his gang and its rival had been involved in a series of shootings.at the scene on eastman street,patrol officers james coyne and thomas griffiths spoke with cabral for about an hour.cabral reported that two men had shot at him through a fence,while he was standing in his driveway.cabral said he had no knowledge of the identity of the shooters,but another person who had been nearby told the police that a red mazda had raced away from eastman street shortly after the shooting.
at around that evening,coyne and griffiths returned to eastman street and interviewed cabral again.this time,cabral mother and brother were present.cabral again said he had no information for the police.the cabrals complained that the police were doing enough in the community to stop the violence.coyne responded that the police could do more if neighborhood residents would give us information for us to solve these shootings.cabral then said that he had no information to offer about his own shooting but that he had information about another shooting that same day.cabral said that a relative told him that she had witnessed gunfire on shirley street from two cars,a red mazda and a red honda with license plate.coyne asked cabral who the relative was.coyne understood cabral to indicate that the relative was female,but cabral refused to give her name or any other information about her.the police made no further attempts to identify or locate the unnamed relative.
that same evening,coyne and griffiths drove to shirley street and looked for some evidence of gunfire,such as spent shell casings or bullet damage.they found none.the officers also searched the police department records to see if anybody had reported gunfire on shirley street.no one had.coyne later testified at the suppression hearing that it was typical for shootings in the neighborhood to be reported to,and for obvious evidence of gunfire to be found at the scene 
coyne ran the license plate number through the vehicle registration database and matched the plates to a red honda belonging to marcelino rodrigues.coyne was familiar with rodrigues and suspected that he was affiliated with a gang that was a rival to cabral.coyne also knew that rodrigues had been arrested three weeks earlier in randolph,massachusetts,on a firearms possession charge coyne and griffiths went to the address rodrigues had listed on his vehicle registration,but rodrigues was not there.that night,the officers looked for rodrigues around the neighborhood but did not find him.coyne and griffiths radioed other officers in the area to be on the lookout for rodrigues and the red honda,but no one saw rodrigues or his car.
a full week passed during which the police apparently conducted no further investigation of the possible shooting on shirley street.then,on march,coyne,griffiths,and a third officer were conducting a traffic stop when they saw rodrigues and two passengers drive by.the officers rushed to their cars,pursued rodrigues,and pulled him over for field interrogation and observation.there was no traffic violation or suspicious activity.the defendant was one of rodrigues passengers.
although this appeal is limited to the legality of the initial vehicle stop,we relate briefly what happened thereafter.the officers ordered rodrigues and his passengers to step out of the car.the third officer,who was not available to testify at the suppression hearing,told coyne that he had seen a gun in the center console of the car the police then handcuffed rodrigues and his passengers and,upon obtaining a search warrant,searched the car and recovered two guns.these guns comprise the evidence at issue in this appeal.at the scene,the police questioned rodrigues about the purported shirley street shooting and about the attempted shooting of cabral on eastman street.rodrigues denied involvement in either event 
subsequently,the state and federal governments indicted the defendant on a variety of charges.in both prosecutions,the defendant sought to suppress evidence gathered in connection with the march stop of rodrigues car the district court held a evidentiary hearing and issued a thoughtful order.the court concluded while this is a borderline case,once the tip of a shooting on shirley street proved to be unreliable,the hunch that rodrigues was involved in criminal activity was not enough to establish a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient to stop the red honda.
the sole question in this interlocutory appeal is whether the police acted reasonably in stopping rodrigues and his passengers on march.because only the district court ultimate fourth amendment conclusion is at issue,our review is de novo.united states paradis,cir.
when a police officer makes brief investigatory stops of persons and vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest the fourth amendment is satisfied if the officer action is supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot,united states arvizu,d internal quotation marks omitted,or if there is reasonable suspicion,grounded in specific and articulable facts,that the stopped person was involved in or is wanted in connection with a completed felony,united states hensley,d.in evaluating whether reasonable suspicion existed,we look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer ha d a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.arvizu,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the government bears the burden of showing such a basis.see florida royer,d plurality opinion brown texas,d.we allow police officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training in making a vehicle stop.arvizu,at.but the reasonable suspicion standard imposes meaningful limits on temporary detentions.a n officer reliance on a mere hunch is insufficient to justify a stop.id.at.quoting terry ohio,d.
while the defendant was neither the driver of the vehicle stopped on march nor then the subject of police suspicion,he was seized when the police stopped rodrigues car.consequently,he has the right to contest the legality of that stop.see united states woodrum,cir.
the government contends that the totality of the circumstances known to the police provided adequate justification for the march vehicle stop.in its briefs,the government suggests that the police may have suspected rodrigues of three types of wrongdoing the purported shooting on shirley street the attempted shooting of cabral on eastman street and ongoing involvement in what the government terms gang warfare.however,the government conceded at oral argument that there is no information in the record tying rodrigues or his car to involvement in the eastman street shooting.coyne had said essentially the same while testifying at the suppression hearing.furthermore,while the police suspected rodrigues of being a gang member,the government does not contend that there was any reason to suspect that rodrigues and his passengers were involved in criminal activity when the stop took place on march,or that they were about to be so involved.
the government does argue that the police had a reasonable suspicion,grounded in specific and articulable facts,that rodrigues had committed a crime on shirley street on march.coyne testified that investigation of this purported crime was his actual motivation in stopping the honda on march.
the tip from cabral unidentified relative is the focus of the government argument.therefore,in section a,we evaluate the appropriate place in the reasonable suspicion analysis i of that tip and ii of the factors that the government argues corroborated it.we conclude that the minimally corroborated tip did not alone provide reasonable suspicion for a vehicle stop on march.in section b,we consider the tip and its minimal corroboration with the other information known to the police on march.we conclude that the totality of the circumstances,including the tip,did not provide reasonable suspicion to stop the car on march.
a.the tip from cabral relative 
the only indication that a shooting actually had occurred on shirley street was the hearsay statement of cabral unnamed relative,as relayed to the police by cabral.three supreme court cases provide the basic parameters for determining whether an informant tip provides reasonable suspicion for a terry stop.the first of these cases is adams williams,d.in adams,the supreme court concluded that a police officer was warranted in conducting a terry stop on the basis of an tip from a person known to him that a man seated in a nearby vehicle in a area was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist.id.at.the court so held in large part because the informant was known personally to the police officer,and had provided him with information in the past,and because the informant would be subject to prosecution for supplying false information to the police.id.at.as a leading academic commentator on the fourth amendment has written,adams makes clear that suspicious circumstances reported to the police by a reliable known person in a nonconclusory fashion may in certain circumstances be sufficient to warrant a terry stop.lafave,search and seizure ed.
anonymous tips are a different matter.the second relevant supreme court case,alabama white,d,involved an anonymous telephone call to the police,which stated that vanessa white would be leaving lynwood terrace apartments at a particular time in a brown plymouth station wagon with the right taillight lens broken,that she would be going to dobey motel,and that she would be in possession of about an ounce of cocaine.at.the supreme court majority termed the resulting question of reasonable suspicion a close case.id.at.the court concluded that a reasonable suspicion existed largely because the tip assertion of white destination had been significantly corroborated,id.at,and because the tip demonstrated the caller ability to predict white future behavior and a special familiarity with her affairs,id.at.given all the circumstances,the court reasoned,the anonymous tip in white bore sufficient indicia of reliability to justify a terry stop.
the third and most recent supreme court case dealing with tips in the context of terry stops is florida,d.in,an anonymous caller reported to the police that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.id.at.the police arrived and found a young man matching that description.the supreme court concluded that the mere fact that the tip identified a specific person and alleged possession of a gun did not provide indicia of reliability of the kind contemplated in adams and white.id.at.an anonymous tip not properly corroborated,the court concluded,does not justify a terry stop.id.
the defendant argues that the tip here was anonymous and uncorroborated like the tip in.the government avers that the tip was neither truly anonymous and so somewhat comparable to the tip in adams and that the tip was corroborated like the tip in white.our analysis takes two parts.we explain i that the tip in this case,whether or not it can rightly bear the technical moniker anonymous,was akin to the anonymous tips analyzed by the supreme court in and white in that it could not provide reasonable suspicion unless corroborated and ii that because,as in and unlike in white,it was not sufficiently corroborated,the tip could not,by itself,provide reasonable suspicion for the vehicle stop.
i.the tip itself 
the government contends that the hearsay tip in this case was more reliable than the anonymous tip analyzed in because of the police officers interactions with cabral,and because cabral was able to report a crime supposedly witnessed by his unnamed relative.
certain of the government arguments have superficial appeal.more so than in,the police here had some limited means of narrowing the class of people who might have provided the tip.see at.noting danger when informant can not be held responsible for false information.and cabral description of his relative report provided some small measure of context for the information that may not have been present if,as in,the police had received a bare tip,out of the blue,alleging the same facts 
contrary to the government suggestion,however,the tip in this case bears some important badges of unreliability not present in the cases relied upon by the government.first,there is the hearsay problem.while the police or a operator often can make some rough judgments about the age,cognitive ability,and motivations of an anonymous informant based on her tone of voice if the tip occurs via the telephone,or appearance and demeanor if the tip is delivered in person even by a complete stranger,the police here had no way of knowing the state of mind of cabral relative when she gave her information,or whether she was a person who could be relied on to relate events accurately.in cases where uncorroborated hearsay tips have been deemed reliable in contributing to reasonable suspicion,there has been a stronger indication that the informant can be trusted.in tucker,at,and in,at,for instance,the police knew that the unnamed hearsay informant was a government employee.
second,there was a higher risk of fabrication here.the court deemed anonymous tips inherently unreliable largely because such tips carry with them a risk of fabrication by the informant.see,at.the hearsay tip in this case provided two distinct opportunities for fabrication.the tip was suspect because cabral may have had a motive to get a rival gang member into trouble with the law and could have fabricated both the shirley street shooting and the supposed communication from his relative,and because even if cabral was honest in his interactions with the police,his unnamed relative may have had her own motive for fabricating incriminating evidence about a rival gang member whom she may have suspected of harboring ill will towards a member of her family there is no indication in any of the cases cited by the government that either a hearsay informant or a party relaying a hearsay tip to the police had so obvious a motive to lie as existed in this case.
finally,crucially,and unlike in,the police had specific reasons to doubt the tip by the time they made their stop.in,there were no factors that cast doubt on the reliability of the tip.at.in this case,there was no physical evidence of gunfire on shirley street as there usually was after shootings in the neighborhood.no one had called the police to complain usually neighborhood residents called upon hearing gunfire.while officers in the city were alerted to be on the lookout,none saw rodrigues or his car in the hours after the purported shooting or remembered seeing the car in the area of the purported shooting earlier that day.the government does not suggest,moreover,that in the week after the hearsay tip,the tipster or cabral came forward with additional information that any other witnesses to a shirley street shooting were found or that physical evidence of a shooting or unexplained gunshot wounds in local hospitals emerged.when an initial police investigation into a tip of illegal activity reveals factors inconsistent with the tip,the reasonable suspicion analysis must take these indicia of unreliability into account along with any indicia of reliability.see adams,at.see also terry,at.brent ashley,cir.here,the investigation the police had conducted actually undermined the tip reliability.
ii.corroboration 
the fact that the license plate number mentio
