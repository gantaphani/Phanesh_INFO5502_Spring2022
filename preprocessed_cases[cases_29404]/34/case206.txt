after extensive motion practice,the district court ended this medical malpractice case by granting summary judgment for the defendants.the ensuing appeal requires us to unravel a jurisdictional tangle,clarify the status of maine law concerning causation,and answer a series of questions regarding the admissibility of scientific evidence.having run this gauntlet,we affirm the judgment.
background 
anton samaan is an egyptian native who resides in brooklyn,new york.he enjoys dual citizenship in egypt and the united states.
on january,the plaintiff flew from cairo to milan,where he boarded a connecting flight bound for new york.toward the end of his journey,he repaired to the galley in search of a cup of tea.a flight attendant thought that he looked sick,sat him down,and recruited professionals from among the passengers.
a medical resident examined the plaintiff and concluded that he was probably experiencing an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack brought on by the stoppage of blood flow to part of his brain.the pilot detoured to the nearest airport bangor,maine.an ambulance took the plaintiff to joseph hospital the hospital.in all,less than two hours elapsed between the time of the flight attendant intervention and the plaintiff arrival at the hospital.
the record is sparse in regard to how the plaintiff was treated at the hospital emergency room.one thing is clear no intravenous shot of tissue plasminogen activator was administered.the drug is a form of thrombolytic therapy that works by dissolving clots that are occluding arteries.its efficacy in any given patient is uncertain but its goal is to reduce neurologic injury caused by a stroke.
not every stroke patient is a candidate for.first,is not a panacea.second,it has to be used within a relatively short period of time after the onset of symptoms a window was generally regarded as appropriate at the time of the plaintiff stroke.third,has the potential to cause intracranial hemorrhaging,serious systemic bleeding,a new stroke,and sometimes death.last but far from least accepted protocol dictates that it should be withheld in many circumstances,including but not limited to cases where the stroke is severe,the time of onset is unknown,the patient experienced a seizure at the onset,or the patient had another stroke or underwent major surgery in the preceding three months.if used when contraindicated,is not only likely to be ineffective but also may increase the chances of adverse effects 
during his time at the hospital,the plaintiff condition deteriorated and then stabilized.when he did not improve,an ambulance transported him to an institution in new york.he went from there to a series of other rehabilitation facilities and eventually returned home albeit still partially paralyzed and unable to work.
on december,the plaintiff sued the hospital and his attending physician there,david kaplan,in a maine state court.his complaint alleged professional negligence medical malpractice and negligent infliction of emotional distress,both relating to a failure to administer.fifteen days later kaplan,citing the existence of diversity jurisdiction,removed the case to the united states district court for the district of maine.see u.a,a.the hospital neither signed the removal papers nor otherwise manifested its written consent to the change in forum.kaplan answered the complaint in the federal court on january,and the hospital followed suit within the next couple of days.
the plaintiff moved to remand the action to the state court on the sole ground that the hospital had failed to join the notice of removal.finding that the hospital had impliedly consented to removal,the district court denied the motion.samaan joseph hosp.samaan i,d.
near the conclusion of discovery,kaplan filed both a motion to exclude the testimony of ravi tikoo and a motion for summary judgment.the plaintiff had designated tikoo as his expert witness on causation to establish that the negligence in failing to administer proximately caused the plaintiff injuries.
the district court initially denied the defendants motions.samaan joseph hosp.samaan iii,no.cv,wl,denying summary judgment samaan joseph hosp.samaan ii,d denying motion to exclude.kaplan moved for reconsideration or,in the alternative,a daubert hearing.see daubert merrell dow.the court scheduled the requested hearing for december.
at the daubert hearing,both tikoo and the defendants expert,paul nyquist,testified.though the cornerstone of each doctor opinion was the definitive study of the efficacy of a study conducted by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke ninds a vast gulf separated their views.for now,it suffices to say that the two men,though using the same data,strongly disagreed about whether the failure to administer proximately caused the plaintiff injuries.
in addition to presenting different interpretations of the data through their experts,the parties argued for different interpretations of maine law.the defendants posited that maine requires a medical malpractice plaintiff to prove that the allegedly negligent act was more likely than not a substantial cause of the injury the plaintiff demurred,arguing that maine would recognize the lost chance doctrine,which permits recovery when a patient chances are diminished to some degree by a doctor acts or omissions.
the district court concluded that the applicable standard for causation was more likely than not and that maine had not adopted the lost chance doctrine.samaan joseph hosp.samaan iv,d.the court then proceeded to analyze tikoo testimony and determined that his statistical calculations were not responsive to the question of whether the failure to administer more likely than not caused the plaintiff injuries.id.at.the court therefore excluded tikoo testimony.
this ruling prompted the defendants to move for reconsideration of the court earlier denial of summary judgment,see samaan iii,wl,at,contending that the plaintiff case evaporated with the exclusion of the testimony of its only causation expert.the plaintiff opposed this motion on various grounds,arguing among other things that two other expert witnesses could provide competent evidence that the failure to treat the plaintiff with proximately caused his injuries.finally,he posited that his claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress survived the exclusion of tikoo testimony.
after pausing to exclude a to whom it may concern letter to which we shall return shortly,samaan joseph hosp.samaan v,d,the district court denied the defendants renewed motion for summary judgment,samaan joseph hosp.samaan vi,d.the court predicated this ruling on a tentative finding that the descriptions of the new experts expected testimony appeared sufficient to defeat summary judgment on the question of causation.id.at.but the court warned that there might be other reasons to exclude the testimony.id.at.on a related topic,the court rescript made clear that,with respect to proof of causation,it viewed medical malpractice and negligent infliction of emotional distress as peas in a pod.id.at.
the defendants responded by moving to exclude the testimony of the newly identified causation experts and for reconsideration of summary judgment in light of that anticipated exclusion.they offered both procedural and substantive reasons for excluding the testimony.the plaintiff opposed these motions but the district court granted them.
the court principal basis for excluding the newly identified testimony was its determination that neither of the two physicians who were the source of that testimony had been designated as an expert witness with respect to causation.samaan joseph hosp.samaan vii.the entry of summary judgment followed from that exclusion without any expert opinion evidence of causation,the plaintiff claims necessarily failed.id.at.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the plaintiff raises a gallimaufry of issues.his most loudly bruited claims of error relate to the denial of his motion to remand the case to state court,the formulation of the standard for causation under maine law,the exclusion of expert witness testimony,and the entry of summary judgment his claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.we address this asseverational array piece by piece.
a.the motion to remand.
a motion to remand usually presents a question of federal subject matter jurisdiction.see biw deceived local,indus.union of marine shipbuilding workers of,cir.when,as in this case,the pertinent facts are not in dispute,the district court denial of such a motion engenders de novo review.see id.
in a diversity case,the rule of unanimity requires that,within a specified time frame,all defendants must consent in writing to the removal.see charles wright,arthur miller,edward cooper joan steinman,federal practice and procedure,at ed collecting cases.the plaintiff says that the removal here offended this rule because the hospital neither signed the removal papers nor otherwise consented in writing to removal.
congress has prescribed the framework for removal.the statutory scheme provides that a defendant may remove a civil action from a state court to a federal court sitting in that state only if the federal court has original jurisdiction over the action.a.this case meets that rudimentary benchmark the parties are of diverse citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds,thus satisfying the criteria set out in a.
removal,however,must sometimes satisfy other requirements as well.in a diversity case,unanimity is one such requirement.but before turning to that requirement,we must iron out a wrinkle that neither the parties nor the district court spotted.
the defendants,though diverse from the plaintiff,are citizens of maine the forum state.the removal of a diversity case by an defendant transgresses b,which provides that unless the action is one arising under federal law,removal is permissible only if none of the defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.in light of this prohibition,it is readily apparent that the instant action which is not one arising under federal law was improperly removed.
withal,the statutory scheme creates a safety valve a motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within days after the filing of the notice of removal or else it is waived.c.after this day period,only if the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction must the case be remanded to state court.id.
the pivotal question,then,is whether removal in contravention of the prohibition against removal by an defendant is jurisdictional in nature or merely a procedural defect that may be waived.see grubbs credit,if after removal a case is tried on the merits without objection and the federal court enters judgment,the issue in subsequent proceedings on appeal is not whether the case was properly removed,but whether the federal district court would have had original jurisdiction of the case had it been filed in that court.we hold that removal in contravention of the prohibition against removal by an defendant creates a procedural defect that is subject to waiver under c.
this holding echoes the holding in farm construction services,fudge,cir per curiam.there,the defendants had improperly removed the case to their federal court.id.at.we concluded that the plaintiff continued prosecution of the case in federal court for approximately one year,and its failure to object to removal until after judgment had been rendered,constitue d implicit consent to federal court jurisdiction and waiver of its right to object to removal.id.because all the requirements for diversity jurisdiction were satisfied,the improper removal had no effect on the federal court capacity to hear the case.accord in re exxon chem.fire,cir lively wild oats,cir hurley motor coach,cir handelsman bedford vill.assocs,cir moores greenberg,cir.but see horton conklin,f d,cir.
we need not tarry over the question of whether a waiver transpired here.the plaintiff did not raise the defendants maine citizenship in support of his motion to remand.he has litigated the case for years first in the district court and presently in this court without advancing any argument based on the defendants citizenship.consequently,any objection to removal based on that citizenship has been waived.see,moores,at fudge,at.the fact that the plaintiff objected to removal on a different basis does not avert this waiver.see hartford accident indem.costa lines cargo,cir finding objection to removal on different ground insufficient to preserve objection to violation of defendant rule.
we now move from the objection that the plaintiff did not make to the one that he did make his plaint that the defendants failed to comply with the rule of unanimity.on this point,the case before us is controlled by our decision in esposito home depot,cir.
in esposito,we explained that the driving forces behind the rule of unanimity are the desire to prevent duplicative litigation and the desire to protect one defendant from seizing a tactical advantage at the expense of a fellow defendant.id.at.with these concerns in mind,we eschewed a wooden rule for demonstrating unanimity,holding that,at a minimum,an apparent lack of unanimity could be remedied by a defendant timely opposition to a motion to remand.id.at.such a course of conduct adequately evinces the defendant willingness to remain in the federal forum and,thus,satisfies the concerns that inform the rule of unanimity.
to be sure,the better practice is for all defendants to sign the notice of removal.under our precedent,however,effective consent to the removal can be manifested in other ways.here,the hospital did not sign the notice,but it filed an answer in the federal court and vigorously opposed the plaintiff motion to remand.in the words of the esposito court,it thereby clearly communicat ed its desire to be in federal court.id.no more was exigible to cure the technical defect in the notice of removal.see id.accordingly,the court below did not err in denying the plaintiff motion to remand.
b.the causation standard.
maine state law prescribes the substantive rules of decision in this diversity case.see erie tompkins.in maine,causation is an element of a cause of action see baker farrand,me dickey vermette,me.maine highest court has held that an examination of causation requires a inquiry,which asks whether the negligent act played a substantial part in causing the injury and,if so,whether the injury was a reasonably foreseeable result of the act.crowe shaw,me.this case centers on what the plaintiff must prove to meet the substantial part requirement of causation under maine law.
the district court determined that maine requires a medical malpractice plaintiff to prove a probability of harm that is,that the alleged negligence more likely than not brought about the plaintiff injuries.samaan iv,d at.because this determination rests on the court assessment of the law and not on its assessment of the facts,our review is plenary.see salve regina coll.russell,united states gifford,cir.
the crux of the plaintiff argument is that the maine supreme judicial court the law court has left the door open for maine to embrace the lost chance doctrine.he asserts that this doctrine should be applied here and that his proof is adequate to establish a trialworthy issue thereunder.the district court disagreed with the proposition that maine law encompasses the lost chance doctrine,and so do we.
as the law court recognized in phillips eastern maine medical center,me,the more likely than not standard and the lost chance doctrine are the two prevailing approaches to causation in medical malpractice cases.the more likely than not standard requires a showing of probability in jurisdictions following this approach,by show ing a better than even chance of avoiding harm in the absence of medical negligence,a plaintiff proves that the negligence played a substantial part in causing the injury.id.at.by contrast,in jurisdictions following the lost chance doctrine,the plaintiff need only show that he was deprived of a significant chance of avoiding harm to meet the substantial part requirement.id.a showing of probability is not required.
the plaintiff argument that maine has left the door open for the lost chance doctrine starts with this discussion in phillips.however,the phillips court mentioned the lost chance doctrine in that context only to present an overview of the approach.the court stopped at this point it neither approved nor rejected the doctrine.
that is the mark of the plaintiff argument,and his singular reliance on phillips ignores the remaining corpus of maine malpractice law.going beyond phillips,we find valuable guidance in the maine health security act mhsa,which governs professional negligence actions against providers.see.ann.tit.the case at hand rests on claims of professional negligence and,thus,falls within the compass of the mhsa.see id.see also saunders tisher,me explaining that negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims against doctors,arising out of medical treatment,are covered.
in the mhsa,the maine legislature required a medical malpractice plaintiff to show a reasonable medical or professional probability that the acts or omissions complained of constitute a deviation from the applicable standard of care.ann.tit,a.the plaintiff also must show a reasonable medical or professional probability that the acts or omissions complained of proximately caused the injury complained of.id.b emphasis supplied.this formulation of the causation standard is clear and unambiguous.it admits of only one interpretation the phrase reasonable medical probability demands that the injury be a probable or likely result of the negligent act or omission.see,harvey price,me see generally black law dictionary ed defining reasonable medical probability as a standard requiring a showing that the injury was more likely than not caused by a particular stimulus,based on the general consensus of recognized medical thought.it is,therefore,beyond serious question that the standard of causation articulated in the mhsa is incompatible with the lost chance doctrine.
this understanding of the maine standard of causation is buttressed by the maine case law which,though scanty,indicates that the more likely than not standard controls.for example,in merriam wanger,me,the law court stated that in medical malpractice cases,t he mere possibility of causation is not enough,and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture,or even if the probabilities are evenly balanced,a defendant is entitled to a judgment.id.at.although the court did not discuss the lost chance doctrine,it held that because the plaintiff had failed to present evidence that her injury would more likely than not have been avoided in the absence of negligence,judgment for the defendant necessarily followed.id.other cases are similar in tenor.see,cyr adamar assocs,me champagne mid me.med,me spickler york,me.
that ends this aspect of the matter.the standard for causation in medical malpractice actions in maine is more likely than not,and that standard is satisfied only when the plaintiff can show a reasonable probability that,absent the negligent act,the injury would have been avoided.the maine legislature has prescribed this standard,the maine cases are consistent with it,and there is simply no room for judicial interpolation of the lost chance doctrine into maine medical malpractice law.
as a fallback,the plaintiff invites us to certify to the law court the question of the applicability of the lost chance doctrine.we decline the invitation.w e have held with monotonous regularity that certification is inappropriate when the course that the state courts would take is reasonably clear.gonzález figueroa penney,cir collecting cases.so it is here 
c.the daubert hearing.
with the proper causation standard in place,we turn to the plaintiff failed attempt to make out a trialworthy issue on causation.courts in maine typically require expert testimony to establish that a physician acts or omissions in the course of diagnosis or treatment proximately caused a patient injuries.see,cox dela cruz,me.this requirement is ironclad where,as here,causation is not within the realm of common knowledge or experience.see cyr giesen,me.
recognizing the need to bridge this gap,the plaintiff offered tikoo testimony.the district court convened a daubert hearing to screen that proffer and ultimately rejected it based on a determination that the testimony failed to cross the daubert threshold.samaan iv,d at.we review this determination for abuse of discretion.ruiz troche pepsi cola of bottling,cir.
we begin with an overview of the principles that govern the admissibility of scientific evidence.we then explain why we uphold the district court determination that tikoo testimony falls short 
a qualified expert may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if a the expert knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue b the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data c the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and d the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
the daubert court explained that this rule requires district courts to act as gatekeepers,ensuring that an expert proffered testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.at.these two requirements a reliable foundation and an adequate fit are separate and distinct.
the reliable foundation requirement necessitates an inquiry into the methodology and the basis for an expert opinion.to perform the required analysis,the district court must consider a number of factors,including but not limited to the verifiability of the expert theory or technique,the error rate inherent therein,whether the theory or technique has been published subjected to peer review,and its level of acceptance within the scientific community.ruiz troche,at.given the nature of this analysis,the expert methodology is commonly the central focus of a daubert inquiry.id.
the second requirement has attracted less attention.this requirement seeks to ensure that there is an adequate fit between the expert methods and his conclusions.see daubert,at.this prong of the daubert inquiry addresses the problem that arises when an expert methods,though impeccable,yield results that bear a dubious relationship to the questions on which he proposes to opine.see id.at.
seen in this light,the scope of a daubert hearing is not limited to an appraisal of an expert credentials and techniques but also entails an examination of his conclusions to determine whether they flow rationally from the methodology employed.see joiner,heller shaw,cir.if perscrutation reveals that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered,the expert testimony should be excluded.joiner,at.
the plaintiff attacks both the mechanics and the outcome of the daubert hearing.his claims of procedural error are patently meritless and do not warrant extended discussion.instead,we adopt the reasoning of the lower court in regard to these points.see samaan vi,d at see also vargas ruiz golden arch,cir declining to expound on issues cogently dispatched by district court.
by the same token,we need not linger over the plaintiff suggestion that the district court impermissibly shifted the summary judgment burden by opting to hold an antecedent daubert hearing.it is settled in this circuit that a daubert hearing appropriately may be held at the summary judgment stage.see,cortés irizarry corporación insular de seguros,cir.
this leaves the plaintiff principal plaint that the district court abused its discretion in excluding tikoo testimony.in support,he argues that tikoo qualifications were impressive and that his statistical methods were comfortably within the realm of acceptable science.these arguments miss the mark.
the district court did not seriously question either tikoo credentials or the reliability of his methods the problem,as the court saw it,was that the results produced through that methodology left an analytical gap.in other words,those results did not sufficiently ground his conclusion that the plaintiff condition likely would have improved had been administered.see samaan iv,d at.this is a finding about the inadequacy of the fit and in reviewing it,we can for the most part leave to one side the expert qualifications,his numerical calculations,and the scientific community acceptance of the study on which he relied.
refined to bare essence,tikoo presented two analyses of statistical data drawn from the ninds study,articles,and the european cooperative acute stroke study ecass iii study.his first analysis examined odds ratios between a group of patients who had received and a placebo group.he concluded from these ratios that a person chances of improvement increase by with administration of the drug.tikoo second analysis used absolute efficacy rates,in some instances exceeding,which he asserted were sufficient to prove that the plaintiff injuries likely derived from the defendants failure to administer.using these analyses,tikoo concluded that had the plaintiff been given a timely injection of,he likely would not have suffered the injuries.
there is simply too great a divide between the numbers that tikoo employed and the conclusions that he tried to wring from them.we elaborate below.
tikoo first analysis depended upon odds ratios drawn from the literature.these odds ratios are,as the term implies,ratios of the odds of an adverse outcome,which reflect the relative likelihood of a particular result observing that some of the odds ratios exceeded,tikoo sought to testify that the chances of a patient in the treated group recovering increased by over.building on this foundation,tikoo opined that the plaintiff more likely than not would have recovered had he received the drug.
as the district court recognized,this reasoning is structurally unsound and leaves a wide analytical gap between the results produced through the use of odds ratios and the conclusions drawn by the witness.when a person chances of a better outcome are greater with treatment relative to the chances of those who were not treated,that is not the same as a person having a greater than chance of experiencing the better outcome with treatment.the latter meets the required standard for causation the former does not.
to illustrate,suppose that studies have shown that out of a group of people who do not eat bananas will die of cancer,as compared to out of a group of who do eat bananas.the group would have an odds ratio of or a greater chance of getting cancer than those who eschew bananas.but this is a far cry from showing that a person who eats bananas is more likely than not to get cancer.even if we were to look only at the fifteen persons in the group who did get cancer,it would not be likely that any particular person in that cohort got it from the consumption of bananas.correlation is not causation,and a substantial number of persons with cancer within the group would in all probability have contracted the disease whether or not they ate bananas 
we think that this example exposes the analytical gap between tikoo methods and his conclusions.although he could present figures ranging higher than,those figures were not responsive to the question of causation.let us take the stroke scale figure from the ninds study as an example.this scale measures the neurological deficits in different parts of the nervous system.twenty percent of patients who experienced a stroke and were not treated with had a favorable outcome according to this scale,whereas that figure escalated to when was administered.although this means that the patients treated with had over a better chance of recovery than they otherwise would have had,of those patients experienced the adverse outcome injury anyway 
the short of it is that while the odds ratio analysis shows that a patient may have a better chance of recovering than he otherwise would have had without,such an analysis does not show that a person has a better than even chance of avoiding injury if the drug is administered.the odds ratio,therefore,does not show that the failure to give was more likely than not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff injuries.the unavoidable conclusion from the studies deemed authoritative by tikoo is that only a small number of patients overall and only a small fraction of those who would otherwise have experienced injuries experience improvement when is administered.
nor can tikoo reliance on efficacy rates salvage his testimony.although certain of the efficacy rates in the ninds study the ecass iii study break a barrier,the question remains of what looking at those rates in a vacuum ignores the substantial number of stroke patients who would improve anyway that is,without receiving.
once again,an example is useful.tikoo,relying on numbers derived from the ecass iii study,stated that of patients receiving recovered as measured by a particular scale.based on this percentage,he suggested that had the plaintiff received,he more likely than not would have avoided injuries.but this suggestion completely overlooks the of people who recovered even without the benefit of.for a small number of patients who would not otherwise have recovered,would offer some advantage,but for the majority of patients whose conditions would not improve on their own,the administration of the drug would make no difference.
experts may present epidemiological statistics in different ways to indicate causation.either absolute or relative calculations may suffice in particular circumstances to achieve the causation standard.see,smith bubak,cir rejecting relative benefit testimony and suggesting in dictum that absolute benefit is the measure of a drug overall effectiveness young mem l hermann hosp,cir holding that texas law requires a doubling of the relative risk of an adverse outcome to prove causation,cert.denied.but the testimony here left too many unanswered questions,and it would serve no useful purpose for us to guess about what statistical measures tikoo might have used in an alternate universe.the methods that tikoo employed and the data that he presented were simply too distant from the conclusion that he drew,thus negating an adequate fit.
daubert demands relevancy,and tikoo testimony falls short of this requirement.as a result,it does not support a finding of causation under maine law.the testimony was,therefore,inadmissible under daubert and rule.
many aspects of science are a mystery to laymen without the aid of experts.in the world of the blind,the man is king and daubert relevancy is the sentry that guards against the tyranny of experts.as the gatekeeper,the trial judge has the duty to insulate the jury from expert testimony when reliance on authoritative studies and methods threatens to mask the lack of an adequate fit.an expert might be able to testify on the phases of the moon to prove that it was dark by a particular time,but he could not offer the same testimony to prove that a person was likely to act in an unusual manner on that night.daubert,at.
this is a hard case.when the harm alleged is a failure to treat and the causation standard is more likely than not,a plaintiff must vault over a higher bar in order to prove that the failure to treat a condition in a particular way rather than the underlying condition itself caused the adverse outcome.we understand that the plaintiff,given the benefit of hindsight,may wish that he was given any treatment offering even a tiny chance of preventing the adverse outcome that he experienced,regardless of the risk.but that is not the question that the district court was to answer.instead,the court was tasked with determining whether the evidence could support the expert conclusion that there was causation,and it fulfilled that responsibility.
d.the other evidence.
after the district court excluded tikoo testimony,the plaintiff claimed to have identified two alternate causation experts maryann walsh an employee of the hospital and elsayed hussein his treating physician in brooklyn.the court precluded this testimony primarily as a sanction for the plaintiff failure seasonably to designate either physician as a causation expert.samaan vii,at.the plaintiff assigns error to this ruling.he argues that he properly designated both doctors as causation experts that in all events,preclusion was too severe a sanction and that the testimony should have been allowed on independent grounds,regardless of any discovery violation.
we review the district court exclusionary order for abuse of discretion.santiago díaz laboratorio cliníco y de referencia del este sara lópez,cir.this standard of review obtains both as to the finding that a discovery violation occurred and as to the appropriateness of the sanction selected.id.
the civil rules require litigation adversaries to disclose to each other the identity of proposed expert witnesses and the subjects on which their testimony will be offered.a a c.time is of the essence,and the disclosures must be made well in advance of trial.see generally.a d.in this case,the district court entered a pretrial order requiring the reciprocal disclosure of experts by specified deadlines.in response,the plaintiff designated tikoo to testify that the defendants failure to administer to samaan,more likely than not,was a proximate or legal cause of his injuries.by contrast,he designated unnamed medical treatment providers a blanket term that he now asserts included walsh and hussein to testify regarding their treatment of the plaintiff,the cost of such treatment,the level of disability that they have assessed him with,and the reasonably foreseeable medical treatment he will require into the future.this designation further recited that those anonymous physicians would testify consistent with their medical reports.words such as causation and were conspicuously absent from this designation.
taking the plaintiff designations in context and crediting his assertion that walsh and hussein were within the penumbra of medical treatment providers,it is plain that these two physicians were intended to be fact witnesses who would testify only as to the nature of the plaintiff condition and the extent of his damages.the plaintiff knew how to designate a causation expert his designation of tikoo was direct and to the point and he did not make even a semblance of such a designation with respect to walsh and hussein.we agree with the district court that the plaintiff did not adequately identify either one as a causation expert.
in an attempt to salvage the disputed testimony,the plaintiff adverts to a sentence in the medical treatment providers designation,which states that the physicians would testify consistent with their medical reports.this reference can not carry the weight that the plaintiff loads upon it.the designation declares that medical treatment providers,presumably including walsh and hussein,will be called as witnesses on four subjects past treatment rendered by them,the cost of that treatment,the level of disability,and anticipated future treatment.it goes on to limit this designation by averring that the providers will testify on these subjects consistent with their medical reports.viewed in this light,the reference to medical reports can not plausibly be read to enlarge the scope of the designation.
in an effort to change the trajectory of the debate,the plaintiff cites hussein retrospective note in a july,to whom it may concern letter,which was intended to help the plaintiff obtain insurance benefits.the letter remarks that t he patient should have received a tpa shot which if given hours window before should have saved his left side from paralysis.he argues at great length about the admissibility of this statement and suggests that hussein should have been permitted to testify about it.this suggestion puts the cart before the horse.
the district court found that hussein had not been properly designated as a causation expert and,therefore,could not offer expert opinion evidence on causation.the admissibility vel non of the letter is not material to that determination.the relevant question is whether the record supports the district court finding that hussein was not properly designated to speak to causation.it does.that is the end of the matter.
the plaintiff has another string to his bow.the district court sanctioned the plaintiff for the discovery violation by excluding the witnesses opinion testimony on causation.see.c empowering district courts to impose this type of sanction.the plaintiff insists that even if his failure to designate walsh and hussein constituted a discovery violation,the sanction that the district court selected was too severe.
a district court has wide discretion in choosing sanctions for discovery violations.see santiago díaz,at.even so,when a sanction carrie s the force of a dismissal,the justification for it must be comparatively more robust.esposito,at.in evaluating whether a specific sanction is appropriate in a given case,we take into account a multiplicity of pertinent factors,including the history of the litigation,the proponent need for the challenged evidence,the justification if any for the late disclosure,and the opponent ability to overcome its adverse effects,including s urprise and prejudice.macaulay anas,cir.we may also take into account what the late disclosure portends for the court docket.id.
in this situation,some factors weigh in favor of the plaintiff.he did not have a history of noncompliance with the district court orders and his need for causation evidence was great.those factors,however,comprise only part of the story.
the plaintiff offered absolutely no justification for the late designation.in addition,the district court pushed back the trial date more than once in a painstaking attempt to determine whether the plaintiff could make out a triable issue on causation.throughout this process,the plaintiff gave no hint that he believed he had designated any causation expert other than tikoo.although he knew for many months that the defendants were challenging the admissibility of tikoo testimony,he took no steps to designate either walsh or hussein as a backup.a party who knowingly chooses to put all his eggs in one basket is to complain when the basket proves inadequate and the trial court refuses to allow him to substitute a new and previously undisclosed basket for it.
the sockdolager,of course,is the extreme prejudice that would have attended an decision to allow the plaintiff to convert two fact witnesses into experts on causation.the deadline for designating the plaintiff experts expired on march,and discovery closed on august of that year.from that date forward,the defendants pursued litigation strategies based on their justifiable understanding that tikoo was the plaintiff only causation expert.their strategic direction was made manifest by the filing in tandem of a motion to exclude tikoo testimony and a motion for summary judgment premised on the plaintiff inability,without that testimony,to prove causation.
it was not until march of nearly a year after the deadline for designating experts,seven months after discovery closed,three months after the exclusion of tikoo testimony,and a mere month before the scheduled start of trial that the plaintiff for the first time claimed that walsh and hussein had been designated all along to provide expert testimony on causation.it strains credulity to explain the plaintiff actions as anything other than a hail mary pass to resurrect a case fatally wounded by tikoo exclusion.
the district court dealt with this complicated case for several years.when faced with an egregious discovery violation,it weighed the relevant factors and made a sensible though not inevitable choice of sanctions.we can not,from the remote vista of an algid appellate record,that choice.we hold,therefore,that the sanction imposed,though severe,was within the realm of the district court discretion.
there remains the plaintiff optimistic assertion that walsh and hussein should have been allowed to testify on causation regardless of whether they were designated as experts with respect to that subject.he offers a different rationale for each of those physicians.walsh worked for the hospital,and the plaintiff argues that her views regarding the effectiveness of are admissions of a,see.d,and admissible on that basis.as to hussein,the plaintiff suggests that the statement about causation contained in the to whom it may concern letter an
