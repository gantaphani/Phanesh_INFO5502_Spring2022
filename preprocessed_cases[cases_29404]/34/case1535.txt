hui pan,a native and citizen of china fujian province,petitions for review of the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal based on his claim that government officials will sterilize him if he returns to china.see a.pan also seeks review of the denial of his claim under the convention against torture cat.we deny his petition.
in november,pan left his home in the jin an district of fuzhou city for the united states.he ended up in baltimore,maryland,where he is living with his uncle while his application for asylum works its way through the system.pan arrived in the united states without valid entry documents,and the department of homeland security dhs detained him and conducted a credible fear interview.during the interview,pan claimed that if he returned to china,family planning officials would forcibly sterilize him for violating china policy.pan stated that he and his wife,xiaojuan chen,already had a daughter when chen became pregnant in november.according to pan,when local family planning officials discovered the pregnancy,they forced chen to have an abortion and beat pan for resisting.pan explained that officials took steps to sterilize chen soon after the abortion but decided she was not suitable for sterilization and that pan would have to be sterilized instead.when the interviewing officer asked why chen was unsuitable,pan answered that government officials did not explain why she was not able to be sterilized.the asylum officer determined that there was a significant possibility that the assertions underlying pan claim could be found credible,and referred his case for a full asylum determination by an immigration judge ij.
the dhs placed pan in removal proceedings,charging him as removable for being present in the united states without having been admitted.see a a i i.pan conceded removability and applied for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the cat.in support of his asylum application,pan submitted a written statement that elaborated on various statements he made during his credible fear interview.pan stated that chen was three months pregnant when birth control bureau personnel appeared at his home on november,charging that chen pregnancy violated birth control regulations and that an abortion was required.when pan attempted to stop them,three men pushed him,beat him and kicked him with their feet.according to pan statement,officials then took chen away,performed the abortion and sent her back home the following day.pan claims,moreover,that government officials returned three days later on november and took her away once again this time to sterilize her.but as it so happened,pan alleged,doctors did not perform a tubal ligation because of her health reasons.pan stated that he was not at home during this second visit by government officials,and that when he returned later that day,he found a notice in his mailbox requiring him to report for sterilization on november.after a discussion with his family,pan decided to flee to the united states without his family.he claimed that he left home on the morning of november,and hid with friends until the middle of december,at which time he left for beijing.pan did not specify the location of his initial hiding place.according to his application,pan stayed in beijing for two days before flying to rome.he spent one day in rome and then flew to mexico before arriving in the united states in january.pan asylum application made no mention of a smuggler and did not address how,if at all,he obtained the travel documents necessary to make such a trip.
pan submitted several corroborating documents with his application,including a fuzhou surgery certificate dated november,the day of the abortion,indicating that chen was pregnant and that i nduced abortion is to be performed,a fujian women and children health center disease explanation form dated november,stating that b ecause chen has a serious skin disease skin damages on her skin around the area where she had her operation,it is not advisable for her to get a tubal ligation,a notice dated november,that was purportedly issued by the fuzhou jin an district birth control bureau directing pan to report for sterilization on november a marriage certificate for pan and chen and a birth certificate indicating a daughter was born to pan and chen on june.
during his asylum hearing,pan testified he believed chen was two months pregnant at the time she was forced to undergo the abortion,but admitted he could not remember clearly.pan recalled that when chen returned home after the abortion,she had a bandage a round her stomach,looked pale and weak,and had difficulty walking.pan testified that he did not ask chen for details about the abortion.in explaining why family planning officials decided to have him,rather than chen,sterilized,pan told the ij that chen could not undergo a sterilization procedure because of a skin problem.
pan also testified in greater detail regarding his flight from china to the united states.according to pan,on the same evening he received notice that the government intended to sterilize him,his parents located and hired a smuggler to get him out of china.pan,however,professed not to know whether or to what extent his parents compensated the smuggler.
pan stated that on the morning of november,he left for the mawei district in fuzhou city where he hid with a friend for two days.pan testified that after hiding in fuzhou city for two days,he traveled to beijing,as arranged by the smuggler,where he stayed for another two days in a house owned by someone he did not know.finally,pan testified that he flew to rome using a passport issued in his actual name and obtained on his behalf from the chinese government by someone he could not identify.pan indicated he no longer had this chinese passport because it was exchanged at some point for a japanese passport.from rome,pan flew to mexico city and then rode in a truck to the texas border where he was detained by dhs.
the ij asked pan how he obtained his corroborating documents for the asylum hearing.pan responded that friends of his parents brought the documents from china to the united states discreetly,secretly and left them with his aunt and uncle in baltimore.pan was unable to name these family friends or provide any contact details for them.when asked to explain why he did not call his aunt or uncle as witnesses to verify receipt of the documents,pan told the ij they had to work.
the ij found that neither pan testimony nor his supporting documentation was credible.the ij offered several reasons to support the adverse credibility determination.first,the ij found it implausible that pan parents could locate and hire a smuggler so quickly on the same day,in fact,that pan allegedly learned the government intended to sterilize him.second,the ij concluded pan testimony about where and with whom he hid in fuzhou city was vague and inconsistent.third,the ij was troubled by pan inability to provide details about chen abortion beyond a general description of her physical appearance and condition following the procedure.finally,the ij expressed major concern as to the authenticity of the documents.the ij observed that the documents were allegedly provided by an unknown courier to the uncle whose testimony could have been provided today,but was not provided.based on pan lack of credibility and the absence of credible independent evidence supporting his claim,the ij denied pan application for relief.
the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision and dismissed pan appeal.in concluding that the adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous,the bia reiterated the ij specific reasons and offered additional reasons to support the adverse credibility determination.first,the bia observed that when pan began his testimony about the events surrounding chen forced abortion,he did not mention being beaten by officials even though that allegation was featured in his credible fear interview and his asylum application.second,the bia concluded that pan testimony regarding how long chen had been pregnant at the time of the abortion was inconsistent with the fuzhou surgery certificate he submitted.third,the bia found that pan explanation that chen could not be sterilized due to an unspecified skin condition was vague and unclear.having concluded that the ij gave specific and cogent reasons for finding pan testimony incredible,which are supported by the record,the bia examined the corroborating documentation pan submitted and concluded the documents were inherently unreliable,and that pan did not authenticate the documents through any means whatsoever.the bia therefore concluded that the corroborating evidence offered by pan did not rehabilitate his testimony,and that pan failed to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.finally,the bia stated additionally that the totality of the record did not establish that pan would more likely than not be subject to torture upon his return to china within the meaning of the cat,id.
the scope of our review of a final order of removal denying asylum or withholding of removal is narrow,dankam gonzales,cir,requiring us to affirm the order as long as it is not manifestly contrary to law.b c.federal appellate courts review factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,using the substantial evidence standard.see djadjou holder,f d,cir dankam,at.under this deferential standard,administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.therefore,w hen the denial of asylum is based on the conclusion that the applicant failed to meet his evidentiary burden for establishing eligibility,then we review for substantial evidence and must affirm a determination of statutory ineligibility by the bia unless the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find eligibility for asylum.dankam,at quoting ins elias zacarias.this means that when the record plausibly could support two results the one the ij chose and the one the petitioner advances,reversal is only appropriate where the court finds that the evidence not only supports the opposite conclusion,but compels it.niang gonzales,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.finally,b ecause the bia affirmed the ij order and supplemented it,we apply these standards of judicial review to the factual findings and reasoning contained in both decisions.niang,at.
the immigration and nationality act the ina authorizes the secretary of homeland security or the attorney general to confer asylum on any alien who establishes refugee status.see b a.an applicant for asylum bears the burden of proving that he or she is a refugee,see b b i,meaning that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,a a.applicants may satisfy this burden by showing either that they were subjected to past persecution or that they have a fear of future persecution on account of one of the enumerated grounds.djadjou,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the ina specifically permits victims of china population control policy to seek political asylum 
a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
pan attempted to prove his refugee status by demonstrating a fear of future persecution.although pan testified about past mistreatment he suffered while resisting officials as they forcibly removed chen to terminate her pregnancy,the clear thrust of pan claim is that he fears family planning officials will sterilize him if he is removed to china 
the fear of persecution standard consists of a subjective and objective component.the subjective part requires the alien to present candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.ngarurih ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the objective element requires a showing of specific,concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution.id.at.
the testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant burden without corroboration,but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant testimony is credible,is persuasive,and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.b b ii.because the subjective element can not generally be proved other than through the applicant testimony,however,a determination that the applicant testimony is not credible will generally defeat the claim,camara ashcroft,cir,unless the asylee is able to prove eligibility with evidence independent of the discredited testimony,see tassi holder,cir.
under the real id act,an ij,after c onsidering the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,may make an adverse credibility determination based on factors such plausibility of the applicant account,the consistency between the applicant written and oral statements,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record,or any other relevant factor.b b iii.a credibility determination may rest on any relevant factor even if such factor does not go to the heart of the applicant claim.id.the real id act credibility provision affords a flexible,commonsense approach to credibility determinations,singh holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted,but also ensures that an ij does not cherry pick solely facts favoring an adverse credibility determination while ignoring facts that undermine that result,shrestha holder,cir shah attorney of the united states,cir although we do expect an immigration judge to search for ways to sustain an alien testimony,neither do we expect the judge to search for ways to undermine and belittle it.nor do we expect a judge to selectively consider evidence,ignoring that evidence that corroborates an alien claims and calls into question the conclusion the judge is attempting to reach.citation omitted.when an adverse credibility determination has been made,this court must assess whether the ij or bia identified,specific,cogent reason s in support of the adverse credibility finding.dankam,at internal quotation marks omitted.if an adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and conjecture rather than specific and cogent reasoning,it is not supported by substantial evidence.see tewabe gonzales,f d,cir.
we conclude that the adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.the ij and the bia identified specific and cogent reasons supporting this finding.although not all of the stated grounds necessarily withstand scrutiny,we conclude that,on balance,substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination.
the bia concluded that pan testimony regarding why chen could not be sterilized resulting in the government decision to sterilize him instead was vague and unclear.although vagueness and lack of specificity are not factors specifically listed in the real id act credibility determination provision,they qualify as other relevant factor s that an ij may consider.b b iii see shrestha,at dorosh ashcroft,cir under bia rulings,credibility encompasses not just consistency but also plausibility and sufficient detail.elzour ashcroft,cir same.pan claims that family planning officials decided to sterilize him after it was discovered that chen could not be sterilized by means of a tubal ligation because of a condition pan described as a skin disease or skin problem.to corroborate his story,pan offered a photocopy of a fujian women and children health center disease explanation form stating that b ecause chen has a seri
