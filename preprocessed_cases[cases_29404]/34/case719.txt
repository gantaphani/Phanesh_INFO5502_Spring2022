we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states wihbey,cir.additional facts are outlined in our analysis that follows.
in the early morning hours of november,matthew sliker sliker,the overnight clerk of the budget host motel in waterville,maine had just completed his duties.sliker was playing a copy of the video game syphonfilter,which had been rented from a store called movie gallery,on a sony playstation in the lobby when the defendant,dennis mooney mooney and his brother,david mooney david,entered and inquired about a room.after asking about the price,mooney told sliker they needed to get money and both men left the hotel.sliker followed them outside to smoke a cigarette and watched the two men approach other men standing next to a dark gray volkswagen jetta.
after sliker returned to the lobby,david and mooney came back into the motel.david asked to play the video game,and sliker began filling out a registration form with mooney.marquis craig craig then entered the lobby and approached the registration desk.wearing a blue bandana over his face,craig pulled out a pump shotgun with a scope,pointed it toward the ceiling,loaded a round into the chamber,and then put the gun on the counter.the defendant ordered sliker to raise his hands and not to set off any alarms.craig demanded money,and after sliker unlocked the cash drawer,the defendant took.david then used a telephone cord to tie sliker ankles to his wrists.pointing the gun in sliker face,craig warned him that if he waited less than two hours to call the police,he would be killed.one of the robbers grabbed the sony playstation,and they fled in the jetta.in the car,mooney divided the money among the robbers and his other,nathan and manuel roderick roderick.
eventually,sliker hands became untied and he called the police.he described the defendant as a white male,years old,with thin sideburns and a red tinted goatee,wearing a dark blue or black bandana and a black or tan jacket with the word american across the back.the police intercepted the robbers on the highway as they headed toward portland.the defendant,david,and roderick were arrested at the scene and brought to the portland police station.craig exited the vehicle and fled into the woods,but was later found and arrested.in the car,the police found a sony playstation,a syphonfilter video game from movie gallery,two dark blue bandanas,and a pump shotgun with a scope.
later that night,on the way to the portland police station,sliker and two detectives stopped to inspect the dark gray jetta that the police had pulled over earlier.sliker recognized it as the car used in the robbery.he also identified the shotgun.once sliker arrived at the station,he identified one of the robbers,david,in a photographic lineup.
sliker then waited in the lobby.in an attempt to isolate him from the suspects in custody,a member of the police department who was not involved in the robbery investigation brought sliker to the back of the station.during the escort,sliker passed the defendant,who was in handcuffs.sliker recognized him right away and told one officer that the defendant was the robber who took the money out of the cash register.
at the trial,cooperating witnesses craig,david,and identified the defendant as one of the three men who committed the robbery.they also testified that the defendant had suggested robbing the budget host motel.sliker corroborated their testimony by identifying the defendant as one of the robbers.in addition,the defendant former girlfriend and the government handwriting expert testified that mooney authored letters in which he admitted his participation in the robbery.
after deliberating for two hours,the jury found mooney guilty of the robbery conspiracy and using or carrying a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.the defendant was sentenced to a term of years and six months.this appeal followed.
ii.improper arguments by the prosecutor 
mooney claims that improper comments made by the prosecutor during her opening argument undermined the fairness of his trial and warrant reversal of his conviction.specifically,the defendant challenges the prosecutor opening statement on two different grounds.first,he argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury emotions when she began her opening with the following remarks 
we are fortunate in the state of maine,particularly in the part of maine that most of us come from,to live lives that are relatively free from random acts of violence.we do have bars on our windows.we do fear walking at night.and as a rule,our homes and our workplaces are safe havens from random crime.
this case involves a painful exception to that rule,a random act of violence that has forever changed the way that one person looks at the world,and in some respects has rocked the sense of security of an entire maine community.
in addition,while describing the nature of the burglary to the jury,she commented after the drawer was empty and the phone cords had all been cut,thank god,the three of them left the hotel lobby.the defendant asserts that these comments created an alliance between the government and the jurors,implied that the defendant had corrupted the community,and resulted in an improper appeal to the jurors passions and prejudices.
second,the defendant argues that the prosecutor impermissibly commented on his failure to testify,in violation of his fifth amendment privilege against.in her opening,the prosecutor told the jury 
finally,as you assess the codefendants credibility,consider how their testimony fits with the defendant own words.you see,after the defendant was arrested on these charges,he chose not to speak to the police,and that was certainly his right.he did give a false name.
the defendant argues that this comment impermissibly suggested that the defendant silence was evidence of guilt and therefore requires a new trial.
at sidebar after the prosecutor opening statement,the defendant immediately objected to these comments and moved for a mistrial.the district judge denied his motion on the basis that just prior to hearing the remarks,the jury had been instructed that opening statements were not evidence in the case.he then promptly delivered an explicit curative instruction to the jury.the judge reminded the jury that the defendant was presumed innocent and that the government carried the burden of proving he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.he also reiterated that the jury could only use the evidence,not their personal feelings,biases or opinions to determine the defendant guilt or innocence.further,he delivered the following instruction 
let me just elaborate on that for a little bit.number one,everybody who arrested has a right to remain silent,and you are not permitted to use the fact that someone did or did not remain silent as any element of guilt.you are not to use that to find any issue of guilt in this case,and i instruct you in that regard.any finding of guilt must be based solely upon the evidence in this case and not that factor.
number two,you are not to use as an element in determining guilt or innocence in this case whether or not we fortunate in maine to be safe or not and whether you or maine or any community is safer or less safe depending upon whether you find the defendant guilty or not guilty.that simply is not an appropriate issue.you only to use the issue of whether or not the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt sufficient facts to show that the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt has committed those acts necessary to constitute these crimes.
the defendant alleges that the district judge erred in denying a mistrial because taken together the prosecutor improper remarks had a cumulative prejudicial effect on the jury that could not be cured by a cautionary instruction.in response to this appeal,the government does not defend the prosecutor opening remarks,but instead argues that a mistrial was unwarranted because the improper remarks were brief and isolated were promptly cured by limiting instructions and were completely inconsequential in light of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant.we review the district judge denial of the motion for a mistrial for manifest abuse of discretion.see united states jesus,cir.
improper appeals to the jury passions and prejudices 
we agree with the defendant that the prosecutor remarks contrasting the jurors sense of community safety with the armed robbery of the hotel crossed the bounds of permissible argument.these comments interjected issues having no bearing on the defendant guilt or innocence and improperly appealed to the jury to act in ways other than as dispassionate arbiters of the facts.see united states,cir prosecutor use of the term we impermissibly suggested an alliance between the government and a church to which many of the jurors,but not the defendant,belonged united states,cir government closing which urged the jury to consider case as a battle in the war against drugs with the defendants as enemy soldiers corrupting our society was inflammatory and impermissible united states moreno,cir opening statement referencing a community plagued by shooting and killings improperly played upon the jury emotional reaction to neighborhood violence.
this finding,however,does not end our analysis.these improper remarks are grounds for reversal only if they so poisoned the well as to have likely affected the trial outcome,at quoting united states,cir.in making that assessment,we weigh several factors,including the severity of the misconduct whether it was deliberate or accidental the context in which it occurred whether the judge gave any curative instructions and their likely effect and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.see united states,cir united states manning,cir see also united states auch,cir adopting similar factors.
our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor improper appeal to the jurors passions,on balance,was not severe.admittedly,the remarks appear to be intentional because they were part of her opening statement and likely scripted in advance.see wihbey,at.the comments,however,were brief and isolated.after the defendant objected to them,the prosecutor never again suggested that the defendant corrupted the general safety of the community of maine,nor did she make other improper appeals to the jurors emotions during the remainder of the trial.manning,at prosecutorial misconduct was pervasive auch,at prosecution made repeated improper references.
the context of the prosecutor comments also weighs against finding that they likely affected the outcome of the trial.the comments occurred during opening arguments,not during summation where the last words the jury hears have significant potential to cause prejudice.see auch,at.in addition,the remarks were prefaced by the judge standard instructions informing the jury that neither opening statements nor summations may be considered as evidence in the case.we have found that these standard instructions alone are sometimes enough to neutralize any prejudice from improper remarks.see united states,cir.
in the instant case,the judge did not exclusively rely on these standard instructions.he promptly delivered a forceful and specific limiting instruction,and we generally presume that a jury will follow such instruction.see wihbey,at citing greer miller,d.given the decisive nature of his instruction,we believe it cured any prejudice.
moreover,we note that any lingering prejudicial effect from the remarks pales in comparison with the overwhelming strength of the government evidence against the defendant.all three of mooney accomplices testified that he suggested that they rob the motel,took the money from the cash register,and then divided the proceeds.the victim independently identified mooney as the robber who removed the money from the cash drawer.in addition,after intercepting the defendant and his accomplices on the highway,the police found in the jetta the gun,bandanas and the sony playstation and video game stolen from the motel.finally,mooney girlfriend and a handwriting expert testified that he authored letters admitting his role in the robbery.taking a balanced view of this evidence,see auch,at,we are confident that the prosecutor improper appeal to the jury emotions did not affect the outcome of the trial.
comment on the defendant failure to testify 
while the prosecutor improper inflammatory remarks are reversible error only if they likely affected the trial outcome,the prosecutor comment on the defendant failure to testify requires reversal unless the government can prove the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see chapman california,d see also wihbey,at.we believe the government met that burden 
as we already described,the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming.in addition,the judge jury instructions strongly emphasized the presumption of the defendant innocence and the government burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.the prosecutor comments on the defendant silence were sandwiched between the judge opening charge that the jury must not consider opening arguments as evidence and his forceful curative instructions after the prosecutor made the remark.in his closing charge to the jury,the judge also explained the defendant constitutional right not to testify and the government burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt sixteen times.accordingly,even taking the prosecutor statement into account,it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict in this case.see united states hasting,d.
motion for a mistrial 
we acknowledge that several incidents of prosecutorial misconduct,none of which individually would require reversal,taken together may have a cumulative effect that warrants a mistrial.see wihbey,at.nevertheless,t he remedy of a new trial is rarely used it is warranted only where there would be a miscarriage of justice or where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.jesus,at.moreover,we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for manifest abuse of discretion.id.at.given the record in this case,the judge exercised sound discretion in denying the defendant motion.
iii.expert testimony 
the defendant also argues that the district court misapplied federal rule of evidence by allowing the government proffered handwriting expert to testify that the defendant was the author of several letters that acknowledged his involvement in the burglary.the defendant does not contend that the expert testimony should have been struck in its entirety.instead,he makes the more narrow argument that,although the reliability of the expert methodology suffices to support testimony regarding the similarity and differences between the handwriting on the letters and that of the defendant,the expert reliability can not sustain the admission of his ultimate opinion as to whether the defendant authored the letters.the district court disagreed,and we fail to see how the district court abused its discretion in reaching its conclusion.
under rule,a qualified expert witness may testify in the form of an opinion,or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.the supreme court has held that this rule imposes a function on the trial judge to ensure that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert merrell dow,d see also kumho tire carmichael,d holding that daubert applies not only to scientific testimon
