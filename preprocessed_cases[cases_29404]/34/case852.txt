defendant appellant deitron davis appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york frederic block,judge,following a jury trial,convicting him of narcotics offenses and resisting arrest.on appeal,davis argues that there was no evidence from which a jury could make the requisite finding that he knew that the criminal scheme at issue involved narcotics distribution,and evidence that he fled from the police and struggled against being handcuffed did not support a conviction for misdemeanor resisting arrest.we hold that the evidence supported davis convictions for the narcotics charges but not for resisting arrest.we therefore affirm as to the former charges but vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss the latter.
background 
factual background 
the evidence at trial demonstrated the following 
on june,employees of forward air shipping company columbus,ohio branch received certain damaged crates that were in transit from phoenix,arizona,to jfk airport in new york city.in accordance with company policy,the employees opened the packages and discovered what appeared to be bales of marijuana.forward air records revealed that the shipment had been sent from phoenix by carl paplow.the bill of lading stated that the consignee was robert francis and that the crates contained rims,tires and accessories,and audio parts,appendix app.the employees reported their discovery to local authorities,who contacted the dea new york office.the dea requested that the crates be sent on to their destination in the normal course for a controlled delivery.
the crates arrived at jfk on june and forward air turned them over to local dea agents.the agents searched the crates pursuant to a warrant and discovered kilograms of marijuana.they removed the marijuana,the crates and returned them to forward air jfk branch.while the crates were in dea custody,someone apparently not davis sought to retrieve the shipment from forward air jfk branch using a driver license for robert francis,but was turned away as the crates were not then available.
on june,the day the crates arrived in new york,davis friend kieama hyman and her friend sherelle whose last name does not appear in the record called davis,looking for something to do.davis picked the two women up in his black nissan maxima and drove to his cousin house nearby.according to hyman,davis started driving crazy as he neared the house,app,which hyman interpreted as davis trying not to be seen.once they arrived at the house,davis went inside while the two women waited in the car.davis returned and asked hyman whether she had identification.when she responded that she did,davis asked her if she would help pick up some rims for his car.hyman agreed.before they left davis cousin house,davis switched cars to a gold toyota avalon.he claimed that the rims would not fit inside the maxima,though hyman did not think the avalon was much bigger.davis drove hyman and sherelle to a nearby home depot.he then left the car and spoke to a man in a white van for about five minutes.he returned to the avalon and,accompanied now by the white van,proceeded to forward air jfk facility.according to a surveillance officer at the facility,davis drove back and forth at least twice before parking in front of forward.
after stopping at forward air,davis left the avalon and spoke once more with the driver of the white van.he then gave hyman a copy of the bill of lading for the shipment and told her to go in and pick up the rims.hyman and sherelle went inside,where hyman presented the bill of lading and her identification and signed some paperwork.the driver of the white van then pulled up to the forward air bay and loaded the crates inside.once the crates were loaded in the van,davis and the two women drove off in the avalon,followed by the white van and by dea agents.
circling the blocks,davis remarked that they were being followed.he pulled over and shouted at hyman and sherelle to get out of the car.as they did,davis said he would be back to pick them up and drove off.the agents then turned on their strobe lights the white van pulled over but davis sped off in the avalon.
the officers arrested hyman and sherelle.while under arrest,hyman received a phone call from davis which she answered at the officers instruction.davis said he would pick the two women up at a nearby intersection,but to make sure they were not followed.hyman and sherelle walked towards the intersection,where an agent observed davis walking nearby.
the agent who saw davis identified himself and drew his weapon,at which point davis ran.the agent chased davis for approximately ten minutes,during which time davis ignored many commands to stop and the agent several times caught up with and struck large man at six feet seven his baton.davis did not fight back.eventually,other agents joined the chase and tackled davis.while pinned on the ground,davis placed his hands under his body and was fighting and resisting against being handcuffed for one or two minutes,app,though he ultimately was subdued,handcuffed and arrested.there was no evidence that davis threatened or struck out at any of the agents.
after arresting davis,the agents searched him and recovered,inter alia,his driver license and a jet blue airways receipt listing davis as a passenger on a may,flight from phoenix to jfk.they later confirmed with jet blue that davis had been on that flight and that he previously had flown from jfk to phoenix on may.they also learned that before davis had boarded the may flight,an fbi agent had asked him why he had no or checked luggage.davis had responded that he planned to buy clothes in phoenix.
davis was interviewed by dea agents after his arrest.among other things,he claimed not to have heard of or been to forward air.
ii.procedural background 
davis was tried for conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of b b vii and attempting to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of b b vii and the misdemeanor of resisting arrest in violation of a.a jury convicted him on all three counts.hyman,sherelle and the driver of the white van were not charged because there was no evidence contradicting their claims that they were unaware that the crates contained marijuana.
davis moved for a judgment of acquittal under.with regard to the narcotics convictions,he argued that there was insufficient evidence that he knew that the shipment contained a controlled substance.special appendix.the district court disagreed 
t he evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the government,established,inter alia,that davis traveled to arizona the source of the shipment less than a month before the shipment arrived that he possessed a bill of lading for the shipment albeit under another name and that he told hyman that he was excited to go pick up his rims.a jury could reasonably infer from those facts that davis traveled to arizona to arrange the shipment and,therefore,that he was the intended recipient of the shipment.
id.at.as to his conviction for resisting arrest,davis pointed out that the government had offered no evidence that davis had directed any force at the arresting officers.he contended that evidence demonstrating only that he had not yielded to arrest was legally insufficient for a conviction.the district court rejected this argument as well,concluding that davis willful use of physical force in making it difficult for officers to handcuff him permitted a conviction for resisting arrest.
the district court entered a judgment of conviction on all counts and sentenced davis principally to a month term of imprisonment.davis appeals from that judgment on the grounds raised in his rule motion.

ii.convictions for the narcotics offenses 
with regard to davis convictions for conspiring to distribute marijuana and attempting to possess marijuana with intent to distribute,the question before us is straightforward was the evidence at trial legally sufficient to support a finding that davis knew that the shipped crates contained a controlled substance 
to prove that a person possessed a controlled substance with intent to distribute,the government must prove that the defendant knew he was dealing with a controlled substance.united states.torres,cir.the same holds true for drug conspiracy charges.see id.at.the government need not prove that the defendant knew the specific drug at issue,but only that he was dealing with some controlled substance.see united states morales,cir.
on appeal,as he did in his rule motion before the district court,davis relies on a line of this court decisions reversing convictions for insufficient evidence that the defendant knew the specific object of the criminal scheme at issue.for example,in united states ogando,cir,this court reversed the conviction of a taxi driver who was scheduled to pick up a drug smuggler at an airport.we held that the evidence which consisted of the defendant presence at the airport,earlier presence at another airport where another was arrested,and associations with certain other simply show ed that defendant was a livery cab driver regularly used by members of this conspiracy.id.at see also torres,at defendant suspicious behavior in attempting to take delivery of narcotics shipment did not indicate knowledge that the shipment contained drugs united states lorenzo,cir defendant periodic involvement with conspirators,including transferring money to one,was indicative of illegal behavior but did not demonstrate knowledge that the conspiracy involved narcotics united states.rodriguez,cir evidence demonstrated only that defendant served as a lookout for some sort of illicit transaction,not that he knew it was a drug transaction specifically united states friedman,cir evidence of calls between conspirator and defendant,and that defendant furnished guns to conspirator,did not demonstrate that defendant knew that the object of the conspiracy was extortion united states samaria,cir gypsy cab driver presence in car with conspirators,and assistance with loading boxes containing stolen credit card information,did not demonstrate knowledge of conspiracy to commit credit card fraud,abrogated on other grounds,united states huezo,cir.
in each of these cases,save torres,the defendant played a role subordinate to that of the principal engaged in the criminal conduct charged,and the defendant plausibly could have fulfilled that role without knowing the scheme criminal nature.that is,it is conceivable that the criminal enterprises at issue could have functioned as planned without the requisite criminal knowledge of the taxi driver ogando,the money transferor lorenzo,the lookout rodriguez,the frequent caller and gun supplier friedman,and the driver and box loader samaria.this case is easily distinguishable from those cases,in which the overall circumstances of each case did not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite knowledge.the evidence in this case established,either directly or by inference,that davis played a principal role,even a managerial one,in the drug conspiracy and for that reason would have reasonably possessed the requisite criminal knowledge.
torres,in which we reversed a conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine,presented a factual scenario closer to this one.davis relies upon it to argue that the evidence here is insufficient to prove his knowledge that the forward air packages contained a controlled substance.in torres,the defendant torres and several other men,in suspicious fashion,had attempted to receive a ups delivery of certain bulky packages addressed to torres.they greeted the deliveryman outside the destination address,presented a driver license for torres that listed him as living at a different address,and followed the deliveryman after he refused to turn over the packages.eventually,ups and the police discovered that the packages contained cocaine and staged a controlled delivery at a ups store.once again,torres suspiciously attempted to receive the packages,and this time was arrested.reviewing his conviction,this court concluded that the evidence supported findings that torres had a connection with the packages and that,based on his suspicious behavior,he was most likely aware that the packages contained contraband of some kind.id.at.but the record did not contain any evidence that torres knew the packages contained narcotics,such as evidence as to the nature of torres associations with the persons who shipped the cocaine or with the persons who expected to distribute it.id.at.because t here was no evidence of any conduct by torres other than his efforts to gain possession of the packages,this court held that there was no evidence that torres knew of the packages contents.id.at.
there may be tension between torres and decisions in other circuits as to whether an inference of guilty knowledge may be drawn from suspicious behavior of an intended recipient of a narcotics package.see united states.hernandez,app x,cir collecting cases for the proposition that a jury may infer a defendant guilty knowledge based on the suspicious circumstances surrounding receipt of a drug shipment see also,united states hernández,cir affirming convictions based on,inter alia,the facts that one defendant was the intended recipient of the shipment and thereafter controlled the packages,and another defendant drove evasively after taking possession of the packages united states gbemisola,the southeast asian shippers placed heroin in the false bottoms of the pots in an amount and value the jury could reasonably have doubted they would have entrusted to recipients who thought they were merely importing artifacts,and in a location that would have been particularly risky if an innocent recipient had decided to use the cooking pots for their apparent purpose.united states brown,cir affirming the conviction of a defendant who tried to take receipt of a ups delivery of drugs in facts resembling those in torres united states quilca carpio,cir a prudent smuggler is not likely to entrust such valuable cargo to an innocent person without that person knowledge.internal quotation marks omitted.but cases of this sort are.in this case,we have no doubt,based on all the evidence,that the jury permissibly could have inferred davis guilty knowledge.
first,the evidence here did not link davis only to the receipt of the drugs but also to their initial shipment.davis,traveling without luggage,flew from new york to phoenix,where the shipment originated,a month before he attempted to receive the crates.viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the government and as the district court correctly concluded,a jury could reasonably infer that davis traveled to arizona to arrange the shipment.and because it logically can be inferred that one who arranges a shipment knows its contents,the jury here easily could have found from the totality of the evidence that davis knew precisely what was in the shipped packages.
second,as noted earlier,the evidence showed that davis had an authoritative role in the criminal scheme.see united states cruz,cir a jury may reasonably infer guilty knowledge from evidence that the defendant exercised authority within the conspiracy itself samaria,at same.he controlled the circumstances surrounding the pick up choosing when to pick up the crates,how to pick up the crates,and who would pick up the crates.specifically,davis recruited kieama hyman and her friend to pick up the crates even though he easily could have done so himself switched cars at his cousin house directed hyman to use her identification to retrieve the crates from forward air and it appears that he obtained a van with a driver to pick up the crates.see united states medina,cir affirming conviction in part because defendant approved participation of an additional and supplied a gun united states tussa,cir affirming conviction of defendant who took part in the negotiations leading to a drug delivery.
third,the evidence showed that davis concealed his involvement in the criminal conspiracy the crates were not addressed to him but to robert francis he recruited another person without knowledge of the true contents of the crates to pick them up and he lied to this person by telling her that he did not have his driver license even though he did.this evidence supports an inference of davis knowledge of the crates contents.see,hernandez,at that the name of the consignee was fabricated supported the conclusion that the defendant knew the container contents.united states johnson,cir similarly probative of defendant guilty knowledge is the fact that defendant listed on the airbill a false name and nonexistent address for the package destination.these facts,along with the fact that the bill of lading identified the recipient as robert francis rather than davis,and a person claiming to be robert francis first tried to retrieve the crates,are inconsistent with davis statements to hyman that the crates contained rims for his car.
finally,davis possession of the bill of lading supports an inference that he had the requisite knowledge.for one,taken together with his recruitment of select people,it gave him not only the prospect of having sole dominion over the crates,see torres,at,but sole dominion itself.furthermore,as we previously have observed,possession of documents relat ing to the crime may support an inference of knowledge.cruz,at see also samaria,at same.
taken together,these circumstances easily permitted an inference that davis,far from being an unwitting courier for a conspiracy,was a willing if not central participant who knew that the shipment contained narcotics.see united states stewart,cir collecting cases for the proposition that a defendant guilty knowledge may be established through circumstantial evidence.we therefore have no difficulty affirming davis convictions on the narcotics counts.
iii.conviction for resisting arrest 
the conviction for resisting arrest,however,presents a different picture.provides 
forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with a officer or employee while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties 
shall,where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year,or both,and where such acts involve physical contact with the victim of that assault or the intent to commit another felony,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b enhanced penalty.whoever,in the commission of any acts described in subsection a,uses a deadly or dangerous weapon including a weapon intended to cause death or danger but that fails to do so by reason of a defective component or inflicts bodily injury,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
davis was tried and convicted under the misdemeanor clause in section a.we therefore must decide whether the evidence permitted the jury to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that davis forcibly assault ed,resist ed,oppose d,impede d,intimidate d,or interfere d with a officer or employee while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties and,in doing so,committed simple assault.
simple assault under section a 
in united states chestaro,cir,we considered a vagueness challenge to the predecessor version of section,which was identical to the current version in relevant part the appellant in that case argued that simple assault,which delineates misdemeanor conduct,was not clearly defined and that the statute therefore did not sufficiently distinguish between misdemeanors and felonies.we disagreed.we noted the settled principle of statutory construction that,absent contrary indications,congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms.id.at quoting united states shabani.we also pointed out that the term simple assault appears elsewhere in the in and that it had been held to embrace the common law meaning in that context.chestaro,at quoting united states stewart,cir.we therefore held that simple assault,as used in section a,incorporated the established common law definition of the phrase a crime,not involving touching,committed by either a willful attempt to inflict injury upon the person of another,or by a threat to inflict injury upon the person of another which,when coupled with an apparent present ability,causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.chestaro,at,internal quotation marks omitted see also united states vallery,cir under the common law,physical contact is the line of demarcation between simple assault and battery.
following chestaro,we clarified that simple assault retains its common law definition in the context of the current version of section a.see united states hertular,cir.thus,for a defendant to be guilty of the misdemeanor of resisting arrest under section a,he necessarily must have committed common law simple assault.see id.
we recognize that there is disagreement among the federal courts of appeals in interpreting section a use of simple assault.the main problem,as explained by the ninth circuit,is that section a appears to prohibit six different types of actions assaulting,resisting,opposing,impeding,intimidating and interfering only one of which is assault,but then it draws the line between misdemeanors and felonies solely by referencing the crime of assault.united states chapman,cir.therefore,it is unclear whether the statute prohibits acts of resistance,opposition,impediment,intimidation,or interference that do not also involve an underlying assault.id.at.several of our sister circuits have taken the same approach as,or similar approaches to,this court namely,requiring some form of common law simple assault for section a misdemeanor convictions.see chapman,at vallery,at united states hathaway,cir.
but two circuits have taken a different approach.in united states gagnon,cir,the sixth circuit,interpreting the predecessor version of section,opined that the approach taken by this court and others disregards five of the six actions congress specifically delineated and thus makes a great deal of what does say entirely meaningless.id.at.that court therefore held that in the context of section a,simple assault is not limited to its common law meaning,but is a term of art that includes the forcible performance of any of the six proscribed actions in a without the intent to cause physical contact or to commit a serious felony.id.at emphasis omitted.construing the current version of section,the fifth circuit followed the sixth circuit lead.see united states williams,cir.the fifth circuit reasoned that the sixth circuit reading avoid s rendering superfluous the other five forms of conduct proscribed by a.williams,at.that court also found it more consonant with the dual purpose of the statute,which,the supreme court has noted,is not simply to protect federal officers by punishing assault,but also to deter interference with federal law enforcement activities and ensure the integrity of federal operations by punishing obstruction and other forms of resistance.id.quoting united states feola.
while we do not find this reasoning to be without basis,we ultimately are not persuaded by it.first,as in any task of statutory construction,w e begin with the statute text.united states lyttle,cir.and as we noted in chestaro,it is that where a federal criminal statute uses a term of established meaning without otherwise defining it,the general practice is to give that term its meaning.united states turley,see chestaro,at.in defining misdemeanor conduct under section a,congress chose to use the specific phrase simple assault,which as noted earlier has a longstanding and precise meaning under the common law.
second,not only does simple assault have an established common law meaning,it does not appear to
