a jury convicted albert díaz,javier rodríguez romero,eddie rodríguez,and angel lópez capó of conspiracy to distribute narcotics and possession with intent to distribute narcotics as a result of their participation in a drug point that operated within a public housing project in guayama,puerto rico.the defendants individually raise a variety of challenges to the district court jurisdiction,the sufficiency of the evidence,the court evidentiary rulings,the jury instructions,and their sentences.after careful consideration,we find merit to only one of these claims.specifically,we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction over rodríguez,who was a juvenile during much of the conspiracy,with respect to two of the substantive drug counts of which he was convicted.we thus vacate those convictions and remand his case to the district court for a new sentencing hearing.we affirm in all other respects.
facts background 
on march,a grand jury returned a indictment against the defendants and other individuals.the indictment alleged,among other things,that the defendants conspired to operate a drug point in the san antonio public housing project commonly known as carioca,in the municipality of guayama,puerto rico.
count one of the indictment alleged that,between and march,the defendants and others knowingly conspired to possess with intent to distribute various amounts of cocaine base crack,heroin,cocaine,marijuana,and oxycodone within feet of a school public housing facility playground,in violation of a,and.we refer to this as the conspiracy count.
counts two through five of the indictment alleged that,between and march,the defendants and others,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin count two,fifty grams or more of crack count three,five kilograms or more of cocaine count four,and kilograms or more of marijuana count five within feet of a school public housing facility,in violation of a and and.we refer to these as the substantive drug counts.
count six alleged that,between to march,lópez capó,díaz,and others conspired to carry and use firearms during and in relation to the drug trafficking crimes charged in count one,in violation of o.count seven,which is not at issue here,sought the forfeiture of drug proceeds.
according to the indictment,díaz worked primarily as an enforcer for the drug point,meaning that he used firearms to protect the drug point employees,narcotics,and proceeds.rodríguez and rodríguez romero allegedly worked as runners and sellers,meaning that they supplied the drug point with narcotics,collected proceeds,recruited and paid sellers,and prepared ledgers,also known as tallies,to keep track of the drug point sales.the indictment alleged that lópez capó was one of the owners of the drugs distributed at carioca and that he received proceeds from the sale of crack at the drug point.
these four defendants elected to go to trial.the government presented the testimony of three witnesses,who had themselves participated in the carioca drug point heriberto garcía román,leonardo martínez de león,and yamil irizarry lucas.the government also presented the testimony of various officers from the puerto rico police department who had conducted surveillance and arrests,or otherwise intervened,at carioca.finally,the government presented the testimony of carmen orengo,a licensed chemist for the puerto rico forensic sciences institute,who analyzed some of the controlled substances seized from carioca.based on her analysis of the substances and the witnesses testimony regarding the frequency of sales at the drug point,orengo estimated that,in a given year,the carioca drug point had sold kilograms of crack,kilograms of heroin,kilograms of cocaine,and kilograms of marijuana.
the jury found díaz guilty of counts one through five but acquitted him of count six.rodríguez romero and rodríguez were found guilty of counts one through five.lópez capó,who testified at trial,was found guilty of counts one and three and acquitted of all other counts.this timely appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
a.the schoolyard counts 
we begin with a claim raised by díaz and lópez capó that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the relevant drug activity took place within feet of a protected area.see a.they also argue that the evidence was insufficient to establish the existence of a school,playground,or public housing project as those locations are defined in the statute.see id.because díaz and lópez capó raised this argument as part of a rule motion,we review de novo,viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states pérez meléndez,cir.we conclude that the foot requirement was met and that the evidence was sufficient to establish the existence of a public housing project.we therefore need not address whether the government also proved that the defendants engaged in activity within feet of a school or playground.
title a,also known as the schoolyard statute,provides enhanced penalties for the distribution,possession with intent to distribute,or manufacturing of drugs in or on,or within one thousand feet of any of three protected areas a school a playground or a public housing facility.the indictment charged the defendants with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute various controlled substances within one thousand feet of all three protected areas 
the government seems to have made its job unnecessarily difficult by alleging that the drug activity occurred within feet of a protected area,rather than simply alleging that it occurred in or on a protected area,as the statute allows.see a.when the government charges a defendant under the within feet prong of the statute,we have held that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the distance from the protected area to the site of the drug transaction is feet or less.united states soler,cir.because d istances are notoriously difficult to gauge in still photographs,and more so in motion pictures,we have generally insisted that the government provide a precise measurement.id.at internal citation omitted.we have,however,carved out an exception in some cases where the spatial leeway is relatively great and the gap in the chain of proof is relatively small,such that common sense,common knowledge,and rough indices of distance can carry the day.id.at.
the government offered ample evidence that the drug point operated within the carioca housing project.government witness heriberto garcía román testified that the drug point was located i nside of the carioca public housing project in some abandoned houses that were located right there inside of the public housing project.police officer víctor veguilla figuero testified that the drug point was located in the area of the staircase,in two abandoned houses and in the children play area within the carioca housing project,and he identified each of those locations in a photograph of carioca.leonardo martínez de león,who himself dealt drugs in carioca,identified various locations from which the drug point operated within carioca.and police officer roberto ayala vega testified that the drug point was always within carioca but moved among multiple buildings in the housing project.
the evidence was also sufficient to establish that carioca is a housing facility owned by a public housing authority,as required by a.officer josé ortiz sierra,of the puerto rico police department monitoring center for the public housing projects,testified that the monitoring center has surveillance cameras within carioca.it would be reasonable for the jury to infer from this testimony that carioca is a public housing project.see pérez meléndez,at.furthermore,defense witness jessica pinto capó,who worked as a secretary in the housing department,testified that she grew up in the carioca public housing project and that all carioca apartments are owned by the public housing authority.
given that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the drug point operated within carioca and that carioca is a public housing facility,it was also sufficient to establish that the drug point operated within feet of a public housing facility.where the government alleges that activity occurred within feet of a protected area under a and then proves that the activity actually occurred in or on the protected area,the government need not provide a precise measurement establishing the foot requirement in such an instance,common sense will carry the day.soler,at.
we thus affirm díaz conviction.we address lópez capó other claims below.
rodríguez bolón,who was convicted of the conspiracy count as well as four substantive drug counts,was either a juvenile or incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility for much of the time that the carioca drug point operated.rodríguez argues that the evidence offered at trial was insufficient to establish that he participated in the conspiracy or committed any of the substantive drug counts after he turned eighteen and that the district court thus lacked jurisdiction under the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda.see.we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo to determine whether the court exercise of jurisdiction was proper.see united states vargas de jesús,cir.rodríguez also argues that the court failed to properly instruct the jury with respect to the fjda.we review preserved objections to a district court jury instructions de novo,but we review for plain error where the defendant did not properly object before the district court.see,united states meadows,cir.
absent a certification from the attorney general,the fjda prevents a district court from exercising jurisdiction over a defendant who is under the age of for criminal acts that he committed before he turned eighteen.see vargas de jesús,at.in this case,it is undisputed that the government failed to present the district court with a certification from the attorney general and that the proceedings began before rodríguez turned.we have held that a conviction must be set aside,even absent timely objection,if the record establishes that a defendant was under the age of when the offense was committed and under the age of when criminal proceedings were commenced.vargas de jesús,at.there are,however,some important limitations on that rule.first,the jurisdictional question is one that the jury can decide there is no need for a pretrial evidentiary hearing.united states welch,cir.second,a jury may properly hear evidence regarding a defendant premajority conduct to establish the existence of a conspiracy.vargas de jesús,at.however,if the conspiracy began before the defendant turned eighteen,there can be no conviction unless the jury finds that the defendant in some manner ratified his participation in the conspiracy after attaining majority.welch,at see also vargas de jesús,at.
according to the indictment,this conspiracy lasted from to march.rodríguez was apparently active in the drug point until he entered a juvenile detention facility on or about may.he turned eighteen in february of while in detention,and was released on august.thus,if rodríguez participated in the conspiracy as an adult,it had to have been between august,and march.
the district court instructed the jury that it could not consider rodríguez acts in furtherance of the conspiracy before he turned eighteen unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt that he had participated in the conspiracy after he turned eighteen.the jury convicted rodríguez of five counts the conspiracy count count one and four substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute heroin count two,crack count three,cocaine count four,and marijuana count five.the district court used an offense level of and a criminal history category chc of i,which yielded a sentencing guideline range of to months.as to each count,the court sentenced rodríguez to months fifteen years and eight months in prison and ten years of supervised release,all to be served concurrently.
our cases have separated the jurisdictional analysis with respect to a conspiracy count from the jurisdictional analysis with respect to a substantive drug count.we have distinguished the continuing offense of conspiracy from a substantive violation,finding that it will generally be readily apparent whether a substantive violation occurred before or after the defendant eighteenth birthday.welch,at.in vargas de jesús,the government had failed to provide the necessary certification under the fjda,and the defendant was found guilty of one conspiracy count and two substantive drug counts.at.we concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over the conspiracy count,because there was ample evidence that the defendant had continued participating in the conspiracy after he turned eighteen.id.at.however,we vacated the defendant convictions on the substantive drug counts,finding that the evidence the government had offered in support of those counts related solely to acts the defendant had committed before he turned eighteen and that the court thus lacked jurisdiction.id.at.with those principles in mind,we turn to the case at hand.the conspiracy count 
rodríguez first claim is that there was insufficient evidence of his participation in the conspiracy for the district court to exercise jurisdiction over that count.we find the evidence sufficient.government witness leonardo martínez de león testified that rodríguez acted as a runner for the drug point towards the end of and in,that runners would give the material to the pushers,and that rodríguez was the person who handled marijuana for the drug point in and.martínez de león also testified that he paid rodríguez per week to be able to sell his own marijuana in carioca at the e nd of,beginning of.given that rodríguez turned eighteen in february,the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that rodríguez ratified his participation in the conspiracy.see vargas de jesús,at.
rodríguez also raises a challenge to the court jury instruction regarding the conspiracy count,which we review de novo.see,meadows,at.the district court gave the jury an instruction and included a special question on the verdict form regarding rodríguez participation in the conspiracy before and after he turned eighteen.the instruction went as follows 
let me say something about eddie rodriguez,also known as bolon age.the case of eddie rodriguez requires that a jury make a threshold consideration.you can not consider his acts in furtherance of the conspiracy before he turned years of age,unless you first find beyond a reasonable doubt that he participated in the conspiracy after he reached the age of years.if he participated in the conspiracy after he became years of age,then all of his acts in furtherance of the conspiracy while he was a minor can be considered as if he was of legal age.
the special question on the verdict form asked whether the jury found that rodríguez had participated in the conspiracy after he turned eighteen the jury answered in the affirmative.
the last sentence of the instruction was not entirely precise as a matter of law.while the jury may properly hear evidence regarding a defendant premajority conduct to establish the existence of a conspiracy,vargas de jesús,at,we have never held that the jury can consider all of a defendant acts in furtherance of the conspiracy as if he was an adult when he committed them,see id.at welch,at.however,rodríguez has given us no reason to believe that this error prejudiced him.see united states duclos,cir an error in jury instructions will mandate reversal only when the error is prejudicial based on a review of the entire record.the jury specifically found on its verdict form that rodríguez had participated in the conspiracy after he turned eighteen,and there was ample evidence of ratification for the court to exercise jurisdiction.we thus affirm rodríguez conviction on the conspiracy count.
the substantive drug counts 
rodríguez also challenges the district court exercise of jurisdiction over the substantive drug counts,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support jurisdiction and that the district court failed to properly instruct the jury regarding those counts.
we begin with the substantive count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana.martínez de león testimony was sufficient to establish jurisdiction over rodríguez with respect to that count.martínez de león testified that rodríguez was the person who handled marijuana for the drug point in and,that rodríguez was one of two owners of the weed at the drug point,and that martínez de león therefore paid rodríguez to be able to sell his own marijuana in carioca at the end of and in.we find that the jury reasonably could have credited martínez de león testimony and found sufficient evidence of activity for the district court to exercise jurisdiction over the marijuana count.see vargas de jesús,at.
for the substantive heroin,crack,and cocaine counts,the jurisdictional question is more complex.here,the government points to martínez de león testimony that rodríguez was a runner in late and he knew rodríguez was a runner because rodríguez would handle the marijuana and he paid rodríguez to be able to sell marijuana in carioca.the government brief suggests that martínez de león said that runners provided him with drugs to sell,including cocaine,crack,heroin,and marijuana,but we find no such statement in his testimony.in the cited portion of his testimony,martínez de león actually said,well,the runners would give the material to the pushers,without specifying or being asked by the government what material he was referring to.the government then asked martínez de león how he knew that rodríguez was a runner for the drug point in and,and martínez de león responded,because he would handle the marijuana.though martínez de león did testify that he was able to put drugs in the housing project by paying per week in rent to rodríguez and another individual,when the prosecutor asked him what he meant by having to pay rent,martínez de león testified as follows 
well,to pay rent to put it in this way,bolon and axel were the owners of the weed,so from there they were charging me each one.
and they would charge you each one for what 
for the marijuana.
and you would pay them the bucks,and what would you get in exchange for paying them the bucks 
i could continue selling the material through the carioca sic.
thus,taken in context,the reasonable inference to be drawn from this testimony is that the material refers to marijuana.the evidence does not establish that martínez de león paid rodríguez to be able to sell anything other than marijuana,that all runners handled all four drugs heroin,crack,cocaine,and marijuana,or that rodríguez personally possessed or distributed any drug other than marijuana after he turned eighteen.
recognizing that the evidence is lacking,the government offers two theories to support jurisdiction over rodríguez with respect to the substantive heroin,crack,and cocaine counts.the first is that,because each of the counts included an aiding and abetting charge,the jury could have convicted rodríguez of aiding and abetting in the possession or distribution of crack,heroin,and cocaine.we reject that argument,because the government has pointed us to no evidence in the record demonstrating that rodríguez aided or abetted in the possession or distribution of those drugs after he turned eighteen.
the government second argument is that the jury received an instruction regarding,and may have convicted rodríguez under,the pinkerton theory of liability,pursuant to which a defendant can be held liable for the substantive offenses of his if those offenses were reasonably foreseeable and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see pinkerton united states,united states vázquez botet,cir.the government theory seems to be that,once a juvenile defendant ratifies his participation in a conspiracy,he can be held liable for all offenses committed in furtherance of that conspiracy,including offenses that occurred before he turned eighteen which,in rodríguez case,is when he appears to have been most active in the drug point.
the propriety of exercising jurisdiction over a juvenile under the pinkerton doctrine was not before us in vargas de jesús.in that case,the government entirely failed to address the defendant substantive drug convictions in its brief,defending them for the first time at oral argument on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to convict.vargas de jesús,at.we thus have not yet examined whether a district court has jurisdiction over a defendant under the fjda with respect to substantive offenses committed by the defendant before the defendant turned eighteen.we find that it does not.
the fjda strips a district court of jurisdiction if the record establishes that a defendant was under the age of when the offense was committed and under the age of when criminal proceedings were commenced.id.emphasis added see also.though the continuing offense of conspiracy may span a defendant eighteenth birthday,a substantive violation generally will not.welch,at.we will allow evidence of acts comprising an offense to be admitted even if those acts occurred before the defendant turned eighteen,but the government can not rely entirely on acts to establish jurisdiction over an offense.see id.at.there must be sufficient proof of activity.see,vargas de jesús,at.thus,when a defendant has participated in a conspiracy both before and after his eighteenth birthday and the government fails to obtain a certification from the attorney general under,the defendant can not be held liable for the substantive crimes of his unless there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that each substantive crime occurred after the defendant turned eighteen,was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant,and was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see pinkerton.the district court must,in turn,properly instruct the jury regarding the government burden and the jury inability to consider the substantive crimes of committed before the defendant eighteenth birthday in assessing the defendant liability.
as mentioned above,the jury here received a pinkerton instruction,which rodríguez does not challenge on appeal.though we find this to be a very close case,the evidence on the record ultimately supports rodríguez conviction on the substantive crack count under a pinkerton theory of liability.specifically,the government introduced evidence that the police seized vials of crack from rodríguez romero,a,on october,which was after rodríguez ratified his participation in the conspiracy.we will assume that the jury properly followed the court pinkerton instruction and found that rodríguez romero possession of crack was reasonably foreseeable to rodríguez and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see,united states salley,cir.we thus affirm rodríguez conviction on the substantive count of possession with intent to distribute crack.
however,the government has pointed us to no evidence on the record demonstrating that rodríguez committed the substantive acts of possessing with intent to distribute heroin and cocaine after rodríguez turned eighteen.the government introduced general evidence that the drug point operated in and,as well as specific evidence tying rodríguez to heroin and cocaine before he turned eighteen,but neither of those will suffice to support jurisdiction.the government had the burden of introducing at trial,and highlighting on appeal,specific pieces of evidence,with dates,tying rodríguez or his to the possession or distribution of heroin and cocaine at the drug point after august,when rodríguez was released from juvenile detention it has failed to do so.for the reasons discussed above,that omission is fatal,and the court thus lacked jurisdiction over rodríguez with respect to the heroin and cocaine counts.see vargas de jesús,at.
having reached that conclusion,we need not address in any detail rodríguez claim that the district court failed to instruct the jury that it could not hold rodríguez liable for the substantive acts of his unless the jury first found that those acts occurred after rodríguez turned eighteen.this claim now only applies to rodríguez convictions on the substantive crack and marijuana counts,since we are vacating his heroin and cocaine convictions.though rodríguez is correct,he failed to make the argument before the district court,so we review the instruction for plain error.see,meadows,at.rodríguez has not cleared the high hurdle of plain error review,because he has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the result of the district court proceeding would have been different.see united states dominguez benitez,vargas de jesús,at.though certainly not overwhelming,the evidence was sufficient to support rodríguez convictions on the crack and marijuana counts,regardless of the omitted instruction.see vargas de jesús,at affirming conspiracy conviction despite lack of jury instruction under plain error standard of review,because evidence was sufficient.
we thus affirm rodríguez convictions on counts one,three,and five,and vacate his convictions on counts two and four.that leaves only the question of whether to remand rodríguez case for resentencing.we choose to do so,because we find that the vacated counts may alter the dimensions of the sentencing package,united states genao sánchez,cir,and that the district court should have the opportunity to consider whether a new sentence is warranted we therefore need not reach rodríguez remaining claim that the district court erred in calculating the amount of crack attributable to him as a result of his participation in the conspiracy.
rodríguez romero 
rodríguez romero raises two challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings.first,he argues that the district court should have allowed him to introduce what he characterizes as impeachment evidence.second,he claims that a portion of trial testimony was inadmissible hearsay and violated his rights under the confrontation clause.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,though we consider de novo whether the strictures of the confrontation clause have been met.united states vega molina,cir.where rodríguez romero failed to object at trial,we review for plain error.see,united states rodriguez,cir failure to object on hearsay grounds results in plain error review united states luciano,cir same for failure to object on confrontation clause grounds.finding no abuse of discretion,and no violation of the confrontation clause,we affirm.
the impeachment testimony 
rodríguez romero first argument is that the district court violated his constitutional right to present a complete defense by refusing to let him introduce extrinsic evidence that he claims could have impeached police officer víctor veguilla figuero.on october,veguilla arrested rodríguez romero with vials of crack outside a home in guayama,puerto rico.rodríguez romero had stopped in front of the house in a grey ford taurus veguilla testified that he received an instruction to arrest rodríguez romero from a colleague,officer pérez,who claimed to have witnessed rodríguez romero conducting a drug sale with a named david de león.on the same day,pérez arrested david de león.
at trial,rodríguez romero sought to introduce the testimony of tomasa colón pérez,david de león mother and the owner of the house in front of which rodríguez romero was arrested.the district court reviewed colon pérez testimony outside the presence of the jury.colon pérez offer of proof was that,on the evening of october,she was sitting outside her house when police officers ran into her house and arrested her son,david.she witnessed the officers handcuff her son,and then a female officer escorted her into a bedroom,where colon pérez remained for a period of time.she was allowed to exit the bedroom and kiss her son before the officers escorted him out of the house through the door in the back of the room which leads to the yard.the officers then brought colon pérez back into the bedroom.about two hours went by,according to colon pérez,at which point the officers standing in the bedroom with her said something to the effect of,it about to arrive.it about to arrive.a few minutes later,the officers said,it arrived.the car arrived.colon pérez then heard a voice in the house say,david,david.from the bedroom,she could not see who was speaking,nor could she identify the voice.colón pérez was inside her home,could not see outside,and did not witness rodríguez romero arrest.
though the offer of proof at trial was less than lucid,rodríguez romero attorney apparently sought to introduce colon pérez testimony in order to impeach veguilla by showing that officer pérez could not have witnessed david de león and rodríguez romero conducting a drug sale,because de león was already under arrest at that point and more generally,the events that day could not have transpired as veguilla claimed they had,since de león was arrested two hours before rodríguez romero.
rodríguez romero argument fails.colón pérez did not witness the arrest of rodríguez romero,which is the arrest veguilla conducted and about which he testified.colón pérez contradicted none of the specific events that veguilla described in his testimony.veguilla did not testify that the drug sale between de león and rodríguez romero occurred outside colón pérez house,that de león and rodríguez romero were immediately arrested following the sale or that de león was still present at the house when veguilla arrested rodríguez romero.nor did colón pérez see the car that was allegedly arriving such that she could establish that the activity she heard two hours after her son arrest was indeed the arrest of rodríguez romero.
rodríguez romero argues that the exclusion of colón pérez testimony denied him a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,a right the constitution guarantees,w hether rooted directly in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,or in the compulsory process or confrontation clauses of the sixth amendment.crane kentucky,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.yet a defendant right to present relevant evidence in his own defense is not unlimited,but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.united states scheffer.see also taylor illinois,the accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,privileged,or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.a witness can not testify to a matter unless there is evidence sufficient to support a finding that she has personal knowledge of the matter.we fail to see how colón pérez had sufficient personal knowledge to testify regarding rodríguez romero arrest,see,nor do we understand how her testimony would have been relevant to impeach veguilla,see.we thus affirm 
the alleged hearsay statement 
when asked why he arrested rodríguez romero on october,officer veguilla testified that officer pérez had witnessed rodríguez romero conducting a drug sale and had indicated to me that we were to intervene.pérez did not testify at trial and thus could not be.rodríguez romero second argument is that veguilla testimony was inadmissible hearsay and that the admission of that testimony violated rodríguez romero rights under the confrontation clause.rodríguez romero admits that plain error review applies to this claim,because he did not object to the testimony at trial,either on hearsay or confrontation clause grounds.rodriguez,at luciano,at.
there was no error,because veguilla testimony was not hearsay.the government offered pérez statement to explain why veguilla had arrested rodríguez romero,not as proof of the drug sale that pérez allegedly witnessed.statements providing directions from one individual to another do not constitute hearsay.united states bailey,cir.and we need not address rodríguez romero confrontation clause argument.first,the argument is completely undeveloped in rodríguez romero brief,and he has thus abandoned it.see united states zannino,cir.second,even if we were to address the argument,and assuming that pérez statement qualifies as testimonial,the confrontation clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.crawford washington,citing tennessee street.
finding no merit to rodríguez romero claims,we affirm.
lópez capó 
lópez capó,who was alleged to be one of the owners of the crack distributed at carioca,was found guilty of counts one and three the conspiracy count and the substantive count of possessing crack with the intent to distribute it.in addition to the claim addressed above,lópez capó challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him and argues that the district court erred by admitting hearsay statements of his admitting evidence of his relation to a known drug dealer admitting evidence of a riot that occurred in carioca failing to give the jury a multiple conspiracy instruction imposing a enhancement for obstruction of justice imposing a enhancement under a and sentencing him to months imprisonment,which he claims was not a reasonable sentence.we affirm on all counts 
the sufficiency of the evidence 
lópez capó first argues that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he participated in the drug conspiracy.we review de novo the district court denial of lópez capó rule motion,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.pérez meléndez,at.a defendant challenging his conviction for insufficiency of the evidence faces an uphill battle.united states hernández,cir.we will affirm if a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty of every element of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.pérez meléndez,at.
to prove conspiracy,the government must show that a conspiracy existed the defendant knew of the conspiracy and the defendant voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.united states bristol martir,cir.to prove that the defendant belonged to and participated in the drug conspiracy,the government must show two kinds of intent intent to agree and intent to commit the substantive offense.id.quoting hernández,at.the government can meet its burden with direct or circumstantial evidence.united states sepulveda,cir.lópez capó makes a general allegation,supported by little argumentation and almost no case law,that the government failed to prove that he knew of an agreement to distribute drugs in carioca.
we have recounted above just a portion of the evidence that a conspiracy to distribute drugs existed at carioca from to.the first element of the conspiracy test was undoubtedly met.the evidence was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that lópez capó knew of that conspiracy and voluntarily participated in it.first,heriberto garcía román testified that lópez capó supplied the drug point with crack and that he had seen lópez capó deliver crack to another drug point employee.second,leonardo martínez de león identified lópez capó as a runner of cocaine,crack,and heroin at the drug point and said that he had personally dealt drugs with lópez capó.martínez de león also testified to having seen lópez capó at the drug point several times,delivering drugs and collecting money and tallies.third,yamil irizarry lucas identified lópez capó as the supplier of crack for the drug point and testified that,on two occasions,he had picked up hundreds of vials of crack from lópez capó for sale at carioca.
it is not for us to weigh this evidence or to make credibility determinations.hernández,at.a reasonable jury could have found lópez capó guilty of every element of the conspiracy count beyond a reasonable doubt.pérez meléndez,at.
the alleged hearsay statements 
lópez capó next claim is that various statements made by his and admitted at trial were inadmissible hearsay.because lópez capó preserved his challenge to the district court admission of these statements,we review for abuse of discretion.vázquez botet,at.finding none,we affirm.
lópez capó argues that the district court erred by admitting four statements,one made by garcía román and three made by martínez de león.garcía román testified that suki and cesar,the alleged owners of the drug point,had told him that lópez capó brought drugs to carioca from the metropolitan area.martínez de león testified that edwin casiano roque,another,had instructed him to collect the tallies for lópez capó casiano roque had told him that lópez capó lived in the metropolitan area and suki had said that lópez capó cooked better crack than cesar 
statements made by a defendant during and in furtherance of the conspiracy do not qualify as hearsay under federal rule of evidence d e.a district court faced with a challenge to the admission of a statement must provisionally admit the statement and then wait until the end of the trial to consider whether,in light of all the evidence,the following four conditions are satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence a conspiracy existed the defendant was a member of the conspiracy the declarant was also a member of the conspiracy and the declarant statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.vázquez botet,at united states petrozziello,cir.
addressing the first two elements of the test,we have outlined the evidence that a conspiracy to distribute drugs operated at carioca and that lópez capó was a member of that conspiracy.we thus need only address whether the declarants were also members of the conspiracy and whether their statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.the declarants statements alone can not satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard there must be some independent corroboration to allow admission.united states portela,cir.evidence other than the statements themselves established by a preponderance of the evidence that all of the declarants at issue suki,cesar,and casiano roque were members of the conspiracy.multiple witnesses identified suki and cesar as of the drug point and testified to their activity at the drug point.as for casiano roque,martínez de león testified that casiano roque had paid him per week as a runner,and officer veguilla testified to having arrested casiano roque with rodríguez romero during a drug sale.
the evidence was also sufficient for the district court to find that all of the relevant statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.when suki and cesar told garcía román that lópez capó brought drugs to carioca,those were statements identifying other members of the conspiracy,made in furtherance of the conspiracy.see united states pelletier,cir.casiano roque statement instructing martínez de león to collect the tallies from the sellers was a statement related to the operation of the conspiracy,made in furtherance of the conspiracy.see united states rodríguez vélez,cir.since martínez de león knew that the crack for the drug point was supplied from the metropolitan area,casiano roque statement that lópez capó lived in the metropolitan area was a statement related to the inventory of the drug point,made in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.finally,suki statement to martínez de león that lópez capó cooked better crack than cesar was a statement identifying other members of the conspiracy,again made in furtherance of the conspiracy.pelletier,at.
the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the statements of lópez capó.
the other evidentiary rulings 
lópez capó also argues that he was unfairly prejudiced when the district court allowed the government to question him about his relationship with his cousin,a known drug dealer,when lópez capó took the stand and admitted evidence of a riot at carioca at which lópez capó was not present.again,we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see,vega molina,at.
federal rule of evidence allows a district court to exclude relevant evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.because rule judgments are typically battlefield determinations,and great deference is owed to the trial court superior coign of vantage,only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states bunchan,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.this is not such an instance.
the district court allowed the government to ask lópez capó two questions regarding his familial relationship with alexander capo trujillo during its of lópez capó.first,the government asked whether lópez capó knew trujillo lópez capó responded that he did.second,the government asked what lópez capó relationship with trujillo was lópez capó responded that trujillo was his cousin.on appeal,lópez capó argues that these questions were irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because trujillo was a drug kingpin and a well known federal fugitive whose names sic was in the puerto rico press with great frequency.thus,lópez capó argues,the questions made more credible the possibility that lópez capó was a member of a drug conspiracy.the district court found the evidence admissible after the government explained that it had reason to believe that lópez capó had inherited all the contacts of alex trujillo once alex trujillo got arrested by the federal government.the record establishes that the court considered both the relevance and the prejudicial effect of the evidence,and we find no abuse of discretion in the court decision to admit it.furthermore,while this is not the kind of extraordinarily compelling circumstance in which we might reverse a district court rule judgment,even if it were,any error would likely be harmless,given the ample evidence against lópez capó.see united states piper,cir an error is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.
nor did the district court abuse its discretion by allowing police officer pedro flores sánchez to testify about a riot that occurred at carioca in september.the government argued that the riot evidence was relevant to show the dangerousness of carioca,in support of count six of the indictment conspiring to use firearms to carry out drug crimes,and we agree.flores sánchez did not testify that lópez capó was present at the riot,or that he was in any way associated with the riot.we thus fail to see how lópez capó could have been prejudiced by the testimony.see.
the multiple conspiracy instruction 
next,lópez capó argues that the district court erred by refusing to give the jury a multiple conspiracy instruction,which would have allowed the jury to find that lópez capó participated in a different conspiracy than díaz,rodríguez,and rodríguez romero.we review the district court decision not to provide the jury instruction for abuse of discretion.united states de la cruz,cir.
a district court should give a multiple conspiracy instruction when a reasonable jury could find more than one illicit agreement,or an illicit agreement other than the one charged,based upon the evidence put forward at trial.united states balthazard,cir.we will reverse a district court decision not to provide a multiple conspiracy instruction only if the defendant can show that he suffered substantial prejudice.de la cruz,at.in the context of alleged multiple conspiracies,the defendant main concern is that jurors will be misled into attributing guilt to a particular defendant based on evidence presented against others who were involved in a different and separate conspiratorial scheme.united states brandon,cir.
it was only after the district court finished instructing the jury that díaz requested a multiple conspiracy instruction,and lópez capó joined in that request.although lópez capó did submit a written request for a jury instruction,asking the court to instruct the jury regarding the weight they should give his criminal record,that motion contained no mention of a multiple conspiracy instruction.lópez capó motion belies his claim that the court gave him no opportunity to request the multiple conspiracy instruction,which is his excuse for failing to comply with federal rule of criminal procedure.
because we find that lópez capó claim fails on its merits,however,we need not decide whether lópez capó forfeited that claim as a result of his failure to comply with rule.see,united states upton,cir the right to a jury instruction can be waived by not requesting the instruction,or not objecting at the proper time.lópez capó has pointed to no evidence in the record indicating that a reasonable jury could have found that he participated in an illicit agreement other than the one charged.rather,the evidence established that lópez capó participated in the very same conspiracy to distribute drugs at carioca as his.
lópez capó seems to argue that a multiple conspiracy instruction was necessary because the evidence failed to establish that he participated in the carioca drug point in even assuming that is true,we do not see why it would necessitate a multiple conspiracy instruction.a conspiracy with a continuity of purpose and a continued performance of acts is presumed to exist until there has been an affirmative showing that it has terminated.united states elwell,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the trial testimony established that this conspiracy operated continuously between and and that lópez capó was active in the drug point at least in and.lópez capó has put forward no evidence that he acted affirmatively either to defeat or disavow the purposes of the conspiracy in.united states juodakis,cir.nor does he provide any support for his conclusory claim that the lack of a multiple conspiracy instruction made it difficult for the jury to believe his testimony and arguments that he was not involved in the conspiracy.there was no abuse of discretion.
the alleged sentencing errors 
finally,lópez capó argues that the district court committed four errors at sentencing.we review the district court factual findings made at sentencing for clear error.united states shinderman,cir.we review the reasonableness of the defendant resulting sentence for abuse of discretion.gall united states,united states bunchan,cir.
at sentencing,the district court found that lópez capó was responsible for at least kilograms of crack,which resulted in a base offense level of.see c amended the court then added two enhancements one for obstruction of justice,see,and one for drug activity near a protected area,see a,which yielded an adjusted offense level of.using a chc of iii,the court determined that lópez capó sentencing guideline range was months to life.the court imposed a sentence at the bottom of that range months thirty years of imprisonment,followed by ten years of supervised release.
first,lópez capó argues that the district court committed clear error by applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice.the sentencing guidelines allow the court to increase a defendant offense level by two points if he has willfully obstructed justice,which includes perjury,united states dunnigan.a defendant commits perjury when he intentionally gives false testimony under oath on a matter material to the proceedings.shinderman,at.to impose an enhancement for perjury,the sentencing court must make an independent finding that the elements of perjury have been satisfied.id.
the district court here applied the enhancement after concluding that lópez capó testimony had been a complete fabrication.the court findings sufficed to establish that the elements of perjury were met.id.lópez capó testimony occurred under oath,in court,and he addressed various matters material to the proceedings.id.the court found that lópez capó had intentionally fabricated his testimony in an attempt to convince the jury that he had been a student,living off little amounts,just making ends meet,who knew none of the cooperating witnesses and only traveled to carioca to see his mother.lópez capó had lied through his teeth,the court found,by portraying a world different from carioca,the world in which he participated,and the world he was supplying narcotics to.when lópez capó attorney asked,at sentencing,for the specific instances in which lópez capó had lied,the court responded,h is whole testimony was a big lie.having reviewed the record,we can not say we disagree.where a district court finds that a defendant has fabricated his entire testimony,the court need not delineate every specific instance in which the defendant lied.but here,the court did specifically mention lópez capó visual expressions and demeanor on the stand,as well as his financial records,which the court found were totally at odds with the testimony that he was portraying.we give those credibility assessments reasonable latitude.shinderman,at.there was no clear error.
second,lópez capó argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level for committing a drug offense near a protected area,pursuant to a.lópez capó bases this challenge on the government alleged failure to establish the foot requirement or the existence of a protected area.as discussed above,we reject that argument.the evidence was sufficient for the jury,and the district court,to conclude that the relevant activity occurred within feet of a protected area.as the court stated at sentencing,it was evident from the evidence that the drug point operated on top almost of the children playground and that the drug offenses occurred in the public housing project.again,there was no clear error.
third,lópez capó claims that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court included two recency criminal history points when calculating his chc,as was then required by e,which was subsequently amended the government brief entirely fails to address this argument.in lópez capó investigation report psi,the probation office assigned him three criminal history points as a result of his prior criminal activity,to which the probation office added two points because lópez capó had committed the instant offense fewer than two years after being released from prison.see e amended.five criminal history points resulted in a chc of iii,which is what the court used to calculate lópez capó sentence.lópez capó argues that he should only have been assigned two criminal history points,which would have resulted in a chc of ii.
lópez capó was sentenced on april.the sentencing commission had voted earlier that month,on april,to eliminate the recency points required by section e,but the proposed amendment amendment did not become effective until november.see united states adams,cir.amendment is not retroactive.see c.and while we have previously remanded cases for reconsideration of a sentence in light of a later amendment to the guidelines even where that amendment had not been made retroactive,we have chosen not to do so where the district court was made aware at sentencing of the proposed guideline amendment and was unmoved by the prospect of the elimination of the recency points.adams,at.lópez capó filed objections to the psi,which included notification to the court that the sentencing commission had proposed to amend section e,and he reiterated at sentencing his objection to the chc calculation.lópez capó has not distinguished adams or provided us with any reason to believe that a different result would follow on remand.see id.there was no abuse of discretion.
fourth,lópez capó argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not properly consider the a factors to determine whether a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines was warranted.this argument seems to have two prongs the district court failed to adequately explain why it was denying lópez capó request for a downward departure and lópez capó received much shorter sentences than he did.both claims fail.
addressing the first contention,particularly where the district court sentences a defendant within the guideline range,as was the case here,the court explanation of the sentence need not be precise to the point of pedantry,united states turbides leonardo,cir,and brevity is not to be confused with inattention,id.at.lópez capó provides no actual support for his claim that it is fair to say that there is no evidence that the district court examined the factors in a through.our review of the sentencing hearing transcript reveals that the district court considered the psi,as well as the arguments of both lópez capó and the government.the court carefully explained its calculation of lópez capó offense level,choosing for the sake of being fair to attribute kilograms of crack to lópez capó,though the court had no doubt that lópez capó was responsible for at least kilograms of crack.the court then rejected the government request for a sentence at the upper end of the guideline range meaning life imprisonment,found that t he guidelines,although advisory,adequately reflect the nature of the offence and the characteristics,and noted that the defendant has not given the court any explanation other than the fact that we have the wrong person basically,that he did do it.thus,the court found that there was nothing on th e record that would lead it to give lópez capó the benefit of a different calculation under a.we find the explanation adequate.see rita united states,w hen a judge decides simply to apply the guidelines to a particular case,doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.turbides leonardo,at.
we also reject lópez capó claim that his sentence was unreasonable because he received a longer sentence than any of his.first,lópez capó provides no argumentation or case law in support of the assertion.see zannino,at i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.second,lópez capó raised this issue at sentencing,arguing that rodríguez had only received a sentence of months.the district court responded that rodríguez had started with the same base offense level as lópez capó but had a lower chc and fewer enhancements.w here the defendant own sentence has been justified and the basis for a lesser sentence is set forth or is apparent,no more precise calibration of the difference between them is customarily feasible,let alone required.united states mueffelman,cir.
