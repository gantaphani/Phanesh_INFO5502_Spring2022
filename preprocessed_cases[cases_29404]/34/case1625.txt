christopher jude blauvelt appeals from his conviction and sentence for production of child pornography,see a and e possession of child pornography,see a b and b possession of cocaine,see a and two counts of distributing a controlled substance to a minor,see a and a.having considered his numerous challenges,we affirm.
on january,erin ruley received a call from anne bridges.bridges claimed that appellant christopher blauvelt,ruley and the father of ruley child,had emailed bridges explicit photos of ruley sister by the time she contacted ruley,bridges had already deleted the photos from her computer.bridges,however,had also dated blauvelt,and she knew the password to his email account.bridges gave ruley the password,and ruley used it to access blauvelt email account.ruley found pictures in the account,including images of in pornographic poses,wearing a bra and thong underwear,and apparently snorting cocaine with a minor male,additionally,there was a image of a young female genital area.ruley recognized the interior of blauvelt home in the background of the photos.
ruley went to her mother linda home where again she accessed blauvelt email account and printed the pictures and a screen shot of blauvelt email inbox showing that the images were sent from blauvelt cell phone to his email account.after viewing the pictures,linda reported the incident to the baltimore county police department.around on january,officer minton arrived at linda home and interviewed ruley,and linda in person.officer minton viewed the images printed by ruley and confirmed with that she was indeed the girl shown in the pictures.ruley also showed officer minton blauvelt email account inbox on linda computer screen and indicated that she had printed the images sent to the inbox from blauvelt cell phone.officer minton did not independently verify ruley claim that the hotmail account and the cell phone number belonged to blauvelt.
officer minton then took ruley,and linda to the police station for an interview with detective ruffino of the vice unit and detective williams of the narcotics unit,the other minor pictured with in some of the photos,was also present for an interview.again identified herself as the girl in the photos,but she denied having any memory of the pictures being taken.claimed that he had taken the pictures of with blauvelt cell phone and then had returned the phone to blauvelt.the detectives concluded that could not have taken all of the pictures,however,because both and are visible in at least one photo.and explained that blauvelt had supplied them with cocaine,alcohol and psilocybin mushrooms.and,as she had done for officer minton,ruley again confirmed that the email address and cell phone number belonged to blauvelt.
officer minton and detectives ruffino and williams began preparing an application for a search warrant for blauvelt house based on these two interviews,the pictures printed by ruley,and the hotmail inbox viewed by officer minton.around,as the officers were still drafting the warrant application,officers cohen and hench were dispatched to observe blauvelt home,having been informed that the homeowner was suspected of committing child pornography offenses using his cell phone.the officers saw blauvelt leave the house at approximately and walk toward his vehicle.the officers stopped him,told him that he was not free to leave,that he was the subject of a criminal investigation,and that the police were in the process of applying for a search warrant for his house.officers cohen and hench did not place blauvelt in handcuffs,and did not at that time read blauvelt his miranda rights.blauvelt was then offered the choice of remaining outside until the warrant was signed or returning inside accompanied by the officers.officer hench testified that law enforcement took these steps as a means of maintaining the status quo until a search warrant was issued 
in these types of crimes where child pornography is supposedly taken and possessed,it was through electronic means,and the investigation said that a cell phone was possibly used,and this type of media can be destroyed rather easily.a cell phone could be destroyed,and the media on a cell phone or on the computer can be destroyed,and i was looking to preserve that evidence,along with the drug evidence.drug evidence can also be destroyed,disposed of.
blauvelt chose to wait inside with the officers,who performed a protective sweep of the house as they entered and then sat in the living room and waited for the search warrant.as they waited in blauvelt living room,additional officers arrived officer hench estimated that at one point as many as eight officers were present.blauvelt was allowed to use his cell phone however,he was required to place it on a table after use and the officers watched what he was doing with the phone.eventually,the warrant was signed at,about two and hours after blauvelt returned inside with the officers to wait.
the probable cause section of the application provided in relevant part 
on officer minton was dispatched to the home of ruley mother in reference to a sex offense report.upon arrival minton was met by erin ruley.she advised that she had just obtained nude and sexually explicit photographs of her sister,a minor at the time the photographs were taken.ruley then handed over five photographs of that were printed from a computer.ruley advised that these photographs were emailed to an acquaintance from a hotmail email address of mrjudeblack.com.ruley advised that this hotmail email address belongs to christopher jude blauvelt ruley has a child in common with blauvelt,and is in regular contact with him.during the interview ruley showed minton a hotmail email web page showing approximately five incoming emails to from.com.she further advised that is the cell phone number for blauvelt cell phone and verizon wireless is his cell phone service provider ruley advised that after receiving and viewing the photographs,she confirmed that her sister,was the subject in the pictures 
minton then interviewed.she identified herself as the female in the above photographs and advised that they were taken while at her friend christopher blauvelt house.
detective ruffino and detective williams responded to northpoint precinct and interviewed b.she advised that herself and a boy named had been picked up by blauvelt,and driven to his house where h e provided them with mixed alcoholic beverages and shrooms she advised that blauvelt had a large amount of cocaine and show ed her and how to snort the cocaine advised that after snorting the cocaine,she does remember anything else until she awakened at her own home 
the affidavit also described the detectives interview of recollection of their drug use was very similar to that of,however,also provided details about the explicit photos 
then walked into the living room,according to t,and told to come into the bedroom.said he then got up from the couch and went into the bedroom where was laying on the bed still only wearing her bra and thong underwear.said he asked christopher blauvelt for his cell phone,telling him that he was going to take pictures of.christopher blauvelt gave his camera cell phone,and took approximately pictures of as she performed a sexual act said that he put the camera cell phone belonging to christopher blauvelt back on the sofa,leaving the pictures that he had taken on the cell phone 
after being informed that the warrant had been signed,the officers read the warrant to blauvelt and informed him of his miranda rights,and blauvelt signed a written waiver form.law enforcement officers then conducted the search and seized numerous items,including blauvelt cell phone,a desktop computer,a media storage card,a digital camera,and a mirror and a straw.
when detectives ruffino and williams and officer minton arrived,they took blauvelt into a bedroom,closed the door and conducted an interview after that blauvelt understood the explanation of his miranda rights.blauvelt initially denied taking any pictures of himself and indicated that had taken all of the pictures.when the detectives,however,pointed out that was in some of the pictures and could not have taken them himself,blauvelt responded,oops.blauvelt also admitted himself the photographs of taken with his cell phone.
forensic analysis of the items seized during the search revealed video files containing child pornography on the desktop hard drive,sexually explicit images of,and four sexually explicit videos of on the media storage card.additionally,forensic testing revealed trace amounts of cocaine on the mirror and straw seized from blauvelt residence.
blauvelt was charged in a indictment as follows count production of child pornography in violation of a and e count possession of child pornography in violation of a b and b count distribution of a controlled substance cocaine to,a minor,in violation of a and a count distribution of a controlled substance psilocybin to,a minor,in violation of a and a count distribution of a controlled substance cocaine to,a minor,in violation of a and a count distribution of a controlled substance psilocybin to,a minor,in violation of a and a and count possession of cocaine in violation of a.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts except counts and alleging the distribution of psilocybin to and.blauvelt received a sentence.
blauvelt argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant for lack of probable cause.when considering a district court denial of a motion to suppress,this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.see united states blake,cir.even though we review de novo the district court denial of a suppression motion,the determination of probable cause by the issuing magistrate is entitled to great deference from this court.united states hodge,cir.essentially,this court duty is limited to ensur ing that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.id.quoting illinois gates.
although the concept of probable cause defies a precise definition,it exist s where the known facts and circumstances are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched.united states richardson,cir quoting ornelas united states.the issuing judge is tasked with mak ing a practical,common sense decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him,there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.gates,at.
blauvelt contends that the affiants failed to present the issuing magistrate with sufficient evidence to establish the reliability of the information supplied by ruley,particularly his cell phone number and email address.because law enforcement officers did not independently verify that the cell phone and email accounts belonged to him,blauvelt suggests that it was critical for the supporting affidavit to include information reflecting the credibility,veracity and reliability of ruley,the primary source of evidence against him.
relying on united states wilhelm,cir,blauvelt likens ruley to an unknown tipster whose information must be substantially corroborated to establish probable cause.in wilhelm,we held probable cause to be lacking for a search warrant premised solely on information supplied to police by an anonymous phone caller whom the attesting officer never met.see id.at.there,the only information supplied by the caller that could be corroborated prior to the search were directions to the defendant house,which was insufficient to cure a bare bones supporting affidavit 
upholding this warrant would ratify police use of an unknown,unproven little or no justify searching someone home 
the minimal corroboration provided in this case simply was insufficient.the conclusion that an informant is reliable and mature based only on brief telephone conversations is dubious,and the affidavit does not disclose any basis for proctor conclusion that her tipster was a concerned citizen.moreover,the only corroboration proctor provided was that the informant directions to wilhelm home were correct.almost anyone can give directions to a particular house without knowing anything of substance about what goes on inside that house,and anyone who occasionally watches the evening news can make generalizations about what marijuana looks like and how it is packaged and sold.
blauvelt attempt to force his case into the wilhelm fact pattern is clearly unavailing.most obviously,ruley is not an anonymous only did three officers meet with her and in person,but they did so twice.as we have previously explained,
t here is a substantial difference between an informant who deals with the authorities in person and an anonymous phone caller c ourts have had no difficulty distinguishing between cases involving encounters with informants and cases involving anonymous tipsters.unlike an anonymous tipster,an informant who meets with an officer provides the officer with an opportunity to assess his credibility and demeanor and also exposes himself to accountability for making a false statement.
united states perez,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,unlike the tipster in wilhelm,ruley provided information about blauvelt criminal activity that could not have been given by anyone who occasionally watches the evening news.wilhelm,f d at.also,the investigating officers corroborated ruley information by actually viewing both the images and the inbox for blauvelt email account,as well as confirming with that she was the girl appearing in the images and speaking with 
the ample evidence set forth in the supporting affidavit submitted with the warrant application afforded the magistrate a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause existed.as already mentioned,detectives ruffino and williams,as well as officer minton,personally viewed suggestive photos of in blauvelt apartment.likewise,the officers viewed pictures of and appearing to use cocaine in blauvelt apartment.officer minton viewed blauvelt email inbox and observed that the digital picture files had been sent from the same cell phone account which ruley identified as blauvelt.and,although law enforcement agents did not independently verify blauvelt ownership of these accounts before applying for the search warrant,they indicated in the supporting affidavit that ruley had a previous relationship and shared a child with blauvelt.additionally,the officers had corroborating statements that the pictures were taken with blauvelt phone in his house.this evidence was more than sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable prudence in the belief that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched.richardson,at quoting ornelas,at.
next,blauvelt argues that the district court erroneously denied his request for a hearing pursuant to franks delaware.in franks,the supreme court instructed that 
where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit,and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause,the fourth amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant request.
id.at.if the defendant is able to establish the 
allegation of perjury or reckless disregard and,with the affidavit false material set to one side,the affidavit remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause,the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.
in this case,blauvelt contends that the warrant affidavit omitted material facts rather than included false ones.he claims the affidavit should have disclosed,but did not disclose,that ruley and blauvelt were engaged in child support and custody litigation at or near the time of this incident that ruley had previously filed a complaint leading to blauvelt arrest for telephone misuse and that ruley herself had a criminal record,allegedly having been convicted for driving under the influence.this information,blauvelt claims,would have caused a reasonable reviewing magistrate to question ruley credibility and motives.
to satisfy the franks intentional or reckless falsity requirement for an omission,the defendant must show that facts were omitted with the intent to make,or in reckless disregard of whether they thereby made,the affidavit misleading.united states tate,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t he omission must be designed to mislead or must be made with reckless disregard of whether it would mislead.id.therefore,to succeed on his franks claim,blauvelt must 
make a substantial preliminary showing that the officers omitted material facts that when included would defeat a probable cause,the omission would have to be necessary to the finding of probable that the omission was designed to mislead or was made with reckless disregard of whether it would mislead.
id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
even though none of the officers had actual knowledge of the impeaching evidence against ruley,blauvelt insists its omission was intentional,or at least reckless,because the information was available to the officers had they looked.blauvelt contends that knowledge of the information is imputed to the officers applying for the warrant under the collective knowledge doctrine.see united states wells,cir.we disagree.the collective knowledge doctrine applies when at least some,but not all,of an investigative team has actual knowledge of facts necessary to a finding of probable cause.see id.a lthough the agent who actually seized the weapon pursuant to the supervising agent instructions had no personal knowledge that wells was a convicted felon,it is sufficient that the agents collectively had probable cause to believe the weapon was evidence of a crime at the time of the seizure.the knowledge is imputed from one officer to another such that the officers collectively are assumed to have actual knowledge of the imputed fact.but blauvelt argument goes too far.we have not applied this doctrine to impute knowledge of facts to an officer seeking a warrant merely because such facts are accessible to the law enforcement community at large.moreover,even if the warrant affidavit had included this impeaching information,there would still have been a sufficient basis,in light of the totality of the circumstances,for the issuing magistrate to make a finding of probable cause.indeed,probable cause was not based solely on the word of ruley.the actual pictures were produced during a meeting with the victim and corroborating statements from more than one witness were obtained.accordingly,we reject blauvelt franks argument.
blauvelt contends that his detention prior to the issuance of the search warrant constituted an illegal arrest and that the district court should have suppressed the incriminating statements he made while still in detention during the search of his home.see,kaupp texas,per curiam discussing the fourth amendment rule that a confession obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest may not be used against a criminal defendant internal quotation marks omitted.the government responds that it was constitutionally permissible for officers to hold blauvelt in custody for a reasonable time in order to prevent the destruction or removal of evidence while they applied for a search warrant.illinois mcarthur,permitting the seizure of a private residence for two hours until a search warrant could be obtained where police believed the suspect would destroy evidence unless restrained.
assuming without deciding that it was unlawful for law enforcement officers to detain blauvelt under these circumstances and that the district court should have suppressed blauvelt statements,we nevertheless conclude that such an error was harmless.see arizona fulminante,concluding that analysis applies to coerced or involuntary statements.the statements that blauvelt sought to exclude arguably constituted an admission that he illegally possessed and produced the child pornography images of.the minimal significance of blauvelt inculpatory statements becomes apparent when viewed in the context of the overwhelming evidence of his illegal activity,much of which was discovered through a subsequent forensic examination of blauvelt computer.through the testimony of dana mcalister,a computer forensic examiner for the baltimore county police department,the government identified video files containing child pornography that were stored on blauvelt computer hard drive in a folder created in association with limewire,a file sharing program.p networks permit users computers to communicate directly with each other,not through central servers.studios grokster.based on her experience as a computer forensic investigator,mcalister explained that the use of file sharing programs such as limewire is a common and popular means by which child pornography is shared.see generally jesse basbaum,inequitable sentencing for possession of child pornography a failure to distinguish voyeurs from pederasts,hastings,may though technology is most commonly associated with the sharing of copyrightable material,recent studies show that technology is increasingly popular for the dissemination of child pornography.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.
additionally,mcalister testified that video files and still images were recovered from a media storage card that was seized during the search of blauvelt home.the videos and stills showed a girl having sex with an adult male.during her testimony,confirmed that she was the girl in the videos and stills stored on the media card.although the man face was not visible,testified that the man in the videos and the stills was blauvelt and that blauvelt took the videos.identified the man voice on the videos as being blauvelt,whom she has known since the age of five.furthermore,the government presented the testimony of three adult women who had previously engaged in sexual activity with blauvelt and were able to identify him at trial as the man in the videos and stills with based on his voice,his genitals which bore no tattoo,and his mannerisms during intercourse.
in sum,there was overwhelming evidence that blauvelt possessed and produced child pornography.although the statements blauvelt made on the night of the search arguably undercut his identity defense based on the tattoo,the other evidence establishing blauvelt as the man in the videos and pictures with was so that it is clear to us beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same guilty verdict even without the statements.see united states forrest,cir explaining that the improper admission of evidence is harmless,if viewing the record as a whole,it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty absent the improperly admitted evidence internal quotation marks omitted.in light of the record as a whole,we conclude that the statements blauvelt sought to exclude had little effect compared to the compelling testimony from the victim herself and blauvelt former sexual partners that he was the man in the videos with and that he acquired the tattoo after the events in question.
finally,to the extent the statements evidenced blauvelt guilt with regard to the possession and distribution of cocaine to a minor,the evidence of blauvelt guilt on these charges was wholly.the government introduced physical evidence recovered in the search of blauvelt apartment,including a mirror coated with cocaine residue and a straw.the mirror was recovered from blauvelt bedroom,where the cell phone pictures of were taken.moreover,detective ruffino testified that the mirror was the same one appearing in the cell phone pictures of snorting cocaine.in addition,and both indicated that blauvelt gave them cocaine and alcohol among other things.again,we have little difficulty in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have reached the same guilty verdict even without blauvelt statements.
prior to trial,the government moved pursuant to federal rule of evidence b to introduce sexually explicit blauvelt made of himself masturbating and engaging in sexual re
