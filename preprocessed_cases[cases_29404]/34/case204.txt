around midnight on a january evening in,viggens guerrier and christian german ducked into a crack house at manchester street in manchester,new hampshire,looking for dwight bennett,a drug dealer who made a living taking crack from new york to new hampshire for sale there they found him,and an irate german then robbed him of and grams of crack at gunpoint while guerrier stood guard at the door.the backstory behind this the cliffsnotes version,at least is easily told.german was himself a drug dealer of some notoriety,and he and his partner,jay galeano,had agreed to let bennett sell crack out of that house to their clients,provided they got a piece of the action but bennett did not pay up,which is why german grabbed his old friend guerrier for extra muscle,just in case and strode into the crack house that fateful night,with a gun at the ready.
law enforcement later collared the duo,and,with german help,a jury convicted guerrier of conspiring to violate the hobbs act sometimes called the act,for easy reading a statute that among other things makes a federal crime out of robbery or conspiracy to rob that in any way or degree obstructs,delays,or affects interstate or international commerce.see a b.guerrier now appeals his conviction but not his sentence of years in prison plus years of supervised release,raising four issues,none of which requires reversal.
sufficiency of the indictment 
citing federal rule of criminal procedure b,guerrier moved pretrial to dismiss the indictment.prosecutors had produced no evidence during discovery that his acts had affected interstate commerce,leaving them unable to satisfy the act jurisdictional prerequisite or so he claimed.the district judge made quick work of guerrier motion,denying it in a margin order.and our de novo review of this legal issue,see,united states lopez lopez,cir,convinces us that the judge got the matter exactly right.
when grading an indictment sufficiency,we look to see whether the document sketches out the elements of the crime and the nature of the charge so that the defendant can prepare a defense and plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.see,united states eirby,cir.guerrier does not suggest that his indictment flunks this test.and his attempt to sink a facially valid indictment with a motion to dismiss that targets the strength of the government evidence misfires.
what counts in situations like this are the charging paper allegations,which we must assume are true.see,united states bohai trading,cir.consistent with that rule,courts routinely rebuff efforts to use a motion to dismiss as a way to test the sufficiency of the evidence behind an indictment allegations,see,united states moore,cir united states todd,cir united states salman,cir per curiam united states de laurentis,cir united states jensen,cir united states mann,cir even when the challenge centers on the adequacy of the evidence concerning the aspects of a hobbs act offense,see united states alfonso,cir stressing that unless prosecutors have made what can fairly be described as a full proffer of the evidence they intend to present at trial to satisfy the jurisdictional element of the offense,the sufficiency of the evidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment ultimately,we can do no better than repeat what the supreme court said in a related context over years ago in the ordinary course of events,a technically sufficient indictment handed down by a duly empaneled grand jury is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.costello united states.explaining that the fifth amendment guarantee does not give defendants the right to a preliminary trial to determine the competency and adequacy of the evidence undergirding the indictment.tellingly,guerrier cites no cases supporting his position,and,unsurprisingly,we know of none either.the net result is that the judge correctly denied guerrier motion to dismiss the indictment.
un mirandized statements 
guerrier also moved pretrial to suppress prearrest statements made during an interview with his parole officer and two agents.his argument was a simple one under the totality of the circumstances,they had had him in custody and therefore should have advised him of his miranda rights before they began asking questions.miranda arizona,d.guerrier did not testify at the suppression hearing.but the parole and officers did,and this is what they say happened,as credited by the judge and he committed no clear error in doing that,see,united states hughes,cir 
looking into the bennett robbery,officers heard that german and guerrier had probably done it.german was no stranger to police.they had pegged him as the chief culprit in a slew of other robberies,and they wanted guerrier to help nail him.having learned that guerrier was on parole from a prior offense,fbi special agent michael schneider asked guerrier parole officer,marc,to help set up an interview.and did what he could.
at guerrier next parole meeting,schneider and a colleague,manchester detective steven coco,showed up dressed in plain clothes with their weapons concealed and camped outside office while told guerrier that some men wanted to see him.then walked guerrier over to schneider and coco,who introduced themselves as agents.schneider calmly told guerrier that they wanted to speak with him about a matter unrelated to his parole status,that he was not under arrest,and that he did not have to talk to them if he did not want to.but if he was game,schneider added,they could chat over a cup of coffee in a more relaxed setting.guerrier said okay,or something to that effect.
the foursome schneider,coco,and guerrier got into schneider unmarked ford explorer.schneider drove,coco rode in the front passenger seat,and guerrier and sat in back.keeping the doors unlocked,schneider cruised to a dunkin donuts,about five minutes away from office.he bought guerrier a hot chocolate at the and then parked in a nearby parking lot.other people were milling about there.
turning to guerrier,schneider thanked him for taking the time out of his day to tag along with them and,in a way,said that they hoped he could help them with the bennett robbery.but schneider stressed to him that he did not have to say anything to them if he did not feel like it,that he was not under arrest,and that they would drive him wherever he wanted if he wanted out.guerrier piped in,saying that german had asked for his help in collecting some money,that he had driven him to manchester street,and that he had seen him take bennett into a bedroom.but he adamantly insisted that he knew nothing about a robbery.
that did not go over well with schneider,because some of what guerrier said clashed with what law enforcement knew.schneider was frustrated,though he stayed calm as he laid out for guerrier the evidence against him.actually,neither schneider nor the others ever yelled at guerrier or threatened to arrest him.also,guerrier never looked nervous or scared,and he never asked to stop the interview,which lasted to minutes.
once schneider realized that he was not getting anywhere with guerrier,he offered to drop guerrier off at a place of his guerrier choosing.then spoke up,saying that he still had to conduct his meeting with guerrier,so schneider drove them back to office.when their meeting ended,arrested guerrier for failing a drug test two months earlier and for visiting manchester street,a crack house.that was the first guerrier had heard about the failed drug test.and neither schneider nor coco knew that was going to arrest guerrier.
everyone pretty much knows that the miranda rule tells police not to question a suspect in custody unless they first advise him of his right to remain silent,among other things.miranda,at.accord stansbury california,d per curium.following the evidentiary hearing,the judge here concluded that miranda was not in play because the interview was not custodial and guerrier statements were completely voluntary,so he orally denied the motion.guerrier takes issue with this ruling.as always,we review the judge factfinding under the deferential standard as we mentioned above,but we give
