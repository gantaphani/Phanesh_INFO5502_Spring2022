opinion of the court 
a jury convicted jose ramon rivas of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine in violation of.the court,acting in part because of a prior drug offense for which rivas had been convicted,sentenced him to months in prison.rivas now appeals,arguing that his conviction is flawed by numerous alleged errors in his trial and that the district court erred in finding that the prosecution had properly filed and served upon rivas an information charging the prior drug conviction on the basis of which the government sought to enhance rivas sentence.for the reasons given below,we affirm.
background 
the government indicted rivas for conspiring with darrin culler and juan johnson to distribute crack,and for aiding and abetting darrin culler distribution of approximately grams of crack on august.the government case at trial can be divided into two parts the testimony of confidential informant charles mobley and his chief handler,philadelphia police officer ronald jones,who explained a sting operation involving four controlled purchases of crack cocaine near the corner of reed and streets in philadelphia,and the testimony of rivas alleged,who had pleaded guilty and were cooperating with the government.
mobley and jones described a series of crack purchases that occurred on april,june,august and september.mobley purchased the crack jones observed and searched mobley and his car before and after and observed the purchases,which were also videotaped.most of the transactions involved rivas alleged culler.mobley testified that on april he called culler and asked to buy an ounce and a half of crack he met culler in the block of reed street and exchanged buy money for crack.at.mobley similarly purchased two ounces of crack from culler on june.
mobley first implicated rivas in his testimony concerning an august,purchase.mobley testified that on that day he called rivas and ordered three ounces of crack.rivas agreed to supply it and selected the block of reed for the transaction.when mobley arrived,both rivas and culler were there.they walked to mobley car rivas got in and exchanged the crack for mobley buy money while culler stood at the driver window.then rivas and culler left.officer jones testified that from his vantage point he could see culler go to mobley driver side window and see rivas enter the car passenger door,but he could not see what was going on inside the car.app.at.the transaction was videotaped,but mobley admitted on that due to the camera angle the tape did not show rivas getting into mobley car.at.jones testified that when he met mobley after the buy,mobley gave him three ounces of crack.
mobley also testified that rivas set up,though did not physically participate in,a purchase on september.mobley called rivas and asked to purchase crack.rivas said that he could meet mobley himself,but that he would send someone named voo.mobley found someone matching voo description at the location mobley and rivas had agreed upon,and exchanged the buy money for the drugs.after the purchase,rivas called mobley to ask if everything had gone well with voo.rivas alleged johnson,nicknamed voo,confirmed his and rivas roles in the sale,testifying that the crack he delivered belonged to rivas and that he only made a small commission on the deal.app.at.at.
rivas responded by attacking the credibility of the government witnesses mobley,culler and johnson were all heavily impeached by their prior crimes and by lies they told about the details of those crimes while on the stand in the present case.rivas strategy made use of culler and johnson guilty plea agreements,which rivas introduced into evidence.the court instructed the jury that the guilty pleas of the coconspirators were not evidence of the guilt of any other person,including the defendant.app.at.the jury acquitted rivas of the aiding and abetting count,but convicted him of the conspiracy count.
at sentencing,the government sought to increase rivas statutory minimum sentence on the basis of a prior felony drug trafficking conviction.on november,a few weeks prior to the trial,the government filed an information charging the prior conviction as required by.after trial rivas moved to strike the information,contending that it had been neither filed nor served on him or his attorney in accordance with the governing law and rules of procedure.app.at.he claimed that the information was not filed within the meaning of because,among other things,it bore no signature,electronic or otherwise,and had failed to comply with a local order governing electronic filing.he also claimed that while the government had faxed the information to his counsel it was required to mail the information under applicable rules,and that his lawyers had never received a copy by mail.the government rejoined that any flaws in the information were excusable and that it had mailed the information as required,even if rivas counsel had not received it.
the court denied rivas motion to strike.it concluded that the clerk had properly excused any noncompliance with the local electronic filing order and that the government had mailed a copy of the information to rivas attorney.the court sentenced rivas to twenty years in statutory minimum to which he could be sentenced,given his prior conviction.see b a.
rivas now appeals,alleging that the court erred several times during trial by failing to strike testimony that rivas was a target of a drug investigation,by allowing the prosecution to purportedly vouch for its witnesses credibility,by improperly instructing the jury on the use of the alleged guilty pleas and by failing to grant a mistrial after the prosecutor suggested that defense counsel was attempting to distract the jury from important issues.he also appeals the denial of his motion to strike the information charging his prior conviction.
ii.discussion 
trial errors 
rivas alleges that his conviction was so heavily tainted by errors that it must be reversed despite his failure to timely object to almost all of the purported errors.generally,failure to object forfeits claims of error.in criminal cases we may always consider a plain error that affects substantial rights.b,but several hurdles must be cleared before the judgment is reversed.the defendant must show not only that error affected the outcome of the trial,but that the error was clear or obvious under current law.if these requirements are met,we may reverse,if the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,d united states olano,d.
in the present case,none of rivas claims establish reversible error.we discuss them in turn.
target testimony 
rivas first argues that officer jones testimony that rivas was the target of a drug investigation was improper hearsay and evidence.the government called jones as its first witness and used him to lay out the background of the controlled buys.jones explained that in the spring of he was investigating crack distribution in the block of reed street.he was then asked 
q who were the individuals or the people that ended up being the targets of your investigation beginning in april of what were their names 
a darrin culler,ramon rivas.there was one more,voo,juan johnson.app.at.
rivas argues that although the government purported to offer this evidence to help the jury understand the subsequent controlled buys,it in fact suggested to the jury that there was unseen evidence that rivas had committed earlier,uncharged drug crimes,violating the hearsay prohibition of federal rule of evidence and the evidence prohibition of rule b.prosecutors often abuse their right to show the jury the context of police behavior by unnecessarily suggesting that the police had evidence not presented to the jury that led them to believe the defendant was involved in crime.united states price,cir citing united states sallins,cir,cert.denied,d.testimony that the police targeted a defendant for an investigation into a specific type of offense is an example of such abuse.united states brown,cir holding that testimony that defendants were on a primary target list of drug dealers known to the sheriff department was prejudicial error.but see united states scarfo,cir holding that there is no error where the jury is not told that the defendant was being targeted or the nature of the crime.
the testimony rivas challenges here is quite difficult to distinguish from the target list testimony held inadmissible in brown if rivas was targeted in april it was probably because of information,possibly supplied by mobley,about earlier drug transactions.the government argues it did not ask whom the investigation targeted in april of,but rather who ended up being the target of the investigation app.at emphasis added,and that therefore the question served only to explain where jones story was going.but the question is ambiguous and the jury already knew where jones was going if it did not already have the targets names in the indictment,the prosecutor explained in its opening statement that it would hear evidence that the three sold crack to an informant.app.at.the absence of a legitimate reason for the question suggests the testimony was offered for an illegitimate one.sallins,at see also price,at holding that courts must exclude evidence not legitimately needed to explain the background of police behavior.
nonetheless,it does not matter whether the testimony was improper,because any error was not plain.the government at least suggested a possible legitimate reason for the question to put the controlled buys in context,indicating that the error was not plain.further,rivas bears the burden of demonstrating that the purported error affected the outcome of the trial,olano,at,and he has not done so.the government never referred back to the target testimony rivas claims that it may have briefly suggested in its opening statement that mobley had told the police incriminating facts about rivas,but any such suggestion is obscure and unlikely.even assuming there was a brief suggestion of evidence against rivas,the jury was instructed to disregard it.see app.at you must make your determination of the facts solely on the basis of the evidence you have heard and seen and not for any reason outside of this courtroom.id.at you should confine your considerations to the evidence presented from the witnesses and from any exhibits that have been admitted into evidence.we are not convinced that the target testimony affected the outcome of the trial,so any error can not be a ground of reversal.
vouching for witnesses 
next,rivas contends that the prosecution improperly vouched for the truthfulness of its witnesses.improper vouching occurs where a prosecutor suggests that she has reasons to believe a witness that were not presented to the jury.united states harris,cir united states,cir.by contrast,a prosecutor may urge that a witness is trustworthy by arguing from record evidence vouching occurs only where the prosecutor implicitly refers to information outside the record.united states walker,cir.
in the present case the prosecution properly argued that its witnesses were telling the truth.first,in its opening statement the prosecution described mobley decision to cooperate with the dea 
he decides to come forward and cooperate with the dea,provide the information he knows about other drug dealers and actively participate in this investigation.to help himself,sure.but also to give dea an accurate picture of what was going on in the streets with these sales that he was involved in.app.at.
rivas urges that the phrase accurate picture improperly vouched for rivas credibility,but we can not see why.the prosecution discussed mobley possible motives for cooperation and suggested that one of them was a pure moral interest in aiding law enforcement.there was no suggestion that the police cooperate only with honest witnesses,that the prosecution could assure the jury that mobley testimony would be accurate,or the like.
second,rivas argues that the prosecution vouched for johnson and culler in its closing argument when it said that they came here and they told you the truth about what happened.app.at.but again,the prosecution did not suggest it knew from evidence that johnson and culler were telling the truth.the conclusion was based upon an argument from their reluctance to speak and their demeanor,both of which the jury could observe for itself.id.the prosecution did not improperly vouch for its witnesses.
jury instructions on guilty pleas 
rivas claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the use of culler and johnson guilty pleas.the court instructed the jury that darrin culler and juan johnson may be considered to be alleged accomplices in this case.the fact that an alleged accomplice has entered a plea of guilt in this case,is not evidence of the guilt of any other person,including the defendant.app.at.
rivas argues that this instruction improperly permitted the jury to infer his guilt from the guilty pleas.although it is true that a jury may not do that,see united states universal rehabilitation servs.pa,cir united states gaev,cir,one is hard pressed to see how the instruction was unclear on this point given that it explicitly said the pleas were not evidence of rivas guilt.he suggests that the jury might have used this roundabout reasoning because the pleas are not evidence of the guilt of any other person,they must be evidence of culler and johnson guilt.but culler and johnson pleaded guilty to conspiring with rivas.universal,at roth,dissenting if two defendants allegedly conspired,and one defendant has been convicted or has pleaded guilty,the clear implication is that the other defendant is also guilty.aha,rivas hypothetical jury concludes,the pleas are therefore evidence that rivas is guilty,despite the clear instruction stating that they are not.to follow such reasoning the jury would have to possess an unlikely combination of shrewdness to invent the argument and obtuseness to ignore the obvious meaning of the instruction.we have previously held it was error to instruct the jury that although a guilty plea was not evidence of the defendant guilt,the plea could nonetheless be used as the jury saw fit in accordance with common sense,remaining studiously vague about what such a use would be.united states toner,cir see also universal,at roth,dissenting discussing toner.but that instruction clearly invited misuse of the pleas while paying to proper evidence law the alleged flaw in the present instruction is much less clear.
at any rate,even assuming there was error,there was no plain error.the parties only used the pleas appropriately,to impeach culler and johnson.having failed to object to the instruction below,the burden is on rivas to prove that the jury in fact adopted the unlikely reasoning described above.he has not done so.
prosecutorial misconduct 
finally,rivas argues that the prosecution improperly impugn ed the function and integrity of defense counsel during its closing argument.during his own closing,rivas attorney hammered mobley,culler and johnson for lies they had told the jury about details of their prior crimes,arguing that they were untrustworthy.during rebuttal closing,the prosecutor said 
in his closing argument,savino spent an awful lot of time discussing with you discrepancies and what he terms as mistruths and lies and differences in plea agreements and language.i will return the compliment to savino,he a very good advocate,he does his job well and his job is to take your focus off the issue.app.at.
unlike most of the errors rivas ascribes to the district court,he lodged a timely objection to this one,which was sustained.he then moved for a mistrial,which was denied.rivas argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial,a decision which we review for abuse of discretion.united states hakim,cir.
to find that the court abused its discretion in failing to order a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct,we must first be convinced that the prosecution did in fact misconduct itself.we are not the comment that defense counsel job is to take your focus off the issue was not,in this context,improper argument.rivas notes that no lawyer may make unfounded and inflammatory attacks on the opposing advocate,gov t of virgin
