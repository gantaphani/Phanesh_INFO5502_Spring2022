opinion of the court 
during the execution of two separate search warrants at properties that police believed were owned or occupied by defendant thomas steiner,police seized,among other things,a shotgun,and caliber ammunition,and gauge shotgun ammunition.as a result,steiner was indicted on two counts for being a of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.following a day trial,he was convicted on one count of of ammunition and sentenced to an month prison term.
during the trial,the government introduced into evidence the fact that a warrant had issued for steiner arrest on an unrelated charge.steiner appeals,contending that the district court improperly admitted evidence of the arrest warrant that was unrelated to the offenses he faced at trial.he also argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it was required to reach a unanimous verdict as to each type of ammunition seized.while we conclude that the admission of the unrelated arrest warrant was error,the error was harmless.we also conclude that the district court did not err when it declined to provide a unanimity instruction.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the conviction.
this case arises from a sting operation.in august,police informant timothy stants told pennsylvania state trooper thomas baumgard that thomas steiner,a convicted felon,was staying on his stants property and was on the run from law enforcement.stants also claimed that steiner had a shotgun,which steiner had described to him as a cop killer,and that steiner said he would use the gun to avoid being arrested.stants claimed that the shotgun would be found in a camper on stants property.
based on stants tip,baumgard obtained a search warrant for the camper.before executing the warrant on august,baumgard paid stants for his help in securing steiner arrest and told stants to drive steiner to a nearby gas station.there,officers would be waiting to arrest steiner on a warrant that had issued for steiner arrest for failure to appear at a preliminary hearing scheduled that same day,on an unrelated sexual assault charge.baumgard conducted his search of the camper in the afternoon,just after stants drove steiner away to the gas station.he found among other things a shotgun loaded with six rounds of gauge shotgun ammunition,a wallet containing various documents,all bearing steiner name,and a discharged shotgun shell.soon after the search,baumgard ordered steiner arrested on the warrant issued for his failure to appear at the preliminary hearing earlier that day.at the time of his arrest,steiner was in stants car at a nearby gas station.
apparently,there was more to the story than the gun and ammunition found in the camper.stants also told police that he had seen the missing pieces of the shotgun part of the barrel and stock at a home that steiner supposedly owned,located at meadow avenue the home or the meadow avenue home.based on stants tip,police obtained another search warrant,this time for the home.
police executed the search warrant for the home on august.when they arrived,they entered the basement of the home,which was in disarray there,they found a shotgun stock on the bar and a shotgun barrel in the ceiling where a tile was missing also,they discovered a hacksaw and pipe wrenches on the basement floor and a single gauge shotgun shell in a pocket of the pool table.four other gauge shotgun shells were found in a bowl,on top of which was steiner notice of impending warrant of arrest.in addition to the shotgun ammunition,the police also discovered a variety of other types of ammunition,including rounds of caliber ammunition and rounds of special ammunition.
based on the shotgun and ammunition found in the camper,a grand jury charged steiner with one count of being a of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.a superseding indictment was filed several months later,adding a second count charging steiner with a violation of g based on the ammunition found in the home.
a.the trial 
the government case against steiner proceeded to a jury trial at trial,steiner stipulated to having a prior felony conviction.he testified in his own defense and denied that he ever owned or possessed the shotgun or ammunition seized from either the camper or the basement of the home.steiner also acknowledged that he owned the wallet found in the camper and admitted that he owned the meadow avenue home at some point in.
steiner,greta steiner,was called as a witness.she testified that although she had been living at a different address in,she occasionally stopped at the meadow avenue home to retrieve her belongings.she also testified that during these visits she saw neither firearms nor ammunition in the home but she recalled having stored boxes of antique ammunition that belonged to her deceased in the home garage.she denied that anyone ever brought the ammunition into the home and claimed that steiner was unaware of the ammunition.neither steiner nor the government presented evidence about whether the ammunition stored in the garage may have been moved to the basement.
mark williams,stants close friend,testified for the government.williams claimed that he had been inside steiner home in august because he was interested in purchasing the property at that time,williams said that he noticed the shotgun barrel and the hacksaw laying on a homemade bar and pointed them out to stants.williams also claimed that steiner told him that he would go easy if the police tried to arrest him.
stants also testified.he denied receiving any benefit for his help in securing steiner arrest,despite baumgard testimony that he had paid stants for his assistance.he also corroborated williams testimony regarding the basement of the home and admitted that he had visited steiner home twice in steiner absence.
the government arrest warrant evidence 
during steiner trial,the government introduced the arrest warrant that had issued based upon steiner failure to appear on the sexual assault charge.the government argued that the arrest warrant though not the underlying conduct,was admissible to show that steiner was on the run from law enforcement at the time,hiding out in this trailer,and was intending to evade the warrant and not appear at the preliminary hearing because t hat what led officers to his trailer in the first place.the government claimed that the arrest warrant complete d the story because it was background of what led law enforcement to steiner to begin with in this case.however,this was not true.stants tip regarding the shotgun was the actual source of the government initial interest in steiner.the district court,relying on the government representation,admitted the arrest warrant evidence as background under federal rule of evidence b.the court reasoned that,as long as the underlying conduct was not admitted,any prejudice to steiner was minimized.the court,though,expressly rejected any argument that the evidence could be admitted to prove steiner motive or intent under rule b.
the district court jury instruction on unanimity 
the government requested that the jury be instructed that although the defendant was charged with possessing ammunition in different varieties or from different locations,it need not unanimously agree on which ammunition he possessed to convict him of felony possession under g.steiner objected and requested that the jury be instructed that it must agree as to which ammunition steiner possessed,adding the indictment was confusing.the district court adopted the government position and instructed the jury that unanimity was not required with respect to the firearm or ammunition.specifically,the court stated 
although all jurors must agree with respect to count that the defendant possessed a firearm or ammunition and with respect to count that the defendant possessed different ammunition,you need not all agree on the exact item possessed.for example,if a defendant was charged with possessing one piece of ammunition found in the bedroom,one piece of ammunition found in the living room,and one piece of ammunition found in the basement,you must all unanimously agree that the defendant possessed at least one piece of ammunition in order to convict.you do not have to agree on which one or if he possessed more than one.
therefore,it would be sufficient if ten jurors determined that he possessed one piece of ammunition in the bedroom,one juror determined that he possessed one piece of ammunition found in the basement,and one juror determined that he possessed them all.in other words,if the defendant is alleged to have been in possession of ammunition of different varieties or from different locations,you must all find that as to the ammunition charged in each count he possessed at least some ammunition as charged in that count in order to convict,but need not all agree with respect to a count on exactly which ammunition was actually possessed as charged in that count 
the jury found steiner not guilty on count one charging possession of the gun and ammunition in the camper,but guilty on count two charging possession of the ammunition found in the meadow avenue home.
ii.discussion 
admission of the arrest warrant 
first,steiner argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence of the arrest warrant that had issued for his failure to appear at a preliminary hearing on an unrelated charge.the district court stated during the in limine hearing on the admissibility of the arrest warrant,and memorialized in its minute entry,that its decision rested on rule b grounds based on the government representations,the court admitted the evidence as background or to complete the story of the crime.
steiner argues that,while courts in this circuit have occasionally admitted evidence under rule b for the purpose of completing the story or providing background,they have also generally limited the use of those purposes to conspiracy cases.in response,the government asserts that the arrest warrant was properly admitted under rule b because it identified a proper purpose for the evidence it was necessary to provide background and complete the story of steiner arrest,interrogation,and the police investigation of the crimes charged.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court erred by admitting the arrest warrant.
admission of the arrest warrant under rule b 
we review the district court evidentiary rulings principally on an abuse of discretion standard,which occurs only when the district court decision is arbitrary,fanciful,or clearly unreasonable in short,where no reasonable person would adopt the district court view.we have plenary review,however,of the district court rulings to the extent they are based on a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.this includes plenary review of whether evidence falls within the scope of rule b.
rule b provides that evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove character or demonstrate action in conformity with those acts evidence,though,may be admitted for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.to be admissible,evidence must satisfy the test set forth in huddleston.united states as the supreme court stated there,the proffered evidence must be offered for a proper purpose under rule b relevant to that purpose sufficiently probative under the rule balancing requirement and accompanied by a limiting instruction,if requested and,unless the reason is apparent from the record,a mere list of the purposes found in rule b is insufficient.indeed,t he district court must put a chain of inferences into the record,none of which is the inference that the defendant has a propensity to commit this crime.
in united states green,we concluded that allowing the jury to understand the circumstances surrounding the charged crime completing the story is a proper,purpose under rule b.we also stated that evidence is admissible to supply helpful background information to the finder of fact.with all of this in mind,one might ask is not all evidence helpful to providing background to the factfinder the answer is yes.but not all helpful evidence is relevant to a proper purpose under rule b.
in fact,steiner is correct that the majority of criminal cases in which we have deemed background a proper purpose involve conspiracies and there is no conspiracy involved in this case.also,in at least one opinion that preceded our decision in green,we specifically warned that,while courts have occasionally admitted prior crimes evidence as background,this label is uninformative at best and,at worst,can be an unacceptable substitute for the analysis required by rule b.
there are unique characteristics that render background a proper purpose for admitting evidence in conspiracy cases.for instance,in proving the existence of a conspiracy,a court might allow a party to present background evidence revealing an ongoing relationship between likewise,this court affirmed the admission of background evidence to help the jury understand one conspirator role in a complex scheme but neither of those models applies in this case.
here,steiner is the only defendant.there was no need for the government to explain a complicated back story.we are not suggesting that conspiracy cases are the only ones in which background facts may be admissible as b evidence.we are saying that,when the information needed to understand what happened in a case is straightforward and easily understood without reference to facts that do not bear on the charged offense,forcing extraneous and potentially prejudicial information into the record in the name of background is not defensible under rule b.that,unfortunately,is what happened here.stants tip entirely explained why the government was focusing on steiner.in fact,the arrest warrant evidence was completely irrelevant to the government case we therefore find this case to be sufficiently distinct from cases in which background evidence may be admissible under rule b.
in green,by contrast,we concluded that the background information evidence that defendant threatened to kill a police officer was properly admitted under rule b because it fit into a logical chain of inferences and explained why the defendant was under investigation for the crime charged,attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine we also held that the information was properly admitted for the purpose of proving the informant motive to cooperate,which was put at issue by the defendant we therefore find green distinguishable insofar as the evidence there served to complete the story of the crime charged.here,we conclude that evidence of the outstanding arrest warrant on the unrelated sexual assault charge had nothing whatsoever to do with steiner charged crime of felony possession of a weapon or ammunition under g.
again,to be clear,we do not conclude that any evidence offered for the purpose of providing background is only admissible in conspiracy cases.there may and likely will be other situations in which such evidence is admissible outside of the conspiracy context.nor do we venture to paint the absolute contours of when evidence may be admissible to provide background under rule b.we simply conclude that,on these facts,the district court abused its discretion by admitting the arrest warrant evidence for the purpose of providing background.
to be sure,the district court was not entirely,or even primarily,to blame for its error.the government played a central role.here,the prosecutor wrongly asserted that the government needed the unrelated arrest warrant to prove that steiner was guilty of felony possession.yet it is clear to us that the government did not need the arrest warrant to try a case against steiner at all.the government had stants tip,stants and williams testimony that steiner owned the home in and possessed a shotgun,and a stipulation that steiner was a felon.taken together,this evidence strongly supported the government theory that steiner unlawfully possessed the firearm and ammunition.the only purpose the arrest warrant served was to improperly suggest that steiner was predisposed to commit criminal acts.
in sum,we are deeply troubled by the government inaccurate claim that the arrest warrant was what led offic
