defendant lyubov groysman or groysman or lyubov appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,following a jury trial before sterling johnson,judge,convicting her of conspiring to commit health care fraud,in violation of,and conspiring to commit money laundering,in violation of h,a a i,and a b i.groysman was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and was ordered to forfeit.on appeal,she contends principally that the main government witness gave testimony that included inadmissible hearsay and inadmissible opinions,and was allowed,without personal knowledge,to provide the foundation for the admission of seven government exhibits gx that were not admissible under the federal rules of evidence and that were inaccurate and misleading.the government concedes these errors but contends that they either were harmless or were not so harmful as to meet the standard for plain error.finding admission of the challenged exhibits and much of the main government witness testimony seriously prejudicial error,we conclude that groysman conviction should be vacated and her case remanded for a new trial.in light of this decision,we need not reach other arguments made by groysman on this appeal.
background 
the present prosecution arose out of an investigation by the federal bureau of investigation fbi,the department of homeland security dhs,the internal revenue service irs,and the new york city police department nypd into schemes by suppliers of durable medical equipment or dme,such as neck braces,knee supports,and bed boards prescribed for patients,to submit fraudulent reimbursement claims to insurance companies.in this type of scheme,a dme retailer would procure from a wholesaler an invoice that bore inflated prices for the listed equipment and give the wholesaler a check for the total the retailer would bill an insurance company for the inflated total and the wholesaler would return to the retailer part of the difference between the stated price and the actual amount paid by the retailer.
the government investigation resulted in the june arrests and indictment of numerous persons,including groysman.groysman and one codefendant,vladimir khmelnitski,were tried together on the indictment charging health care fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.at their day trial,the government called nine witnesses whose testimony related to groysman or to the companies by which she was employed,including two cooperating witnesses the cooperators or informants grigory groysman or grigory,who is not related to lyubov groysman,and vadim yuzovitskiy.the government main witness was dhs special agent semyon ginzburg,who had run the latter stages of the investigation and who testified on the first four days of trial attended by the jury.
a.the testimony of special agent ginzburg 
agent ginzburg testified that he became involved in the health care fraud investigation into dme companies in january.prior to his involvement,grigory and yuzovitskiy,dme wholesalers who had long been engaging in fraudulent schemes,had learned that a participant in their dme schemes had been arrested,and they had voluntarily surrendered to federal authorities and agreed to assist in the investigation.after ginzburg became involved,he conducted a street operation by having the cooperators monitored by himself and others continue their dealings with suspects but with the goal of collecting evidence for the authorities.
all conversations on the cooperators telephone lines were recorded.and initially,for meetings with the suspects,the cooperators were outfitted with audio recording devices.eventually,the cooperators were equipped with hidden cameras that provided video recordings with audio although ginzburg testified that the video aspect did n ot work too well.trial transcript tr.at.
the conversations between cooperators and suspects were usually in russian.see,id.at.ginzburg testified that his native language was russian that he was raised in the former until he came to the united states at about age that his primary language at home and in social situations has remained russian and that he had been trained to translate between russian and english and had passed tests given by the fbi,nypd,and dhs for such translations.see id.at.ginzburg testified that he reviewed translations of the cooperators conversations with the suspects,and he personally transcribed at least the final transcriptions of the meetings and telephone recordings.id.at.at trial,the government introduced transcripts of recorded conversations between groysman and grigory or yuzovitskiy,as well as videotapes of some of their meetings.
groysman position with respect to the charges against her was that she was merely a worker at ega group,ega that she helped with billing because she knew how to use the computer and that she was not getting paid and was unaware of the dme fraudulent scheme.see,id.at,ginzburg description of his postarrest interview of groysman see also government brief on appeal at at trial,groysman defense was that she was a worker at ega who had been following the direction of one of ega owners,gregori sic branfenbrener,without knowledge of the scheme or the criminal intent to participate in it.
ginzburg testimony at trial with respect to groysman included the following.groysman,along with codefendant grigory branfenbrener branfenbrener who had pleaded guilty prior to trial see government brief on appeal at,worked at two dme retail companies,first leica supply leica,and then ega.ginzburg testified that groysman or branfenbrener would give one of the cooperators a document that the government dubbed a see,tr.see also id.at.the listed the types of equipment that ega supposedly wanted to buy from the wholesaler,the quantity of each item,and a highly inflated price per item.for example,bed boards that cost were listed as costing home whirlpools that cost were listed as costing.see,id.at.ginzburg instructed the cooperators to prepare invoices to match the information ega provided in the.
the were generally accompanied or followed by ega checks that would come from groysman and gregory sic branfenbrener.id.at.the ega checks were deposited into an account of one of the cooperators fictitious wholesale companies,usually one named delazoom.delazoom then issued a corresponding check to a shell company,and that check was cashed.after the check casher retained a small fee,all or most of the rest of the cash was divided among the defendants and their retail companies and the cooperators.in some instances,a small portion of the money would be used to purchase equipment.
ginzburg testified that he monitored the operation in part by meeting with the cooperators before and after their meetings with the suspects see tr,and by controlling the deposits of the checks,the withdrawal of cash,and the delivery of the cash to the defendant id.ginzburg attended none of the cooperators meetings at ega and could not see through the windows.see,id.at.the only witnesses who had actual knowledge of what groysman did were the informants id.at ginzburg knowledge of what took place at those meetings came from what he could hear through the audio equipment,from what he learned by reviewing the recordings,and from the debriefing of the informant s id.at.
ginzburg testified that ega would bill insurance companies for the items it claimed to have purchased at the prices shown on the invoices provided by the cooperators and that the insurance companies would then reimburse ega for the dme.the government introduced a chart,gx,prepared at the direction of ginzburg,that provided a general summary of the fraudulent health care scheme by giving a visual description of the scheme that ega was running with the informant tr.circles on the chart contained the names or titles of relevant entities or documents,and arrows pointed from circle to circle to show the movements of documents and checks.as described by ginzburg,gx showed that t he go bys were received predominantly from defendant groysman to delazoom.the false invoices were generated based on those go bys and brought back to the defendant groysman.tr.ginzburg testified that after groysman gave the cooperators ega checks payable to delazoom,the resulting cash would go back minus the kickback and minus any cost of dme predominantly to grigory branfenbrener and at least on one occasion the defendant groysman.id.gx also suggested that ega inflated claims to the insurers were paid as submitted.the exhibit was admitted in evidence over groysman objection that,inter alia,that suggestion was inaccurate and misleading.
seven other exhibits introduced by the government,gx,were charts prepared at ginzburg direction to depict numerous meetings between groysman and yuzovitskiy or grigory,with boxes and arrows to show checks given to yuzovitskiy or grigory and cash flowing back to groysman.groysman objection that these exhibits were improperly being used as actual evidence rather than for purely illustrative purposes was overruled.see tr.most of these charts were admitted over groysman additional objections after her counsel elicited on voir dire that the charts were based on what the informants told ginzburg,rather than on ginzburg personal knowledge or observations see,id.at.and certain of the charts were admitted over groysman objection that they were inaccurate or contained information that was misleading.see id.at.six of the charts indicated that after groysman had given yuzovitskiy or grigory a,cash was returned either to groysman and branfenbrener or just to groysman.see gx.
ginzburg summarized groysman role in the dme scheme as follows 
based on the street operation,based on the recorded meetings and telephone calls that you obtained and preserved in this investigation,what role did groysman play in ega office between january and june of 
a.she provided the for the false invoices,received false invoices based on those,provided checks and received cash at least once.
testimony by the cooperators 
both cooperators testified at trial.grigory testified that he and yuzovitskiy were partners operating fictitious dme wholesalers.grigory testified that groysman and,although being tried together,were not shown to have interacted with each other in the dme scheme were my partners in criminal activities.we were doing money laundering and insurance fraud.tr.
grigory testified that ega and leica,the companies that employed groysman,were retailer clients of grigory and yuzovitskiy in the dme scheme.grigory testified that he,either alone or with yuzovitskiy,drove to the office of ega or leica dozens of times however,usually yuzovitskiy went into the office alone.grigory went into the ega office only six or seven times.when grigory himself went in,everything he received with respect to the fictitious invoices came from lyubov groysman id.at.
grigory testified that when he returned cash to ega,the amount returned was the amount of the check the cooperators had received from ega minus five percent as the standard fee for the entity that cashed the check,a six percent fee for the cooperators,and the cost of dme actually supplied to ega,if any.see id.at see also id.at similar testimony by yuzovitskiy as to the division of the scheme proceeds.thus,where no equipment was actually purchased,ega would receive in cash percent of the amount it had given a cooperator.
grigory testified that on march,he returned such cash to groysman.the transcript of the audio portion of the recording on that day,translated from russian and using lg for groysman and gg for grigory,included the following 
gg take it.
lg thank you.yes.
gg it has this and that.
gx,at.at trial,grigory explained this exchange as follows 
q.what were you referring to when you said and this and that 
invoice and cash.
do you recall what the purpose of the cash was 
a.it was the cash for the check that had been given prior to that.
yuzovitskiy testified that his role in the scheme was to prepare the fictitious invoices for the retailers.for the information that was to be shown on those invoices for ega,yuzovitskiy received from groysman.see id.at.the fictitious invoices were then reviewed by groysman,and errors were called to yuzovitskiy attention by groysman.see id.at see also id.at,testimony by grigory that groysman also called such an error to his attention so that he could have yuzovitskiy provide a corrected fictitious invoice.yuzovitskiy testified that the ega checks corresponding to the,made out to one of the cooperators wholesale companies,were signed by branfenbrener but lyubov groysman issued the check.id.at.
yuzovitskiy testified that he also ha d discussions with lyubov groysman with regard to the cash deliveries that he would make to ega and leica he testified that s he would ask me when the money will be coming.id.at.however,yuzovitskiy testified that percent of the time he delivered the cash to branfenbrener.id.at.indeed,on questioning by the government,yuzovitskiy testified that he did not remember ever giving cash to groysman 
q.did you ever,ever deliver cash to lyubov groysman 
i do remember if it ever happened.but most of the time i would leave it in the drawer,in the branfenbrener desk drawer.but i do remember that i gave cash directly to lyubov.
tr.emphases added.
both grigory and yuzovitskiy testified that they had been involved in the dme schemes prior to voluntarily turning themselves in and agreeing to assist the government in the investigation that led to the present prosecution.grigory testified that he was currently awaiting sentencing for money laundering,insurance fraud,and tax evasion,having pleaded guilty to those charges.he agreed to cooperate with the government in the present investigation and to be a witness at trial in hopes of getting a reduced sentence.see id.at.yuzovitskiy similarly testified that he had turned himself in and decided to cooperate with the government because he was afraid that he was about to be arrested.see id.at.he too had pleaded guilty to money laundering,insurance fraud,and tax evasion and was awaiting sentencing.he hoped,by his cooperation,to secure a lighter sentence.see id.at.
both cooperators also testified that they had been ensnared in a prior fraud investigation by new york state authorities and had cooperated with the authorities in that matter.grigory testified that he had been investigated by state authorities in and he had avoided prosecution by assisting in their investigation,including by recording conversations with his.see id.at.yuzovitskiy testified that he had participated in grigory frauds,and he too cooperated with the state authorities.in exchange for that cooperation,neither grigory nor yuzovitskiy was arrested,charged,prosecuted,or required to make payments of back taxes.see id.at.
yuzovitskiy testified that as soon as that state investigation ended,he and grigory resumed business as usual.they never went out of business.they just closed their old office and continued doing fraud as they did before,at a new address.id.at see also id.at testimony by grigory that he had started the criminal dme wholesale business in,and it continued for nine years.yuzovitskiy testified that in all their operations together,he and grigory never had any clients that were running legitimate retail durable medical equipment companies.id.at.
c.other government witnesses 
the government other trial witnesses whose testimony related to ega were an irs special agent and an fbi special agent who had analyzed documents in connection with the health care fraud investigation an irs special agent who was involved in executing a search warrant at ega office two investigators employed by insurance companies and a dme wholesale distributor.none of these witnesses provided evidence about groysman personally.
groysman defense case 
groysman called three witnesses in her defense,including two character witnesses.her fact witness was yelena panchenko,a longtime friend who had been a coworker at ega for six or seven months,beginning in and ending in june when the arrests occurred.panchenko worked at ega as a clerk,doing billing.
panchenko testified that groysman was not an owner of ega e g and a were the initials of the first names of the three owners,including grigory branfenbrener.she testified that groysman,like panchenko,was a clerk at ega see tr,and she believed groysman too worked see id.at.groysman was doing the mail id.at,sorting it and sometimes responding to insurance company requests for additional information see id.at.
panchenko testified that one of ega suppliers was yuzovitskiy and that the accuracy of the invoices they received from him was t errible every time they would bring up the invoice it was always mistake.id.at.invoice errors made it difficult to receive reimbursement from the insurance companies.panchenko testified that eventually,to address the problem with yuzovitskiy invoices,branfenbrener would dictate to us the names and quantities for an order.id.as to prices,panchenko testified that e verything was in the computer and the computer did it automatically.id.at.
panchenko testified that on a few occasions yuzovitskiy delivered a sealed envelope to ega offices panchenko would usually put it on branfenbrener desk.she never saw cash in an envelope and never saw yuzovitskiy or grigory or any wholesaler give cash to branfenbrener or groysman.see id.at.
summation and verdict 
in summation,the government argued that the evidence demonstrated that groysman knowingly entered into and participated in the fraudulent scheme alleged.in discussing the testimony of the cooperating witnesses,the government stated in part as follows 
we put on two cooperating witnesses.the government witnesses grigory groysman came first and then vadim yuzovitskiy.
now let talk for a second about what those cooperators are not.they are not boy scouts.they are not altar boys.they criminals.they are individuals who came forward to the government and identified themselves as having been part of this scheme and as furthering this scheme and they wanted to cooperate,motivated in their own self interest of hoping to some day get leniency.they not angels.
i said,you know,they were angels,but what they were and what they are was consistent,credible and corroborated.
i mean,they went into these meetings and they essentially operated as walking,talking,videographers.i mean,their video was no steven spielberg most of the time,but we have on tape documents that are incriminating,documents that are furthering the fraud,statements that are made by the defendants in furtherance of the fraud over and over and over again.
you can trust the testimony that came from vadim yuzovitskiy and grigory groysman because it was consistent and it was corroborated and every time they went into a meeting with one of the defendants,they met with an agent before they went in,they met with an agent when they came out and you heard from that agent.so you can trust that testimony.
tr.emphases added.
groysman was convicted on both of the counts with which she was charged.she was sentenced as indicated above.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,groysman contends principally that ginzburg testimony was replete with inadmissible hearsay,as he recounted factual matter as to conduct by groysman that he could not have learned except from statements by the cooperators that ginzburg was improperly allowed to give his opinion as to groysman culpability that ginzburg was allowed to give foundation testimony for the admission of documents as to whose accuracy he had no personal knowledge and that seven charts introduced by the government showing from groysman to yuzovitskiy or grigory six of which indicated cash was given by yuzovitskiy or grigory to groysman were not admissible under the federal rules of evidence and were inaccurate and misleading.groysman concedes that some of her present objections to ginzburg testimony or to those charts were not made at trial.she contends,however,that the errors to which she objected were not harmless and that those to which she did not previously object warrant reversal on the ground of plain error.we conclude that given the serious impropriety of the prosecution use of this witness in light of the record as a whole,the evidentiary errors of which groysman complains on appeal which,along with others,are admitted by the government as described below meet the standard for plain error review and require that groysman be given a new trial.
preliminarily,we note the principal differences between analysis and analysis.in conducting analysis,applicable when an error claimed on appeal has been properly preserved in the district court,we consider the overall strength of the prosecutor case the prosecutor conduct with respect to the improperly admitted evidence the importance of the wrongly admitted testimony and whether such evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.united states gomez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.conducting analysis,we will reverse a conviction on the basis of improperly admitted evidence only if the error affects a substantial right.united states garcia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the federal rules of criminal procedure criminal rules provide that any error that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.a.an evidentiary error affects substantial rights if it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.united states garcia,at internal quotation marks omitted.an error is harmless if we can conclude with fair assurance that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury.cameron city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.with respect to analysis,the government bears the burden of proof.see,united states kaiser,cir.
the criminal rules also provide that a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.b.under this rule,
before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.
johnson united states,quoting united states olano,other internal quotation marks omitted.an error affects substantial rights when it is prejudicial that is,when there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.united states dominguez benitez.the burden of meeting the above criteria for review is on the defendant.see,id.at.the government may point to parts of the record in an effort to counter any ostensible showing of prejudice the defendant may make.see,united states young.
in the present case,given the numerous errors conceded by the government and the fact that not all of them were the subject of objections by groysman at trial,we elect to bypass analysis and to conduct only analysis notwithstanding that the burden under that analysis is on groysman,because we conclude,on the present record as a whole,that she meets the burden.the first two criteria for relief under the test for plain error are clearly met.there were errors and they were plain.the government in its brief on appeal concedes as follows 
groysman challenges three aspects of agent ginzburg testimony ginzburg incorporation of hearsay from the cooperators who later testified at trial,the inadequate foundation during his testimony for the admission of summary charts,and ginzburg inappropriate opinion testimony relating to groysman role in the charged fraudulent scheme while groysman is correct that the government improperly admitted sic several aspects of ginzburg testimony,ultimately,as explained below,any error in the admission of this testimony was harmless in light of the strength of the other evidence offered at trial.
first,to the extent that ginzburg described what occurred at meetings inside ega offices,he was conveying information that he learned from debriefing the cooperators and was thus conveying inadmissible hearsay.c.
second,to the extent that ginzburg interpreted recorded conversations involving the cooperators,groysman and branfenbrener,or opined upon groysman role in the charged conspiracy,he was providing inadmissible opinion testimony.united states garcia,cir united states grinage,cir lay opinion united states dukagjini,cir expert opinion.
further,as counsel properly objected to all but one of the charts below,to the extent that ginzburg provided a foundation for the admission of government exhibits through,he had no personal knowledge of many of the matters conveyed on those exhibits.compounding the lack of foundation for the admission of the summary exhibits,as counsel had further objected below,the exhibits contained inaccurate and misleading information,further rendering them inadmissible.united states citron,cir.
more fundamentally,however,these charts were not summary charts as contemplated by.government exhibits through do not summarize voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs.id.instead they appear to be pictorial representations of hearsay testimony offered through agent ginzburg and of events and transactions later described by the two cooperators.as such,the exhibits are no more admissible than any other extrinsic writing memorializing the substance of a witness testimony.
in addition,although not raised in groysman brief,it appears that gx,a chart that generally summarized the scheme,was erroneously admitted for similar reasons and was also inaccurate to the extent it suggested that all claims that were submitted by ega were paid by insurance companies without any rejections or inquiries,as counsel had objected below.t.using gx,ginzburg described,without objection,a summary of the scheme,including opining that groysman had provided the to delazoom,which prepared false invoices on the basis of the,which,in turn,were delivered to groysman.t.ginzburg further indicated that after the cooperators cashed the checks received from ega,they returned the cash,less their fee and expenses,primarily to branfenbrener but at least once to groysman.t.while this testimony improperly relayed hearsay from the cooperators,it too was harmless for the reasons explained below.
further,these depictions may have also constituted a degree of improper bolstering of the cooperators.
government brief on appeal at emphases added.groysman complaints regarding the admission of the evidence challenged herein are well founded id.at.
the third analysis factor,whether the errors affected groysman substantial rights,whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the erroneously admitted evidence,the jury would not have found groysman guilty,is not conceded by the government,but we conclude for the reasons that follow that that factor too is established.the standard is not the same as,and should not be confused with,a requirement that a defendant prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for error things would have been different.dominguez benitez,at.the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict but whether despite the error he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.a reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the government error undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.kyles whitley,internal quotation marks omitted.
the government,in its brief on appeal,characterizes its trial evidence excluding ginzburg testimony,as strong,if not overwhelming.government brief on appeal at.it argues that 
both cooperators directly implicated groysman in the charged crimes and were corroborated by their contemporaneous consensual recordings and the documentary evidence reflecting the gross price disparities between the cost of the dme to ega and the amount that ega billed to the insurance companies,
id.and that t hus,the inadmissible aspects of ginzburg testimony,viewed in relation to the prosecution formidable array of admissible evidence,was merely corroborative and cumulative id.quoting united states dukagjini,cir.
on the contrary,we find the government entire strategy was dependent on,and tainted by,the egregious errors that the government now admits.these errors,discussed in more detail below,so infected the fairness of the trial that groysman conviction would have been overturned in all but perhaps the most airtight of cases.specifically,the prosecution chose to lead with ginzburg testimony,which gave a coherent,and superficially reliable,narrative of the government version of groysman participation in the fraudulent scheme.it was the equivalent of an opening argument or summation by the prosecution but was presented as evidence for the jury to consider.the charts,graphically displaying purported facts ginzburg had verified,compounded the error.with this in place,the jury was all but invited to fall asleep during the admissible but messy evidence of wrongdoing,the garbled evidence and testimony of the cooperators.
before delving into the individual weaknesses of the government case,we issue a word of caution the errors admitted to in this case bordered on the structural,and the government should not hope to overcome similar lapses in the future by the marshalling of a slightly stronger case.see united states yakobowicz,cir interim summations that the prosecution used to not only state what the particular witness said but also argue the inferences to be drawn by the jury constituted a structural error requiring reversal.viewed in the context of the trial strategy as a whole,ginzburg testimony was used to essentially vouch for the admissible evidence offered by the prosecution.this tactic,whether engaged in by a prosecutor or other government agent,has been repeatedly condemned.see,united states modica,cir this court has repeatedly warned prosecutors not to vouch for their witnesses truthfulness,and t he policies underlying this proscription go to the heart of a fair trial w hen the prosecutor conveys to the jurors his personal view that a witness spoke the truth,it may be difficult for them to ignore his views,however biased and baseless they may in fact be.united states perez,cir attorney statements vouching for the credibility of witnesses are generally improper because they impl y the existence of extraneous proof quoting united states rivera,cir united states young,cir newman,concurring the risk of undue reliance on the testimony of a government agent arises because the jury may infer that the agent opinion about the criminal nature of the defendant activity is based on knowledge of the defendant beyond the evidence at trial.the risk is increased when the opinion is given by the very officers who were in charge of the investigation.quoting united states sette,cir united states scop,cir a government investigator testimony that was based on his positive assessment of the trustworthiness and accuracy of the testimony of the government witnesses improperly opine d as to the credibility of the testimony of other witnesses at the trial.the credibility of witnesses is exclusively for the determination by the jury.the cumulative and strategic effect of the inadmissible evidence proffered by the government in this case,even separate from other,individual deficiencies,thus went to the heart of a fair trial.
from the outset of the prosecution,groysman claim was that she had merely been following instructions given by branfenbrener,without knowing of or intending to participate in the fraudulent scheme.as indicated in part above,ginzburg testified that groysman took this position when he interviewed her following her arrest.at trial,groysman attorney opening statement argued that the invoices were erroneous unbeknownst to groysman tr.and that there would be no evidence that groysman received money or saw money being exchanged id.at.and as set out in part above,groysman called as a witness panchenko,who worked at ega during the entire period of ginzburg street operation and who testified that the details on the lists that ega gave yuzovitskiy for his preparation of invoices were dictated by branfenbrener.thus,the government set out to prove that groysman was a knowing participant in the fraudulent scheme by,in part,presenting evidence that she received cash kickbacks.most of the evidence that the government caused to be admitted for this purpose was inadmissible and,as discussed bel
