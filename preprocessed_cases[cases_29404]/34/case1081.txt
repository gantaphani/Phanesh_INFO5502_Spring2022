petitioners bao zhu zhu bao,and her two sons,ye zheng and shi kun zheng,petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals summarily affirming an immigration judge denial of their asylum application.based on an adverse credibility finding,the ij rejected the petitioners application for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act of as well as their request for relief under the united nations convention against torture cat see a,b.
we find that the ij erred by arbitrarily preferring assertions in bao husband application for asylum to those in hers and then arbitrarily using the husband assertions as the basis for deeming her not credible.consequently,we vacate the bia decision and remand it.
background 
bao and her children are chinese nationals from the fujian province.bao was married in a traditional village wedding in and registered her marriage in.she and her husband,yu kai zheng zheng,had two sons one in and another two years later.bao children claims for asylum have been joined and are derivative of bao petition.
in,bao older son arrived in the united states from china.a year later bao arrived with her younger son.the immigration and naturalization service paroled bao and her younger son into the united states.in august,she,on behalf of herself and her sons,filed an asylum application contending that she had been subjected to china coercive family planning policies.
in december,bao appeared before immigration judge gabriel videla.the ij waived the appearances of bao sons and her attorney informed them that their appearances were unnecessary.bao submitted,among other documentation,birth certificates for herself and her children,a marriage certificate,a household registration form,a sterilization certificate,an affidavit from her husband,and a family photograph.
through her documentation and testimony,bao presented the following facts.in,shortly after the birth of her second child,she was notified by a local birth control official to report for the insertion of an intrauterine device within two days or be heavily fined.bao complied with the order and after the iud was inserted,she was required to report for iud inspections three or four times a year.by the spring of,the iud was causing her significant discomfort and she had it removed by a private physician.at that point,rather than face the required inspections,bao and her sons went into hiding at her mother house and consequently she missed iud inspections scheduled for july and october.
as a result,family planning officials searched for and,in november,found zheng at home and arrested him because bao had not appeared for her scheduled inspections.he was briefly detained before his mother secured his release and promised the officials that bao would appear and submit to sterilization.at that point,zheng fled china for the united states.
bao testified that she refused to appear voluntarily for sterilization.in january,she was seized at her mother house by birth control officials who transported her to a family planning facility.there,bao was taken to an operating area where her legs and hands were bound and she was forcibly sterilized.she testified that following the procedure she experienced considerable pain in the area where the procedure had occurred as it became infected and required.
bao asserted that,in addition to forced sterilization,she was required to pay an rmb fine when she registered her second son.also,due to a change in local policies,in may she had been fined an additional rmb about,because four years had not elapsed between the birth of her first and second sons.she testified that when she refused to pay the second fine,her younger son was not permitted to attend school and her windows,doors,furniture and other belongings were destroyed by the government.at this juncture,having been sterilized,with a large pending fine,her belongings destroyed,and her younger son unable to attend school,bao testified that she decided to leave china.
zheng,who had left china in,entered the united states from mexico in,and submitted an individual asylum application the same year.he sought asylum based on the facts that he had two sons,he strongly opposed china family planning policies,and he had fled the country when he was notified to appear for sterilization.zheng also stated that his wife was forcibly sterilized in and sought asylum on that ground as well.
his application was denied.in july,zheng was ordered deported but,in violation of the order,remained in the united states.although zheng submitted an affidavit to the ij in this case,he did not appear,allegedly fearing arrest as a consequence of his illegal status.
the ij did not believe bao and denied her application.the ij believed she had been sterilized,but questioned whether it had been involuntary.while the ij provided some additional bases for his adverse credibility determination,he mainly focused on discrepancies between zheng version of events in his independent asylum application and interview and bao own version presented in her testimony before the ij.
for example,the ij focused on such things as the fact that bao could not explain why her husband,in his asylum interview,stated that he was present for her sterilization,that he had been fined rmb,and that bao had been sterilized a year after the birth of their younger son.in addition,the ij focused on a number of discrepancies between their statements regarding when the sterilization occurred he said,she said and the circumstances of the fines and arrests.the ij also noted inconsistencies between the husband affidavit,which petitioner proffered,and his previous asylum application.the ij registered suspicions regarding the authenticity of her documentation and her multiple explanations for why her household registration booklet was issued in august,a time when bao was allegedly in hiding.finally,the ij noted that he found bao description of her forced sterilization implausible.the ij concluded that the discrepancies added together lead the court to believe that her testimony is not credible,therefore,the court can not find that the respondent has established credibly that she had an involuntary sterilization procedure in china.
the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision except insofar as the immigration judge finding was tied to his views regarding,and the plausibility of,the respondent description of the sterilization procedures.
this appeal followed.

when,as here,the bia affirms the ij decision in all respects but one,we review the ij decision as modified by the bia decision,minus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the bia.ming xia chen immigration appeals,cir quoting xue hong yang united states dep t of justice,cir.
we review factual findings of the ij under the substantial evidence standard.see ins,cir.we will uphold the determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.id.at quoting diallo ins,cir.w here an asylum seeker has challenged an adverse credibility decision,we typically afford particular deference to the ij conclusions.ming shi xue,at quoting zhou yun zhang ins,cir.our review of an ij credibility assessment is an exceedingly narrow inquiry.id.
however,the fact that the bia has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.in reviewing adverse credibility findings,we consider whether the ij has provided specific,cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and whether those reasons bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.in short,our review is meant to ensure that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.zhou yun zhang,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also,at.
