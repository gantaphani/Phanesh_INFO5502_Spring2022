we review the denial of a franks hearing for clear error.united states,cir.a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing under franks where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that both a false statement knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit and the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.franks delaware,d.omission of a material fact from the affidavit supporting a warrant is sufficient to trigger a franks hearing.united states castillo,cir.in the case of an omission,suppression should be ordered only if the warrant application,clarified by disclosure of previously withheld material,no longer demonstrates probable cause.united states stewart,cir.therefore,reiner must make a substantial preliminary showing that,considering the previously withheld material,giguere affidavit fails to demonstrate probable cause,franks,at,and that the district court denial of his motion was clearly erroneous.
