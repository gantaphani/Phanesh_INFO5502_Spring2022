defendant scott torrellas appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following his plea of guilty before colleen mcmahon,judge,convicting him of possession of stolen firearms,in violation of j and,and sentencing him principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.on appeal,torrellas contends principally a that the district court failed to determine in accordance with.that torrellas,who suffered from a memory impairment at the time of his plea of guilty in june,understood the nature of the charge against him,and b that there was an insufficient basis for the court to determine that his plea was knowing and voluntary.torrellas also contends that the court imposed inconsistent alternative sentences.although we note that the judgment contains a typographical error in the spelling of torrellas surname,and we instruct that that error be corrected,we find no basis for disturbing the substance of the judgment.
background 
there is no dispute as to the factual background of this case.in the fall of,local law enforcement agents in dutchess county,new york,were investigating a series of burglaries in the area.on november,torrellas wife contacted the dutchess county sheriff office sheriff office and reported that there were a number of stolen items in the torrellas residence.members of the sheriff office promptly searched torrellas home and discovered items similar to property that had been reported stolen.torrellas was arrested.
following his arrest on november,torrellas admitted to officers of the sheriff office,in a session,that he had committed many larcenies during a span of several years.these included thefts in september of a variety of firearms from lockers of members of a nearby gun club at which he had been employed.
in february,torrellas was indicted on charges of,inter alia,robbery,burglary,and criminal possession of stolen property.he eventually pleaded guilty in may to one count of robbery in the first degree and was sentenced in july principally to a term of imprisonment the state sentence.
a.the federal indictment and the competency proceedings 
the present prosecution was commenced in may,when a federal grand jury handed down a indictment charging torrellas with offenses relating to the firearms taken from the gun club.the indictment alleged that,in violation of j and,
i n or about september,in the southern district of new york,scott torrellas,the defendant,unlawfully,knowingly and willfully received,possessed,concealed,stored,bartered,sold and disposed of stolen firearms and stolen ammunition,knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition were stolen,to wit,scott torrellas,while working as an employee at the pawling mountain club in pawling,new york,purposefully and without authority stole firearms and ammunition from the lockers of club members and retained such firearms and ammunition for his own use.
when this indictment was filed,torrellas was in state custody.produced in federal court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum in may,he initially entered a plea of not guilty to the federal charge.federal pretrial proceedings were begun but they,like the state proceedings,were soon delayed by unfortunate events following torrellas return to state custody.
in june,while in state custody,torrellas was seriously injured when another inmate struck him in the head.as a result,torrellas suffered memory loss and had some difficulty speaking.the district court therefore ordered that torrellas undergo medical and psychiatric examination to determine whether he was competent to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him and to assist in his defense.
apparently,several evaluation reports followed.a march report indicated that torrellas injuries prevented him from communicating with others.the government conceded that torrellas was not then fit to stand trial.the court ordered further evaluation.
a december,evaluation report,however,concluded that torrellas did not suffer from a mental disease or defect that rendered him unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him.that report opined that torrellas was malingering and essentially feigning the extent of his injuries.at a pretrial hearing shortly thereafter,torrellas attorney noted his own observation that torrellas condition had improved somewhat,and he requested and was granted an adjournment to permit a defense expert to review the december report.see hearing transcript,january,competency tr,at.defense counsel thereafter sought an additional extension of time to permit his expert to make a thorough assessment of the december report.the district court granted that request,stating that 
if your expert concludes that the report that i have received is flawed or incorrect and you want to contest the findings that your client is competent to stand trial and that he is malingering,we will have a hearing into that.
hearing transcript,february,competency tr,at.
following completion of the defense expert review,torrellas did not seek a hearing,and he raised no further issue as to his ability to understand the charge or the nature of the proceedings against him.instead,by letter dated june,his counsel informed the court that torrellas was prepared to plead guilty to the charge of possession of firearms and ammunition that he had stolen from the gun club lockers.see letter from torrellas attorney paul davison to judge mcmahon dated june,at torrellas letter.further,adverting to the fact that torrellas had been assaulted and injured by other inmates at the westchester county jail in june,and he has experienced memory loss and other complications since that incident id.at,torrellas attorney proposed that the court determine the factual basis for torrellas plea of guilty by listening to the confession given by torrellas to members of the sheriff office shortly after his arrest in november confession tape 
as requested,i am writing to set forth what we believe to be the appropriate procedure in view of the fact that torrellas has no current recollection of the conduct set forth in the indictment.
rule b,requires the court to determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.significantly,this portion of the subsections b rights and warnings and b voluntariness does not require the court to address the defendant personally or to ascertain the factual basis from the defendant himself.
instead,so long as the facts relied on are placed on the record at the time of the plea,the district court,in determining whether there was a factual basis for the plea,is free to rely on any facts at its just the admissions of the defendant.united states maher,cir internal quotations omitted.the factual basis inquiry can be made of the defendant,of the attorneys for the government and the defense or by whatever means is appropriate in a specific case,at,quoting.advisory committee note.
in this case,the factual basis for defendant guilty plea can be amply established by a interview that torrellas gave to the dutchess county sheriff department on november.the instant indictment charges torrellas with possession of firearms and ammunition which he stole from the lockers of club members at the pawling mountain club,in violation of j.during the november interview,torrellas was specifically questioned about the theft of the firearms,and he admitted having taken the firearms from lockers at the club during the course of his employment there.
we propose to play an excerpt of the recorded november,interview to establish the factual basis for the defendant plea in accordance with rule b.although torrellas has no current recollection of the subject matter of this recording,the tape is a classic recorded recollection admissible under rule.
torrellas letter at emphasis and emendations in original footnote omitted.
b.the plea proceedings 
on june,torrellas entered a plea of guilty to the charge set forth in the federal indictment.at the outset of the plea hearing,the district court stated its understanding 
that the factual basis for the defendant guilty plea will be established in this instance by a tape recording that was made on the evening of the defendant arrest when he was asked questions at the dutchess county sheriff department and gave answers to same.
plea transcript,june,plea tr,at.upon inquiry by the court as to whether that procedure was satisfactory,the government answered in the affirmative,as did defense counsel,who stated,indeed,since we suggested it,your honor,it is satisfactory.id.
before accepting the plea,the district court questioned torrellas to determine,inter alia,whether he was competent to plead and whether he understood the nature of the charge against him.see id.at.with respect to the elements of the offense with which torrellas was charged,the plea colloquy included the following 
the court now,torrellas,the crime that you are charged with is unlawfully,knowingly and willfully receiving firearms shipped in interstate commerce,knowing and having reasonable cause to believe that the firearms and ammunition were stolen.that the crime.
id.at.the court added,i gather that the accusation is that torrellas unlawfully possessed shotguns and a pistol which were registered to other people.id.at.
the court inquired whether torrellas understood that he had the right to appeal from his sentence,to proceed to trial rather than plead guilty,and to have a speedy and public trial,to which torrellas responded,yes,yeah,and oh,yeah.plea tr.the court also inquired as to,inter alia,torrellas education and whether he was under the influence of alcohol or medications see id.at,the court informed torrellas of the maximum punishment that could be imposed,asking torrellas to let the court know if there was anything he did not understand see id.at.
the court asked the government to describe the evidence that the prosecution would present at trial.the assistant united states attorney ausa then representing the government one of several who appeared on behalf of the government at various times in this prolonged matter responded that the government would prove,based in part on torrellas november confession tape,
that in or about september,the defendant took approximately five weapons from the lockers of club members of the pawling mountain gun club and that the defendant took the weapons for himself without permission from their owners 
id.at.defense counsel endorsed the government characterization of the confession tape see id.at and played supporting excerpts of that tape for the court,including the following 
q we also have approximately five guns that you told me were taken from the pauling sic mountain club,is that correct 
a that right.
q and you want to tell me about these guns,please describe them to me,what they were,where you got them and what you did with them.
a all of them i kept,which you guys have now recovered.um,yeah,there was from pmc 
q when you say pmc,you mean the pauling sic mountain club,correct 
q okay.now all these guns we talking about were taken on the same day,is that correct,approximately a month ago you told me 
q we have a smith wesson millimeter that you told me about,a caliber colt officers lightweight handgun 
q they were taken from whose locker 
a matt goulet.
q matt goulet 
q were these lockers locked,do you remember,or were they open 
a i was cleaning out matt locker,so i going to guess it was unlocked.
q why were you cleaning the locker out 
a that part of my job.
id.at,quoting confession tape.the district court asked torrellas whether that was you talking there on the tape,and torrellas responded,yeah.id.at.
the court concluded that,based on the defense stipulations and the admission by torrellas that he was the person giving those taped responses to questioning by a member of the sheriff office,torrellas plea of guilty was supported by an independent factual basis for each and every element of the crime charged.id.at.the court also concluded,based on the allocution,as well as the most recent report of the examination that was performed on him by the bureau of prisons medical staff,that torrellas was fully competent and capable of entering an informed plea,and that the plea wa s knowing and voluntary.id.at.the court therefore accepted torrellas plea of guilty.
sentencing 
the presentence report psr prepared on torrellas stated that the range of imprisonment for his offense was months.by the date of his sentencing hearing,february,torrellas had already served months of his state sentence.recognizing the overlapping conduct underlying torrellas federal and state offenses,the district court imposed a term of months imprisonment but reduced that term,by the months torrellas had served on the state sentence,to months imprisonment,to be served concurrently with the remainder of the state sentence.see sentencing transcript,february,at.the court stated that the imposition of the federal sentence concurrently with the state sentence means that for months of the months period the defendant will be serving two sentences,which means he will serve an additional months over and above the remaining state term of imprisonment.id.at.the district court thereafter briefly considered structuring the sentence as one for a term of imprisonment to be served consecutively to the state sentence see id.at but,after hearing argument from the parties,the court adhered to its original formulation,months imprisonment,months of which were to be served concurrently with the remainder of the state sentence see id.at.judgment was entered accordingly.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,torrellas contends principally that his conviction should be vacated on the ground that the district court failed,before accepting his plea of guilty,to comply with the requirements of.b that the court inform him of,and conduct an adequate inquiry into whether he understood,the nature of the charge against him.see torrellas brief on appeal at.torrellas also contends that the court impermissibly sentenced him to two conflicting terms of imprisonment.see id.at.we summarily reject torrellas sentencing contention because it is unsupported by the record,given the proceedings described in part above.only the plea proceedings warrant extended discussion.
to the extent pertinent to this appeal,rule b provides that,
b efore the court accepts a plea of guilty,the court must address the defendant personally in open court.during this address,the court must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands,the following 
g the nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading.
b g.this requirement,which prior to was found in rule c,see.advisory committee note,along with the requirements that the court advise the defendant on such matters as the range of penalties for the crime,the right to counsel,and the rights the defendant will forgo by pleading guilty,is designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant guilty plea is truly voluntary,united states maher,cir maher discussing former rule c citing mccarthy united states,d,for w ithout adequate notice of the nature of the charge against him,or proof that he in fact understood the charge,a plea can not be voluntary,henderson morgan,d.
nonetheless,while rule imposes strict requirements on what information the district courts must convey and determine before they accept a plea,it does not tell them precisely how to perform this important task in the great variety of cases that come before them.maher,at emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.what is essential is that the court determine by some means that the defendant actually understands the nature of the charges.id.at.and i n all such inquiries,matters of reality,and not mere ritual,should be controlling.mccarthy,at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
rule also provides that a variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.h.thus,even where the judge advice as to the nature of the offense was not absolutely complete,in that some essential element of the crime was not mentioned,the error may be found harmless where the defendant responses clearly indicate his
