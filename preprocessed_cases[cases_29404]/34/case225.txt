for the better part of a decade,claudine bhatti has been a dental hygienist at boston university dental health center.she claims that a series of supervisors at the center subjected her to unpaid work hours because she is black and then to selective discipline and other malfeasance in retaliation for questioning her unpaid hours.on the university motion for summary judgment,the district court discerned only a series of essentially interpersonal grievances insufficient to support bhatti claims.after careful review of the record,we agree with the district court that the evidence does not support bhatti claims.we affirm.
because bhatti case is before us on her appeal from a grant of summary judgment for the university,our framing of the facts reflects the evidence in the light most favorable to her.see martnez rodrguez guevara,cir.
bhatti who,again,is black began working at the center in january,joining fellow dental hygienists sally baldwin,anne jensen,and julie lidano,all of whom are white.eyad haidar was director of the center from the time of bhatti hire until july.reporting to haidar was the center manager jacqueline needham,who directly supervised the hygienists.in the center hired hygienist stefanie charity,who is black,bringing the racial balance of the hygienists to.
the center alleged discrimination against bhatti began right at the outset of her employment in,as needham told her she had to perform a of unpaid setup time every morning in addition to her basic workweek.in contrast,bhatti says,the three white hygienists were credited for their setup time as a part of their weeks under needham supervision,bhatti maintains,she was thus subjected to a workweek while her white coworkers worked only the hours they were paid for making matters worse,she claims,a unwritten rule allowed her white counterparts to take extended lunch breaks and leave up to early without having to place a written request and without being charged sick or vacation time.but if bhatti wanted a similar deviation from her scheduled workday an extended lunch or early departure she had to submit a written request,and needham would deduct the time from bhatti bank of sick or vacation time.at least this is the picture bhatti paints as we will discuss later,not all of bhatti claims have an adequate evidentiary foundation in the record.
in,bhatti confronted needham about the perceived disparities based on an unwritten rule.needham protested and proclaimed offense,and haidar was drawn into the dispute.he clarified that the unwritten rule was just professional courtesy that applied to bhatti,too,while reserving the right to approve or disapprove any scheduling deviations as might be necessary bhatti requested that haidar restore to her a backlog of sick and vacation time or to compensate her for the time in order to honor the unwritten rule post hoc,but he declined to do so.
bhatti scheduling concerns ended in august,when the center switched all the hygienists from salaried to hourly status ensuring that their pay would reflect the time they actually worked and that they would be paid overtime for any hours over their base forty.but just as one problem ended,another began.
after her confrontation with needham and her followup with haidar,bhatti says,center management began retaliating against her.specifically,she began receiving written reprimands for infractions that she says either were minor or did occur at all.
on september,bhatti was called to a meeting with needham and haidar there,she was presented a memo discussing three performance issues that continue to be a problem despite our many conversations an occasion where she had supposedly left the center during the workday without permission an occasion where she had taken a sick day but failed to produce a doctor note and an occasion where she had used a cell phone at work.bhatti vigorously contested these purported performance issues,explaining that she had arranged for a coworker to see her patient while she rested in a vacant workstation because she felt ill that the sick note policy was unevenly applied and,furthermore,that far from abusing sick days,she had accrued an entire month of unused leave and that she only used her cell phone at work in emergency situations.
on september,haidar issued a memo chastising bhatti for making a derogatory remark to needham about another center manager,yu wen szeto.specifically,after szeto had accused bhatti of leaving two hours early without approval,bhatti said to needham,that is a lie bhatti told haidar that she had not actually left the center early and that her remark was not actually derogatory.
on september,bhatti met with haidar and two university officials and complained to the university that the center was subjecting her to racial discrimination.on september,bhatti submitted a formal complaint to the university office of equal opportunity and affirmative action and finally on november,bhatti filed charges with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad the university responded in december,denying any discrimination around this time,bhatti began seeing a therapist for treatment of anxiety.
in the middle of this,on october,needham and haidar again called a meeting with bhatti to discuss alleged performance issues.as usual,bhatti disputed each of these issues.and on june,haidar issued yet another letter,this time reprimanding bhatti for claimed insubordination faced with conflicting duties due to a scheduling snafu,bhatti had protested haidar request that she see a patient during a meeting she was also supposed to attend.once again,bhatti disputed the claim,noting that despite her initial protest she did see the patient as haidar had requested.
in july,haidar left the center and margaret errante took his place.conditions markedly improved,although bhatti still complained about needham arbitrary supervision.in march,errante forced needham resignation.
on august,bhatti filed this action alleging discrimination,retaliation,and a hostile work environment in violation of various federal laws the university answered and,in april,filed a motion for summary judgment denying any discrimination but acknowledging that bhatti had worked under management.bhatti responded,pointing to scads of evidence documenting grievances that she claimed could only be the result of animus rather than reason.
on october,the district court granted the motion,holding that none of bhatti grievances,individually or in the aggregate,rose to the level of an adverse employment action necessary for her to succeed in her suit.the district court further held that the university had presented evidence establishing that its bad management practices applied across the board to employees of all races and that bhatti had failed to respond with adequate evidence of actual animus.final judgment entered on the same date.bhatti timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.
we review the district court summary judgment grant de novo,assessing the arguments and the record ourselves and affirming only if the record reveals undisputed facts that entitle the university to judgment as a matter of law.see baltodano merck,sharp,and dohme,cir.
bhatti grounds her claims in both title and the same legal framework applies to both statutory bases.see conward cambridge sch,cir.this framework allows for distinct claims of disparate treatment,retaliation,and hostile work environment,all of which bhatti alleges,and all of which fit into the familiar mcdonnell douglas scheme.see id.citing mcdonnell douglas green.we spell out each claim in more detail below,but in general for a claim to survive summary judgment under the scheme bhatti must first point to evidence making out a prima facie case.id.at.if she does so,this evidence creates a presumption of discrimination that the university may rebut by pointing to evidence of legitimate,reasons for the challenged conduct.id.and if the university succeeds on this showing then bhatti may still prevail by pointing to evidence that these reasons,though facially legitimate,are actually pretextual.id.applying this framework,we begin by assessing bhatti discrimination claim,then move on to retaliation,and finish with hostile work environment.
bhatti claims that the university discriminated against her in several ways,first and most notably by requiring that she,but not her white counterparts,perform unpaid setup time.a prima facie case for discrimination based on disparate treatment presents a test the plaintiff must be a member of a protected class she must be qualified for her job she must suffer an adverse employment action at the hands of her employer and there must be some evidence of a causal connection between her membership in a protected class and the adverse employment action,e,in the case of a firing,that the position was filled by someone with similar qualifications.mary honor ctr.hicks,santiago ramos centennial wireless,cir.
essentially collapsing prongs three and four,bhatti contends that she had to work more hours per week than her white counterparts,without compensation.the university responds that the record does not support bhatti claim of scheduling disparities but instead shows that bhatti and the white hygienists worked and were paid for the same number of hours.these positions are mutually exclusive,so it falls to us to examine the record and see who is correct or whether there is a genuine dispute.
bhatti main evidence is her own interrogatory answers and unsworn,statements that she learned and became aware of the alleged disparity because her coworkers told her they were paid for setup time.but bhatti tenuous mentions of her coworkers statements all constitute inadmissible hearsay.see dávila corporación de puerto rico para la difusión pública,cir.bhatti has pointed to no hearsay exception that might apply.and i t is law that hearsay evidence can not be considered on summary judgment for the truth of the matter asserted.hannon beard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this makes sense.there is no way to test the reliability of an amorphous,statement or to gage the intentions or credibility of the person who made the statement.see united states benitez avila,cir.so,because they depend on hearsay,bhatti interrogatory answers and other references to her coworkers statements can have no bearing on our conclusion.
other than that evidence,bhatti points to the following spots in the record to support her claim of scheduling disparities a schedule showing the white hygienists hours two years before bhatti was hired,when the center operated under a different supervisor needham testimony supporting the uncontroversial proposition that different employees work ed different hours and her own statement of undisputed facts from the district court record,which has no independent evidentiary value but merely references sources and.none of these even remotely shows that the schedules of the three white hygienists made for a shorter workday than their black counterparts the proposition they cited to support.instead,the admissible evidence in the record schedules showing bhatti and the white hygienists work hours and deposition testimony from the other hygienists indicates that unpaid setup time was standard.the record reveals no scheduling disparity.
bhatti also relies on other alleged disparities in the university treatment of the hygienists,particularly the application of workplace rules about the hygienists having to request time off and be docked sick time when leaving early or taking an extended lunch.more specifically,bhatti alleges that the other hygienists worked under an unwritten rule that a deviation from the schedule of minutes or less did not require a supervisor approval,but that she was unaware of this rule for her first two years of employment.there are several problems with this argument.
first,the rule was not a rule at all,but rather an acknowledgment on the part of center directors that their hygienists were professionals who could be trusted to perform their work duties without recourse to draconian schedule enforcement.haidar said allowing the hygienists to leave minutes early at the end of the day when they had no work duties left to perform was simply a matter of trust that he extended to everyone.indeed,the evidence all suggests that the rule was nothing insidious at all but rather simple professional courtesy.
additionally,there is no evidence that bhatti was ever actually denied this professional courtesy.for one,the other hygienists testified that they only took advantage of it occasionally,in particular when their last patient of the day failed to show.but the evidence indicates that when bhatti last patient of the day cancelled,she would generally take minutes to an hour off instead of staying at the center until the workday was almost complete.in fact,bhatti never submitted a leave request seeking fewer than minutes off.there simply no indication in the record and,most importantly,no testimony from bhatti that she ever would have departed work minutes early but did not because she was unaware that leaving early was an option.instead,bhatti evidence reflects only vagaries and generalities about how,she had been required to submit a form requesting time off when she left early.this statement,and the rest of bhatti evidence on this point,does no more than reflect the center formal policy of requiring leave request forms but occasionally bypassing this requirement as a professional courtesy if work wrapped up early at the end of the day.in the end,the evidence shows that all hygienists had to submit a leave request if they left more than minutes early and that no hygienists,including bhatti,had to submit a leave request if they left fewer than minutes early,so we can discern no disparate treatment.
finally,even if we assume despite the above discussion that bhatti has made out a prima facie case of discrimination,the claim fails under the regime that governs employment discrimination cases.see conward,at.the university has pointed to reasons as to why bhatti may not have been aware of the center extension of professional courtesy to the hygienists,and bhatti has pointed to no evidence of actual bias or pretext.specifically,the other hygienists learned of the center workplace policies from their supervisors when they were hired well before needham and bhatti arrived.bhatti learned of workplace policies and practices from needham,who according to her deposition testimony knew nothing of the center practices regarding de minimis scheduling deviations.in fact,needham says she was unaware of any hygienist leaving early without submitting a leave request.once bhatti learned of the courtesy extended to others,she raised the issue with haidar,who immediately clarified that she,too,was entitled to this courtesy.again,this uneven communication between administration personnel and between administration and staff certainly suggests some dysfunction in the center management,but it does not show bias 
these problems are dispositive because there is no evidence in the record that bhatti was ever actually denied a to minute early departure,such a nonexistent denial can not support her discrimination claim.and beyond that,because she can not show bias,the claim must fail anyway.
bhatti last discrimination claim stems from the center alleged failure to provide her with annual performance reviews before.this claim falters because the record contains her annual performance reviews for the years,and thus,there is only one missing performance review,and its absence is not materially adverse because bhatti received a merit raise in.because the factual predicate for bhatti claim turns out to be false,the claim fails.
on to retaliation.bhatti claims that the university retaliated against her,primarily by issuing written warnings,in response to her complaints of race discrimination.to succeed on a retaliation claim,a plaintiff must show that her employer took some objectively and materially adverse action against her because she opposed a practice forbidden by title vii,such as race discrimination.burlington northern santa fe ry.white.bhatti claims that the reprimands she suffered at the hands of needham and haidar were materially adverse employment actions.
