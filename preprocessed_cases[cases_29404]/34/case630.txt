paul james hansen was convicted after a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts for his role in stealing a minivan and his responsibility for the armed robbery and killing that followed.he now appeals both his conviction and sentence,bringing no less than eleven claims of error.after careful review,we affirm.
background 
we begin with an overview of the facts of this case,in the light most favorable to the government as the prevailing party.the unfortunate friendship of hansen and brendan brennan brennan spawned from their childhood association with the boys club in charlestown,massachusetts,when the two were about twelve years old.during their teen years,they became friendly with an older man from the neighborhood,scott sheehan sheehan,who made money by robbing banks.sheehan instructed his two young apprentices about various aspects of the criminal trade,including the finer points of stealing cars.under sheehan tutelage,the young men learned,for example,that to prevent police detection when stealing vehicles that were to be used in robberies,they should wear certain clothes such as nylon pants,shirts,hats,and gloves.
the pair wasted no time putting their newly acquired skills to june,and the summer of,brennan was involved in stealing approximately cars,with hansen participating in roughly of these thefts brennan budding criminal career hit bumps in the road,however,when he was arrested and convicted of four different auto thefts in and.
while brennan was incarcerated for one of these auto thefts,hansen continued to mingle with the wrong crowd,and eventually learned of an upcoming criminal opportunity from a charlestown acquaintance named john fidler fidler.on july,hansen met up with brennan,who had just been released from jail,and told him that fidler and two other individuals from charlestown,dennis bird bird and billy mckillop mckillop,were planning to rob an armored truck and wanted hansen to help out by stealing a minivan.a minivan was the vehicle of choice for such a venture because the sliding doors and removable seats conceal the robbers and allow for easy exit during the heat of a robbery.according to brennan,fidler and his crew were apparently in the process of replacing another charlestown group that robbed armored trucks while that group was incarcerated for a robbery in hudson,new hampshire,which had resulted in the death of two guards.
the next day,hansen,fidler,bird,and mckillop unsuccessfully tried to pilfer a minivan.having had difficulty stealing these types of vehicles in the past,hansen asked the more adroit brennan to lend a hand,with the understanding that both hansen and brennan would be compensated for the theft.brennan understood that the minivan to be stolen was to be used in an armored truck robbery,firearms would be used during the robbery,and he and hansen would earn more money if the robbery was successful.
on the evening of july,hansen and brennan donned nylon pants,shirts,and gloves and trolled the streets of charlestown for a suitable vehicle.before long,the pair noticed an attractive white minivan with tinted windows.while hansen kept watch,brennan broke into the vehicle and started the engine.after stashing the stolen minivan in somerville,massachusetts,hansen and brennan showed fidler and bird their quarry.
four days later,on july,a dunbar armored truck driven by michael day day and edward kubera kubera parked at the twin city plaza in somerville to deliver currency to a star market.kubera unloaded boxes of coins while day remained in the truck and watched for suspicious activity.while they were working,a white minivan approached the armored truck with tires squealing.an individual dressed in a ski mask and gloves exited the minivan,pointed a handgun at day head,and instructed him to lie on the floor of the truck.at the same time,another masked man wearing gloves and dark clothes approached the armored truck with an assault rifle and brutally shot kubera in the chest.the second robber climbed over day to enter the armored truck,collected approximately,and took day firearm.the armed robbers escaped as quickly as they had arrived,with the entire robbery lasting only a few minutes an hour later,kubera died.
the resulting investigation produced statements by brennan explaining hansen role in the robbery as well as a conversation recorded by brennan father,stephen brennan,in which hansen admitted that fidler had asked him to steal a vehicle.hansen was indicted on june,nearly five years after the heist,on charges that he aided and abetted robbery affecting commerce,in violation of and a conspired to affect commerce by means of robbery,in violation of a used a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby caused murder,in violation of,c,and j and made a false material declaration before a grand jury,in violation of.at trial,the government was primarily based upon brennan testimony,which largely consisted of the factual account set forth above.the jury found hansen guilty on all counts.
hansen was sentenced on october.at the sentencing hearing and in a subsequently filed memorandum dated february,the district court explained its findings.the court grouped counts,and together and determined a base offense level of using the first degree murder guideline.see the court then departed downward to an offense level of based upon hansen state of mind.see cmt.the extent of the departure should be based upon the defendant state of mind,recklessness or negligence,the degree of risk inherent in the conduct,and the nature of the underlying offense conduct.a enhancement for obstruction of justice was added because hansen testified falsely before the grand jury,resulting in a total offense level of.see c.because hansen had a criminal history category of vi,the district court calculated hansen guideline sentencing range to be to months.the court sentenced hansen to a term of imprisonment months on counts,and grouped a consecutive term of months on count.five years of supervised release and a restitution payment of were also imposed.these appeals followed 
ii.discussion 
hansen appeals both his conviction and sentence,raising no less than eleven points of error.we address each challenge in turn,taking the sentencing issue first.
booker sentencing issue 
hansen first and main line of attack is the fact that the district court sentenced him under the prior mandatory guideline regime.see united states booker,d.despite his claim to the contrary,however,hansen did not argue to the district court that the guidelines were unconstitutional or that his sentence violated apprendi new jersey,d therefore,his booker claim is not preserved and thus we review for plain error.see united states antonakopoulos,cir.under plain error review,hansen must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
hansen is able to meet the first two elements because he was sentenced under a mandatory guideline regime.see antonakopoulos,at.the question is whether he is able to show a reasonable probability that the sentencing court,freed of the shackles forged by mandatory guidelines,would have fashioned a more favorable sentence.united states guzman,cir.while we have said that we are not overly demanding as to proof of probability,united states heldeman,cir,the defendant must point to specific indicia that reasonable probability exists.united states,cir.
to support his claim that it is reasonably probable that sentencing under a system would have yielded a different result,hansen points to the following statement in the district judge february,sentencing memorandum 
the defendant was.the people who enlisted him in stealing the van were at least ten years older,with a brutal reputation in charlestown.while the law holds hansen responsible for the foreseeable consequence of his acts,it is clear that his relationship to the armored car robbery that resulted in the tragic murder of edward kubera was tenuous.he had,at most,only the most general idea of the plans of fidler and bird.he did not know when the robbery would take place,where,or of whom.while brennan suggests that hansen knew that guns would be guns at had no control over how they would be brandished,or indeed,whether they would be used at all.
united states hansen,d.these comments do suggest that the district judge was sympathetic to hansen situation in light of the jury guilty verdict on count,which held hansen accountable for the shooting as a foreseeable consequence of the use of a firearm in the course of the conspiracy.see pinkerton united states.scrutinized in the context of the entire memorandum,however,the court statements do little more than explain why it chose to depart downward to the second degree murder guideline base offense level of instead of using the first degree murder guideline base offense level of.nothing in the judge comments imply that she would have imposed a different sentence had she been operating under an advisory guideline regime.in fact,a review of the entire record indicates just the opposite.the district court explained 
in this area,the guidelines permit me to make a more nuanced judgment as to what kind of sentence hansen deserves than the jury did.the jury may have found the killing foreseeable but i can not conclude that it was intentional.if there ever were a case in which the downward departure to a second degree murder guideline was appropriate,it is this one.
hansen,d at.other comments by the court at the october,sentencing hearing indicate that to the extent the judge felt constrained,it was as a result of the jury guilty verdict on the conspiracy counts,not the mandatory guidelines indeed,the judge comments indicate that she felt the mandatory guidelines allowed her room to craft an appropriate sentence based upon hansen actual role and his state of mind.this is critical because here,in contrast to the vast majority of cases,the applicable guidelines encourage the sentencing judge to choose the most appropriate point along a spectrum,from first degree murder level to second degree murder level based upon an evaluation of state of mind.the judge exercised this authority by placing the crime at the level she found appropriate level.
but having exercised the authority to depart,the court also made it clear that it would go no lower t here no way i going to go below a level.it is also clear that the court believed hansen played a greater role than brennan in the offenses,and deserved a longer sentence than brennan months.as the judge explained 
based on the relationship,though,between brennan and hansen,i agree with the government that i will not give a role adjustment to hansen,one that brennan got.i do think that,whatever brennan might have been involved in in any other situation certainly,he was a lesser participant in this offense than in others.
while there is certainly some evidence that the court felt sympathetic for hansen situation in light of pinkerton,based upon this record,there can be little doubt but that hansen falls short of meeting the burden of showing a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.
crawford washington 
in crawford washington,d,the supreme court held that the sixth amendment confrontation clause prohibits the admission of statements that are testimonial in nature unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant concerning the statements.id.at.relying on crawford,hansen argues that the district court improperly admitted into evidence the following 
brennan testimony concerning his conversation with hansen,sheehan,and john shirko about the need to wear certain clothes when stealing vehicles to be used in robberies 
brennan testimony that robby brady asked hansen and brennan if he could come along with them to steal a car 
brennan testimony that fidler was satisfied with the stolen minivan 
brennan testimony that hansen told him that bird said to chill out about the money,there too much heat around 
agent travaglia testimony that stephen brennan agreed to record a conversation with hansen and 
stephen brennan statements made during the recorded conversation with hansen.
hansen reliance on crawford,however,is misplaced for two reasons.first,for crawford to apply,the statement must be testimonial in nature.see crawford,at.although the supreme court did not define the term testimonial,it gave us three examples of statements that would be testimonial testimony or its equivalent statements contained in formalized documents such as affidavits and depositions and statements made as part of a confession resulting from custodial interrogation.see id.at.in light of these formulations,we find that,with the exception of stephen brennan recorded statements,the challenged statements are nontestimonial because they are either statements made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy,or casual remarks which the declarant would not reasonably expect to be available for use at a later trial see horton allen,cir.
the statements of stephen brennan are not barred by crawford because they were not offered for their truth,but to provide context to the recorded conversation see crawford,at,the confrontation clause does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.see also united states jimenez,cir finding crawford inapplicable because challenged statements were properly admissible,not for their truth,but to provide context united states logan,cir stating that the mere fact that the content of the statements cast doubt on a defendant innocence does not bring those statements within the ambit of sixth amendment protection under crawford.
consequently,hansen arguments are without merit.
jury instructions 
hansen next argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury about the possibility of multiple is,a conspiracy to steal the minivan as well as a separate conspiracy to rob the armored truck.the government retorts that this argument not only is without merit,but has been waived and should not be considered on appeal.we agree that the claim is waived.
an issue is waived when a defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a legal right.see united states mitchell,cir.waiver is distinct from forfeiture,which occurs when a party fails to timely assert a right,in that a forfeited issue is reviewed for plain error while a waived issue generally may not be reviewed.see united states rodriguez,cir.
hansen,through counsel,not only failed to object to the court omission of his proposed multiple conspiracy instruction,but also affirmatively stated i am content after the district court instructed the jury.we hold that this statement constitutes an explicit withdrawal of the proffered charge on multiple conspiracies,and as such,the issue is waived and may not be revived on appeal.see id.at finding appellant bound by his express waiver when he deliberately withdrew his objection.
we will pause to note,however,as we pass by this claim,even though it is waived,that the evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that hansen knew the minivan would be used in the armored truck robbery,knew that guns would be used in the robbery,and expected his payment to depend on the success of the robbery.accordingly,the district court did not commit plain error as a reasonable jury could not have found more than one illicit agreement or an agreement different than the one charged.see united states balthazard,cir citing united states brandon,cir.
prosecutorial vouching 
hansen contends that the government engaged in improper vouching in both its opening statement and closing argument.again,because no objection was raised at trial,we review only for plain error.see united states millan,cir.these arguments need not detain us long.
a prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she places the prestige of her office behind the government case by imparting her personal belief in a witness veracity or implying that the jury should credit the prosecution evidence simply because the government can be trusted.united states,cir citing united states,cir.in the first challenged remark,the prosecutor told the jury during his opening statement that brennan plea agreement required him to tell the truth.this statement is not improper,because we have clearly held that a prosecutor properly may admit a witness plea agreement into evidence,discuss the details of the plea during closing arguments,and comment upon a witness incentive to testify truthfully.united states bey,cir.
hansen second challenge is to the closing,where the prosecutor stated 
the other thing i want to point out,and this is brendan brennan agreement with the government and also what he said on the stand.what did he say on the stand about what his agreement was he did say,my agreement is to convict pj.he said,my agreement is to tell the truth.he said that over and over again.my deal with the government is to tell the truth.and any benefit brennan gets is based on whether he tells the truth.it in the agreement,ladies and gentlemen.go ahead and read it.his deal here is to tell the truth,and i submit to you,that is precisely what he did during this trial.
these remarks were made in rebuttal to hansen closing,in which hansen argued that brennan testimony was bought and paid for by the government.in this context,we typically cede prosecutors some latitude in responding to defense counsel allegations of fabrication,at.latitude or not,the prosecutor comments do not constitute improper vouching as they do no more than recite facts that are in brennan agreed to testify truthfully as part of his plea assert why brennan should be believed.see millan,at finding no error where prosecutor stated i submit to you she is testifying,she has a plea agreement,she has kept that plea agreement she has a plea agreement to testify truthfully i submit to you,ladies and gentlemen of the jury,you can consider the fact,consider the fact that she has indeed testified truthfully.
in a similar vein,hansen urges that the government improperly referred to stricken testimony during its closing,brennan testimony that hansen stated he hansen would do the ten years if he had to for his role in the offense.this portion of brennan testimony,however,was not stricken by the district court and it was proper for the government to refer to this evidence in its closing.
as such,hansen is unable to show plain error regarding the vouching claim.
motion for a new trial 
hansen believes that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the government withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.this claim is reviewed for a manifest abuse of discretion.see united states glenn,cir.
the supreme court holding in brady requires the government to disclose exculpatory evidence which is material either to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.a district court may award a new trial based on newly discovered evidence subject to disclosure under brady if the defendant demonstrates both that the evidence is material and that there is a reasonable probability that it would produce an acquittal upon retrial.united states wall,cir citing united states josleyn,cir.
the alleged brady violation in this case involves evidence that fidler associated with three separate crews who frequently changed plans and stole cars on the way to various robberies.the import of this evidence,according to hansen,is that fidler always acted spontaneously and with different groups of people thus,it allegedly shows that hansen could not have reasonably foreseen that fidler would use the stolen minivan to rob an armored truck.
it is not enough for hansen to show the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped his defense,or might have affected the outcome of the trial.united states,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.instead,hansen must show the evidence to be of such probative value that there is a reasonable probability it would produce a different result.see id.hansen attempt to meet this burden falls far short.first,the relevancy of fidler erratic behavior in is,at best,unclear,because it involved armored truck robberies that occurred nearly two years after the robbery at issue here.second,the evidence is hardly anything,it seems to reinforce the notion that fidler was a consummate robber who was highly likely to use stolen vehicles to accomplish his criminal goals.for these reasons,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of the new trial motion.
bundled with hansen brady challenge is a general claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.even if it were sufficiently which it is not,we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can not make their debut on direct review but should be presented to the district court pursuant to.united states mala,cir.
pinkerton united states 
as we discussed in connection with the booker challenge,the district court gave the jury a pinkerton instruction that allowed the jury to find that hansen,by virtue of his membership in the charged conspiracy,was criminally liable for the substantive offenses committed by his during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.see pinkerton,at.hansen attacks his conviction under pinkerton,arguing he was not afforded adequate notice of the essential nature of the charges against him the evidence does not support a finding that fidler use of a firearm to commit armed robbery was reasonably foreseeable to hansen and the district court wording of the pinkerton instruction was improper.
as to notice,the indictment told hansen that he was being charged in counts for aiding and abetting robbery affecting commerce,conspiring to affect commerce by robbery,and using a firearm during a crime of violence and thereby causing murder.the unambiguous language of the indictment,combined with our decisions which have made abundantly clear that a is liable for acts committed by other members in furtherance of the conspiracy,see,united states sanchez,cir,convince us that hansen,represented by experienced defense counsel,suffered no unfair surprise.
nor is hansen able to persuasively challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that was presented against him.the government case relied primarily on the damaging testimony of hansen childhood friend,brennan.we previously described their friendship as unfortunate,and undoubtedly it combined actions resulted in a tragic loss of life and countless other offenses.their partnership was particularly unfortunate for hansen,because,as the district court observed,w ithout brennan,there was no case.hansen,d at.brennan testimony revealed not only that hansen was aware of the possibility that the minivan might be used in an armed robbery,but that fidler told him the minivan was needed for an armored car robbery and guns would be used during the robbery.moreover,brennan and hansen discussed how armored car robberies often resulted in killings,and knew their payment was contingent on the success of the heist.under de novo review and taken in the light most favorable to the jury guilty verdict,see united states felton,cir,hansen challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is simply unavailing.
because there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that hansen and others were members of the same underlying conspiracy,the pinkerton charge to the jury was proper.see united states torres,cir.we,thus,are not confronted with the sort of marginal case in which the pinkerton instruction sometimes causes concern.sanchez,at citation omitted.additionally,after review of the district court charge,we find it contains all elements of a standard pinkerton instruction,including emphasis that the jury was obligated to find each element of pinkerton beyond a reasonable doubt.
double jeopardy 
hansen contends that his indictment and conviction for violations of c and j,and the underlying violent crimes pursuant to,violate the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment because these counts involve the same criminal conduct.we review for plain error be
