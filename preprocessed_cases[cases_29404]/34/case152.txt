michael powers and john mahan,who ran an employment agency from to supplying temporary workers,were both convicted after an jury trial of conspiracy to defraud the united states by impeding the functions of the internal revenue service irs and mail fraud.powers was also convicted of subscribing false tax returns and mahan of procuring false tax returns.all told,the tax fraud amounted to.as part of the fraud,they underreported the amount of the payroll to the agency workers compensation insurance carriers.powers is serving a total term of imprisonment of months mahan,a term of months.each was ordered,jointly and severally,to pay total restitution of to the irs and two insurance carriers.
their appeals do not contest the sufficiency of the evidence but rather allege that there were serious errors at trial which require that they be given a new trial.
there is a common theme to the arguments that each error undercut a major theory of defense.the theory was that they in good faith believed their agency,commonwealth temporary services cts,was not an employer of any of the temporary workers and that they did not knowingly defraud the government of payroll taxes by paying the workers in cash and not reporting their payments to the government or to the insurers.they pointed out that they conceded that payments were made in cash,that no forms w were given to the workers,that no forms were given to anyone,including their recruiters and subcontractors,and that federal insurance contributions act fica tax was not withheld.their position was that cts was no more than a broker for the hiring company which needed the workers and that cts was not the employer who owed the taxes rather,the cts subcontractors were.
most seriously,they complain that the trial judge failed to give a defense instruction on advice of counsel,inappropriately placing too high a burden on them to justify the instruction.they also assert that various witnesses were allowed to testify as to the ultimate issues,invading the role of the jury,and they should have been allowed to call witnesses to support their defense.
because there is no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we do not recite it in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states hardy,cir.rather,we provide a more neutral recitation to give context for the claims of error.united states morla trinidad,cir.
cts mode of operation 
in,powers and mahan started cts.cts articles of organization listed powers and mahan as the agency sole directors,with mahan as president and powers as treasurer and clerk.before starting cts,powers and mahan had both worked at another temporary employment agency,daily king dak.
cts provided temporary workers to facilities such as warehouses and recycling plants to perform manual labor.cts entered into contracts with client companies that set out the rates which the clients would pay cts per worker hour.clients called cts to request a particular number of workers and cts communicated the client order to recruiters,some of whom had been temporary workers themselves before cts approached them to recruit workers for cts.cts told the recruiters how many men and women were needed,what clothes the workers should wear,and how to get to the client facilities.the recruiters then found workers for cts.
powers set the workers rate of pay and cts informed the recruiters what the rate was.cts did not ask recruiters how much it would cost to find workers,and recruiters did not provide a quote to cts for how much workers would cost.recruiters did not send cts invoices for finding workers.cts paid the recruiters a commission of fifty cents per hour for each worker,plus an extra fifty cents per hour if the recruiters transported the workers to the client company.
cts provided client companies with blank timesheets that the clients filled out and returned to cts each week.cts then created invoices listing workers names,the hours they worked,and the billing rate,and submitted them to clients.after cts had collected and added up the timesheets each week,powers or mahan wrote a check for the total amount,sometimes above,that would be cashed and the cash distributed to the workers.powers and mahan divided the cash into separate quantities for each recruiter and placed the cash in bags,working from paysheets that listed workers names,the hours they worked,and their pay rate.each bag was then given to a recruiter with a paysheet so the recruiters could pay the workers.cts also paid recruiters and some cts office workers in cash.between january,and june,cts cashed checks totaling.
cts failure to pay payroll taxes or file forms 
employers report payroll paid to employees to the irs each quarter using a form.employers pay fica taxes,also known as payroll taxes,in connection with the filing of form.the total payroll tax rate during the relevant period was of an employee wages employers are to withhold half of the payroll tax amount from employees paychecks,and to pay the other half themselves.employers are also supposed to withhold federal income tax from employees wages.cts filed forms,but it did not report the cash wages and did not pay payroll taxes or withhold any taxes.powers and mahan did not instruct recruiters to withhold taxes from wages paid to temporary workers.joseph guidoboni,a revenue agent in the irs special enforcement program,estimated at trial that the total tax due on the unreported payroll was.
when a company uses contract laborers rather than employees,it is still required to file a form whenever it has paid an individual or unincorporated business more than in a calendar year.in,powers and mahan hired joyce christensen,a certified public accountant,to prepare their corporate and personal tax returns.powers and mahan told christensen that was to be deducted on cts tax return as contract labor,and that these contract laborers were temporary workers.christensen told the defendants that cts needed to file a form for anyone classified as a contract laborer and explained how to determine if someone was an employee requiring the filing of a form w or a contract laborer requiring the filing of a form.christensen sent a letter to the defendants on march,reiterating that properly classified independent contractors should receive a form at the end of each calendar year.if you fail to provide the proper forms,you could have exposure to a large tax liability.christensen stopped working with the defendants for the tax year because they would not follow her advice.during the charged conspiracy period,from to,cts did not file any forms with the irs.
cts underreporting of payroll to insurance carriers 
with certain exceptions not relevant here,massachusetts employers are responsible for maintaining workers compensation insurance for everyone to whom the employer makes payments.upon the expiration of each policy term,the insurance company audits the employer and reviews the employer records to determine,inter alia,the actual remuneration paid by the employer to individuals and businesses during the previous year,including payments to subcontractors or contract labor.the audit then arrives at a final premium figure for the policy term that determines whether the employer owes additional money to the insurer or the insurer owes the employer a rebate.
cts was audited by its workers compensation insurance carriers several times.cts failed to report all of its payroll to its auditors,resulting in its carriers underbilling it by more than between june of and february of.
powers and mahan statements in the dak investigation 
in april of,powers met with federal bureau of investigation fbi agent nancy mccormick and a representative of the attorney office to discuss the business practices of dak,his previous employer.powers explained that dak was a temporary employment agency,and said that the majority of dak payroll involved cash payments.powers described how he cashed checks for dak,and how this cash was then divided into envelopes and given to lieutenants to distribute to temporary workers.powers provided agent mccormick with a hard drive containing excel spreadsheets recording cash payments to temporary workers that were not disclosed on dak forms,and also said that dak cash payments were designated as contract labor on dak tax returns.powers stated that dak cash payments had not been reported to dak workers compensation insurance carriers and that dak had withheld no tax from these cash payments.powers was the first person to meet with agent mccormick and provide information about dak,and he ultimately spoke with agent mccormick five times between april of and may of.
in,mahan met with joel burman,an irs criminal investigation special agent,to discuss.during mahan interview,he explained that dak and its affiliated companies paid their employees with cash and used managers to recruit,pick up,transport,and pay their employees.mahan stated that dak underreported its payroll to its workers compensation carriers in order to reduce its premiums.
federal agents then obtained a search warrant on june,to search the offices of dak and its affiliated companies.the investigation culminated in the indictment,trial,and conviction of dak owners for mail fraud,procuring false tax returns,and conspiring to defraud the united states of employment and income taxes and to commit insurance fraud.see united states mcelroy,cir.
massachusetts department of unemployment assistance proceedings against cts 
massachusetts employers are required to contribute to the state unemployment assistance fund in an amount determined,in part,by how many employees they have.employers report the information upon which their contributions to employment assistance are based to the massachusetts department of unemployment assistance dua each quarter,and some employers are then selected to be audited.
in july of,roberta davis of the dua notified cts that it had been selected for an audit focusing on cts operations during.cts retained attorney edward defranceschi with respect to the dua matter.on september,cts provided davis with a transaction report that reflected a number of cash disbursements.during a meeting with davis,defranceschi and powers characterized the recipients of these disbursements as subcontractors.
davis requested additional documentation,whether it business cards,invoices,contracts,yellow pages,something to show me that these people are in business for themselves,as well as forms and other documentation.davis asked for more documentation about one of cts recruiters,jose gramajo,and his wife,delmy gramajo,who transported workers for cts.
in february of,defranceschi sent davis a letter,with a copy to powers,in which he stated 
cts routinely calls delmy and jose to handle certain jobs that it has acquired.delmy and jose,however,are not cts employees.each of them and several others quote a price.if the price is within the profit targets cts quotes the customer,they complete the job and are paid.
on february,defranceschi sent davis another letter stating that 
you asked about invoices from the persons who had received large payments from commonwealth temp services cts.i have enclosed three invoices from and a current invoice cts solicits situations requiring unskilled labor if cts successfully bids the job,it contacts various parties that it has done business with in the past and inquires if they are interested in doing the job at a fixed rate for labor and transportation.cts usually finds someone to organize the labor for the job.the invoices i have enclosed represent the billing for the jobs to cts please note the detail in the february,invoice from k s comm domestic services.the job,the labor and the transportation are all separately stated.
two of the enclosed invoices purported to be from delmy gramajo.powers had faxed the enclosed invoices to defranceschi on an undisclosed date with the note early and recent invoice these are good representatives of the type of invoices we rec then and now.
in fact,delmy gramajo never submitted any invoices to cts,much less the invoices that defranceschi provided to davis.neither did jose gramajo.the invoice that defranceschi identified as from k s comm domestic services was actually a paysheet that cts had originally provided to jose gramajo.
on april,the dua issued a determination to cts that twelve listed individuals and others similarly employed were in employment,making them your employee s and not independent contractor s.
cts appealed and hearings were held on june,and july,which powers,mahan,and attorney defranceschi attended.powers testified under oath that he did not know the medium of payment between the recruiters and the temporary workers that for each new job he contacted the recruiters to solicit a price from them for which they would be willing to find workers that the recruiters,at least initially,invoiced cts for the services they performed and that he did not have direct knowledge of the amount the temporary workers were paid.the dua,in an undated decision signed by review examiner scott pachico,affirmed the determination that an relationship existed between the listed individuals and others similarly employed and commonwealth temporary services,this decision made cts liable for unemployment contributions for its temporary workers,and powers and mahan then shut down cts operations in december of.
powers statements to irs criminal investigators 
during a interview with irs agent david butka,powers stated that cts used subcontractors,but had no contracts with these subcontractors and paid them in cash,which the subcontractors paid to the workers.powers stated that the subcontractors requested that the payments be in cash and that he did not know whether the temporary workers were paid in cash.powers said that the subcontractors initially submitted invoices to cts but that cts eventually began directly incorporating information from the subcontractors into its internal spreadsheets.
powers admitted that cts did not issue forms to the subcontractors,but insisted that accountants never discussed forms with him and that he was not familiar with the form filing requirements.
we treat each of the claims presented on appeal.
refusal to give advice of counsel instruction 
although the government,in its initial proposed jury instructions given to the district court on the fourth day of trial,requested that an be given,this was apparently based on defense counsel representation in his opening statement that he would call attorney defranceschi to testify that he advised the defendants that their position that neither recruiters nor temporary workers were employees of cts was litigable and reasonable.by day seven of trial,the defense had not called defranceschi,and the defense never did so.at the charge conference the government stated that it was withdrawing the request.defense counsel asked that the instruction be given.
the district court decided not to give an instruction,giving two reasons the defendants have presented no evidence that they fully advised attorney defranceschi of their plan,received advice regarding that plan before,and followed that exact advice in good faith and even if there were some basis for an advice of counsel instruction,that instruction is subsumed by the general instruction that the court will give.
it is a basic tenet of criminal law that a defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense provided that the theory is a legally valid one and there is evidence in the record to support it.united states rodriguez,cir instruction regarding entrapment.in making this determination,the district court is forbidden from weighing the evidence,making credibility determinations,or resolving evidentiary conflicts.rather,the court must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant,to see if the inferences and evidence can plausibly support the theory of the defense.id.
these same rules are used for the defense of good faith reliance on the advice of counsel.see united states christopher,cir.we review these determinations de novo.see united states howard,cir united states sánchez bérrios,cir rodriguez,at.this is different from the abuse of discretion standard in some other circuits.see,united states bush,cir.there is no claim the instruction was flawed.
here,it was essential to the prosecution to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants had knowingly committed the charged offenses.the crimes with which defendants were charged required an intent to impede or defraud,or wilfully making or aiding a false representation.see united states mubayyid,cir conspiracy to defraud the irs united states stergios,cir mail fraud subscribing false tax returns,procuring false tax returns.if the defendants had acted pursuant to advice of counsel,this would have been very useful evidence for them of lack of fraudulent intent or wilfulness.see united states ibarra alcarez,cir.
the circuits have provided some guidance as to the types of facts which will warrant giving an instruction.some have suggested a defendant must show that he or she fully disclosed all material facts to attorney before the advice was given,that the attorney gave that advice,and that the defendant actually relied on counsel advice in a good faith belief that conduct was lawful.see bush,at united states rice,cir.we have been clear that the defense is not available to one who omits to disclose material information to advisors or dictates imprudent outcomes to advisors.janeiro urological surgery prof l ass n,cir.that principle disposes of this claim.
at trial,the defendants chose not to testify and not to call defranceschi whom they first consulted in to represent them before the dua as a witness.the prosecution introduced exhibits demonstrating that powers had faxed phony invoices to defranceschi and represented to him that they were good representatives of the type of invoices we rec then and now from recruiters.the government also introduced evidence that defranceschi represented to davis,copying powers,that cts recruiters quote a price.if the price is within the profit target cts quotes the customer,they complete the job and are paid.defranceschi would have no knowledge of this and was likely repeating representations made to him.legal advice made based on material misrepresentations to counsel does not qualify for the defense.there was no evidence that powers corrected this statement,which he knew to be a misrepresentation.
defendants assert that i t is clear from the record evidence that attorney defranceschi knew the material facts about the cts business model and advocated that the model was appropriate.they have pointed to no evidence that this was so,that defranceschi advised them that their actions were legal,or that they relied on such advice.in light of the evidence that attorney defranceschi was not told needed information and was given false information,the instruction was unavailable.
we add that the ample instructions cured any possible harm to the defendants.the instructions given were as follows concerning the general meaning of knowingly i f the defendant acted in good faith that is a defense to the charge that he acted in a knowingly criminal manner concerning the mail fraud charge if the defendant acted in good faith,he can not be guilty of the crime and concerning the charges of subscribing or procuring false tax returns 
if the defendant then under consideration in good faith believed that he paid all the taxes he owed,he can not be guilty of criminal intent to evade taxes.therefore,if you find that the defendant then under consideration honestly believed that he owed no taxes,even if that belief was unreasonable or irrational,then you should find him not guilty.however,you may consider whether the defendant belief was actually reasonable as a factor in deciding whether he held that belief in good faith.
these instructions adequately conveyed that an absence of intent to defraud,or an honest belief that taxes were not owed,would shield defendants from conviction.the defendants have not argued that the instructions would not encompass a situation in which their belief was based on the advice of counsel.we do not suggest that the presence of a instruction invariably eliminates the need for a court to consider an instruction.but here,there could have been no prejudice to defendants.see united states allen,cir.

testimony of irs agent guidoboni 
agent guidoboni was called as a summary witness who presented calculations of the payroll taxes due and owing after examination of voluminous exhibits.in the course of this,he referred to the cash payments as cash payroll.defendants filed an unsuccessful pretrial motion in limine to exclude agent guidoboni testimony and renewed it at trial,again unsuccessfully.defendants argue that the agent characterization of the cash distributions to workers as unreported payroll was improper.they say this was a legal conclusion reserved to the jury.
the objection is foreclosed by united states stierhoff,cir,and united states mcelroy,cir.indeed,in mcelroy we approved exactly this type of testimony,and guidoboni was the witness there,as well.at.irs agents may testify as summary witnesses in tax evasion cases to analyze facts already introduced into evidence and spell out the tax consequences that necessarily flow from those facts.stierhoff,at.one limitation on this type of evidence is that the agent may not testify about the defendant state of mind.united states mikutowicz,cir.nor may he testify as to the meaning of provisions of the internal revenue code.id.at.agent guidoboni did neither.
agent guidoboni ma d e assumptions concerning the proper attribution of the income from the transactions in this case in identifying the tax consequences of these transactions,but his assumptions were supported by evidence in the record.united states diez,cir.agent guidoboni calculated cts cash payroll by adding the value of the checks cts cashed during this period.his method was supported by the testimony of manuel deaguiar,cts office manager,that cts cashed checks in order to pay recruiters and temporary workers and the fact that his figure roughly matched cts own deductions,reported to the irs,for contract labor over this period.
agent guidoboni then calculated the taxes owing on this amount by assuming that these payments went to workers who were cts employees.this assumption was supported by testimony at trial that defendants controlled where and when recruiters and temporary workers worked determined how much recruiters and temporary workers earned distributed cash to recruiters for direct payment to recruiters and temporary workers addressed problems that client companies had with temporary workers addressed temporary workers complaints about their pay oversaw treatment of injured temporary workers had no contracts with recruiters and permitted recruiters and temporary workers to quit at any time.see d defining employee as any individual who,under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the relationship,has the status of an employee nationwide mut.ins.darden,d enumerating test for determining whether a hired party is an employee rul,enumerating twenty factors to consider in determining whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor.further,agent guidoboni explicitly conceded that his analysis rested on this assumption and defense counsel him on this point.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting agent guidoboni testimony.
testimony of deaguiar,novick,brady,mckenna,soto,and davis 
defendants challenge the testimony of several witnesses on the basis that they expressed legal or factual conclusion s on key disputed issues that should have been left to the jurors.a lay witness may offer an opinion so long as it is a rationally based on the witness perception b helpful to clearly understanding the witness testimony or to determining a fact in issue and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.see also united states sanabria,cir.an opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.a.
deaguiar over objection described the individuals who recruited temporary workers for cts as recruiters.defendants argue that this term strongly suggested the conclusion that the government was attempting to prove.deaguiar term accurately describes what these recruiters did for cts,and he testified that powers and mahan themselves used this term.deaguiar also testified that defendants used the terms recruiters and independent contractors interchangeably.his testimony was not on any ultimate conclusion.
defendants argue that bruce novick,an accountant who prepared tax returns for mahan and powers between and,expressed the opinion that the only legitimate reason for cts not to file forms would be on the condition that cts was paying the claimed amounts to corporations.defendants overread novick testimony.in reality,novick merely testified,over objection,that payments in excess of to individuals who are not corporations require filing of a form,and powers told him cts was not filing forms because the payments for contract labor were to other corporations.neither statement invaded the province of the jury.
john brady,plant manager and human resources manager at a cts client,testified,over objection,that his understanding was that temporary workers work for the agency that i hiring them through.he did so only after testifying that the temporary workers were not employees of his company.mahan argues that this was inadmissible opinion testimony on the ultimate factual issue in the case.we see no abuse of discretion.brady merely stated his understanding of whom the temporary workers worked for,and did not attempt to explain the legal significance of this understanding.
andrea mckenna,a human resources manager at another cts client,testified,over objection,that she understood that the recruiters worked for cts.defendants challenge this testimony for reasons similar to those advanced regarding brady testimony.admitting this testimony was likewise not an abuse of discretion.
mahan also argues that mckenna opine d,over the defendant objection,that with temporary workers the agency was responsible for the payroll taxes.she did so after testifying that temporary workers were not on the payroll of her company.mahan argues that she should not have been permitted to go further,that the jury was in a better position to decide this,and that her views were not helpful to the jury.to the extent that mckenna expressed an opinion,it helped the jury understand why clients pay a premium to temporary employment agencies.further,the contract between cts and this client which was introduced without objection stated that cts will pay all applicable local,state and federal payroll taxes on all labor provided.mckenna testimony buttressed that the parties conduct was consistent with the contract.it could not have been prejudicial to the defendants.
jose soto,a recruiter for cts,testified,over objection,that he did not consider himself an independent contractor.he explained that he understood an independent contractor to be somebody who works for himself and pays his own taxes,and stated that he was not such a person because cts was paying me in cash.to the extent that this statement offered a lay opinion,it was helpful to the jury and the criteria on which soto relied were explicit and subject to attack.indeed,defense counsel soto on this subject,eliciting that you knew that the term independent contractor meant that you were responsible to pay your own taxes and that if you admitted you were an independent contractor that would not be a very good thing for you.
defendants challenge as inadmissible davis testimony that temporary employment agencies often provided inaccurate information to the dua.in a separate argument,defendants also argue that the court erred in permitting davis to testify that certain individuals,including delmy gramajo and jose gramajo,were employees of cts and refusing to permit defense counsel to davis about this conclusion.
davis testified,over objection,that temporary employment agencies do always give you the correct amount of names and numbers.defendants argue that in eliciting this testimony the government asked the jurors to assume,based on the past experiences of davis with other companies in the same business,that cts and its agents were engaged in the same pattern of wrongful conduct.while t he threat of guilt by association is perhaps greatest where the defendant has done little but is closely associated with others already known to have been convicted,allen,at,it is a leap too far to find that threat here.davis did not testify that furnishing incorrect names or numbers to the dua,without more,could constitute wrongful conduct warranting conviction,and she did not claim that defendants were closely associated with persons who had committed wrongful conduct.instead,her testimony helped the jury understand why lengthy dua audits were sometimes necessary.and there was ample evidence that defendants had submitted inaccurate reports,rendering this testimony harmless.the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony.
on the second point,davis did agree that the individuals you highlighted,including delmy gramajo and jose gramajo,were employees,but she did so in response to a question from defense counsel.a n attorney can waive his client right to raise an error on appeal by deliberately eliciting or relying on inadmissible evidence,united states vachon,cir second alteration in original quoting weinstein berger,weinstein evidence.defense counsel did just that here for sensible tactical reasons to elicit from davis that attorney defranceschi indicated he did not agree with that assessment and that these people,including delmy gramajo and jose gramajo,were subcontractors.
as for the challenge to restrictions on the of davis,w e review this challenge de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.should that threshold be reached,any restrictions that were placed on the extent and manner of the will be reviewed for abuse of discretion.mikutowicz,at citations omitted.defense counsel were afforded ample opportunity to davis about her conclusion that delmy gramajo and jose gramajo were cts employees.defense counsel were permitted to ask davis whether a number of factors including that jose gramajo had business cards,had registered businesses at city hall and with a contractors association,was running between six and twelve passenger vans to transport workers,owned a garage to maintain these vans,could accept or reject job requests,and actually paid temporary workers would have been relevant to her determination.
the district court sustained objections to only three defense questions,and its rulings did not meaningfully constrain the defense of davis.further,to the extent the district court refused to permit defense counsel to question davis about the legal test for identifying independent contractors,it impose d reasonable limits on in order to avoid confusion of the issues,id.at quoting united states gonzalez vazquez,cir.i t is for the judge,not the lawyers or the witnesses,to inform the jury of the law applicable in the case nieves villanueva soto rivera,cir.
exclusion of pachico testimony and draft opinion 
powers and mahan sought to introduce the testimony and draft decision of dua hearing officer pachico,who conducted two hearings and prepared a draft opinion.that early,draft tentatively concluded that it had not been shown that an relationship existed between cts and certain workers.the dua ultimately determined that these certain workers were cts employees,contrary to pachico preliminary conclusion.
the standard of review is not favorable to defendants.before trial,the government moved to exclude testimony by pachico about the dua hearings,as well as pachico draft opinion.the district court provisionally granted the government motion as to pachico testimony and definitively granted the motion as to pachico draft opinion.at trial defendants did not renew their objection to the government motion and did not attempt to introduce pachico tes
