in today appeal which seems like something straight out of dateline nbc old to catch a predator series donald jones iii attacks his convictions and life sentences for federal crimes related to his efforts to have sex with a child.he must settle for a partial victory,however,as we affirm his convictions but vacate his life sentences.and because our vacating his life terms undoes a big part of the judge sentencing schematic,a resentencing on the other counts is appropriate too.
how the case got here 
we start with the facts,viewed in the light most compatible with the guilty verdicts.see,united states kinsella,cir citing united states bunchan,cir united states mercado,cir.
a predator on the prowl 
in jones signed up for an account at,an internet pornography site.picking as his screen name,jones posted on his profile page a photo of a young girl holding a penis,with something that looked like semen on her face and hands i am into young,read his message,look ing for white mothers and fathers who have young and would like to see their daughters get parted by a normal to moderate sized black pole.emphasis in original.wanting a real meeting,he added.
a couple days later a postal inspector named jay stern spotted jones postings.posing as jim stuart,stern chatted with jones online via messaging system.hi,friend,stern wrote.i got a daughter.maybe we can work something out.where are you from and how old jones wrote back.rhode island,stern responded,adding that his daughter was eight,almost nine.we put daughter in quotes this last time because she is fictitious,though jones did not know this then.would i get a chance to touch her or just look at her jones wanted to know.i would be so gentle and kind to her,he promised,and would come bearing gifts.continuing with this theme,he wrote a bit later that he was a lover of all girls little.do want to hurt.want to love.he suggested that they all meet at a h otel up your way,preferably around the end of school or maybe before so you can go on summer vacation and i will have loved her by then.and he eventually gave stern his email address and cellphone number.
stern was not the only person jones chatted with online at,by the way.for example,having joined the site forum called very cute only,jones was asked,what is the youngest you will fuck he wrote,i wont go below not definite but a fairbase line.
over the next two weeks,jones and stern emailed and called each other a lot.during their conversations jones bragged about his prior sexual contact with very young girls one as young as four.he also bragged about his cache of child pornography,describing some of what he had as absolutely mouth watering.and he emailed some videos to stern too.
after much discussion,the men settled on a plan.jones would travel by bus from pennsylvania to rhode island.rendezvousing with stern and his daughter,the trio would then check into a hotel,where jones would perform sex acts on the girl over the course of several days.stern would watch and perhaps film what jones did close up shots only,the men agreed,n o face shots.
with the date for their fast approaching,jones asked for and got a chance to talk to stern daughter played by another officer over the phone.i sent you something and y ou should have it really,really soon,jones told her.what he was referring to was some clothing he had sent her,gifts intended to make her feel comfortable around him,apparently.he also promised stern that he would bring something sexy for her to wear when he came up.and he emailed stern some videos for her to watch,presumably to make her think that what they were about to do was totally normal.one video in particular would do the trick,he said,and he gushed at the possibility of reenacting a scene or two with her.on top of all that,he sent stern a poem that he had penned for her.it read 
roses are red 
and candy is sweet 
i ca wait to get there 
to tickle you little feet 
to give you a hug 
and share time with you 
to see a smile on your face 
there nothing i would do 
the symbol of peace 
is what brings us together 
but it the love that we share 
that keeps us forever 
and knowing that in time 
so much we will share 
and if you ever need me 
call me and i be there.
arrest and indictment 
when jones later boarded a bus bound for rhode island,little did he know what lay in store.an undercover agent hopped on in new york and sat directly behind him.jones was in a good mood,the agent later said.very,very talkative.the agent,for example,overheard jones side of a phone conversation with someone presumably stern discussing how he had the evening wear.as the bus neared providence,it drove by the hotel where jones had booked a room for his with stern and stern daughter.the agent then heard jones ask the driver to pull over so he could get off.but the driver kept on driving.
agents arrested jones the second he got off the bus in providence.searches of jones and his backpack turned up among other things a sheer nightgown and panties,a looking like something right off the racks of frederick of hollywood a usb thumb drive containing child pornography and a smartphone containing stern number and email address saved under the name jim,plus more child pornography.twelve files on jones thumb drive and another on his smartphone matched ones that he had sent to stern.damning evidence,for sure.
after officers advised him of his miranda and obtained his waiver,jones gave a lengthy statement trying to explain what brought him to rhode island,jones said that stern a man he did not know had hit me up on my email.he talking about having sex with his kid,jones stressed,and i wanted to see what he was really about.jones did concede that stern had talked about possibly me having sex with his daughter.but jones wanted no part of that,and after completing his factfinding mission,all he planned on doing was a little sightseeing around providence or so he said.critically,jones admitted that he had a opened the account,posting the photo of the young girl no older than,he said holding a penis,with ejaculate on her face and hands b started communicating with stern through c probably posted the message about his willingness to have sex with girls five and up d gotten child pornography left and right from a guy named eduardo e emailed stern more than videos f booked the hotel room g mailed stern clothes for his daughter and h downloaded child pornography to the thumb drive that he had on him stuff to show stern kid,he conceded.as for the other posting look ing for white mothers and fathers who have young and would like to see their daughters get parted by a normal to moderate sized black pole jones suggested that someone else could have put that there.
soon a grand jury indicted jones,charging him with crossing a state line with intent to engage in a sex act with a person under the age of count using the internet a facility of interstate commerce to persuade a person under to engage in a sex act for which he could be charged with the criminal offense of child molestation under rhode island law count traveling in interstate commerce to engage in a sex act with a minor count transporting child pornography in interstate commerce count possessing child pornography distributed through interstate commerce count and committing the crimes alleged in counts while being required to register as a sex offender count jones pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.
conviction and sentence 
the parties dueled below over the admissibility of a certified document showing jones new jersey conviction for aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child.the judge had earlier granted the government in limine motion to introduce that document,finding the evidence relevant,not unfairly prejudicial,and admissible under.titled similar crimes in child molestation cases and the judge stood by his decision at trial.a new jersey probation officer then testified that the victim there was nine years old and that jones still had to register as a sex offender in.confronted with this and the other evidence against him,jones tried to fight back during his lawyer closing he presented no evidence and never moved for a judgment of acquittal.anyone truly intending to have sex with a child would have acted more slyly,his lawyer told the jury you do give out your phone number,for example.jones was a registered sex offender,his lawyer added.do you think he is going to leave a trail that goes to his front door,like the prosecution says he did no one is that dumb,defense counsel insisted.and as for the trip to rhode island,all jones wanted was to find out what going on.the jury bought none of defense counsel theories,however,and convicted jones on all counts.
some months later the judge sentenced jones to life plus years in prison.this is how he got there he imposed life terms on counts,a year term on count,a year term on count,a year term on count,and a year term on count with the sentences on counts running concurrently with each other,and the sentence on count running consecutively with the sentences on counts.
having set the stage,we now tackle the issues presented on appeal,adding further details as needed.
issues and rulings 
unhappy with the outcome below,jones contests the admissibility of the evidence,the validity of the count conviction under,and the legality of the life sentences.the government puts up a strong fight on the first two fronts.but it basically stands with jones on the sentencing issue,agreeing that we must toss the life terms.and if we do that,the government adds,then we should let the judge reassess the sentences on the other counts a suggestion that jones seconds.
the prior conviction evidence 
jones thinks that the judge stumbled in admitting evidence of the new jersey conviction.his thesis has two facets first,that rule requires an actual child victim and,he reminds us,there was none here and second,that the evidence was irrelevant for counts and unfairly prejudiced his defense of counts,see,and.because he débuts his claim on appeal,we review it only for plain error a very stiff standard that requires him to show error,plainness,prejudice to him and the threat of a miscarriage of justice.united states torres rosario,cir see also united states acosta colon,cir united states batchu,cir.he did,however,raise the irrelevance and claims below,so we review this part of his thesis for abuse of discretion,see united states polanco,cir which means we can reverse only if no reasonable person could agree with the judge ruling,united states maldonado,cir.ultimately,though,his theory is not a winning one,for reasons we now explain.
a quick evidence primer 
evidence is admissible only if relevant,probative,and not unfairly prejudicial.see.we oversimplify slightly,but the basics are there.moving on,we note that when the evidence is evidence of a defendant other crimes,it is typically inadmissible to show his propensity for crime.see.b.we say typically because rule like its,rule similar crimes in sexual assault cases and rule similar acts in civil cases involving sexual assault or child molestation overrides the ban on propensity inferences in a specific situation.see martínez cui,cir.in a criminal case in which a defendant is accused of child molestation,rule says,the court may admit evidence that the defendant committed any other child molestation.a.importantly,this evidence may be considered on any matter to which it is relevant.id.a child is anyone under,the rule adds.d.and child molestation includes a kaleidoscopic array of acts constituting crimes under a variety of federal and state statutes,any conduct prohibited by chapter and committed with a child and any conduct prohibited under chapter as well as attempt or conspiracy to commit those crimes.d.
actual child victim 
as for whether rule requires an actual child victim,jones does not cite and we can not find any case,anywhere,addressing the issue,let alone deciding it in his favor.given this state of affairs,we are worlds away from a plain error,an error that is indisputable.see united states marcus,see also cheshire med.center grace,cir finding no plain error where among other things no decision cited to us,and none of which we are aware,showed the obviousness of the supposed error.
things might be different if rule language clearly supported jones position.see united states caraballo rodriguez,cir.unfortunately for him,it does not.
pouncing on the rule opening clause in a criminal case in which a defendant is accused of child molestation jones argues that child there must mean a real child.ditto for the word child in the section saying that child molestation includes acts criminalized by chapter of title and committed with a child.surely child there must mean an actual child too,he insists.the government responds with a number of reasons why that is just not so.its big one is that rule only requires an attempt or conspiracy,which,it adds,undermines any notion that the rule demands a completed crime with a child victim.we need not take sides,however.at best for jones,there is a reasonable dispute about what the phrases mean and that devastates his position,because as we said a second ago an error open to reasonable dispute is not plain error.see,marcus,at.
just to be clear we are not saying that the judge rule edict is error.nor are we saying that it is not error.all we are saying is that if there was error,it is not plain.
relevance and unfair prejudice 
we can make quick work of jones claim that the judge should not have admitted the evidence because to his mind,at least it was irrelevant to counts the ones dealing with the transportation and distribution of child pornography.essentially,and helpfully,he concedes the evidence relevance to counts and.that means game,set,and match to the government on this issue,for we know of no case and jones cites none suggesting that evidence must be relevant to all counts.see generally united states morris,cir stressing that the court was aware of no rule of law declaring that in order to be admissible on one count of an indictment,evidence must be relevant on all counts.all things considered,we can not say that the judge abused his discretion on the relevance question.
we turn,then,to the issue.rule for those not in the know lets a judge exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial nature.unfairly prejudicial means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,commonly,though not necessarily,an emotional one.advisory committee note.
jones complains first that evidence of his new jersey conviction merely encouraged the jury to infer that he had a propensity to act like a child molester,something that he believes is at odds with rules b and.not true.yes,evidence offered under rule must still pass muster under rule.see martínez,at.but when tackling the problem,judges must be ever mindful that rule removes rule b blanket ban on propensity inferences in cases.see id.at and because rule flags this propensity inference as proper,we can not brand the inference as unfairly prejudicial under rule.see united states rogers,cir quoted favorably in martínez.
readers take note,please.even if no unfair prejudice arises solely because the evidence rests on propensity,that hardly means that there are no dangers to watch out for.see id.the evidence could still cause the jury to condemn a defendant based on passion or bias,for example,which is a.see,old chief united states.think of a jury that uses that evidence to convict because it is disgusted by the defendant criminal past rather than convinced that he did the crime charged.see id.or think of a jury that unsure of guilt convicts anyway because it believes the evidence shows the defendant is an evildoer who must be locked up see id.jones makes a passing attempt to raise the specter of passion or prejudice,noting in a case parenthetical tucked in his brief that neither of these emotions is a proper basis for conviction.but after telling jurors that they could draw a propensity inference whether to do so was up to them,the judge stressed that the government has the burden of proving that jones committed each of the elements of the offense involved in the current indictment.and he reminded them that jones was not on trial for any act,conduct,or offense that was not charged in the indictment.jones says not a word about this,never explaining why the judge comments were not enough to neutralize any risk of unfair prejudice,for example.as things stand,then,jones passion or bias surmise is a.see generally united states mehanna,cir finding no reason to think that the verdict was the result of passion or prejudice,given how the judge among other things gave the jury suitably prophylactic instructions.
the bottom line is that we see no abuse of discretion in the judge handling of this aspect of the case.and so we press on.
the conviction 
jones grouses that his count conviction committing a particular felony crime involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender can not stand because,he says,the statute of conviction demands an actual child victim.he never raised this theory below in any context,like in a motion alleging a defective indictment,see.b b,or in a motion claiming insufficient trial evidence,see.and we can not tell what the basis is for his challenge here.if it is a defective indictment and assuming for argument sake that this type of attack remains open he must show plain error to get anywhere.see,united states troy,cir.but if instead it is insufficient evidence,he must vault over the clear and gross injustice hurdle too.see,acosta colon,at explaining that the already high bar for plain error becomes even higher when dealing with an unpreserved challenge,requiring a criminal defendant to show a clear and gross injustice for reversal internal quotations omitted.he has made neither showing,however.
reduced to its essentials,makes it a felony for a person required to register as a sex offender to commit certain sex crimes involving a minor,including crimes under,and remember,the jury convicted jones of violating c,b,and b jones reads involving a minor to mean involving a real minor.we have not spoken on the issue.but the eleventh circuit has,the government is quick to point out,citing united states slaughter,cir 
relying on its circuit law,slaughter noted that a b conviction for attempted enticement does not require an actual child victim.see at discussing united states root,cir.and so,slaughter added,a conviction does not require an actual child victim either,at least when that conviction is based on a violation.see at.slaughter drew comfort from the fact that chapter uses the phrase actual minor three times,in a b ii,c,and e,but not in showing,slaughter said,that congress knows how to add the actual minor language when it wants to.see at.slaughter also emphasized how its conclusion jibed with the purpose behind these laws,which is to protect children from sex predators.id.at.surely congress could not have intended to let repeat sex offenders off simply because they enticed somebody they believed to be a child,rather than an actual child,slaughter concluded.id.
turning back to our case,we point out the judge jury charge below and unchallenged here said a couple of important things first,that none of the predicate offenses c,b,and b require s that an actual child exists and second,that the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that jones committed at least one of these crimes while required to register as a sex offender.whether right or wrong and we express no opinion,one way or the other,these instructions are the law for our case because they are not patently incorrect,given decisions from other circuits we have not ruled on the issue see,united states,cir,vacated on other grounds.and when combined with slaughter holding that does not require an actual victim if the predicate crime does not the only holding from any court,jones can not show either a plain error,see batchu,at,or a clear and gross injustice,see acosta colon,at describing how hard it is to meet that standard.
desperate for a way around the problem,jones spends a lot of time arguing that slaughter is irrelevant,for example because that case involved an conviction under b while his does not.at best,jones has done no more than raise the possibility of a reasonable dispute about what requires which gets him nowhere,because at the risk of sounding like an ipod stuck on repeat an error subject to reasonable dispute is not plain error.see,marcus,at.still hoping against hope,jones also suggests that two of his three predicate convictions specifically,his convictions under and constitute a violation.but he discusses the issue only in his reply brief and so has waived the argument.see,united states hall,cir.
to summarize succinctly,because jones preferred approach to the issue is far from obvious,the judge did not plainly err in not taking it up on his own.obviously nothing said here whispers even the faintest hint of how we might someday rule on the merits of the question.see caraballo rodriguez,at explaining that our holding did not constitute a ruling on the merits concerning how to read the statute in play.
two sets of arguments down,two to go.
the life sentences 
jones says that we must vacate his life sentences on counts and,offering a bunch of reasons.commendably,the government agrees,though for slightly different reasons.we think the government analysis is.
we start with count,which,the reader will recall,charged jones with violating c by crossing state lines to engage in a sexual act with a person under.sexual act means among other things the penetration,however slight,of the anal or genital opening of another by a hand or finger or by any object,with an intent to abuse,humiliate,harass,degrade,or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.c.and c so far as relevant here requires emphasis ours a life sentence i f the defendant has previously been convicted of another federal offense under this subsection,or a state offense that would have been an offense under either such provision had the offense occurred in a federal prison.the judge at sentencing concluded that jones new jersey conviction qualified as a predicate offense under c.looking at the judgment and the statute of conviction not at what jones did to trigger the statute application,see descamps united states,we respectfully disagree.
the judgment shows that a jury convicted jones on a indictment for aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child.see stat.ann.and.the judgment also says that the latter count merge d into the former.so we like the parties zero in on.
section provides that a person is guilty of aggravated sexual assault if he commits an act of sexual penetration with another person and t he victim is less than years old.one reason that section can not qualify as a c predicate and one is all we need is that unlike c,does not require proof that the defendant acted with the intent to degrade,humiliate,arouse,see in re,a d,explaining how lacks that intent element.enough said on that.
now on to count,which,the reader will remember,charged jones with infracting b by using the internet to entice a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.unlike c,b does not have a proviso.but another statute e does.and the judge relied on that statute in imposing the life sentence on count.
section e pertinently provides that a person who is convicted of a federal sex offense in which a minor is the victim shall be sentenced to life imprisonment if the person has a prior sex conviction in which a minor was the victim.section e a lists nine crimes that qualify as federal sex offenses,including c the only one that matters here.also,e b and c say among other things that a prior sex conviction includes a state sex offense,which is an offense that consists of conduct that would constitute a federal sex offense.and so we are left with the question whether jones state conduct would constitute a crime under c a question we have already answered no,given how and c do not share the same intent element.ultimately,then,e can not be the basis for the life sentence.
one final matter,and we are done.
the sentences on the other counts 
the government says that if we vacate the life sentences,then the judge should get to reassess the sentences on the remaining counts as well,presumably because it believes that our
