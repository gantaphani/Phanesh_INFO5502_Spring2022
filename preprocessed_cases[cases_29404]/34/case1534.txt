a federal jury convicted defendant mohammed keita of various charges related to credit and debit card fraud.defendant appeals,arguing that the district court should have dismissed the government case based on the speedy trial act erred in allowing certain business records into evidence and miscalculated the loss at sentencing.for the reasons that follow,we reject defendant arguments and affirm.
on january,pursuant to a search warrant based on a credit card fraud investigation,federal agents searched defendant residence.there,they seized laptop computers containing stolen credit card information,credit and debit cards bearing defendant name but with stolen credit card information,numerous credit card receipts,and a device for credit cards.that same day,the agents arrested defendant.
on february,with defendant consent,the government moved for a continuance of the time period to file an indictment under the speedy trial act,stating that the parties were engaged in plea negotiations.the district court granted the motion and extended the deadline for filing an indictment through march.the court later granted a second consent motion seeking a continuance to april,because an grand jury investigation and plea discussions are being conducted.plea negotiations ultimately failed,and defendant was indicted on april,for three counts of access device fraud,three counts of aggravated identity theft,one count of possession of counterfeit access devices,and one count of possession of equipment.
at trial in august,the jury viewed store surveillance videos and still photographs of defendant using cloned credit and debit cards.loss prevention investigator robert fogel explained that 
a cloned credit card is a copy of someone credit card b asically somebody has skimmed your credit card or taken your credit card and run it through a skimmer,taken the information off the magnetic strip on the back.then they transfer that information onto a blank credit card,onto the magnetic strip,and then they have a copy or a clone of your credit card and they can go out and use it as they wish.
the government presented evidence that defendant used the cloned cards to purchase,among other things,thousands of dollars worth of gift cards and cigarettes.the government witnesses included loss prevention specialists from two stores where defendant used the cloned cards,individuals whose credit cards defendant had cloned,fraud investigators from american express and chase bank,a computer forensic expert who analyzed defendant computers,and the lead detective who investigated the case.defendant called one witness,who testified that the apartment federal agents searched was leased to someone other than defendant.
the jury convicted defendant on all counts.at sentencing,the district court determined that as a conservative matter the government has clearly established as the amount of the loss here,and imposed a total sentence of months imprisonment.defendant appeals.
defendant first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on asserted violations of his rights under the speedy trial act we review de novo a district court interpretation of the speedy trial act,while we review any of the court related factual findings for clear error.united states leftenant,cir.
the speedy trial act provides that a ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.b.an indictment filed in violation of the time limit must be dismissed.a.
however,certain delays shall be excluded when calculating the time period.h.two are relevant here first,a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant shall be excluded.h.we have interpreted other proceedings to include plea negotiations.leftenant,at.second,a ny period of delay resulting from a continuance,if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial shall be excluded.h see zedner united states,d discussing continuances,which permit a district court to grant a continuance and to exclude the resulting delay if the court,after considering certain factors,makes findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the public and defendant interests in a speedy trial.
in this case,defendant was arrested on january.absent any excluded delay,the government was required under the speedy trial act to file an indictment by march.however,the parties twice jointly requested additional time to discuss a potential resolution of the case.the district court accordingly granted two continuances the first secured a continuance until march,and the second secured a continuance until april.both orders granting the continuances specifically found that the grand jury investigation and plea discussions warranted the continuances and that the resulting periods of delay served the ends of justice.the periods of delay resulting from these continuances are therefore excluded in computing the time period.see h,h leftenant,at.
applying the exclusions,the speedy trial clock began on february the day after defendant arrest and stopped on february when the first continuance was granted.see united states stoudenmire,cir noting that the day of the event that triggers the speedy trial clock is not included in the calculation the clock begins to run the following day.it resumed on april when the second continuance lapsed and stopped again on april when the indictment was filed.thus,a total of twelve days elapsed,well within the speedy trial act limit.consequently,the district court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss based on purported speedy trial act violations.
with his next argument,defendant contends that the introduction of business records relating to cardholders who did not testify at trial violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation.he further argues that those records were irrelevant.
whereas we generally review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,united states perkins,cir,when a defendant fails to make a specific and timely objection at trial,our review is restricted to plain error.united states cabrera beltran,cir.to prevail under the plain error standard,the defendant must show there was an error,the error was plain,and the error affected the defendant substantial rights.united states boykin,cir citing.b and united states olano,d.the correction of plain error lies within our discretion,which we may exercise if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,or the defendant is actually innocent.id.
here,defendant objected to the business records on hearsay grounds to preserve a claim that a district court erred in admitting certain evidence,a party must,on the record a timely object or move to strike and b state the specific ground,unless it was apparent from the context.a.a hearsay objection at trial can not be understood to include a confrontation clause objection cabrera beltran,at.because defendant failed to preserve his objections on confrontation clause and relevance grounds,we review the asserted errors for plain error.
the confrontation clause states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.in accordance with the confrontation clause,t estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial are admitted only where the declarant is unavailable,and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to.crawford washington,d.the supreme court has explained that the confrontation clause bars only testimonial statements because o nly statements of this sort cause the declarant to be a witness within the meaning of the confrontation clause.davis washington,d.the core class of testimonial statements includes
