no mother wants to see her daughter go to prison,no matter how frayed their relationship.in some cases,a mother may attempt to take the blame for her daughter crime.pennsylvania,like the federal system,requires courts to evaluate such inculpatory statements for indicia of truthfulness in order to ensure that justice is not being subverted.here,on the eve of candice staruh homicide trial,her mother lois confessed to a horrific crime during an interview with a defense investigator despite having denied responsibility for two and a half years.when she did confess,she refused to do so under circumstances that would have subjected her to criminal liability.for example,she never confessed to the prosecutor and she refused to testify at trial.a pennsylvania court refused to admit lois hearsay confession at her daughter trial,and the district court denied the daughter petition for a writ of habeas corpus.on appeal,candice staruh argues that this refusal to admit a hearsay confession violated her due process right to present her defense.she relies heavily upon the supreme court decision in chambers mississippi.for the reasons stated below we will affirm.
on october,emergency medical services responded to a call concerning an unresponsive child at a home in newville,pennsylvania.when they arrived,jordan was not breathing and did not have a pulse.the emergency medical technicians emts observed bruises all over jordan body,with some that were particularly severe across his ribs.they also noticed vomit on the floor,on jordan face and neck,and in his mouth.
jordan mother,candice staruh,is the in this case.the emts asked her about the bruising and she told them that the bruising was caused by a combination of prior falls and horseplay with jordan brother kamden.staruh told them that jordan fell off of a stool and hit his head on a metal door before he fell onto the floor.ja.jordan was transported to carlisle hospital,where hospital staff were unable to revive him.staruh repeated her version of the story to the coroner and to the investigating police officers that jordan had fallen off of a stool and that the bruises were the result of prior falls and horseplay with kamden.
a forensic pathologist conducted an autopsy of jordan during which significant bruising to jordan abdomen,sides,and back were examined.the pathologist concluded that the bruises were a mix of older and more recent injuries,and that they were too severe to have been caused by his brother.he also found gray material,consistent with duct tape,on jordan back,and the pattern of bruising on the abdomen and back were consistent with being bound by duct tape.the pathologist determined that jordan death was caused by blunt force trauma to the head and neck and deemed the manner of death to be a homicide.
the police investigation noted the deplorable state of the house where staruh lived with her three children jordan,kamden,and an infant brother.the house was owned by staruh mother,lois,who also lived with staruh and the children.investigators saw diapers on the floor,kitchen faucets that did not work,a sink overflowing with dirty dishes,and toilets that were used without water.the house smelled of garbage,and animal droppings were found throughout the kitchen.
staruh was arrested and charged with first and third degree murder,aggravated assault,and endangering the welfare of a child.lois was also arrested and shortly thereafter,on june,pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of children.at her plea agreement hearing,her attorney added that lois was not admitting to causing any injury to jordan,as she had only violated her duty of care regarding the condition of her home.
while in jail awaiting trial,staruh told one cellmate that she had made sandwiches for her children on the day of jordan death.according to this version,jordan was sitting on a stool,tearing his sandwich apart,which caused her to become angry.she told this cellmate that she backhanded jordan,causing him to flip off of his stool and hit his head on the heater.staruh told another cellmate that when she woke up,she found jordan in the kitchen making a mess and so she slapped him,causing him to fall and hit his head on the entertainment stand.
on october,kamden and the infant were placed in foster care.kamden made comments to several people about what he saw on the night that his younger brother jordan died.first,in a videotaped interview with karen helfman,a child interview specialist at children resource center,kamden was asked about his friend jordan.ja kamden said that jordan was in heaven now because his mother smacked his face,causing jordan to fill up with green oil,which helfman took to mean vomit.kamden moved in with the eisenhart family,and he told tina eisenhart how his mom killed his friend jordan when she hit him.he told her that mommy hit jordan and pushed him back into a door and he fell down and died.ja.he also told eisenhart that he had a secret,which was that he saw mommy kill jordan.ja.finally,kamden and staruh interacted at a supervised children and youth visit where jimmy jackson kamden father and jonathan jackson kamden and jordan infant brother were present.a children and youth services employee named jason sullivan walked into the room,where kamden was underneath a chair.kamden said jason,i have something to tell you.the day that jordan died mommy pushed him and he died.ja.when staruh asked how he knew that,kamden said i saw you.ja.
on december,after the prosecution asserted its intention to call kamden to testify,a preliminary hearing was held in the presiding judge chambers pursuant to the tender years doctrine at the hearing,kamden was able to communicate well and was knowledgeable about the world around him.he showed his understanding of the importance of telling the truth and repeatedly expressed confidence that he could remember the events that occurred two years before when he was four years old.after talking to kamden again during a break in the trial,the trial court found him competent to testify.
lois version of events that she had nothing to do with jordan injuries or his death changed shortly before trial began.staruh mother pleaded guilty only to endangerment of children on june,and her attorney explicitly stated that her guilty plea was limited solely to her violation of her duty of care.staruh investigator interviewed lois on june.during this interview,lois admitted to the investigator that she had abused jordan by hitting him on the ribs with a metal sweeper pipe numerous times,throwing him against the wall where he would hit his head,and restraining him with duct tape to keep him from getting up during the night.she stated,i think i am partly responsible for his death,not candice,ja,and that staruh would only ever yell or hit the baby on the bottom,not on the head or body.she said that i am leaving this in god hands.and i must tell the truth as my daughter does not deserve to die for what i or jackson probably did.ja.despite these revelations,lois stated that if questioned in court,she intended to invoke her fifth amendment privileges.lois was appointed counsel to represent her in her capacity as a witness.
on june,the day that the trial began,lois again spoke to the investigator while he was serving subpoenas on lois two sons.lois said that candice did not hurt jordan it was me i have settled this with god and i will accept what occurs.ja.such acceptance did not,however,include testifying.lois again said that if she were called as a witness she would assert her rights under the fifth amendment because my attorney said i could get in trouble if i say this in court so i ca.ja.on june,lois called the investigator concerning a subpoena that she had received.she said that if she testified her parole officer would put her in jail,and i do want to go to jail,but that her daughter was innocent and she wanted to help her.ja.lois also said that she had something important to tell the investigator.at this point,the investigator told her not to speak further about the case,as she now had counsel and everything that she said to him would be memorialized.
after trial began on june,kamden and the three persons whom he made statements to testified for the prosecution.staruh defense implied that it was lois,not staruh,who killed jordan.she elicited testimony from kamden that he sometimes called lois mom from karen helfman that when she asked kamden his mother name he said something that sounded like lettuce from the of one of staruh brothers that both staruh and lois treated jordan poorly and lois beat jordan and from the same that staruh was shy,while lois was dominant and controlling.
staruh,who testified on her own behalf,stated that lois abused jordan and had abused staruh as a child.she said that she was afraid of her mother,which was why she never left her house,and that she had recently been diagnosed with battered woman syndrome.staruh also testified that on the day that jordan died,he was on a stool watching cartoons.she said that she laid down for a few seconds,but got up when she heard jordan fall.according to her,she went over to check on him,and when she turned around kamden told her that jordan was getting sick.staruh testified that jordan was throwing up,having trouble breathing,and looked like a baby doll.ja.while lois attempted to perform cpr,staruh ran next door to a neighbor house to call.at trial,her story of the bruises differed from what she had told the emts,coroner,and the police throughout the investigation that they were caused by previous falls and horseplay with his brother kamden.instead,she placed full blame for the bruises on her mother,lois.however,she never identified her mother as the cause of jordan death,saying i did see her do anything that caused him to actually die.ja.
during the trial,but outside the presence of the jury,defense counsel called lois as a witness.lois said that she was unwilling to testify and asserted her fifth amendment right to refuse to do so.defense counsel sought to have her assert the fifth amendment in the presence of the jury,which the trial court denied.following this ruling,defense counsel moved for permission to introduce the statements that lois had made to the investigator as statements against her penal interests pursuant to pennsylvania rule of evidence b.however,the trial court denied this motion,concluding that the statements lacked the indicia of trustworthiness required under rule b to introduce a statement against penal interest.
the jury acquitted staruh of first degree murder,but found her guilty of third degree murder,aggravated assault,and endangering the welfare of a child.in september of,staruh was sentenced to to years imprisonment.
staruh filed a direct appeal arguing,among other things,that if lois invocation of the fifth amendment was proper,the court should have admitted her statements to the defense investigator.in its opinion in support of its judgment,the trial court stated,the circumstances surrounding the statements demonstrate their untrustworthiness.ja.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed,holding that the circumstances surrounding the statements against interest do not provide assurance of their reliability.ja.specifically,the superior court noted that lois had repeatedly claimed that she bore no responsibility for jordan death for two and a half years before confessing on the first day of trial,that her confession came right before her daughter was to be tried for murder,and that she asserted her intention to invoke the fifth amendment when she realized that she could be tried for murder herself.
staruh argued before the superior court as she argues before us that the supreme court decision in chambers mississippi,mandated reversal.the superior court rejected this argument,holding that the inculpatory declarations in chambers were more credible,and therefore distinguishable,for three reasons unlike in chambers,lois never signed a written confession and never intended to be held accountable for her statements lois asserted her privilege against and was unavailable to testify,whereas in chambers the confessor testified under oath and the trial court erred in not allowing about his confession and the confessor in chambers had no reason to incriminate himself,while lois had an interest in preventing her daughter from being convicted of murder.
the pennsylvania supreme court denied staruh petition for allowance of appeal.staruh then filed a pro se post conviction relief act pcra petition.counsel was appointed,but subsequently withdrew and filed a letter.the pcra petition was dismissed as raising arguments that had previously been litigated,such as the chambers claim before us,and because allegations concerning newly discovered evidence were without merit.staruh did not pursue this action further in state court 
in,staruh filed a timely pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,raising ten claims.magistrate judge smyser issued a report and recommendation that recommended denying the habeas petition,which judge caputo adopted.however,upon staruh later petition to amend,judge caputo vacated the order and granted her leave to amend her exhausted,claims in her amended petition,staruh argued,among other issues,that the state trial court erred in not allowing the defense investigator to testify that lois told him that she was at fault for jordan death.staruh had counsel appointed to represent her in the habeas proceedings.
magistrate judge schwab issued a report and recommendation holding that the superior court determination that lois statements were not made under circumstances that provided considerable assurance of their reliability was reasonable.ja.specifically,the report and recommendation stated that g iven the differences between this case and chambers,staruh can not show that the superior court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of chambers,staruh winstead,ecf.because staruh also failed to show that the superior court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,she was not entitled to habeas relief in adopting the report and recommendation,the district court noted the significant factual differences between this case and chambers and that lois extrajudicial statements were not reliable.staruh winstead,wl,at.in a slightly different analysis from the superior court,the district court focused on three indicia of reliability in chambers that were lacking here that the statements in chambers were made immediately after the homicide,while the statements here were made on the eve of trial that the extrajudicial statements in chambers could be confirmed by the sworn confession of the third party,while here there was no corroborative evidence to confirm lois statements regarding her culpability and that the party in chambers who made the extrajudicial statements was present at trial and could be,while lois invoked the fifth amendment and was unavailable to testify.id.
the district court had jurisdiction over staruh habeas petition pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over the district court order denying staruh habeas petition pursuant to and our review of the district court decision is plenary because no evidentiary hearing was held.eley erickson,cir.we therefore review the superior court decision under the same standard that the district court was required to apply.lewis horn,cir.
we apply the highly deferential standard imposed by aedpa.d renico lett,aedpa thus imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings.quoting lindh murphy.aedpa prohibits the federal courts from granting habeas relief unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or if it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,id.d.the supreme court has called this standard difficult to meet,harrington richter,and it demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.woodford visciotti,per curiam.
