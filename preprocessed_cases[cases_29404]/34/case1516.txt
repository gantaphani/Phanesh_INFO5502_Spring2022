during the course of a grand jury investigation,the government subpoenaed a year old man doe or appellee to testify with regard to potential federal charges against his father doe doe moved to quash the subpoena pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c,claiming that his testimony was shielded by a purported privilege.the district court granted the motion.
no federal appellate court has recognized a privilege,and we decline to do so here.as explained more fully below,doe has not made a strong showing of need for the privilege,and reason and experience do not warrant creation of the privilege in the face of substantial authority to the contrary.therefore,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on november,hartford county,maryland sheriff deputies responded to a domestic assault complaint from doe mother.at this time,year old doe lived in the house with his parents and two minor siblings.the deputies arrived and conducted a search.they seized approximately firearms,including two rifles,a pistol,a loaded handgun,and an ak assault rifle equipment used to alter and convert firearms,torches,welding equipment,and saws and in the basement,marijuana plants growing in buckets and drug paraphernalia.
domestic abuse charges were filed against doe,but doe later dropped them.and doe thereafter separated,and doe moved in with his father because he claims he was was kicked out of the house by his mother.doe now lives exclusively with doe,who helps to pay for his college education and supports him financially.doe also testified that he has an aunt who helps with his college bills,and if she did not,he would not have been able to go to college this year.id.at.
the government began investigating the events of november,and referred the case to a grand jury for possible prosecution pursuant to d on october,the government subpoenaed doe to determine the ownership of the illegal guns found at the doe home.appellant br.
doe filed a motion to quash with the district court on october,explaining that he believed he was called upon to testify as part of an ongoing investigation of federal criminal charges pending against his father.he contends that enforcing the government subpoena would violate the privilege 
in a case like this,where the government seeks to solidify a criminal case against the father by compelling the child testimony,the necessary conclusion on the child part will be that he,doe,is responsible for his father prosecution.the damage to the relationship is,under these circumstances,as certain as it is incalculable.
on october,the district court held a hearing on the motion to quash,at which doe at that time years old testified.the following exchange occurred 
the government i f you testify truthfully are you saying that your dad would not cut you off 
q he would cut you off 
q he would not cut you off.would he hold it against you 
a would he hold it against me no.
nonetheless,doe said that he had significant anxiety about testifying against his father,and provided doctors notes to that effect.
at the district court hearing,the government argued that there would be no negative ramifications resulting from doe testifying.because doe had invoked her spousal privilege and the government did not intend to call the two minor doe children as witnesses,the government asserted it needed doe testimony to fully explore all the evidence in this case to do a complete and thorough investigation.id.the government noted,there is a chance that there were other people in the house besides doe that might be responsible for the automatic weapons.id.at 
the district court granted the motion to quash from the bench,explaining,in part,
the fact of the matter is,based upon the testimony as i have heard it,there is a continuing relationship between doe and his dad.doe.age is certainly not as old as some of the people in the other cases.i not sure quite how age cuts.if i had a very young person,i would be concerned about abuse.and there is a potential for abuse in this doe,if he were to testify,despite what he knew about his father perception,certainly there would be a n incentive for the father to cut him off now.and if the father is convicted,then a source of income is cut off,so doe,might not be able to continue in college as he is now doing,nor have his necessities provided for.
but in the final analysis it has to do with one perception of the proper role of government.
o ne must be concerned about the intersection of government and individual privacy rights.and the government has every reason to be concerned here.and i not suggesting in any way that they being motivated improperly by seeking this testimony.but i think the privilege does exist.it must be considered on a basis.
hearing the evidence before me,i think that the relationship between doe and his father does create the privilege.and doe does not have to testify in the grand jury.i not despite what i said,i not being critical of the government.i very suspicious about the relationship,of the possession of the automatic weapons and the growing of marijuana in pots in the basement.but i do think that my suspicions about that provide an adequate reason for me to say that the government and society interests trump those constitutional the privacy rights of doe.
so i find the privilege exists and grant the motion to quash.

federal rule of evidence provides,t he common law as interpreted by united states courts in the light of reason and experience governs a claim of privilege unless any of the following provides otherwise the united states constitution,a federal statute or rules prescribed by the supreme court.hereinafter,rule emphasis supplied.rule allows for recognition of a privilege based on a confidential relationship on a basis.jaffee redmond,d recognizing privilege under the reason and experience clause of rule internal quotations marks omitted see also trammel united states,d congress manifested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law on privilege.its purpose was to provide the courts with the flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a basis,and to leave the door open to change.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.rule,therefore,leaves the door open for courts to adopt new commonlaw privileges,and modify existing ones,in appropriate cases.united states sterling,cir.
in trammel,however,the supreme court cautioned,
t estimonial exclusionary rules and privileges contravene the fundamental principle that the public has a right to every man evidence.as such,they must be strictly construed and accepted only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.
at internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted see also sterling,at as the supreme court made clear in jaffee,the federal courts latitude for adopting evidentiary privileges under rule remains quite narrow indeed.
only a very small handful of federal district courts in this country have recognized the privilege.the district of nevada created the privilege where a minor child was issued a subpoena to offer grand jury testimony against his father.see in re agosto.the court concluded that the privilege is based not only on the confidential nature of specific communications between parent and child,but also upon the privacy which is a constitutionally protectable interest of the family in american society.id.at.the court also reasoned,the relationship exhibits similarities not only to the spousal relationship,which is based upon love and affection,but to the rela
