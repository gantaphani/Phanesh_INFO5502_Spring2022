clive mcfarlane was convicted of one count of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of g and was sentenced to months of imprisonment.mcfarlane appeals,claiming that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress and committed several trial errors.we affirm.
the government presented the following evidence at trial.just before on april,david delehoy,a detective with the brockton,massachusetts police department,was traveling through a section of brockton on his way to work.while stopped at a traffic light,detective delehoy,who was dressed in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car,saw a group of people standing in an abandoned parking lot and heard three loud explosions,which he thought were gun shots.
detective delehoy turned in the direction from which he thought the gun shots originated and saw a man sprinting away from the group in the parking lot.he followed the man,later identified as antwone moore,before losing sight of him behind several buildings.after a few seconds,delehoy again spotted moore,this time walking rapidly.at the same time,delehoy also saw a second male,later identified as clive mcfarlane,following approximately feet behind moore.
delehoy observed moore looking repeatedly over his shoulder at mcfarlane.soon,moore began running across another vacant lot.delehoy sped ahead,stopped his car at the end of the lot,and asked moore if he needed help or a ride.delehoy left his car,identified himself as a police officer,showed his badge to moore,and ordered him to show his hands.moore,who appeared relieved by delehoy presence,said that mcfarlane was trying to shoot him.
delehoy then saw mcfarlane approach a set of trash cans along the path moore had traveled.delehoy,who had an unobstructed view of mcfarlane,saw him remove a liner from the trash can,lean into the can with both arms,and stand up to replace the liner.this led delehoy to believe that mcfarlane might have put something in the can.delehoy,with his gun drawn and badge displayed,moved toward mcfarlane and ordered him to raise his hands and get down on the ground.mcfarlane shouted profanity at delehoy but complied with the order.delehoy called for help and remained several feet from mcfarlane until another officer arrived.
seconds later,officer robert smith arrived on the scene and,at delehoy command,handcuffed mcfarlane.after mcfarlane was handcuffed,delehoy went to the trash can into which mcfarlane had reached.he removed the liner and found a revolver containing six spent ammunition cases.
at trial,mcfarlane testified in his own defense.he stated that he and moore had a physical altercation in the abandoned parking lot,during which moore attempted to shoot him with the revolver that was later found in the trash can.mcfarlane explained that moore then fled,but mcfarlane followed,stopping to look in the trash can out of curiosity.
motion to suppress 
prior to trial,mcfarlane filed a motion to suppress,claiming that his detention and arrest violated the fourth amendment to the constitution because there was neither probable cause for the arrest nor reasonable suspicion for the detention.after an evidentiary hearing the district court denied the motion,concluding that there was reasonable suspicion to detain mcfarlane for an investigative stop under terry ohio,d,and that delehoy permissibly ordered mcfarlane to the ground because he may have been dangerous.
in considering the denial of a motion to suppress,we review questions of law de novo and factual findings for clear error,see united states vongkaysone,cir,and will affirm the district court decision if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it,see united states garcia,cir.in resolving mcfarlane challenge,we bypass the district court terry stop analysis because we conclude,in accord with the government alternative position,that delehoy had probable cause to arrest mcfarlane at the moment he ordered him to the ground 
an arrest does not contravene the fourth amendment prohibition on unreasonable seizures so long as the arrest is supported by probable cause.see united states fiasconaro,cir.probable cause exists when police officers,relying on reasonably trustworthy facts and circumstances,have information upon which a reasonably prudent person would believe the suspect committed or was committing a crime.united states burhoe,cir.the inquiry into probable cause to support an arrest focuses on what the officer knew at the time of the arrest,and should evaluate the totality of the circumstances.see united states jones,cir.
mcfarlane contends that there was no basis for his arrest when delehoy ordered him to the ground because at that point the only information available to delehoy was moore uncorroborated statement that mcfarlane had tried to shoot him.we disagree.
when delehoy made the arrest,he had substantially more information than moore word that a crime had taken place.before the arrest,delehoy heard several gun shots from a close distance and then observed mcfarlane following moore in what appeared to be a chase.he saw moore sprinting away from mcfarlane and looking back over his shoulder several times to check on mcfarlane distance.he also saw what he thought was mcfarlane attempt to hide an object in a trash can by removing a liner,placing both hands in the can,and then replacing the liner.see united states meade,cir noting that suspicious maneuvers are relevant to the probable cause inquiry.
after watching the chase,delehoy stopped moore and identified himself as a police officer.moore appeared relieved by the presence of a police officer and informed delehoy that mcfarlane had tried to shoot him.
a statement from a source can constitute the basis for probable cause,even if the source is previously unknown to the officer,so long as there is a sufficient basis for crediting the source reliability.see vongkaysone,at.here,there was a sufficient basis for delehoy to credit moore statement.moore made the statement to delehoy,which supports the statement reliability because the nature of the encounter permitted delehoy to observe moore apparent relief when he realized that a police officer was present.this conduct was consistent with moore claim that someone was trying to shoot him.see united states romain,cir a encounter provides police officers the opportunity to perceive and evaluate personally an informant mannerisms,expressions and tone of voice and,thus,to assess the informant veracity more readily.the nature of the encounter also allowed delehoy to learn moore identity and appearance so he could hold him responsible if the information provided later turned out to be false.see florida,d.furthermore,after moore made the statement,delehoy saw mcfarlane appear to hide something in the trash can,which was consistent with moore assertion that mcfarlane had tried to shoot him.see united states greenburg,cir stating that an officer observation of conduct consistent with the informant tip supports the tip veracity.
in sum,delehoy saw a chase between two men after hearing gun shots and then learned from one participant of the chase that the other had tried to shoot him.the circumstances under which moore made this statement to delehoy supported its veracity,as did mcfarlane peculiar conduct in going to the trash can.p robable cause is a common sense,nontechnical conception that deal s with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men,not legal technicians,act.united states meade,cir quoting ornelas united states,d alterations in original internal quotation marks and additional citation omitted.under this standard,we conclude that delehoy had probable cause to arrest mcfarlane after he saw him go into the trash can.the motion to suppress was correctly denied.
jury instructions 
mcfarlane also challenges two aspects of the district court jury instructions.first,he claims that the court did not adequately explain the concept of constructive possession as applied to this case,and second,he challenges the district court instruction concerning the significance of his indictment in the jury deliberations.
we discern no abuse of discretion in
