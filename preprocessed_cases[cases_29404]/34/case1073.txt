this is an appeal from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,leisure,j.the primary issue we consider is whether the doctrine of conscious avoidance applies to the money laundering charge in this case arising out of a government sting operation.we hold that it does.
the doctrine of conscious avoidance is indeed susceptible of several attacks nektalov is not one of them.rejecting this and nektalov other challenges,we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.
background 
roman nektalov roman or nektalov was indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of,and four substantive counts of conducting,or attempting to conduct,financial transactions involving cash represented by law enforcement officers to be the proceeds of narcotics trafficking,in violation of a a,b c and.the indictment also sought criminal forfeiture pursuant to of an aggregate sum of money and loose diamonds seized from nektalov.the charges stemmed from a government sting operation conducted by an undercover government agent,miguel herrera,with the aid of a cooperating witness,edward delgado,involving the laundering of funds represented to be the proceeds of international narcotics trafficking.
during a two week jury trial,the government presented voluminous evidence of delgado and herrera meetings with roman and his son,eduard,in their store,roman jewelers.these meetings,many of which were,resulted in arrangements for four cash sales,three for gold and one for diamonds.the first was a sale completed in early august of three kilograms of gold in exchange for approximately in bills of small denominations the second,completed in late august,was for another three kilograms of gold in exchange for in cash and the third,completed in october,was for three kilograms of gold in exchange for in cash.the fourth transaction arranged was a sale of diamonds to herrera in exchange for cash.on the day of the sale,herrera and delgado met the nektalovs in a private room at roman jewelers,herrera bringing with him approximately in cash in a knapsack.although roman had not participated in the prior planning of this transaction,he did actively take part on the day of the sale as eduard and herrera selected the diamonds to be sold.when the diamonds had been selected,herrera said he would leave the in cash with delgado and the nektalovs and retrieve the balance of the.after herrera left,federal agents entered the store and arrested both eduard and roman,as well as delgado to maintain his cover,and seized the diamonds involved in the transaction.
the government evidence included voluminous tape recordings and transcripts of the conversations among roman,eduard,delgado and herrera that,the government argued,proved that the cash had been represented as and was believed to be the proceeds of narcotics trafficking.the premise for the transactions,as delgado and herrera explained to the nektalovs,was that some product,stuff or shit was being brought into this country from colombia and sold in the streets for cash in small denominations,and that herrera was interested in moving gold or moving diamonds back down to colombia through couriers.herrera explained that he had to pay by cash in small denominations because t hat how they pay me in the streets.to prove roman understanding of the illicit source of the cash and herrera ostensible reason for converting the cash to gold or diamonds,the government introduced roman statements to delgado regarding herrera young man,very smart he put the money in the diamond.it better way.
nektalov did not deny that the transactions occurred,but submitted that the case turned on whether when these transactions were taking place they were taking place with the knowledge and with the distinct belief on the part of roman jewelers and particularly roman nektalov that these monies were coming from drug traffickers.emphasizing nektalov difficulties with the english language,his counsel argued that nektalov did not catch the innuendos of illicit activity colombians,stuff,shit t here is no proof in this record that roman understood any of those words,not one.
instructing the jury on how it should assess that crucial issue of nektalov belief,and over nektalov objection,the court charged 
in determining whether the defendant acted knowingly and intentionally,you may consider whether the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious.
i would like to point out that the necessary knowledge can not be established by showing that the defendant was careless,negligent or foolish.one may not,however,wilfully and intentionally remain ignorant of a fact material and important to his or her conduct in order to escape the consequences of criminal law.if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that there was a high probability that,for example,the money in which he was conducting financial transactions was the proceeds of narcotics trafficking,but deliberately and consciously avoided confirming this fact,then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of positive knowledge as the equivalent of knowledge,unless you find that the defendant actually believed that the money in which he was conducting a financial transaction was not the proceeds of drug trafficking 
the jury returned a guilty verdict on one count of money laundering in violation of a a b and and a verdict of not guilty with respect to all other counts although the sentencing guidelines provided for a range of to months imprisonment,the court departed downward in sentencing nektalov and imposed a ten month split sentence five months imprisonment and five months home confinement,to be followed by a two year term of supervised release.nektalov was released on bail pending appeal.
discussion 
doctrine of conscious avoidance 
we review the propriety of a jury instruction de novo.see united states wilkerson,cir.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury of the law.id.quoting united states walsh,cir.where,as here,a defendant requested a different jury instruction from the one actually given,the defendant bears the burden of showing that the requested instruction accurately represented the law in every respect and that,viewing as a whole the charge actually given,he was prejudiced.id.quoting united states abelis,cir.
we previously have explored in depth the origins of the doctrine of conscious avoidance.the modern doctrine,as articulated by the united states supreme court in leary united states,d,is that w hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense,such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence,unless he actually believes that it does not exist.id.at.quoting model penal code,at proposed official draft.see also united states reyes,cir.thus,a conscious avoidance instruction is warranted 
i when a defendant asserts the lack of some specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction,united states civelli,cir,and ii the appropriate factual predicate for the charge exists,the evidence is such that a rational juror may reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.
united states,cir quoting united states rodriguez,cir.
nektalov submits two reasons why the conscious avoidance charge should not have been given.first,he argues that the doctrine can not apply to criminal activity arising out of a government sting operation.second,he argues that even if the doctrine may apply to some sting cases,the charge was unwarranted here because there was an insufficient factual predicate.
aspect of knowledge required for conviction 
nektalov argument that the doctrine of conscious avoidance has no place in sting prosecutions possesses a syllogistic logic.the first premise of the argument is that knowledge is not required for a conviction under a belief is.the argument second premise is that the doctrine of conscious avoidance applies only when knowledge is required for conviction.accordingly,nektalov contends that the doctrine can not apply to a money laundering sting.
we agree with nektalov first premise that a requires belief,rather than knowledge.in a money laundering sting prosecution,the funds used in the transactions are,in fact,not the proceeds of an unlawful activity.conviction under this statute,therefore,can not require that a defendant knew that the funds were the proceeds of an unlawful activity.instead,it requires that the defendant believed the property involved in the transactions to be the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity.a b emphasis added.
nektalov second conscious avoidance applies only when knowledge is invalid.the fallacy lies in nektalov extrapolating from the limits of the word knowledge in the jury charge the limits of the doctrine of conscious avoidance.in fact,the doctrine applies in the context of a sting operation with as much force to one efforts to avoid certain belief as to one efforts to avoid knowledge.
contrary to nektalov contention that belief and knowledge are entirely discrete concepts,belief is more properly understood to be a part of knowledge see,douglas husak craig callender,wilful ignorance,knowledge,and the equal culpability thesis a study of the deeper significance of the principle of legality,g enuine knowledge requires belief because genuine knowledge consists of true belief that is to some extent externally justified.emphasis added.here we are determining the applicability of the conscious avoidance charge in a money laundering sting prosecution.in such a case,any distinction between the concepts of knowledge and belief is a distinction without a difference.
in our opinions examining the doctrine,we have stressed that it is essential to the concept of conscious avoidance that the defendant must be shown to have decided not to learn the key fact,not merely to have failed to learn it through negligence.rodriguez,at emphasis omitted.quoting a scholarly treatise,we said that 
a court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew.he suspected the fact he realised its probability but he refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able to deny knowledge.this,and this alone,is wilful blindness.
reyes,at quoting glanville williams,criminal law the general part,at ed.elsewhere we stated that t he rationale for the conscious avoidance doctrine is that a defendant affirmative efforts to see no evil and hear no evil do not somehow magically invest him with the ability to do no evil.united states adeniji,cir other internal quotation marks omitted.acknowledging that the doctrine is not without detractors,we nevertheless have deemed it a practical necessity given the ease with which a defendant could otherwise escape justice by deliberately refusing to confirm the existence of one or more facts that he believes to be true an end we wish to avoid because we adjudge deliberate ignorance and positive knowledge to be equally culpable.reyes,at emphasis added quoting united states jewell,cir en banc.
against this backdrop the inadequacy of nektalov argument is apparent.the culpability of the wilfully blind defendant lies in his averting his eyes to what he thinks he sees,not in the objective accuracy of his vision.in other words,the applicability of the doctrine does not turn on the truth of the particular proposition in question,but on what the defendant does to avoid reaching subjective certainty mistaken or not about that proposition.thus,conscious avoidance encompasses a defendant deliberately refusing to confirm the existence of one or more facts that he believes to be true,reyes,at emphasis added,regardless of whether those facts actually are true.
accordingly,when a defendant claims as a defense to a violation of a that he did not believe that the property involved in the transaction was the proceeds of an unlawful activity,he has asserted the lack of the specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction of that statute.here,as the district court observed,the focus of nektalov defense was his disbelief in the illicit source of the cash.thus,nektalov assert ed the lack of the specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction,at,under a,and the first condition for the conscious avoidance charge was satisfied.
moreover,the district judge focus on knowledge despite a focus on belief did not render the jury charge erroneous.although knowledge is,fundamentally,belief substantiated by veracity,belief is tantamount to knowledge in the context of a sting operation.the reason is because punishing the target of a sting assumes the veracity of a defendant beliefs insofar as it embraces the legal fiction that the defendant has engaged in a criminal enterprise.thus,a defendant who believes the representations made by informants in a sting can be said to know of the underlying criminal enterprise even though the enterprise does not,in reality,exist.such a defendant knows of the crime in the sense that he is aware that the informants acts are suggestive of illegal behavior.the fact that the acts are staged by law enforcement does not diminish either the defendant guilt or our ability to assess his knowledge or avoidance thereof with respect to his circumstances or the acts of those around him.accordingly,the focus on knowledge in the jury charge did not reflect an incorrect legal standard.united states alfisi,cir.w e will not find reversible error unless a charge either failed to inform the jury adequately of the law or misled the jury as to the correct legal rule.we therefore turn to the second condition.
factual predicate 
next,we consider nektalov claim that the requisite factual predicate did not exist to justify a conscious avoidance instruction.the factual predicate for a conscious avoidance charge is that the evidence is such that a rational juror may reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.id.quoting rodriguez,at.where the evidence could support both a finding of actual knowledge and a finding of conscious avoidance,the government may present conscious avoidance as an argument in the alternative.see united states wong,cir.
however,a conscious avoidance instruction is not appropriate where the only evidence alerting a defendant to the high probability of criminal activity is direct evidence of the illegality itself that is,when the evidence is that the defendant had either actual knowledge or no knowledge at all of the facts in question.united states,cir internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.in the defendant,who was found driving a van that reeked of marijuana,denied any knowledge of the drugs and claimed that she did not recognize the smell of marijuana.id.at.the court held that the conscious avoidance instruction was inappropriate,reasoning that 
i f recognized the smell as that of marijuana,then she knew that there was marijuana in the van.if did not,on the other hand,recognize the smell of marijuana,then she had no reason to be suspicious.her senses either give rise to direct knowledge of illegality,or there is nothing to raise suspicions of illegality at all.
id.at.comparing his case to,nektalov argues that the government evidence is consistent only with a finding of actual knowledge and not conscious avoidance.we disagree.
a jury rationally could find beyond a reasonable doubt that given the circumstances of the transactions in the context of the nektalovs prior dealings with delgado,together with delgado and herrera statements hinting at the source of the cash and their unambiguous intention to transport the gold and diamonds to colombia,nektalov was mistaken but certain that the cash used in the transactions was the proceeds of narcotics trafficking.alternatively,a jury rationally could find beyond a reasonable doubt that nektalov strongly suspected,but was not completely certain,that the cash used in the transactions was the proceeds of narcotics that he deliberately av
