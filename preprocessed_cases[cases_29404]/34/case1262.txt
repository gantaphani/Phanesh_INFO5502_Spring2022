opinion of the court 
warren was indicted on charges of intent to distribute fifty or more grams of crack cocaine in violation of a and b a iii,and possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony in violation of g.he filed a pretrial motion to,inter alia,suppress evidence allegedly obtained in violation of his miranda rights.miranda arizona.the district court granted warren motion in part,as to statements warren made at his home to his state parole agent,but denied it as to statements warren made at the police station after receiving the miranda warning.warren appeals this ruling.we will affirm.
warren later entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to the drug charge.in this agreement,the government states that it will refrain from filing,pursuant to,an information to increase the penalty based upon a prior conviction.on appeal,warren contends that the government breached this provision of the agreement.we will dismiss the breach of plea agreement claim.
we will first address the miranda issue at the police station,warren signaled that he wished to talk.the police officer testimony at the suppression hearing gives an account of what happened next.
i told warren that he had the right to remain silent.anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.you have the right to an attorney.if you can not afford to hire an attorney,one will be appointed to represent you without charge before any questioning if you wish.should you decide to talk to me,you can stop the questioning any time.
suppression hearing,ecf.the record makes clear that the officer did not read this warning from a card,but rather recited it from memory.warren does not challenge the accuracy of the officer testimony.instead,warren argues that the officer testimony evinces a deficient miranda warning because it failed to advise him of his right to an attorney after questioning commenced.
the supreme court stated in miranda,that authorities are obligated to advise a person taken into custody of the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.miranda,at.yet,in the years since miranda,the supreme court has consistently refrained from constructing a particular formula for the warning.in duckworth,the court held the following.
reviewing courts are not required to examine miranda warnings as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.the inquiry is simply whether the warnings reasonably conve y to a suspect his rights as required by miranda.
duckworth eagan,quoting california prysock.the court recently reaffirmed this standard in florida powell,
after powell was arrested,but before the tampa,florida,police questioned him,an officer recited the miranda warning from a card.the officer told powell,inter alia,y ou have the right to talk to a lawyer before answering any of our questions and then that powell had the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview.id.at.at issue was whether the lack of any specific reference to powell right to an attorney during questioning rendered statements he made during the interview inadmissible.powell argued that miranda was clear in its requirement that a person in custody must be advised of the right to counsel during questioning.he asserted that,by qualifying the language about counsel with the phrase before answering any of our questions the warning was deficient because it communicated that his right terminated when questioning began.the supreme court disagreed.
miranda requires that a suspect be informed of the right to have counsel present during questioning.miranda,at.yet,as was highlighted in questioning by justice ginsburg at oral argument,miranda regarded the warning used at that time by the federal bureau of investigation which did not explicitly state any right to counsel at the time of questioning as consistent with its holding.oral argument at,id.at,available at.that warning was characterized in miranda as stating the following.
the person in custody is not required to make a statement,that any statement may be used against him in court,that the individual may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice and that he has a right to free counsel if he is unable to pay.
miranda,at.the court went on to state that this warning could be emulated by state and local enforcement agencies.id.at.therefore,it can not be said that the miranda court regarded an express reference to the temporal durability of this right as elemental to a valid warning.rather,as the powell decision underscores in quoting prysock,attention must be focused upon whether anything in the warning suggested any limitation on the right to the presence of appointed counsel different from the clearly conveyed rights to a lawyer in general,including the right to a lawyer before the suspect is questioned,while he is being questioned,and all during the questioning.powell.at quoting prysock,at internal quotation marks in prysock omitted emphasis added.
powell argued that the warning he received contained such a limitation because it informed him that he had a right to counsel before questioning.the court,however,did not regard this language as fatal to the validity of the warning for two reasons.first,the before language,which is similar to the language of duckworth,merely conveyed when powell right to an attorney became,before he answered any questions at all.powell.at including these additional words did not vitiate the essential information given to the suspect that a right to counsel exists.additionally,the powell court took note of a catch all statement included in the warning at issue,to wit you have the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview.id.at.therefore,the powell court said,i n combination,the two warnings reasonably conveyed powell right to have an attorney present,not only at the outset of interrogation,but at all times.id.at.elaborating upon its assessment of the term reasonably conveyed,the court said the following.
a reasonable suspect in a custodial setting who has just been read his rights,we believe,would not come to the counterintuitive conclusion that he is obligated,or allowed,to hop in and out of the holding area to seek his attorney advice.instead,the suspect would likely assume that he must stay put in the interrogation room and that his lawyer would be there with him the entire time.
id.footnotes omitted.importantly,the court concluded that the warning was sufficient because n othing in the words used indicated that counsel presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.id.at emphasis added.
turning to the warning used in this case,we note that unlike powell the police officer warned warren of his right to counsel without any reference to whether it commenced or ceased at any particular time.warren was told in a straightforward manner y ou have the right to an attorney.therefore,it can not be said that the instant warning explicitly stated a right to counsel.yet,in light of powell,we find it necessary to address whether the lack of any express reference to the right to counsel during interrogation,coupled with the lack of a catch all statement like that used in powell,undermines the validity of the warning.we conclude that it does not.
as a starting point,it is of interest that the officer miranda statement on the right to counsel here is remarkably similar to the warning used by the federal bureau of investigation,which was regarded by the miranda court as consistent with its holding.at as noted earlier,that warning did not make any mention of the right to an attorney during questioning.while not dispositive,this observation is instructive since our analysis turns upon whether the officer statement in this case reasonably conveyed the rights set out in miranda.
warren asserts that the warning could be reasonably interpreted only as limiting his right to counsel.unlike powell,warren offers no rationale for a reasonable person belief that the clear,unmodified statement y ou have the right to an attorney would be regarded as.
we note that the officer did,next,state i f you can not afford to hire an attorney one will be appointed to represent you without charge before any questioning if you wish.yet,we do not find that such a statement referring only to the appointment of pro bono counsel on his behalf can be reasonably interpreted to modify the prior,unqualified declaration of his general right to counsel 
moreover,it is counterintuitive to conclude from this warning that while the general right to counsel is unrestricted,the right to appointed counsel exists only in the moments prior to questioning and ceases the moment that the interview commences.again,the officer said i f you can not afford to hire an attorney,one will be appointed to represent you without charge before any questioning if you wish.like powell and duckworth,we read the officer words as indicating merely that warren right to pro bono counsel became effective before he answered any questions.powell.at.it does not restrict the right to counsel,but rather addresses when the right to appointed counsel is triggered.see duckworth,at.taken as a whole,then,the warning reasonably conveys the substance of the rights expressed in miranda.
with that said,as in powell,we do not regard the warning delivered in this case as the clearest possible statement that could be given.powell.at.moreover,the fact that this exchange occurred in the police station a setting where a card imprinted with the miranda warning should be readily available is disconcerting,considering the resources that have been expended to consider a claim that could have been preempted with minimal care and effort.nonetheless,we examine the warning objectively within the totality of the circumstances.id.from this perspective,we conclude,as in powell,that n othing in the words used indicated that counsel presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.id.therefore,we will affirm the order of the district court.
we now turn to the breach of plea agreement claim warren admitted to his career offender status at the change of plea hearing,and neither the maximum statutory sentence life imprisonment or the guidelines range attributable to his crack cocaine offense to months is disputed rather,warren has argued that the district court should use the guidelines relating to a powder cocaine offense,yielding a range he asserts of to months.
at the sentencing hearing,the government disagreed with the range stated by warren noting that,with warren career offender status,the applicable range would be to months.warren alleges that the government argument constituted breach of the plea agreement,in which the government agreed not to file an information pursuant to warren argument confuses the issue.
it is irrelevant to the breach of plea agreement analysis that the government disagreed with warren argument.warren argued for the application of a powder cocaine guidelines range.the point of reference here is the undisputed sentencing range applicable to warren crack cocaine offense.see united states whitaker,cir a a notice is required only where the statutory minimum or maximum penalty under part d of title is sought to be enhanced,not where a defendant,by virtue of his criminal history,receives an increased sentence under the sentencing guidelines within the statutory range.warren concedes that the government did not file an information under section to increase the crack cocaine sentence based upon prior convictions.finally,as a factual matter,the district court sentenced warren to months,below the recommended range.
we,therefore,conclude that warren assertion of the government breach of the plea agreement is meritless.accordingly,we will enforce the appellate waiver provision of the agreement and dismiss this claim.plea agreement,ecf.
for the reasons stated above,we will affirm the order of the district court denying warren motion to suppress,and we will dismiss the remaining breach of plea agreement issue.
ernesto miranda lived an unremarkable life,but his surname stands for what has become one of our most fundamental constitutional rights.indeed,miranda has become embedded in our national culture.see dickerson united states.the majority concludes that a police warning to a suspect in custody,given from memory at a station house,of his right to an attorney,and right to an appointed attorney before any questioning satisfies the miranda requirement to inform him of his right to counsel at all times throughout questioning.for the reasons that follow,and because i believe that miranda and the supreme court most recent iterations require more,i respectfully dissent.
miranda repeatedly emphasizes the importance of informing a suspect in custody of the right to counsel during questioning.it requires,as recognized by the supreme court in florida powell,that as an absolute prerequisite to interrogation,an individual held for questioning must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation.miranda arizona.the court found this right to have counsel present at an interrogation indispensable to the protection of the fifth amendment privilege.id.the court aim wa s to assure that the individual right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.id.at.thus,the practical right to the presence of an attorney addresses the concern that t he circumstances surrounding interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege to remain silent by his interrogators.powell.at quoting miranda,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as powell recognized,the court has not dictated the words in which the essential information must be conveyed.id.at.in reviewing miranda warnings,courts are not required to examine miranda warnings as if construing a will or defining the terms of an easement.duckworth eagan.the inquiry,according to duckworth,california prysock,and powell,is simply whether the warnings reasonably conve y to a suspect his rights as required by miranda.powell.at quoting duckworth,at citations and quotation marks omitted.
in powell,the supreme court most recent iteration of miranda,the court reviewed whether a warning with an explicit temporal limitation on the right to an attorney withstood miranda requirements.in rejecting the defendant argument that the warning,as a whole,failed to convey his continuous right to counsel,the court held that 
they informed powell that he had the right to talk to a lawyer before answering their questions and the right to use any of his rights at any time he want ed during th e interview.the first statement communicated that powell could consult with a lawyer before answering any particular question,and the second statement confirmed that he could exercise that right while the interrogation was underway.in combination,the two warnings reasonably conveyed powell right to have an attorney present,not only at the outset of the interrogation,but at all times.
id.at alterations in original.the court not only took note of the catch all statement,but also relied on it in combination with the before language in concluding that 
in context,however,the term before merely conveyed when powell right to an attorney became effective namely,before he answered any questions at all.nothing in the words used indicated that counsel presence would be restricted after the questioning commenced.
id.at.the court found that the words used did not indicate that the presence of powell counsel would be restricted after the questioning commenced because i nstead,the warning communicated that the right to counsel carried forward to and through the interrogation powell could seek his attorney advice before responding to any of the officers questions and at any time during th e interview.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the warning included the catch all statement y ou have the right to use any of these rights at any time you want during this interview id.at.thus,it appears that if powell had not been told that he could invoke the rights read to him at any time during questioning,his right to the presence of counsel during the i
