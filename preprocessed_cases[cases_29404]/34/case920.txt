ellis williams gomez appeals from a judgment of conviction swain,for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute,ecstasy and the resulting sentence,which consisted primarily of months imprisonment.key testimony in the case against gomez was provided by detective michael ryan,who interviewed gomez,fred rivas,after rivas was arrested for selling ecstasy to a confidential informant.on appeal,gomez primarily argues that the district court admitted prejudicial hearsay in permitting detective ryan to testify,by inference,that rivas told ryan that gomez supplied rivas with ecstasy.the government argues that gomez waived his hearsay objection,that any possible hearsay problem was cured by the district court limiting instructions,and that,in any event,the evidence was admissible for the proper,purpose of showing context,in that it explained how ryan came to place a call to gomez.we hold that ryan testimony included highly prejudicial hearsay,and we reject the government contentions.moreover,while we find it unnecessary to reach the issue,we note that ryan testimony also poses a serious confrontation clause issue.we vacate gomez conviction and remand for a new trial.
background 
the defendants in the charged ecstasy conspiracy were gomez,rivas,and darwin pena.rivas and pena were arrested after they sold ecstasy pills to a confidential informant.following their arrest,rivas cooperated with the government,and the phone calls at the center of this appeal were made as part of that cooperation.prior to gomez trial,rivas and pena pleaded guilty.
the government opening statement 
in its opening,the government told the jury that the evidence would show that after rivas arrest 
he spoke with the agents who arrested him.and the agents instructed him to make phone calls to the person who supplied him with the five thousand pills.they told him to say he was with the guy who purchased the five thousand pills,and that rivas had money to give to that person.so who did rivas call he called the defendant.
detective ryan testimony 
only three witnesses testified against gomez at trial.the most important of the three was new york city police detective michael ryan who testified concerning the arrest and interrogation of rivas and supplied foundation for transcripts of recorded conversations between rivas and gomez.ryan testified that he arrested rivas on june,and later interviewed rivas along with united states drug enforcement dea special agent rodolfo cesario,who spoke spanish,rivas native language.ryan told rivas to call the person who had given him the pills that we had seized that morning.we told him to call that person to tell him that you were with the person,the customer who he sold the pills to,that he was collecting money from that person and that he needed an additional pills of ecstasy.the agents provided rivas with written instructions to state i here with the guy from the five on.he gave me something,he wants two more.i call you when i nearby.
ryan testified that he dialed gomez number on rivas cell phone by locating gomez number on the phone,setting up a recording device for rivas,then pressing the send button on the phone to make the call before passing the cell phone to rivas.the defense objected on hearsay grounds to ryan testimony.in response to those objections,the district court instructed the jury that 
the testimony that you have just heard about instructions given to rivas and rivas actions in response to those instructions is not being offered to establish and is not to be considered by you as evidence that the defendant was,in fact,rivas supplier.rather,the evidence is offered for the more limited purpose of explaining how it happened that rivas made calls to the defendant.
the government did not call rivas as a witness at trial.
closing arguments and charge 
in closing,the government said 
t he crucial question and the only question that you need to decide is whether the government has proved that the defendant,ellis williams gomez,was part of the agreement to distribute ecstacy.so,what was the evidence on this well,you heard that after fred rivas got arrested on june of,he made a series of telephone calls to the defendant.you heard why those calls happened.detective ryan told rivas to call the person who had given him the five thousand pills.
defense counsel argued,in part,that even if the jury found that gomez sold the five thousand pills to counsel acknowledged would be a fair and reasonable interpretation of the finding would not establish a conspiracy.in her charge,judge swain again instructed the jury that it could not use ryan testimony concerning the instructions he gave rivas and rivas actions in response to those instructions to establish that gomez was rivas supplier.
the jury convicted gomez of the sole count of the indictment.in a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule of the rules of criminal procedure,gomez primarily argued that ryan should not have been permitted to testify as to his understanding of the meaning of rivas statements on the recorded calls to gomez.gomez also argued that the jury charge on the nature of the conspiracy was erroneous,and that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce rivas and gomez cell phone records at trial.judge swain denied gomez rule motion in a memorandum order of september.this appeal followed.
discussion 
prejudicial hearsay.
the federal rules of evidence prohibit as hearsay the receipt of statements offered to proved the truth of the matter asserted.see.the government argues,however,that the disputed testimony was admitted for a valid,provide background and context for the that it therefore is not hearsay.the government claim is simply not credible.indeed,the government in both its opening statement and its summation explicitly argued the very hearsay use of the evidence which it now contends it was not offering the bearing of ryan testimony on gomez guilt was clear and the inference that the jury would draw from gomez was rivas supplier in the transaction for which rivas was inescapable.ryan testimony that he told rivas to call his supplier,selected gomez number from rivas cell phone address book,placed the call,and then handed the telephone to rivas,clearly informed the jury that rivas had told ryan that gomez was his supplier.there was no other reasonable explanation why ryan would have selected gomez number from rivas address book.
in ryan miller,cir,we addressed a similar issue.there,after questioning a,a detective told his colleague to advise the defendant of his miranda rights.in ryan,we rejected the state contention that the detective testimony was properly admissible as background information to show why the defendant was at the police station and to explain the course of the investigation that led to his arrest in part because it was not necessary to provide background,and it was only relevant if we assume d its the accused the defendant which we could not do.id.at.in this case,the hearsay violation is even more clear than it was in ryan,because in ryan,there were other reasonably plausible,explanations for the instruction to give a miranda warning.for example,the defendant might have told the police that the defendant had information about the crime,but not that he participated in it.alternatively,the first detective might have told the second detective to give the warning merely because it was good police practice.conversely,here there is no such likely alternative inferences to explain ryan selection of gomez number.ryan testimony provides background that would aid the jury in understanding why gomez was called only if we assume that rivas told ryan that gomez was his supplier,which we can not do.if the jury inexplicably missed the obvious point of ryan testimony,the assistant united states attorney ausa drove it home with her opening and summation.
the testimony was also completely unnecessary to inform the jury of the background or to avoid confusion.ryan testimony that rivas was arrested and then made several consensually recorded phone calls would have been sufficient background for the calls themselves.although hearsay may sometimes be admitted to prove relevant facts other than the truth of what was asserted,this is not the case when the evidence sought to be justified in its nonhearsay use is on the unimportant issue of investigative background,and it has considerable capacity in its improper application for substantial prejudice to the defendant on the crucial issue of proof of guilt.united states johnson,cir.in this case,the main import of the challenged evidence is not what it furnished as background,but rather its demonstration that rivas identified gomez as his supplier 
the government next argues gomez waived any error related to ryan testimony by failing to adequately object to the scope and substance of ryan proposed testimony during pretrial conferences.w aiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.united states olano,quoting johnson zerbst.a defendant who waives a claim of error may not raise it on appeal.see united states polouizzi,cir.
ryan testimony was the subject of pretrial controversy.in an april,pretrial conference,defense counsel objected to the admission of instructions ryan had given rivas for the latter calls to gomez.counsel explained i have an objection to any testimony being elicited from detective ryan about what he instructed rivas to do therefore,i also have an objection to the handwritten directions.defense counsel later explained that 
i have no objection to detective ryan saying that earlier in the day,for whatever reasons he provides,rivas was arrested.he was brought down to law enforcement headquarters and sometime thereafter,he made a phone call that was monitored and recorded,and here is the monitored and recorded conversation.
counsel then made clear that if the government is permitted to 
do more,not only elicit testimony but also have the opportunity to introduce this statement of instructions,it infers,implies,suggests that rivas had conversations with law enforcement,indicating and implicating gomez sic involvement,which is a background way of getting hearsay testimony in through implication,without my having the opportunity to rivas.
the court overruled gomez objection to admitting the written instructions and to testimony consistent with the written instructions as to detective ryan having instructed rivas to make the phone call.it explained that t here is nothing that is particularly suggestive of the content of any conversation between rivas and ryan in these instructions and they are relevant in providing context for the telephone call and chronology.
later the ausa indicated that rivas was also instructed to make certain phonecalls sic to certain people or at least to a person who fell within a particular description as in the person who had supplied him with these five thousand pills.defense counsel responded 
there is an objection on the same grounds that i objected to the instructions.rivas having postarrest conversations and not being a witness in the case,the statements that he makes to detective ryan at that time are hearsay and inadmissible for their truth.the phone calls are in evidence.now,according to your honor ruling,the written instruction that detective ryan gave him is going to be in evidence.
asked by judge swain whether defense counsel was objecting to the introduction into evidence of the alleged fact that these were calls that were to be made to an alleged supplier,defense counsel explained 
i think that any statements rivas made to detective ryan before the phonecalls sic are made are inadmissible because they are hearsay and because they will be taken for their truth proving that gomez was,in fact,a supplier.and that inadmissible hearsay,it would be treated as truthful by the jury and that my fear.
the government attorney responded that she 
plan ned to ask the agent did you speak with rivas what instructions,if any,did you give him 
what i expect the agent to say is something along the lines of i instructed him to call the person he got the five thousand from and to ask him for ask him for two more and to ask him also ask him if he wanted to receive his money or say he had money for him the only really new thing that i raising is the instruction to call the person that you got the five from.
defense counsel replied 
if the purported testimony by detective ryan is i instructed him to call the person who supplied him the five thousand,i do object.if the instructions are based on conversations i had with rivas,i instructed him to call gomez,the person who supplied him with the five thousand,then i do.
the government agreed that it would not elicit testimony from ryan that he instructed rivas to call gomez,whom rivas had identified as his supplier.thus,at this point,it appeared that everyone agreed as to the nature of the testimony ryan could give.
however,the issue was apparently not settled to judge swain satisfaction because upon her return to chambers,she instructed the government attorneys by facsimile,with a copy to defense counsel,that the government attorney 
should address by letter to the court the issue of why testimony to the effect that rivas phoned gomez in response to a directive by detective ryan to telephone rivas supplier would not constitute evidence of a testimonial out of court statement within the meaning of crawford washington,and davis washington.see also basciano,d.
the government responded that there was no crawford problem because it did not intend to argue based on the testimony that rivas was instructed to call his supplier,and that gomez was rivas supplier.it indicated that it would not object to an instruction that the jury could consider the applicable portion of ryan testimony only as provid ing the necessary context for the calls between gomez and rivas,that is,to make clear to the jury why it is that rivas telephoned gomez.ultimately,the judge drafted her own proposed instruction 
the testimony that you have just heard about instructions given to rivas and rivas actions in response to those instructions is not being offered to establish and is not to be considered by you as evidence that the defendant was in fact,rivas supplier.rather,the evidence is offered for the more limited purpose of explaining how it happened that rivas made calls to the defendant.
in response to the proposed charge,defense counsel said w hile still maintaining my objection to the testimony with regard to this in any way,in light of your ruling,i have no problem with the curative instruction.
the government argues,based on these exchanges,that gomez knowingly abandoned his objection.we disagree.defense counsel initial statement was a global objection to anything in ryan testimony that infers,implies,suggests that rivas had prior conversations with law enforcement,indicating and implicating gomez sic involvement,which is a background way of getting hearsay testimony in through implication,without my having the opportunity to rivas.defense counsel later refined his objection,but never retreated from his insistence that ryan could not properly testify that rivas had identified gomez as his supplier.the government argument that the defendant waived the hearsay objection is further undermined by the fact that the government made no such contention in the district court.
nor does the government succeed in demonstrating waiver by its argument that counsel reached agreement before trial on the admission of evidence.the government evidence went well beyond what had arguably been stipulated.the government lawyer assured the court and defense counsel that she would certainly caution ryan from saying anything that would get close to referencing the content of the call conversations that he had with rivas.at trial,however,ryan testified that after the debriefing of rivas,we placed several calls to gomez.ryan also testified that he located gomez phone number on rivas phone,something he would have done only if rivas had identified gomez as implicated in the scheme.the ausa also promised judge swain that in soliciting ryan testimony about ryan instructions to rivas to call the person who supplied rivas with the ecstasy,there is no one who is going to say who that person is yet
