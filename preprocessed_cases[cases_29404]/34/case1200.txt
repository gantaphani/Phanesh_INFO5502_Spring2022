opinion of the court 
in this consolidated appeal,francis brooks,enid edwards,and bill john baptiste challenge their convictions following trial before the district court.all convictions stemmed from the defendants alleged extortion,kidnapping,bribes,and drug trafficking while each served as law enforcement officers.brooks and edwards were employed with the virgin islands police department vipd,and john baptiste was employed by the virgin islands port authority vipa.defendants challenge their convictions on various constitutional and evidentiary grounds.in addition,the government the district court judgment of acquittal on certain counts.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the district court judgment of acquittal as to counts,and,and affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to all other counts.
background 
this case presents a sordid picture of law enforcement officers who sought to enrich themselves rather than protect the public by engaging in a protracted pattern of criminality that included extortion,drug dealing and kidnapping,all at the expense of the residents of the united states virgin islands.
in september,a federal grand jury issued a count superseding indictment against the defendants,and the case proceeded to trial.at trial,the prosecution introduced the following evidence as to particular charges in the superseding indictment.
evidence of specific crimes 
brooks and edwards distribute six pounds of marijuana for resale.counts to 
kelvin moses testified that in,brooks and edwards approached him in their police cruiser and sold him six pounds of marijuana for him to resell.joint app.moses also testified that prior to this exchange,from to and from to,he routinely paid money to brooks and edwards for information regarding other people who were cooperating with them.
brooks and edwards impound a truck and extort payment from the owner.counts to 
kenneth love testified that in,brooks and edwards illegally impounded his truck.edwards told love that he would have to pay to get his truck back,and further informed him that she had been taking money from people for years.joint app.love also testified that brooks and edwards eventually arranged for him to pay approximately in cash to release the truck.joint app.
brooks,edwards and john baptiste arrest a taxi driver and hold her in custody until her boyfriend pays for her release.counts to 
in april,john baptiste arrested taxi driver,yvese calixte,for a parking violation.john baptiste proceeded to forcibly detain calixte until vipd officers arrived,handcuffed her,and placed her in a police car.john baptiste followed behind as the officers drove calixte to a vipd facility,and placed her in a holding cell where she remained for four to five hours.joint app.calixte was eventually transferred to a downtown jail,where she was processed for booking.id.at.thereafter,john baptiste handcuffed calixte and drove her to a shipping station,where they were met by brooks,edwards,and calixte boyfriend,jossenel morino.calixte was finally released,but only after morino paid to brooks and edwards in exchange for her freedom.
brooks extorts payment from felon in possession of a firearm in exchange for not arresting him edwards and brooks then coerce him into selling cocaine for them counts to to 
john lindquist,a convicted felon,testified that in,brooks approached him while lindquist had a gun in his possession.in exchange for not arresting him,brooks asked lindquist for,which lindquist paid over the course of the next month.months later,lindquist encountered brooks again while carrying another gun.lindquist testified that brooks and edwards gave him ounces of crack cocaine to sell for them in exchange for not being arrested.after lindquist sold the drugs,he paid brooks over the course of the following months 
post trial motions.
at the close of trial,the jury convicted brooks and edwards of conspiracy under the racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations act,d rico conspiracy and extortion under the hobbs act,a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances,in violation of distribution of and possession with intent to distribute controlled substances,in violation of a conspiracy,in violation of v.extortion,in violation of solicitation and receipt of a bribe,in violation of and conflict of interest,in violation of and.the jury convicted john baptiste of kidnapping and false imprisonment,in violation of.
following their convictions,defendants moved for judgments of acquittal pursuant to rule,and for new trials pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.the district court granted defendants rule motions as to counts,and.thereafter,the district court sentenced both brooks and edwards to months imprisonment to be followed by years supervised release.john baptiste was sentenced to months imprisonment.these appeals followed.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction to review a district court final order and sentence under and.
sufficiency of the indictment 
prior to trial,brooks moved to dismiss the indictment because the government failed to identify the victims of each crime by name.according to brooks,the indictment was invalid because it failed to provide him with sufficient information to prepare a defense,and to plead double jeopardy in case of future prosecution.brooks renews this claim before us.this presents a legal question over which we have plenary review.united states kemp,cir.
the supreme court has articulated a test for measuring the sufficiency of an indictment.russell united states.under this test,an indictment is sufficient when it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,id.at,and allows him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.hamling united states.we have recognized that a n indictment must allege more than just the essential elements of the offense.united states vitillo,cir.however,n o greater specificity than the statutory language is required so long as there is sufficient factual orientation to permit a defendant to prepare his defense and invoke double jeopardy.united states huet,cir quoting united states kemp,at.
brooks argument is wholly grounded upon the second of the factors.he claims that he can not assert a double jeopardy claim in the future because the indictment omits the names of the alleged victims.he correctly notes that the indictment only references dates and the nature of the statutory offense charged in each count and does not include the name of any of the alleged victims.for example,brooks highlights count,charging racketeering extortion in violation of a.that portion of the indictment states 
on or about april,at thomas in the district of the virgin islands,enid edwards,francis brooks and bill john baptiste,while acting under color of official right as law enforcement officers of the virgin islands,did knowingly and intentionally affect commerce by extortion,and attempted to do so,and aided and abetted the same namely,by unlawfully requiring an individual to pay money in order for the individual to recover a vehicle that had been towed pursuant to police directive authority.
brooks app.at emphasis added.
the specificity required for an indictment to have sufficient factual orientation to permit a defendant to prepare his defense and invoke double jeopardy,is not particularly onerous.huet,at quoting united states kemp,f d at.we have found that a defendant has sufficient notice to guard against a future prosecution in violation of the protection against double jeopardy if an indictment specifies the time frame for the criminal conduct.see united states huet,at reversing district court order dismissing an indictment where the relevant charge listed all required elements of the offense and where it also specifie d the time period during which the violation occurred by including the temporal description on or about august,to on or about january.
although this indictment could easily have identified the alleged victims,it adequately specified the period in which the alleged crimes occurred,and set forth enough specificity about the crimes charged to protect against any subsequent attempt to charge brooks with any crimes arising from the conduct that is the subject of this indictment.accordingly,we conclude that the indictment was sufficiently specific to withstand a double jeopardy challenge 
john baptiste motion for severance 
the jury returned a verdict finding john baptiste guilty of a single count count,charging false imprisonment and kidnapping,and acquitted him of all other charges 
john baptiste argues that the district court erred in rejecting his requests for severance under either.b or a.he argues that the government case against him stemmed solely from the april,incident involving calixte,and joinder in an indictment containing numerous other charges against other defendants allowed evidence admissible only against brooks and edwards to improperly spillover and be used against him.
a defendant seeking a new trial due to the denial of a severance motion must show that the joint trial led to clear and substantial prejudice resulting in a manifestly unfair trial.united states urban,cir internal quotation marks omitted.mere allegations of prejudice are not enough,united states reicherter,cir,and defendants are not entitled to severance merely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.zafiro united states.thus,as we have previously explained,the critical issue when considering the potential for prejudice is not whether the evidence against a is more damaging but rather whether the jury will be able to compartmentalize the evidence as it relates to separate defendants in view of its volume and limited admissibility.davis,at quoting united states somers,cir.
here,john baptiste can not establish that the evidence presented against edwards and brooks resulted in clear and substantial prejudice to his case.as noted,his sole contention is that the evidence against edwards and brooks was so extensive that it prevented the jury from reliably determining his guilt.see john baptiste br.at.however,severance is not required simply because the evidence against his may be stronger than the evidence against john baptiste.see urban,at a defendant is not entitled to severance merely because the evidence against a is more damaging than that against him.citation and internal quotation marks omitted united states console,cir prejudice should not be found in a joint trial just because all evidence adduced is not germane to all counts against each defendant or some evidence adduced is more damaging to one defendant than others.see also united states dansker,cir.
additionally,nothing suggests that the jury was unable to compartmentalize the evidence as it relate d to separate defendants davis,at,nor does john baptiste point to any evidence of that happening.we realize that only eight of the counts in this indictment involved john baptiste and his involvement in the scheme to kidnap calixte and hold her for ransom.however,the evidence that was relevant to those charges was easily separated and compartmentalized from testimony that was admitted regarding edwards or brooks involvement in the other charged offenses.see,davis,at rejecting claim of prejudice where facts relatively simple all events occurred in a single evening there are only three defendants and there are no overly technical or scientific issues.finally,in instructing the jury,the district court underscored that e ach count and the evidence pertaining to it should be considered separately and that t he case of each defendant should be considered separately and individually.joint app.accordingly,we conclude that the jury could have compartmentalized the evidence on each count and each defendant as instructed.
c.the virgin islands false imprisonment and kidnapping statute 
john baptiste also challenges the district court interpretation and application of the virgin islands false imprisonment and kidnapping statute.he first claims that he district court erroneously ignored the requirement that a defendant act without lawful authority in committing the offense.second,john baptiste argues that the statute is unconstitutionally void for vagueness as interpreted because it provides no notice to law enforcement officers that they can be charged and convicted of kidnapping.the arguments border on frivolity.
provides in pertinent part 
whoever without lawful authority confines or imprisons another person within this territory against his will,or confines or kidnaps another person,with intent to cause him to be confined or imprisoned in this territory against his will is guilty of kidnapping and shall be imprisoned for not less than one and not more than years.
as noted,the jury convicted john baptiste of one count of kidnapping for which he received a sentence of five years imprisonment.
in arguing that the district court erroneously interpreted without lawful authority,john baptiste claims that,given his authority as a peace officer to make arrests with or without a warrant,any arrest he makes must necessarily be within lawful authority.the argument is at best,misguided and at most,fanciful.this virgin islands statute provides peace officers with lawful authority to make arrests in routine circumstances,when they have witnessed a public offense or when there is reasonable cause to believe that a person has committed a felony.see no reasonable interpretation of the statute would convert it to a license to empower peace officers to act outside of this authority or detain someone for a criminal purpose.indeed,the slightest modicum of common sense would negate the conclusion that the statute allows police officers to engage in criminality merely because they have been authorized to uphold the law.yet,that is precisely the interpretation that john baptiste urges upon us.
notwithstanding john baptiste argument to the contrary,it is that law enforcement officers are subject to prosecution under criminal statutes when they act unlawfully or without legal authority.see,hampton united states,plurality opinion if the police engage in illegal activity in concert with a defendant beyond the scope of their duties the remedy lies in prosecuting the police under the applicable provisions of state or federal law.see also imbler pachtman,this court has never suggested that the policy considerations which compel civil immunity for certain government officials also place them beyond the reach of criminal law.
a recent case decided by the first circuit court of appeals is illustrative.in united states cortes caban,cir,a divided panel of the first circuit upheld the conviction of several police officer defendants for drug distribution under.the officers unlawfully transferred marijuana and cocaine to each other and outside parties as part of a conspiracy to plant evidence and conduct illegal searches and seizures.in affirming the convictions that followed,the majority explained in detail that while congress had carved out a specific exemption for distribution of controlled substances by law enforcement officers,but only the extent that they are lawfully engaged in the enforcement of drug laws.see cortes caban,at citing emphasis in original because the officers in that case acted outside their lawful authority to enforce state and federal drug laws,they were subject to prosecution under federal drug laws the same as anyone else.id.at 
similarly,the virgin islands arrest by a peace officer statute may only be read to grant officers authority to carry out arrests under specific circumstances.it was certainly not intended to immunize police officers from prosecution for such clearly illegal actions as restraining someone liberty until a ransom is paid.thus,where,as here,the government can show that a peace officer conduct exceeded lawful authority to arrest and detain,that officer is subject to prosecution under any statute that criminalizes conduct.
john baptiste makes an equally tenuous claim that the virgin islands kidnapping statute is unconstitutional as applied because it is so vague as to not give peace officers notice that they could be arrested and convicted of kidnapping for performing their official duties.john baptiste br.at.we exercise plenary review over that question of law.san filippo bongiovanni,cir.
a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute or encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions.papachristou city of jacksonville,see also kolender lawson.a statute can be void for vagueness not only on its face,but as applied,as a result of an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language.united states protex,cir quoting bouie city of columbia.
we fail to see how a person of ordinary intelligence could possibly think that or any other legislative enactment authorizes a police officer to hold someone in custody for personal gain until a ransom is paid.as the government notes,the virgin islands false imprisonment and kidnapping statute closely tracks those of other jurisdictions.see.stat.like the virgin islands statute,these laws generally proscribe the removal,transport,or confinement of another person when carried out unlawfully or without lawful authority.for john baptiste vagueness argument to have any merit,we would have to conclude that no reasonable law enforcement officer could understand that is proscribed from,confining or imprisoning another person without lawful authority.
in fact,the contrary is true.police officers can be exposed to civil liability under usc.in addition,in order to lawfully exercise the police power of the state,they must understand the constitutional restraints imposed on the authority of the state and its agents.no reasonable interpretation of this statute,or any similar statute that we are aware of,could conceivably suggest that a police officer may use police power to extort a ransom in exchange for releasing someone who was being held in custody.
here,as in any prosecution for kidnapping,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted without lawful authority.that burden is easily satisfied where the proof would allow a reasonable juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a person was held in official custody for private gain rather than in furtherance of an officer official duties.despite john baptiste argument to the contrary,we see neither vagueness nor room for confusion about the scope of his legal authority in the text of.
defendants rule motions 
the government appeals the district court grant of brooks and edwards rule motions on counts,and relating to the extortion of love and relating to the lindquist drug transaction.john baptiste also appeals the court denial of his rule motion motion for judgment of acquittal.he argues there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for kidnapping count.
we exercise plenary review over a district court ruling on a rule motion.united states applewaithe,cir.a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence pursuant to rule bears a heavy burden.united states casper,cir.in reviewing a verdict for sufficiency of the evidence,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affirm the judgment if there is substantial evidence from which any rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states benjamin,wl,cir.march,quoting united states brown,cir.
john baptiste conviction for false imprisonment and kidnapping 
as noted above,under the applicable statute,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant,intending the victim to be confined or imprisoned,unlawfully took or carried away the victim for a substantial distance,against the victim will.
john baptiste argues that the government evidence was insufficient to prove that he acted without lawful authority when he arrested calixte.he claims that the government evidence largely relied upon the testimony of vipd officer rodney querrard,who testified that the vipd does not recognize an officer authority to unarrest a detainee,as john baptiste arguably did once morino paid the ransom to edwards and brooks to secure calixte release.john baptiste reasons that this testimony was irrelevant because there was no evidence to show that the policies and procedures governing the conduct of a virgin islands police officer such as querrard also governed officers of the virgin islands port authority police.as noted at the outset,john baptiste was a member of the virgin islands port authority police.john baptiste also argues that even if querrard testimony was properly admitted,it was insufficient to show that his john baptiste conduct satisfied the elements of the false imprisonment and kidnapping statute.
while we certainly agree that failing to follow departmental procedures is not tantamount to acting unlawfully,the record here contains sufficient evidence that john baptiste acted without lawful authority in detaining calixte.specifically,the government introduced the testimony of vipa chief edred wilkes,who stated that while john baptiste may have followed vipa procedures in arresting calixte,he wilkes was furious when he learned that john baptiste released calixte as a favor to edwards.joint app.given that testimony,and testimony that john baptiste accepted money as a condition of releasing calixte,the jury could reasonably conclude that even if the original seizure of calixte was lawful,at some point during her detention,john baptiste decided to hold her until he received a payment that can only be described as a ransom.from that point until the ransom was actually paid,he was holding her against her will and when he transported her to the location where the ransom was paid,the jury could well have concluded that she was being illegally detained and transported solely to facilitate receipt of the ransom he extorted for her release.
in reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence,we are limited to determining whether the conclusion chosen by the factfinders was permissible.united states ashfield,cir emphasis added.viewed in the light most favorable to the government as verdict winner,we conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to prove that john baptiste was guilty of false imprisonment and kidnapping as charged in count.indeed,on this record,it is hard to imagine that the jury could have concluded anything else 
extortion and conspiracy to extort under federal and territorial law.
the government challenges the district court judgment of acquittal in favor of brooks and edwards after the jury convicted them on the charges set forth in counts,and.those counts all related to the officers extortion of kenneth love,who,as noted above,paid brooks and edwards approximately in return for the release of his truck after it was illegally impounded by brooks and edwards.
counts and charged conspiracy and extortion under the hobbs act.to sustain the conspiracy conviction the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that brooks and edwards knowingly entered into an agreement to interfere with interstate commerce by extortion under color of official right.see also united states inigo,cir.to prove extortion,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that brooks and edwards knowingly and willfully obtained love property through coercion resulting from the wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right and that this obstruct ed,delay ed,or affect ed interstate commerce.a,b united states manzo,cir.
the district court granted the defendants post trial motion for judgment of acquittal,primarily because love did not make his payment to recover his impounded truck directly to edwards.rather,love testified that he placed approximately on the dashboard of edwards police vehicle in exchange for obtaining his truck.joint app.after love retrieved his truck,he was given an itemized receipt for.
the government concedes that there was no direct evidence that edwards took any of the that love paid,but argues that direct evidence was not required.see united states johnson,cir.the government contends that the prosecution presented sufficient circumstantial evidence at trial to sustain a hobbs act extortion charge.the government relies on the following evidence edwards repeatedly told love how much love would have to pay to get his truck back edwards told love that she had been taking money from people for years edwards ordered love to put the money on her patrol car dashboard and love later saw the driver with only a couple hundred dollars in his hand.br.at,joint app.at.we agree that this was sufficient to convict edwards of hobbs act extortion as charged in count 
the jury obviously accepted love testimony that after he placed the on edwards dashboard,he saw the driver with only a couple hundred dollars in his hand.joint app.that testimony is circumstantial evidence that edwards gave the driver a couple hundred dollars for his role in the scheme,but that edwards retained most of the that love placed in edwards patrol car.see,united states mcneill,cir the fact that evidence is circumstantial does not make it less probative than direct evidence.this evidence,when properly viewed in the light most favorable to the government,would clearly allow any reasonable juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that edwards was guilty of extortion.
conspiracy 
the district court apparent reliance on the absence of direct evidence also caused it to err in granting a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy charge.the court explained that it could not find evidence of an explicit agreement between brooks and edwards.it did not have to.the court stressed that brooks remained silent while edwards told love that she had been doing this for years,taking money from people.joint app.thus,while brooks was present in the patrol car while this conversation was going on,the court noted that mere presence at the scene of the crime or association with a criminal is not sufficient evidence of a conspiracy.id.
the government concedes that mere presence is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction,but underscores that the existence of an agreement can nonetheless be inferred from the circumstances surrounding a contract.see united states caraballo rodriguez,cir en banc holding that proof of an element of conspiracy can be shown by circumstantial evidence a case can be built against the defendant until the scale finally tips.quoting united states iafelice,cir.indeed,that proposition is so firmly established as to require no citation.we also agree with the government that the circumstances surrounding the interaction of edwards and brooks was certainly sufficient to establish an illicit agreement between the two to extort money from love.the towtruck driver involved in returning love car testified that brooks spoke to him about the price he thought love should pay for the release of the truck.perhaps most damningly,brooks sat silently by as edwards explained that she had been taking money from people for years.therefore,the unique circumstances here establish something much more probative than mere presence.the jury could certainly assume that if one police officer boasts of engaging in such illegal activity for nearly two decades in the presence of another police officer,there must be an agreement and that the agreement arises from a longstanding pattern of activity and mutual trust between the two.here,that relationship can be discerned from the evidence that sustained convictions for other counts as well as the circumstances surrounding the release of the truck.see united states gibbs,cir holding that buyer shared conspiracy goal of distributing cocaine,when circumstantial evidence showed he knew about the larger drug operation 
while we agree that the evidence supporting brooks and edwards conviction for conspiring to extort love out of his property is more tenuous than the evidence that edwards carried out the extortion plan,membership in a conspiracy need not depend on the level of cooperation that the district court required here.see united states claxton,a finding of guilt in a conspiracy case does not depend on the government introducing direct evidence that a defendant was a knowing participant in the conspiracy circumstantial evidence can carry the day.united states wexler,cir the elements of a conspiracy may be proven entirely by circumstantial evidence.thus,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,we conclude that the district court erred in granting judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy counts and that portion of the court order will be reversed 
conspiracy to distribute drugs under 
count charged brooks and edwards with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in violation of u.the charge relates to brooks and edwards interactions with john lindquist.as noted above,the government introduced evidence that brooks coerced lindquist into selling crack cocaine for him.that evidence established that lindquist received the crack cocaine from edwards while he sat in the back of the officers patrol car.although edwards handed the bag containing the crack cocaine to lindquist and told him that brooks expected to receive for its contents,lindquist neither heard edwards admit that she knew what was in the bag,nor saw her look into it.
to establish a conspiracy,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt a shared unity of purpose an intent to achieve a common illegal goal and an agreement to work toward that goal.united states boria,cir.it may do so by direct or circumstantial evidence.united states brodie,cir.we have also required proof that the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy illegal goal.id.at.
we must therefore examine the record to determine whether the government set forth evidence,considered with the surrounding circumstances,from which a rational trier of fact could logically infer that the defendant knew a controlled substance was involved in the transaction.boria,at.
in granting the defendants rule motion on this count,the court reasoned that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that edwards knew the contents of the bag.see,cartwright,at.the district court concluded that the evidence of a conspiracy was therefore insufficient against edwards,and thus necessarily insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that brooks conspired with her.joint app.
however,after defendants trial,we decided united states caraballo rodriguez,where we reexamined our test for evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence in drug conspiracy cases such as this.at.in doing so,we recognized that we had previously overturned convictions in the absence of specific evidence of a defendant knowledge of the identity of the illegal drugs possessed even though circumstantial evidence may have been sufficient to establish that knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt.caraballo rodriguez,at.we acknowledged that our jurisprudence in this area had failed to apply the deferential standard the law requires on review of sufficiency of the evidence challenges.id.at.as we explained,we had previously sometimes examined the evidence under a microscope rather than reviewing the evidence as a whole and giving deference to the jury verdict.id.at.our decision in that case clarified that the appropriate standard of review of the sufficiency of the evidence in a drug conspiracy case is the same as in all other cases the jury verdict must be assessed from the perspective of a reasonable juror,and must be upheld if the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew what was in possession.id.at abrogating united states wexler,cir,united states salmon,united states thomas,united states idowu,cir,and united states cartwright,cir.moreover,we specifically disavowed our prior analytical approach and reasoning that the jury verdict could not stand when the evidence was as consistent with other contraband,as it was with controlled substances.id.at 
thus,while this issue may have presented a close question when the district court originally decided it,it is now clear that the district court grant of this rule motion was not sufficiently deferential to the jury verdict.
the evidence introduced at trial established that in,lindquist met with brooks and edwards,who arrived together in a car.lindquist got into the car,and edwards handed him a bag while informing him that brooks wanted for it.lindquist looked into the bag,recognized its contents,and got out of the car.over the course of the next several months,lindquist sold the crack cocaine that was in the bag and gave the proceeds to brooks.the government also argues based on the timing of their meeting,the bag small size,flimsy construction,and light weight,and edward statement that brooks wants for this,along with evidence of a incident involving the sale to kelvin moses of six pounds of marijuana,the jury could have concluded that edwards knew the bag contained drugs.br.at.we agree.
the same reasoning would have allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that edwards knew that the illegal venture involved drugs.see caraballo rodriguez,at.in caraballo rodriguez,the defendant responded to questions about whether he knew that a suitcase contained drugs by saying i did know it was drugs.i knew that it was something bad because nobody is going to pay five thousand dollars for picking up suitcases.id.at.we reasoned that the jury could have concluded from the surrounding circumstances that the defendant knew the suitcases contained drugs.similarly,here,the jury could reasonably conclude that these two police officers had enough common sense and knowledge to understand that if brooks expected for the sale of whatever was in the paper bag,brooks wanted lindquist to sell the contents of the bag,and given the expected price,the bag most surely did contain a tuna fish sandwich.
moreover,while mere presence at the scene of the crime or association with a criminal is not sufficient evidence of a conspiracy,see,united states tyson,cir,the evidence here is once again substantially more than mere presence.the events involving lindquist took place in,several years into a longstanding pattern of illicit activity between edwards and brooks.that activity had,in the past,involved recruiting third parties to sell drugs for them.see,united states claxton,cir a lthough the number of transactions here does not,on its own,prove defendant knowledge of the character of the conspiracy,it does make it more likely that he knew the business he was about.given the circumstances here,the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury conclusion that edwards understood that she was participating in a drug transaction.accordingly,we conclude that the jury verdict on count did not fall below the threshold of bare rationality.coleman johnson.we therefore reverse the district court grant of the rule motion on that count,and the guilty verdict will be reinstated as to both edwards and brooks 
brooks rule motion for new trial on rico 
brooks claims that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for a new trial on his conviction for rico conspiracy.he argues that the jury considered evidence of acquitted conduct in convicting him on that count.we review a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under rule for abuse of discretion.united states silveus,cir.however,we again view the evidence supporting a conviction in the light most favorable to the government and affirm s the judgment if there is substantial evidence from which any rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.benjamin,wl,at.
to establish a conviction for a rico conspiracy,the government must show that two or more persons agreed to conduct or to participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity that the defendant was a party to or member of that agreement and that the defendant joined the agreement or conspiracy knowing of its objective to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of an enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.united states riccobene,cir 
to establish a pattern of racketeering activity,the government must show that there was continuity plus relationship among the predicate acts.united states mark,wl,at cir,quoting sedima imrex,quoting,at.racketeering acts are related if the acts had the same or similar purposes,results,participants,victims or methods of commission.barticheck fidelity union state,cir.s poradic and separate criminal activities alone can not give rise to a pattern for rico purposes mark,wl,at quoting united states eufrasio,cir.
count of the indictment charged a rico conspiracy and included the following predicate acts drug trafficking,alien harboring,kidnapping,bribery,and extortion.in support of these charges,the government relied on the testimony of moses,lindquist,deeb,willock,and love discussed in section.the testimony of these witnesses established that brooks and edwards regularly demanded money in exchange for drugs or property.
before submitting the case to the jury,the district court acquitted the defendants on all counts relating to deeb and willock,as well as several others.joint app.accordingly,the district court instructed the jury that it had to agree on at least two of the remaining racketeering acts drug trafficking conspiracy,drug trafficking,kidnapping,kidnapping for extortion,extortion,and bribery.the jury convicted brooks and edwards of the rico conspiracy and twelve counts charging offenses that were predicate acts,but the district court granted brooks rule motion as to four of those twelve counts,and.the jury did not specify,nor was it asked to specify,which of the predicate acts it relied upon to convict on the rico conspiracy charge.
brooks argues that the dismissal of four of the twelve counts relating to the predicate acts required a new trial,since the jury could have relied on dismissed counts to convict him of the rico charge.he also claims that the lack of credibility of the particular witnesses casts doubt on the convictions on the remaining eight counts.
it is well established that if a jury convicts the defendant on two or more of the predicate acts constituting a rico violation,the conviction on the rico count itself will withstand a challenge even if the jury acquitted the defendant on several counts charging other predicate acts.see united states holzer,cir.even where the jury verdict is inconsistent,the rico conviction must stand so long as there is sufficient evidence to prove that the defendant committed two or more predicate acts.united states vastola.as noted,even accounting for the four counts on which the district court granted the rule motions,brooks and edwards eight convictions for offenses that were predicate rico acts remain including extortion,bribery,and drug trafficking.the convictions foreclose brooks challenge to the court denial of his rule motion on the rico offense charged in count.holzer,at a jury is presumed to act rationally,and a rational jury would convict a defendant of racketeering e ven if it had exonerated him of all the predicate offenses charged except one act of extortion and one receipt of a bribe.moreover,brooks attack on the sufficiency of evidence amounts to little more than a challenge to the credibility of the witnesses see united states cothran,cir refusing to reconcile inconsistencies in testimony because witness credibility is an area peculiarly within the jury domain.thus,the district court properly rejected his claim.
prosecutorial misconduct 
both brooks and edwards argue that prosecutorial misconduct occurred during the trial when the prosecutor withheld exculpatory evidence and suborned perjury.their argument pertains to the government use of three witnesses love,deeb,and willock.as we explain,this argument is unpersuasive.
kenneth love identification of brooks 
at trial,love identified edwards but could not identify brooks.joint app.thereafter,during a break in love testimony,love and an agent had lunch at the same pizzeria where brooks and his family ate,and the agent pointed love out.joint app.brooks argues that this was improper because love had not finished his testimony.brooks br.
the agent conduct was clearly improper,and the incident could have been problematic.however,the district court competently handled the situation.upon the parties return to the courtroom,the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to discuss what had occurred during the break.since love had not been able to identify brooks in the courtroom prior to the incident,the court dismissed any suggestion of a tainted identification and allowed the government to continue love direct examination.joint app.thereafter,love was not asked to identify brooks,nor did he identify brooks at any point during trial.see joint app.
brooks also argues that love falsely testified that he had read brooks name on brooks name tag or badge,joint app.that testimony was undermined by other officers who testified that vipd officers badges have numbers,but no names and that names are not displayed on uniforms.see joint app.however,that conflicting testimony only raised a credibility issue that the jury was free to resolve.moreover,brooks fails to explain why the officers testimony should be given more weight than love,and we agree with the district court decision to refrain from usurping the role of the jury by attempting to resolve this conflict in brooks favor.see united states richardson,cir i t is the jury province to make credibility determinations and to assign weight to the evidence.united states prejean,app x,cir jury free to discredit witness testimony and instead believe evidence offered by other party.
moreover,even if we assume that love was not truthful about seeing brooks name on his badge,the jury was free to accept the balance of love testimony.see united states merlino,cir noting that a jury can believe some witness testimony as to some aspects,and disbelieve others,or not believe any,or believe all.barber csx distribution,cir evaluation of witness credibility is exclusive function of jury,and jury can always choose to discredit testimony mccann miller,app x,cir jury not required to believe all of the testimony offered by an interested witness.
elias deeb alleged suppression of exculpatory evidence 
brooks also argues that the government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by omitting an exculpatory portion of deeb recorded conversation with a federal agent.joint app.in order for brooks to succeed,t he evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene.here,nothing in the record suggests that the prosecution decision to only play a portion of the conversation between deeb and a federal agent amounted to misconduct.the government introduced the full tape into evidence.on,brooks counsel played the allegedly exculpatory conversation for the jury,and highlighted the fact that deeb never discussed brooks involvement in the scheme to obtain a driver license.accordingly,even if it could be argued that the prosecution suppressed evidence by failing to directly present it to the jury,it can not be said that the failure prejudiced brooks.
troy willock controversy surrounding witness identity 
lastly,brooks and edwards contend that the prosecution purposefully concealed the controversy concerning the identity of troy willock willock,who testified in relation to the marijuana theft charged in counts to.willock was a cooperating witness who testified that in,he saw brooks pocket a quantity of marijuana taken from a dealer during a shakedown.united states edwards,wl.
prior to trial,the government learned that the vipd had files on two troy willocks with different fingerprints and photographs but the same name and birthday.the government claims that on the first day of trial,one of the prosecutors placed copies of willock national crime information center ncic report,along with his pre sentence report psr for his pending drug charges,on defense counsels table.joint app.the government claims that both reports listed multiple social security numbers for willock and disclosed what the government knew about its witness at that time.joint app.defense counsel acknowledged having received the packets,but no defendant willock about his identity.joint app,see joint app.
in or about april,another person using the name troy willock willock complained to the social security administration in thomas that willock had stolen his identity.joint app.later that month,willock appeared for sentencing pursuant to a guilty plea in an unrelated drug distribution case.willock attorney asked to withdraw on grounds that he had reason to believe that willock is not who he claims to be.id.counsel also stated that he believed that willock had stolen willock identity.
on november,the district court held a hearing to consider the defendants motion for a new trial and determine whether the controversy surrounding willock identity had in any way affected this trial.following the hearing,the court denied the defendants motion.the court held that there was no specific evidence that willock had perjured himself at trial,as he testified that his name was troy willock and no conflicting evidence was introduced there was not sufficient evidence to show that,if willock committed perjury,the government knew of it before or during trial and if committed perjury and the government was blameless,the perjury did not result in a manifest injustice that would require upsetting the jury verdict.joint app.
on appeal,brooks and edwards claim that willock alleged perjury amounts to a due process violation because the government either knew or should have known that willock would offer false testimony.they claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motion for a new trial because there was a reasonable likelihood that the false testimony affected the judgment of the jury.united states augurs.we reject their arguments for substantially the same reasons relied on by the district court.
for such a claim to succeed,the defendants must show the government witness committed perjury the government knew or should have known of his perjury the testimony went uncorrected and there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the verdict.lambert blackwell,cir.this record does not contain any evidence that would render the district court findings regarding the alleged perjury clearly erroneous.discrepancies regarding his social security number notwithstanding,there is no direct evidence that willock name was anything other than troy willock when the district court held an evidentiary hearing into the matter.a finding that the witness did not commit perjury would itself preclude a finding of constitutional error.lambert,at.
the issue of knowledge is a thornier one.at the time of trial,the government certainly appears to have been aware that vipd records for troy willock listed two individuals sharing the same name and birth fact that the district court admitted should have raised red flags.see edwards,wl,at noting odds that two individuals share same name and birth date is far from impossible but nonetheless a highly improbable coincidence.moreover,even if the government did not know that one number belonged to another person,it also understood from ncic reports that one of the two willocks was claiming two separate social security numbers.id.at.ultimately,as the district court noted,it is clear that,at a minimum,the government should have investigated the identity of its witness further prior to willock appearance at the defendants trial.
however,even assuming arguendo that willock committed perjury that the government knew or should have known that,willock testimony could not have prejudiced the defendants entire case.his testimony was only relevant to counts to and those charges were dismissed at the close of the government case.joint app.the transaction willock testified about did not pertain to the rico conspiracy charged in count for which brooks and edwards were convicted.
limitations on cross examination and the introduction of character testimony 
edwards,brooks,and john baptiste all challenge several of the district court rulings regarding the admission of evidence.we review these claims for abuse of discretion.see united states starnes,cir.the district court exercise of discretion is commonly left undisturbed unless no reasonable person would adopt its view.ansell green acres contracting,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
district court limiting of cross examination of government witnesses 
three of the government witnesses against edwards were facing their own criminal charges when they testified.on,edwards sought to elicit information from the witnesses relating to any deals each made with the government in exchange for their cooperation.the district court acting sua sponte permitted only questions going to the general contours of the sentence reductions and prohibited questions relating to the specific lengths of time they faced without cooperation.the court stated concern was that talk of specific terms of incarceration would prejudice the jury by putting visions of jail and incarceration and penalties into the jurors minds as they deliberated,and cause confusion of the issues because they would lack details as to the actual lengths of the witnesses sentences.
edwards claims that the district court infringed on her constitutional right to confrontation by limiting the scope of the of three government witnesses to nonspecific questions regarding the reduction of their sentences they received in exchange for their cooperation.
the sixth amendment gives a defendant the right to the government witnesses for possible bias.davis alaska.however,a district court retains wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.united states mussare,cir quoting delaware van arsdall.we review any restriction of for abuse of discretion and will reverse only when the restriction is so severe as to constitute a denial of the defendant right to confront witnesses against him and is prejudicial to his substantial rights.united states conley,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether a limitation on violated the confrontation clause,we inquire into whether the limitation significantly limited the defendant right to inquire into a witness motivation for testifying and whether the constraints imposed fell within the reasonable limits that a district court has the authority to impose.mussare,at.the district court ruling was well within this parameter.
the district court limited inquiry only into specific sentences that could have been imposed if the witnesses had refused to cooperate a line of questioning that we have allowed trial courts to curtail.see mussare,at rejecting categorical right to inquire into the penalty a cooperating witness would otherwise have received.indeed,the district court allowed testimony regarding the witnesses agreements to cooperate with the government and the fact that they expected to receive more lenient sentences in return.see,ja exchange between defense counsel and moses in which moses admits,inter alia,that he entered into an agreement with the government for what referred to as substantial assistance.we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion here.
district court limiting of cross examination of deeb 
edwards attempted to attack deeb credibility by him about deeb alleged submission of a fraudulent insurance claim.edwards wanted to produce two witnesses who would have testified about this.the district court ruled that such extrinsic evidence was both impermissible under.b and barred by.because it would result in an unnecessarily confusing mini insurance trial.because deeb compensation from the fbi and dea was at issue,the district court limited any inquiry related to an insurance payout to matters relating to his income,and not to the alleged fraud itself.edwards again argues that the district court decision to limit defense counsel was a violation of her confrontation rights.see edwards br.at.
edwards confrontation argument as to deeb must also fail.in denying edwards defense counsel the opportunity to question deeb as to his past insurance claim,the district court stressed that it had never been established that deeb acted fraudulently.see joint app.a.accordingly,the district court acted well within its discretion in concluding that any questions this insurance claim were potentially confusing,misleading,and risked unnecessary delay.
district court exclusion of out of court statements 
during trial,john baptiste intended to have five witnesses,who were present during the incident with calixte testify about that incident.this is the incident we have discussed and is the same incident that formed the basis of the charges against john baptiste.john baptiste insisted that his arrest of calixte was the result of an altercation in which calixte refused to move her unlawfully parked cab and then proceeded to physically attack him.the proffered testimony was offered to establish that the force used,the arrest,and the detention,were all reasonable under the circumstances.moreover,john baptiste intended to use witnesses recollection that,before the altercation with calixte,he told the drivers of parked cars,which the witnesses understood was the fine for parking in the relevant loading zone.the testimony was intended to show that he fairly and properly enforced vipa rules.
the district court sustained hearsay objections and limited the witnesses testimony only to what they saw,rather than what they heard.the court also rejected john baptiste argument that the statements were verbal parts of acts showing the state of mind of both parties and therefore not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.because this incident,and calixte complaints,form the basis of the allegations against john baptiste,he argues that the district court mechanistic application of the hearsay rule denied him due process,citing chambers mississippi.jean baptiste br.at.
john baptiste argument relies on two exceptions to the hearsay rules.first,he claims that any statements he sought to introduce were not hearsay because they constituted verbal acts a legally operative statement,like making a contract or a threat.united states tyler,cir.the government argument could also be characterized as invoking the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.
under either of these theories,john baptiste arguments would fail.first,it is unclear how any of the testimony that john baptiste sought to introduce which,he explains would have gone to show the reasonableness of the actions of the officer could be characterized as verbal acts.see,united states tyler,cir the hearsay rule excludes statements which themselves affect the legal rights of the parties or are circumstance s bearing on conduct affecting their rights.quoting.c.moreover,to the extent any testimony would have gone to show either john baptiste or calixte frame of mind during their exchange,the government correctly notes that other testimony regarding observations adequately informed the jurors of the confrontation.approached her car she threw a drink can at him he reached for the door handle he pulled her out she kicked him they scuffled he put handcuffs on her br.at.accordingly,the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion when it foreclosed the use of this testimony 
district court refusal to allow john baptiste to cross examine vipa chief wilkes on calixte prior statements 
on of vipa chief edred wilkes,john baptiste defense counsel asked a series of questions attempting to show that calixte had made statements inconsistent with her prior testimony.the district court refused to allow this line of questioning because it constituted improper impeachment under.rule required that calixte first be given the opportunity to explain or deny any extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement.joint app.john baptiste claims that the district court ruling was erroneous and contributed to the denial of his due process rights.the argument is meritless as the court ruling was clearly consistent with rule and well within
