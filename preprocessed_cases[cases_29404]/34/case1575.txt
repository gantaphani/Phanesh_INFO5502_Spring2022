this matter was previously before us on appeal by petitioner justin michael wolfe,a virginia prisoner who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death by the commonwealth in.by our decision of may,see wolfe johnson,cir wolfe i,we remanded for further proceedings.specifically,wolfe i instructed the district court to determine whether wolfe was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and other discovery to decide in the first instance whether,under schlup delo,d,wolfe had made a sufficient showing of actual innocence to clear any procedural bars to his constitutional claims the schlup issue and to assess anew wolfe claim,among others,that the prosecution had contravened his fourteenth amendment due process rights,as recognized in brady maryland,d,by suppressing favorable and material evidence the brady claim.
on remand,the district court heeded our wolfe i mandate,authorized appropriate discovery and conducted an evidentiary hearing,and ruled in wolfe favor on the schlup issue and his brady and two additional claims.by its judgment of august,the court vacated wolfe capital murder and other convictions,and ordered the commonwealth to either retry him within days or release him unconditionally from custody.the judgment was stayed pending this appeal by the commonwealth,which was initiated on its behalf by respondent harold clarke,director of the virginia department of corrections the commonwealth challenges the remand proceedings from start to finish,contending that the district court repeatedly and fatally erred in its procedural and substantive rulings.because we readily conclude,however,that the court award of habeas corpus relief on wolfe brady claim was not marred by any error,we affirm the judgment.
as more fully detailed in our wolfe i decision,a prince william county jury found wolfe guilty in of capital murder,using a firearm in the commission of a felony,and conspiring to distribute marijuana.see wolfe i,at.the trial court sentenced wolfe to death for the murder,plus consecutive terms of three years for the firearm offense and thirty years for the drug conspiracy.id.the murder conviction was premised on evidence that wolfe,then a marijuana dealer in northern virginia,hired his close friend and fellow drug dealer owen barber iv to murder drug supplier daniel petrole in march.id.at explaining that virginia defines capital murder,in pertinent part,as t he willful,deliberate,and premeditated killing of any person by another for hire quoting ann.significantly,barber was the prosecution key witness,in that he was the only witness to provide any direct evidence regarding the for hire element of the murder offense and the involvement of wolfe therein.id.at.in exchange for barber testimony that he was wolfe hired triggerman,the commonwealth dismissed its capital murder charge against barber,and he pleaded guilty to murder.barber was sentenced to sixty years in prison,of which years were suspended.id.at.
in november,after failing to obtain relief from his convictions on direct appeal and in state habeas corpus proceedings,wolfe filed his initial petition in the district court.see wolfe i,at.it was only thereafter,on december,that barber executed an affidavit repudiating his trial testimony and exculpating wolfe from the scheme.id.at.within a single day,wolfe filed an amended petition,along with an appendix of supporting materials,including additional affidavits corroborating the barber affidavit and suggesting that the prosecution had suppressed evidence that should have been disclosed to the defense.id.at.the amended petition raised,inter alia,the schlup actual innocence issue,thereby asserting a second ground to excuse any procedural default of wolfe constitutional claims the previously asserted first ground having been the separate cause and prejudice standard.id.at.in april,while the amended petition and related procedural issues were pending before the magistrate judge,wolfe notified the court that barber sought to repudiate the statements in his affidavit exculpating wolfe.id.at.in conjunction with that notice,wolfe lawyers requested an evidentiary hearing to resolve credibility issues,plus discovery into the prosecution compliance with its brady obligations.id.at.
in august,the magistrate judge issued his report,rejecting wolfe request for an evidentiary hearing,deeming the barber and other affidavits to lack credibility,and recommending the dismissal of wolfe amended petition on the ground that the claims asserted therein were meritless,had been procedurally defaulted,or both.see wolfe i,at.although wolfe spelled out a lengthy series of objections to the magistrate judge report,the district court,by its decision of february,adopted the report as its own and dismissed wolfe petition.id.at explaining,inter alia,that the court did not address the schlup issue,but considered and rejected wolfe contention that his procedural defaults were excused under the cause and prejudice standard internal quotation marks omitted.after the court declined to alter or amend its decision,we granted wolfe a c certificate of appealability on his brady and three other claims.id.at.and,as explained above,we ultimately remanded with instructions for the court to determine wolfe entitlement to an evidentiary hearing and other discovery,to decide the schlup issue in the first instance,and to freshly assess the brady and two additional claims.id.at.we also advised the court that it was free to revisit its cause and prejudice ruling.id.at.
without explicitly reconsidering its prior cause and prejudice ruling,the district court decided the procedural schlup issue early in the remand proceedings,by its opinion and order of february.see wolfe clarke,the schlup order the court therein determined,largely on the existing wolfe i record,that owen barber subsequently disavowed recantation of his trial testimony was sufficiently corroborated to raise doubt in a reasonable juror mind about the circumstances of the night of the daniel petrole murder.schlup order.indeed weighing the two stories of what occurred on the night of the murder,both with hearsay corroboration,and almost no other evidence that would support one version over another the court concluded that it was more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found wolfe guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.applying schlup,at requiring petitioner to show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.accordingly,the court announced that wolfe had met the schlup standard,thus justifying review of the merits of his procedurally defaulted constitutional claims.id.the court also granted wolfe request for an evidentiary hearing,as well as discovery.id.at.
during the contentious course of the discovery proceedings,wolfe had to move to compel the commonwealth to meet its discovery obligations.a june,hearing on wolfe motion revealed,inter alia,that the commonwealth had provided only unsworn responses to the interrogatories it had answered,had wholly failed to respond to other interrogatories,and was refusing to produce approximately documents that it unilaterally deemed irrelevant.by its order of june,the district court directed the commonwealth to provide sworn responses to wolfe interrogatories,including those previously unanswered,and to allow wolfe to examine the hundreds of theretofore undisclosed documents,subject to an agreed protective order.see wolfe clarke,cv.june,the discovery order to give wolfe an opportunity to assess the evidence that would be forthcoming under the discovery order,the court was constrained to postpone the impending evidentiary hearing.
the evidentiary hearing finally ensued late that autumn,when it was conducted over the four days of november and.on the second day of the hearing,in response to the commonwealth objection to wolfe use of newly disclosed evidence in support of his existing brady and other claims,wolfe filed a motion to amend his petition.see arguing that the commonwealth has tenaciously fought to deny wolfe access to any facts that would have enabled him to plead additional brady,and thus should not be rewarded for playing and should not be allowed to blame wolfe for lacking the clairvoyance to include these proposed amendments to his federal habeas petition without the benefit of the withheld documents.by its order of november,the district court granted wolfe motion to amend out of an abundance of caution,but found that even in the absence of the motion,the issues wolfe raises fall squarely within the existing brady claim.see wolfe clarke,cv,the amendment order 
thereafter,by its opinion and order of july,the court determined that wolfe was entitled to habeas corpus relief premised on,inter alia,the commonwealth manifold violations of his brady rights.see wolfe clarke,cv.july,the brady order specifically,the court ruled in the brady order that the prosecution had withheld eight items or groups of favorable and material evidence,falling into three broader categories evidence tending to impeach triggerman barber evidence tending to impeach other prosecution witnesses who corroborated barber testimony and evidence suggesting an alternate theory of the petrole murder.the court also deemed wolfe to be entitled to relief on his claim that the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony by barber,in contravention of wolfe fourteenth amendment due process rights under napue illinois,d,and giglio united states,d the giglio claim,as well as his claim that the state trial court deprived him of his rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to an impartial jury by striking a qualified venireman for cause the venireman claim.notably,the court closed its brady order by specifying that wolfe conviction and sentence both in the singular were vacated.see brady order.
wolfe timely filed a federal rule of civil procedure e motion to alter or amend the judgment,seeking the district court clarification that the awarded relief encompassed vacatur of not only his murder conviction and death sentence,but also his convictions and sentences for using a firearm in the commission of a felony and conspiring to distribute marijuana.the court granted wolfe motion by its order of august.see wolfe clarke,cv,the relief order.the court clarified therein that,i n light of its finding that wolfe was denied the right to due process during his state criminal trial,he is entitled to a new trial on all charges previously considered by the state court.relief order.that same day,the judgment was amended to direct the commonwealth to retry wolfe within days or release him unconditionally.see wolfe clarke,cv,the judgment.the judgment was subsequently stayed pending this appeal by the commonwealth.see wolfe clarke,the stay order 
we possess jurisdiction over the commonwealth appeal pursuant to.further,because we granted wolfe a certificate of appealability for a,we have and c jurisdiction to consider his contention that the district court should have granted him relief on an additional,unadjudicated claim that e ven if the prosecutors had no knowledge of barber perjury at the time of trial,they do now,and thus his continuing detention by the commonwealth constitute s a due process violation.see br.of appellee quoting sanders sullivan,cir the sanders claim see also brady order ruling in favor of wolfe on his giglio,rather than sanders,claim,premised on the finding that the commonwealth presented barber trial testimony despite having information in its possession indicating that the testimony was false.
as explained below,we need look no further than one item of the first category of evidence withheld from wolfe defense by the prosecution the evidence tending to impeach barber to agree with the district court that wolfe deserves habeas corpus relief on his brady claim and affirm the judgment.see brady order observing that the suppressed habeas evidence relating to barber alone is enough to warrant habeas relief under brady.consequently,we need not review any issues of substance or procedure related solely to the other withheld evidence underlying wolfe brady claim,or to his giglio,sanders,and venireman claims.
the single,plainly momentous item of suppressed barber impeachment evidence on which we rest today decision is a written police report reflecting that before barber ever asserted that wolfe hired him to murder petrole prince william county detective newsome advised barber that he could avoid the death penalty by implicating wolfe.see the newsome report.the newsome report documents newsome and fellow detective walburn conversations with barber during an april,flight,returning barber to virginia upon his arrest in california three weeks after the petrole murder.in pertinent part,the newsome report reveals the following 
i told barber that we knew he had killed petrole and had a very strong case against him.but that as far as we knew he had no personal problem with daniel petrole but that he had killed him for someone else and we believed that person was justin wolfe.i explained to him that we needed the information that he had in order to arrest wolfe.i explained again that we had a very strong case against him barber and that we could stop there but that would not be right since we knew it was someone else sic idea.i told him that he was potentially facing a capitol sic murder charge in this case and that he needed to help himself.he asked me,what do i get out of it if i tell you who the other person,the higher up,is.i told him i could not make any promises to him,but that the commonwealth might entertain the idea of not charging him with capitol sic murder,or that they may be willing to make a recommendation as to his sentence.
again barber asked about discovery and i again explained it to him.he then said,what do i get out it sic if i name the higher up.i told him that was one of his problems that his case was so tight he really had very little to offer us.i told him it could simply be the difference between capitol sic murder or first degree,execution or life in prison,or that the commonwealth may be willing to make a recommendation in sentencing after speaking to his attorney.i told him again that the commonwealth attorney would make these decisions and that i could not promise him anything.i pointed out that at this point he would do more good than harm for himself by cooperating with us.
the commonwealth inexplicably withheld the newsome report from wolfe until these proceedings in,after wolfe first appeal and during the contentious discovery proceedings conducted in the wolfe i remand.thus,the newsome report was among the newly disclosed evidence that the commonwealth argued was outside the legitimate purview of wolfe brady claim a contention that was roundly rejected by the district court in its amendment order of november.during the evidentiary hearing,as recounted in the court subsequent brady order,barber recanted his trial testimony while under oath.brady order.barber also engaged in the following exchange with the commonwealth lawyer during 
q.you related that several times they had said if you do tell us what we want,you will get capital murder 
q.who is they 
commonwealth attorney ebert,assistant commonwealth attorney conway,barber attorney pickett,detective newsome,and detective walburn.
q.but if my notes are correct,they never told you exactly what to say.they did give you a script for the events of that night,did they 
a.a specific script for the events,no.
q.they in fact told you what they wanted was the truth,did they 
a.they said that they know justin wolfe is involved and that we know that he hired you to kill danny petrole.
well,what they told you they wanted you to tell them was the truth.was that their statement 
was that their statement to you,that they wanted the truth 
yeah.i mean,they said they wanted the truth,but at the same time they said that this is what you have got to say or you are getting the chair.
by its brady order,the district court found the foregoing testimony by barber to be consistent with the suppressed newsome report.see brady order.the court also deemed barber recantation to be credible and generally found his demeanor and candor to be persuasive.id.at.
among the enumerated findings of fact in the district court brady order is the finding that t he prosecution failed to disclose detective newsome report outlining his initial interview with owen barber on april,during which he newsome implicated wolfe as being involved in the murder before barber mentioned his wolfe s involvement.brady order.the court also spelled out the controlling legal standard for assessing wolfe brady claim,observing that,to find a brady violation,it must determine that the evidence was favorable to the accused,suppressed by the prosecution either willfully or inadvertently,and material.id.at citing banks dretke,d.in concluding that the emergence of the newsome report entitled wolfe to habeas corpus relief,the court explained 
this information is favorable to wolfe because it documents the fact that detectives first mentioned wolfe in connection to the murder and presented barber with the option of execution or life imprisonment in exchange for implicating someone else,well before barber began cooperating with the commonwealth or implicating wolfe in the murder.prosecutors do not dispute the fact that the report was not provided to wolfe.furthermore,the report is material because it reflects that barber had a motive to misrepresent the facts regarding petrole death.
according to the commonwealth,we should not reach or address the merits of the newsome report aspect of wolfe brady claim,because the newsome report would never have surfaced or been made available to wolfe but for the flawed procedural rulings made by the district court in the wolfe i remand proceedings.in that regard,the commonwealth asserts that the court erred in three respects by generally excusing wolfe procedural defaults under the schlup actual innocence standard by authorizing discovery and conducting the evidentiary hearing and by allowing wolfe to amend his petition to broaden his brady claim to include the newsome report and other newly disclosed evidence.we examine those assertions in turn.
attacking the schlup order,the commonwealth argues that the district court erred by ruling early in the remand proceedings that wolfe satisfied the schlup actual innocence standard on the basis of the wolfe i record,including the affidavit in which barber recanted his trial testimony and denied wolfe involvement in the petrole murder.the commonwealth emphasizes that the court,in looking at that same record,had already decided that the barber affidavit lacked credibility.see br.of appellant the court never explained its about face and the record certainly did not justify any finding of innocence under schlup.wolfe,of course,defends the schlup order,asserting that the correctness of the district court findings was confirmed when barber recanted his trial testimony while under oath at the order evidentiary hearing.see br.of appellee internal quotation marks omitted see also brady order finding barber evidentiary hearing recantation credible and his demeanor and candor persuasive.
in any event,we need not reach or assess the parties competing contentions on the validity of the schlup order.put simply,any procedural default of wolfe brady claim particularly as it relates to the newsome report was otherwise excused under the separate cause and prejudice standard.as we explained in wolfe i,
a procedural default is excusable under the cause and prejudice standard when the petitioner demonstrates that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule,murray carrier,and that errors at his trial worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,infecting his entire trial with errors of constitutional dimensions,united states frady,d.
wolfe i,at alteration in original.on remand,after having decided the schlup issue in wolfe favor,the district court understandably declined our wolfe i invitation to revisit its prior cause and prejudice ruling.see id.at.nevertheless,pursuant to supreme court precedent,the district court necessarily found cause and prejudice for the brady claim default when it determined that claim to be meritorious.see banks,at recognizing that c ause and prejudice parallel two of the three components of the alleged brady violation itself quoting strickler greene,d.
to illustrate,as recognized by the district court,the three components or essential elements of a brady prosecutorial misconduct claim are the following the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.banks,at quoting strickler,at.by satisfying the second brady component evidence suppressed by the state,a petitioner shows cause when the reason for his failure to develop facts in proceedings was the state suppression of the relevant evidence.id.additionally,coincident with the third brady component prejudice,prejudice within the compass of the cause and prejudice requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is material for brady purposes.id.
thus,by succeed ing in establishing the elements of his brady claim which we today affirm that he did wolfe concurrently succeed ed in demonstrating cause and prejudice for his procedural default of that claim.see banks,at.by these circumstances,the commonwealth challenge to the schlup order is rendered moot.
next,the commonwealth asserts the district court erred in the remand proceedings by authorizing discovery and conducting the evidentiary hearing.in rejecting the commonwealth position,we emphasize that the court faithfully followed our wolfe i directions to whether wolfe has shown that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing,and then,i f such a hearing is warranted,to resolve any factual disputes bearing on the procedural schlup issue and the substantive brady and giglio claims.see wolfe i,at.we also observe that wolfe i pragmatically anticipated that discovery would be conducted in conjunction with any evidentiary hearing.see id.at advising that,i f the court determines that schlup is satisfied on the existing record,any evidentiary hearing and discovery proceedings may relate primarily to the merits of wolfe substantive claims emphasis added.we therefore conclude that,in authorizing discovery and conducting the evidentiary hearing,the district court acted well within its discretion.see schriro landrigan,d recognizing that the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing in a case is generally left to the sound discretion of the district courts see also conaway polk,cir relating that district court decision on whether to conduct evidentiary hearing or authorize discovery proceedings is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
briefly,as we more thoroughly explained in wolfe i,at,if a petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,e bars a district court from conducting an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the petitioner can satisfy one of two statutory exceptions.importantly,however,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.wolfe i,at quoting williams michael taylor,d see also cullen pinholster,d recently affirming that e continues to have force,in that it still restricts the discretion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence when deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state court citing michael williams,at.
applying the controlling standard on remand,the district court determined that e did not bar wolfe from an evidentiary hearing.see schlup order.in so ruling,the court observed that wolfe had made diligent efforts in the state court proceedings to develop his brady claim by request ing a hearing,fil ing requests under the virginia freedom of information act,and mov ing for discovery on multiple occasions.id.at.moreover,with respect to the exculpatory barber affidavit on which wolfe federal habeas petition largely relied,the court found that t here was no indication that barber would have been willing to give his affidavit at an earlier time,particularly as
