at about on october,amber howard was driving south from maryland into the district of columbia along the baltimore washington parkway,a federal area maintained by the national park service.as she approached,she saw a car lights coming toward her from the northbound side of the highway.she watched that car drive over the median,flip several times,and crash into the highway embankment.
howard pulled over and dialed,then ran to check on the accident.she approached the car and heard a woman screaming for help.as howard tried to indicate that help was on the way,the woman,appellant kristen smith,exited the wrecked vehicle through its rear passenger window and walked toward howard.as smith approached,howard heard her say i never drink.i never drink.i did want to go out.i never drink.i only had one drink.howard also saw the arm of smith passenger,jabari outz,hanging out the car window.
while waiting for the police to arrive,a distressed and disoriented smith repeatedly wandered onto the highway,forcing howard to pull her out of the road several times.howard also smelled the odor of white liquor emanating from smith.white liquor,as howard explained at trial,is alcohol such as vodka,gin,or tequila,and in howard experience as a bartender,has a smell distinct from dark liquor or beer.
united states park police officer gary hatch arrived on the scene at about and found smith car on its side,leaning against a stone wall.by this time,outz had been pronounced dead on the scene by emergency medical services.officer hatch,who had some experience as an accident reconstructionist,analyzed the scene and determined that smith car had left the northbound roadway,flipped after crossing the median,and crashed into the stone wall.
smith was taken to prince george county hospital,where she submitted to a routine blood test park police officer david lorde was dispatched to stay with smith while she received treatment in the emergency room.he testified that smith was writhing in bed and making unsolicited statements,three of which he recalled in particular do ever drink and drive,i just hope he okay,and lock me up and throw away the key.
some time later,park police officer ernest patrick arrived at the emergency room to oversee a second blood draw,which was conducted at.the blood sample from this draw,which showed a blood alcohol content of grams per milliliters,was furnished to lucas zarwell,the deputy chief toxicologist at the office of the chief medical examiner in washington,
the government charged smith in a indictment for homicide during the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony,in violation of a.the underlying unlawful act was an alleged violation of a,which provides that o perating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle is prohibited while t he alcohol concentration in the operator blood or breath is grams or more of alcohol per milliliters of blood.notably,the government chose not to charge smith with a violation of a,which prohibits operating a motor vehicle while u nder the influence of alcohol to a degree that renders the operator incapable of safe operation.unlike the per se a violation,a does not require the government to prove the defendant blood alcohol level.
deputy chief toxicologist zarwell testified as an expert witness on the results of the blood sample,stating that it contained grams of alcohol per milliliters of blood.over the defense objection,zarwell also gave generalized testimony about how the human body metabolizes alcohol,including the average duration of alcohol absorption and rate of elimination.he indicated that typically people continue to absorb alcohol for about minutes after they stop drinking and that females eliminate alcohol at an average rate of about grams per milliliters per hour.
prior to,smith renewed her objection to zarwell statements on alcohol metabolization,moving to strike this line of testimony on the ground that it exceeded the scope of the pretrial notice provided by the government.pointing to a series of letters exchanged between counsel before trial,the defense charged that the government had represented that zarwell testimony would be limited to the results of smith blood test.the defense argued that without explicit notice that zarwell would be testifying about metabolization rates more generally,it was unprepared to effectively zarwell and unable to realistically procure a rebuttal witness.smith did not move for a continuance or otherwise indicate that she wanted time to procure her own expert witness regarding blood alcohol absorption rates,although the court indicated that she could call her own witness in response to zarwell broadened testimony.
the district court denied the motion to strike,holding that the government disclosures were sufficient.zarwell generic testimony,the court explained,was within his area of expertise and served as necessary background to his testimony on smith blood test result.nor did the court find the admission of zarwell testimony to be unduly prejudicial,since smith had the opportunity to him and to find her own toxicology expert.
the district court also rejected the defense alternative contention that zarwell testimony on generic human alcohol metabolization was irrelevant as to smith blood alcohol content at the time of the accident.even though zarwell had not offered an opinion as to smith blood alcohol content at,the court reasoned that the jury was not prohibited from making inferences on that issue based on zarwell generic metabolization testimony and the results of the test.
during,zarwell confirmed that his blood alcohol analysis showed the quantity of alcohol in smith blood only at the time of the test,not beforehand.he also conceded,notwithstanding his earlier testimony about typical alcohol absorption and elimination rates,that those rates are highly variable among individuals.zarwell stated that although he would have been able to conduct an individualized analysis of smith absorption and elimination rates,he had not done so.zarwell also confirmed that he had not performed a retrograde extrapolation of smith blood alcohol level at the time of the crash and did not offer any opinion about her blood alcohol level at that time.
at the close of the government case in chief,smith moved for a judgment of acquittal under,arguing that the evidence produced by the government was insufficient to show her blood alcohol level exceeded at the time of the accident,almost three hours before the blood test.the district court denied the motion,concluding that based upon the blood test result,the evidence of smith erratic driving and behavior,and the statements she made at the hospital,a rational jury could reasonably infer that she had violated a.smith offered no evidence and renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal,which the district court again denied.
at the charge conference,smith requested several supplemental jury instructions,one of which proposed to instruct the jury,in relevant part,as follows 
as you heard,the rates of alcohol absorption and elimination can vary between persons.therefore,the practice of extrapolating a person blood alcohol level at the time of driving from a test of a blood sample taken at a later time requires careful consideration of many factors i instruct you that you should not attempt to extrapolate the blood alcohol of the accused at the time of driving from the result of a blood test from samples taken at a later time unless sufficient evidence has been presented to you with regard to the aforementioned factors you may not infer from the test of defendant blood samples taken at on october,in this case without more,as i have described above what defendant blood alcohol content at the time of driving around might have been.
the district court rejected this instruction.it explained that the jury already knew that there was no piece of evidence,standing alone,showing that smith blood alcohol content exceeded at the time of the crash an element the existing jury instructions already established was essential to the crime.but because there were other facts in the record from which the jury might reasonably infer the a violation,the court allowed the jury to draw those inferences.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on the sole count of the indictment.prior to sentencing,smith renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal and moved for a new trial.the district court denied both motions and imposed its sentence.this appeal followed.
the issues before us are whether the district court erred in permitting the government toxicology expert to testify about generic alcohol metabolization rates whether smith was entitled to a judgment of acquittal due to insufficient evidence and whether the district court erred in refusing to give smith requested jury instruction concerning blood alcohol level extrapolation.we consider each issue in turn.
smith contends the district court erred in permitting the government toxicology expert to testify about generic alcohol metabolization rates.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion,united states basham,cir,and generally will not reverse absent a showing of prejudice,united states durham,cir.
smith argues that she was unfairly surprised by toxicologist lucas zarwell testimony regarding average human alcohol metabolization rates because this testimony exceeded the scope of the pretrial notice provided by the government pursuant to.as she did at trial,smith points to the series of letters exchanged between counsel during discovery that comprised the parties rule communications.the government initial written disclosure included zarwell curriculum vitae and named him as the likely toxicology expert.in response,smith counsel wrote it is assumed from your discovery response that the expert evidence would be limited to testimony that smith blood sample revealed an ethanol level of.the government reply confirmed that smith characterization was correct as to the toxicology expert testimony.smith argues that since zarwell testimony was not confined to the results of the blood test,as the letters suggested it would be,the district court abused its discretion by admitting it.as a result,smith claims she was unable to effectively zarwell on the intricacies of or prepare her own expert to rebut zarwell testimony.
the government echoes the district court justification for admitting the evidence,arguing that zarwell gave no testimony about smith personal alcohol elimination rate and that zarwell testimony concerning typical human alcohol metabolization was general background information within the scope of both the notice and his expertise.it notes that smith never objected to zarwell qualifications as a toxicology expert and that,having sat down with zarwell before trial for an interview,smith counsel had ample opportunity to prepare for.finally,the government asserts that even assuming error,smith has failed to demonstrate how she suffered any prejudice as a result of the testimony or the wording of the government pretrial disclosure.
federal rule of criminal procedure a g requires the government to give,at the defendant request,a written summary of any expert testimony that it intends to use during its at trial.this summary must describe the witness opinions,the bases and reasons for those opinions,and the witness qualifications.a g.as the rule advisory committee notes explain,rule a g is intended to minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert testimony through focused.a g advisory comm.note to the amendment.
on the one hand,we do not fault smith for taking issue with the government less than fulsome pretrial summary of zarwell planned expert testimony on the other hand,consistent with the government rule disclosure,zarwell declined to offer any opinion on smith personal metabolization rate,and did not attempt to extrapolate what her blood alcohol content might have been at and although full disclosure by the government would have been more in keeping with the spirit of rule,we think it fair to characterize zarwell testimony on typical human alcohol absorption and elimination rates as generic background information that fell within the scope of zarwell expertise.
in any event,we need not decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the government did not violate rule a g,because any error was harmless.in addition to showing the district court error,a defendant seeking reversal under rule a g must also demonstrate prejudice resulting from the district court decision to admit the contested testimony.united states buchanan,cir see also united states charley,cir affirming a district court decision despite a rule violation,due to absence of prejudice to defendant.
smith fails to make that showing here.although smith claims that the government incomplete rule disclosure prevented her from effectively zarwell on the intricacies of science,zarwell never offered any such evidence.further,smith interviewed zarwell prior to the trial,and extensively him at trial regarding the numerous factors that determine an individual blood alcohol absorption rate,the nuances of his generalized direct testimony,and whether it was possible that a person blood alcohol level would continue to increase for a few hours after consumption and to the extent smith disagreed with zarwell testimony regarding general metabolization rates,the district court gave her ample opportunity to call her own rebuttal expert.smith simply chose not to pursue that avenue or ask for a continuance to consider it.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in permitting zarwell expert testimony.
we next consider smith argument that she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the government offered insufficient evidence to support her conviction.we review de novo the district court decision to deny a defendant rule motion for judgment of acquittal.united states smith,cir.on an appeal challenging the sufficiency of evidence,we assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and the jury verdict must stand unless we determine that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states young,cir.
smith concedes that the government presented evidence that she was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident.she also concedes that the government evidence established that her blood contained grams of alcohol per milliliters at,nearly three hours after the crash.smith contends,however,that the government did not offer sufficient evidence upon which a rational finder of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that,at the time she was operating her vehicle,her blood alcohol concentration was percent or more,as a a per se violation requires.absent such direct evidence,smith insists,she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.
the government responds that its evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.it argues that the fact that smith had a blood alcohol content exceeding percent within a reasonable period of the time after driving sufficed to show a violation of the a per se offense,without any need for evidence,which it argues is unreliable
