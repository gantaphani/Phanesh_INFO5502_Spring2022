the government charged gerard sasso with one count of interfering with the operation of an aircraft with reckless disregard for human life and one count of making false statements.see a.after a trial,a jury found the defendant guilty as charged.the defendant was sentenced to serve three years in prison.on appeal,the defendant raises a gallimaufry of issues,only two of which need be discussed.
we begin with the defendant plaint that the district court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence did not suffice to support his conviction under a.see.we review de novo the denial of a rule motion.see united states dwinells,cir.in determining whether the evidence suffices to sustain a conviction,we take the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states walker,cir.the verdict must stand unless the evidence is so exiguous that no rational jury could conclude that the government proved all the essential elements of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.united states rodríguez vélez,cir.
the evidence,taken agreeably to the verdict,reveals the following.on the night of december,two members of the massachusetts state police lieutenant timothy riley and trooper michael basteri flew a helicopter escort of a liquefied natural gas tanker as it traversed boston harbor en route to a facility in everett,massachusetts.at about as the helicopter was flying over the mystic river,the troopers noticed a bright green light two to three miles to the northwest.basteri recognized the green light as a laser beam and warned riley the pilot not to look at it.riley swerved to avoid direct contact,but the laser beam hit the aircraft,filling the cockpit with bright green light.
the troopers elected to abandon their escort mission in order to track down the source of the laser beam.as they flew toward their quarry in a zigzag pattern,the beam struck the helicopter several times.the final strike occurred when the helicopter was approximately half a mile away from the source.
the troopers determined that the laser beam was emanating from the third floor of a house on the medford somerville border.they radioed this information to police officers on the ground.medford police,including sergeant jack buckley,responded and knocked on the door of the defendant tenement at main street.
when the defendant answered the knock,the officers told him that they were investigating a laser strike on a helicopter.the defendant denied any involvement in the incident and said that he had no lasers or instruments in his abode.he invited the officers to look around,which they did.
the officers pressed the question of whether the defendant possessed any lasers,and he eventually admitted that he had a small keychain laser.he nevertheless continued to maintain that he did not possess any other lasers.by like token,he denied any involvement in the helicopter incident.
buckley then noticed an item on the defendant nightstand that appeared to be a laser pointer.when asked about the artifact,the defendant began to backtrack.according to buckley,the defendant said,i did it.it was me,and added that he was sorry and did not mean to cause all the commotion.the defendant explained that he had a penchant for stargazing,and that when he saw the helicopter he decided to light it up.when he heard the helicopter directly overhead,he got scared and hid the laser that he had pointed at the helicopter in a baseboard heater.
buckley retrieved the hidden laser,which had a label reading danger laser radiation,avoid direct eye exposure,laser diode,wavelength,max output.asked if he owned any other lasers,the defendant opened a bureau drawer containing nine additional lasers.
on june,the defendant was arrested and brought to the federal courthouse in boston.special agent michael ryan of the department of homeland security testified that during the ride the defendant acknowledged that he had lased the helicopter and he further provided that he did realize it was a massachusetts state police helicopter until it was around his house.
the defendant contends that this evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the scienter required under a.he argues that the government failed to prove that he willfully interfered with the operation of the helicopter with reckless disregard for the safety of human life.we disagree.in our view,the evidence was sufficient to convict.
drawing all plausible inferences in favor of the verdict,a reasonable jury could have found as this jury did that the government proved all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.the jurors heard testimony that the defendant admitted that he had noticed the helicopter and decided to light it up.they also heard testimony that notwithstanding the helicopter zigzag flight path,the laser struck it repeatedly.based on this testimony,the jurors could reasonably infer that the defendant intended all along to target the helicopter.given the warning label on the laser,the jurors could further infer that the defendant knew that aiming the laser at the helicopter might interfere with its operation and thereby pose a risk to human life.to cinch matters,an attempt to cover up the commission of a crime implies consciousness of guilt.see united states gonsalves,cir see also united states vega molina,cir consciousness of guilt evidence is generally admissible in a criminal case.here,the jurors could reasonably infer consciousness of guilt and,thus,intent from the defendant endeavor to conceal his possession of the laser that he had pointed at the helicopter.
to say more about the rule claim of error would be supererogatory.on the facts of this case,it is clear that a rational jury could conclude that the government satisfied its burden of proving all the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.the motion for a judgment of acquittal was,therefore,appropriately denied.
the defendant next assignment of error implicates the same count of conviction.he calumnizes the district court construction of the scienter requirement as reflected in both the jury instructions and the verdict form.the defendant fully preserved these objections below.
preserved claims of instructional error are assessed on appeal under a bifurcated framework.decaro hasbro,cir.we review de novo questions about whether the instructions conveyed the essence of the applicable law and review for abuse of discretion questions about whether the court choice of language was unfairly prejudicial.id.in this instance,the claim of instructional error involves the district court interpretation of the scienter element of section a,engendering de novo review.see united states pitrone,cir explaining that when a claimed error involves the interpretation of the elements of a statutory offense,it poses a question of law and engenders de novo review.
we hasten to add a caveat.even an incorrect instruction to which an objection has been preserved will not require us to set aside a verdict if the error is harmless.see united states argentine,cir.there are two barometers for measuring harmless error in a criminal case.the stricter standard,applicable mainly to issues of constitutional dimension,requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not influence the verdict.see chapman california,d argentine,at.the less stringent standard,applicable mainly to trial errors that are not of constitutional dimension,allows a conviction to stand,error notwithstanding,as long as it can be said with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.kotteakos united states.here,we assume,favorably to the government,that the less stringent kotteakos standard applies.
