opinion of the court 
keenan price appeals from convictions on drug and gun possession charges price raises three issues first,that the district court improperly allowed two police officers to present hearsay testimony about the contents of the radio report to which they responded second,that the district court improperly allowed the government expert witness to testify about price mental state and third,that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of in furtherance in c.we can discern no impropriety in the district court rulings,and will affirm on all three issues.
price was arrested along with two other men while sitting in a parked car in a parking lot in philadelphia.drugs and drug paraphernalia were found in the car,and when the car was subsequently searched,pursuant to a warrant,drugs and a gun were found in the trunk.philadelphia police officer frank bonett,who had been observing the parking lot while performing drug surveillance,testified that he had seen price open the trunk,take a gun out of his pants,and place it in the trunk.
there were several officers in the vicinity of the parking lot that night.relevant to this case were bonett,the surveillance officer,who was hiding in and around other cars in the lot,and two backup officers,sergeant anthony chiarolanza and officer thomas lacorte,who were waiting nearby in an unmarked car.chiarolanza and lacorte were part of the backup team,whose job was to move in when called,and support any eventual arrest.midway through the surveillance operation one of the alleged drug dealers apparently spotted chiarolanza and lacorte and identified them as police.the alleged dealer then alerted price to the presence of police.at that point,according to bonett testimony,price got into the car and moved it to another area of the parking lot,then reached into his pants,took out a gun,opened the trunk,put the gun inside,and sat down again in the driver seat.
when bonett saw that price had a gun,he reported this fact on the radio,at which point chiarolanza and lacorte moved in and approached the car,following what they testified was the standard police protocol,in surveillance operations,of arresting a suspect immediately once a gun is observed,rather than continuing to perform surveillance.price and the other two men were removed from the car and searched.they had nothing incriminating on their persons,but vials of crack were found in the car,clearly prepared for sale,including some in a bag under the driver seat,where price had been sitting,and under which he had been observed reaching by chiarolanza and lacorte as they approached the car.
at trial,bonett testified as to what he seen while performing surveillance.he stated that he observed price engage in several transactions with individuals who approached the car,and that after being warned of the police presence,price had removed the gun from his pants and placed it in the trunk.
chiarolanza testified after bonett.the government elicited from chiarolanza a hearsay account of those latter details as bonett had reported them on the radio that price had taken a gun from his pants and placed it in the trunk of the car.the defense objected on hearsay grounds,and the district court allowed the testimony as background to explain the context of chiarolanza actions,instructing the jury that the testimony about the radio call was to be used solely to explain why chiarolanza had approached the car,and not for the truth of its content,that price in fact had possession of the gun.officer lacorte testified after chiarolanza,and the government elicited from him similar testimony.between them,the two officers used the term gun nine times.
price appeals,charging that the government used the hearsay testimony of the other two officers to bolster bonett testimony.price defense was that none of the contraband found in the trunk was his,and his trial strategy was to attack the credibility of bonett testimony,and to emphasize the lack of corroborating eyewitnesses or physical evidence to confirm that price had been in possession of the gun.he argues that by allowing chiarolanza and lacorte to relate the contents of the radio call to which they responded,the district court contravened our teaching in united states sallins,cir,about how the rule against hearsay should be applied in such situations.
the government also called an expert witness to testify about the common behaviors of drug sellers as opposed to drug buyers.drug buyers,the witness testified,almost never bring a gun to the transaction.drug sellers,on the other hand,almost always have a gun at hand or readily available.price contends that this testimony constituted impermissible speculation as to his mental state.
finally,the district court instructed the jury on the meaning of in furtherance in c.price challenges the adequacy of that instruction.
we consider price contentions in turn.
standard of review 
at the threshold,we ask,first,whether we are reviewing a legal determination or a discretionary application of the rules of evidence.we ask,second,whether price has sufficiently preserved this issue for review.
whether a statement is hearsay is a legal question subject to plenary review.sallins,at.if the district court correctly classifies a statement as hearsay,its application of the relevant hearsay exceptions is subject to review for abuse of discretion.united states tyler,cir.
if the government had sought to introduce the statements under one of the hearsay exceptions of rule,then our review would be for abuse of discretion.but the government grounds for introduction were not that the testimony fit one of the exceptions,but rather that the testimony was not hearsay,because it was offered not for its truth but rather as background to explain the context of the responding officers actions.because the government did not invoke,and the district court did not apply,one of the established hearsay exceptions,the issue for us is whether the statements were hearsay.price argues that the statements were hearsay,insofar as they actually served as substantive corroboration of bonett eyewitness testimony.if they served the substantive purpose of corroborating bonett testimony,they were hearsay if they served only to provide background information,they were not hearsay.whether the challenged statements are hearsay is a legal question,and our review is plenary.
the second threshold question is whether price preserved this objection for our review.at trial,defense counsel objected only once on hearsay grounds,during chiarolanza testimony.the district court ruled,on that objection,that chiarolanza account of bonett radio report could come in as background,to explain chiarolanza presence on the scene.that portion of the transcript is excerpted below.the hearsay objection was raised after chiarolanza had made four references to price having had a gun,and the prosecution had made one such reference.following the district court cautionary instruction,chiarolanza referred to the gun twice more.lacorte,in his testimony,referred to the gun three times.the government contends that because lacorte references to the gun came after the district court instruction,we should review those references and presumably,on the same logic the latter two of chiarolanza references for plain error.
we do not agree our plain error jurisprudence is not so parsimonious.we apply plain error review when an issue was not brought to the attention of the district court.see,collins alco parking,cir becker.that certainly was not the case here.the ground of the defense objection was clear police officers other than bonett should not be permitted to relate what they heard bonett say on the radio.the government argued that such testimony was admissible for the purpose of explaining the officers actions.the district court agreed.no reasonable attorney would doubt that the ruling covered lacorte as well as chiarolanza.lacorte testified immediately after chiarolanza,and their testimony was materially identical each said that the two of them heard bonett report that price had a gun,and thereupon approached the car and arrested price.the purpose of requiring contemporaneous objection at trial for full appellate review is to ensure that the trial court has an opportunity to consider and rule on disputed questions of law.when an issue has been raised,and a ruling made,that purpose is served.we do not suggest,to be sure,that a single objection to one statement by one witness,preserves an issue as to all statements by all witnesses.but we think it clear enough on this record that counsel raised the issue and preserved it for appeal.we therefore proceed to the merits of price claim.
chiarolanza testified as follows 
q at that time,what did you decide to do 
a officer bonett was relaying information via our radios and he stated that he observed the defendant exit the white pontiac,go to the rear of the pontiac,and remove a handgun from his waistband area.
q and this was once the defendant was already parking lot 
a that correct.
q and what did he observe he removed the gun from his waistband area and did what with it,sir 
a and placed it in the 
defense counsel your honor,i objecting at this time as it clearly hearsay.
the court it what 
defense counsel it hearsay.
the court yes,all right.is there an exception you want to apply to this 
i trying to get to the actions this gentleman took as a result of the information he received.
the court all right,you may do so.
q as a result of the information you received 
a as a result of that information,i determined to terminate the investigation due to the officer and public safety.any time there a handgun involved,my attention is solely focused on the confiscation and recovery of the handgun.at that time,i instructed the other takedown officers to come in,so that we can effectively make the arrest of the defendant and make the recovery of the handgun.
at this point,the district court gave the following instruction 
members of the jury,the testimony about what officer bonett said to him is not admissible to prove the truth of what officer bonett saw i t is offered here solely to explain why this sergeant did what he did,so you use it only the purpose of explaining why this sergeant did what he did after hearing that information,not for the truth of what happened.
the government then continued 
q so you made the call at that point to do what,sir 
a to terminate the investigation and,again,go to parking lot number,which is where officer bonett stated the vehicle was parked and the defendant was,to,again,effectively make the arrest and confiscate the handgun.
q what did you do when you saw price movement,sir 
a as i observed this,i was relaying that to officer lacorte to be careful,again because of the fact that there was a handgun involved.
the relevant portion of officer lacorte testimony is as follows 
q how was it that you came into contact with the defendant,keenan price,that evening 
a on that evening we were doing a narcotics surveillance of the block of east ashmead street.through information i received from police officer bonett,he was our surveillance officer,to go in and stop the defendant,that the defendant took a handgun out of his waistband and placed it in the trunk of a white pontiac sunbird.
q whose call was it to effectuate the arrest 
a sergeant chiarolanza.once we see there a gun out there,police officer bonett said to come in and sergeant chiarolanza told the other backup team members to come in,because we stopped the narcotics surveillance at that time and we just go in to get the individual with the gun.
price argues that because bonett radio report was admitted for the specific purpose of establishing background context for the actions of chiarolanza and lacorte,its contents should not have been admissible.price does not dispute that the district court instruction clearly explained that chiarolanza and lacorte recitations of the contents of bonett report were not to be considered for their truth rather,he contends that under sallins,no details about the contents of the call should have been admitted even for the purpose of establishing background context for the police response.
sallins is our fullest articulation of the application of the rule against hearsay to statements by police officers about the content of radio reports from other officers,and we recognized there that the use of statements to show background has been identified as an area of widespread abuse.at.
in sallins,a gun possession case,an officer testified that he and his partner responded to a radio dispatch stating that a call had just reported that a black man in black clothes was on a particular block carrying a gun.the officer testified that he responded to the report by approaching the block,and there observed a black man in black clothes,sallins,walking along the sidewalk.upon seeing the police car,sallins appeared to throw something under a car and then ran away.one officer gave chase and arrested sallins,while the other looked under the cars near where sallins had been walking,and discovered a gun.no physical evidence connected sallins to the gun.t he only admissible evidence linking sallins to the possession of a gun was circumstantial evidence conveyed through the testimony of officers santiago and howard.sallins vigorously challenged the credibility of this testimony.sallins,at.
sallins went to trial and successfully excluded evidence of the radio call as inadmissible hearsay.that trial ended in a mistrial.on retrial,the government persuaded the district court to allow the responding officers to describe the contents of the radio dispatch about the call,as background explanation of their actions.the evidence described above was introduced,and sallins was convicted.
when the case reached us,we held that because the testimony about the contents of the radio report was admitted only for background to explain why the officers responded to the not as substantive evidence that sallins had possessed the gun,the incriminating details about the contents of the radio report should not have been admitted.our duty,we stated,is to carefully scrutinize the actual evidentiary function that ostensibly background evidence played at trial,to see whether it really served any legitimate function.if the legitimate probative value of particular testimony is nil or de minimis,and the substantive hearsay value is great,then it should be excluded.such scrutiny is necessary if the hearsay rule is to have any force in the context of police radio reports.id.at.
the evidentiary function of testimony about a police radio call is to provide a background explanation for the testifying officer is,to explain what the officer was doing at the scene.the jury need not,we explained in sallins,be led to believe that officers responding to a report of criminal activity just happened by.neither,however,may the other officers relate the contents of that report if the same contextual explanation could be adequately conveyed by the statement that the officer was responding to information received.
in criminal cases,an arresting or investigating officer should not be put in the false position of seeming just to have happened upon the scene he should be allowed some explanation of his presence and conduct.his testimony that he acted upon information received,or words to that effect,should be sufficient.
sallins,at.
the government distinguishes sallins by pointing out that the disputed radio report in sallins originated from an anonymous call,and no eyewitness testified as to sallins possession of the gun.by contrast,the report at issue in the instant case came from an eyewitness,bonett,who testified at trial.thus,unlike in sallins,the credibility of the eyewitness account was directly tested.
united states lopez,cir,is the only published case in which we have applied sallins,and it too involves an anonymous tip.in lopez,the defendant,a prisoner,was charged with heroin possession after heroin was found concealed in his cell.no physical evidence or eyewitness testimony connected lopez to the drugs,and his defense was that because the cells were open during the day,the drugs could have been hidden in his cell by any of the more than one hundred inmates on the cell block who had access
