lee henry pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute heroin and contempt of court.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment for the drug trafficking crime and an additional months imprisonment for contempt,to be served consecutively.he appeals his conviction for contempt and his sentence for drug trafficking,asserting that the district court erred by convicting and sentencing him in violation of the fifth amendment prohibition against double jeopardy,failing to conduct the sentencing enhancement colloquy mandated by b,and the court determining that two prior offenses were unrelated for guidelines purposes.we find no plain error in the district court treatment of henry first two claims and hold that the third claim is barred by the law of the case.
background 
on october,a federal grand jury charged henry in a indictment with distributing controlled substances in violation of a.following his arrest,a magistrate judge released henry on bail pending trial,subject to certain conditions,among them that he not commit any additional offenses while on pretrial release undeterred by the magistrate judge admonition,henry was arrested less than hours later,at which point police discovered ten bags of heroin on his person and forty more in his automobile,with an aggregate weight of grams.on march,henry was indicted by a grand jury for possession and possession with the intent to distribute heroin,in violation of a,and,in a separate indictment based on the same underlying conduct,contempt of court,in violation of.
on october,henry pleaded guilty to both indictments at a single hearing,and was duly sentenced for both crimes at a subsequent proceeding the sentence for drug trafficking was based,in part,on the district court determination that henry should be classified as a career offender under,predicated upon two prior connecticut state court convictions for drug trafficking.although the relevant calculations resulted in a suggested guidelines range of to months,the district court issued a downward departure after finding that the prior state convictions overrepresented henry criminal history and that henry suffered from diminished capacity,stemming from a traumatic experience that occurred during childhood.
following henry timely notices of appeal,his original appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to anders california,d,stating that henry appeals did not present any nonfrivolous issues for review,including the question of whether henry two prior connecticut state court convictions should be considered related offenses under the guidelines.on april,we issued an order providing for summary disposition of the matters addressed by the anders brief,but we requested further briefing concerning two issues raised by henry pro se specifically,his double jeopardy claim and b challenge.
ii.discussion 
double jeopardy 
henry argues that his october,dual convictions for contempt of court and drug trafficking are barred by the fifth amendment prohibition against double jeopardy because henry did not object on such grounds at trial,we review only for plain error.united states cotton,d united states,cir.to establish plain error,a defendant must show the existence of an error that is plain that affected his substantial rights and seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states roy,cir citing united states olano,d.essentially,we will only reverse if the trial court committed blockbuster errors.united states moran,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states griffin,cir.
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment commands that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend generally,this prohibition against double jeopardy shields a defendant from a second prosecution for the same offense after either conviction or acquittal,and it also prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.united states pacheco,cir citation omitted accord north carolina pearce,d.we assume arguendo the charges for contempt and drug trafficking against henry constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes,because proving the contempt violation required the government to prove the underlying offense of drug trafficking.see united states dixon,d scalia,joined by kennedy,see also blockburger united states.holding that the test to determine whether there are two offenses or only one,is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.
here,henry pleaded guilty to both the contempt and the drug trafficking charges at the same proceeding,rendering inapplicable the bar against successive prosecutions.thus,our analysis is restricted to whether the imposition of multiple punishments violated henry constitutional rights.not all multiple punishments run afoul of the double jeopardy clause.missouri hunter,d united states lemoure,cir.a defendant constitutional rights are not implicated where the legislature clearly intended to impose multiple punishments for the offense.united states,cir.thus,to determine whether multiple punishments are authorized,we must seek to determine the legislature intent.id.
henry was convicted of contempt of court pursuant to,which provides that 
a court of the united states shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment,or both,at its discretion,such contempt of its authority,and none other,as 
misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice 
misbehavior of any of its officers in their official transactions and 
disobedience or resistance to its lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command.
as a condition of pretrial release,the magistrate judge specifically forbade henry from violating any federal,state,or local law.by committing the underlying drug offense,henry clearly flouted the magistrate judge he acknowledged by pleading guilty.
as an initial matter,we observe that the nature of the contempt statute arguably presupposes the notion that congress intended multiple punishments in situations where the breach of a court order is likewise a violation of substantive criminal law enforcement of a contempt statute vindicates interests wholly separate from those related to punishing drug dealers see young united states ex rel.vuitton et fils,d explaining that contempt proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws but rather to vindicat e the authority of the court.thus,the gravamen of henry violation is not his act of drug trafficking,but rather his failure to obey the court command that he refrain from any illegal act while on pretrial release.see united states woodward,d permitting an inference of congressional intent to authorize multiple punishments where the relevant statutes guard against different evils.
henry arguments to the contrary are not sufficiently persuasive to establish plain error.first,we reject henry argument that dixon requires reversal.in relevant part,the majority holding of dixon stands for the narrow proposition that an individual may not be prosecuted for an underlying,substantive offense and criminal contempt in temporally separate proceedings.see at.the divided court left open the possibility that an individual could be punished for both contempt and an underlying offense in a single proceeding without implicating constitutional concerns see id.at.rehnquist,joined by and thomas,concurring in part and dissenting in part rejecting proposition that the double jeopardy clause bars even separate prosecutions for contempt and underlying offenses id.at.white,joined by stevens and souter,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part discussing possible constitutionality of multiple punishments for contempt and underlying offenses if imposed in a single proceeding id.at.blackmun,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part asserting that contempt proceedings should not be subject to traditional double jeopardy analysis id.at.souter,joined by stevens,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part
