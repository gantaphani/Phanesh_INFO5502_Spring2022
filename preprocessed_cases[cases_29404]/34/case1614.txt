collin mckenzie gude pled guilty under a conditional plea agreement to knowing possession of a firearm not registered to him,in violation of d.in doing so,he reserved his right to challenge the district court refusal to suppress evidence seized from his home pursuant to a warrant or to grant a hearing to determine the veracity of the affidavit that provided the basis for that warrant.mckenzie gude appeals those rulings and also challenges his sentence of months incarceration.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm the district court in all respects.
on july,ludmila yevsukov went to a police station in montgomery county,maryland to report that her nephew,patrick yevsukov,had told her that mckenzie gude brought an ak style assault rifle to the yevsukov residence on july.yevsukov further informed the police that the rifle belonged to mckenzie gude father,joseph gude.a police officer then contacted joseph gude,who confirmed he had purchased an ak rifle.four days later,on july,yevsukov provided additional information in a letter she addressed to the police department.in the letter,she asserted that mckenzie gude was years of age,lived at rockhurst road in bethesda,maryland the rockhurst road residence,and had just graduated from john college high school in washington.she further advised the police that her nephew,patrick,was an intern with the montgomery county police department.
in her letter,yevsukov asserted that mckenzie gude constantly discuss ed weapons and explosives with patrick and had brought dangerous chemicals to the yevsukov residence.yevsukov reported that she had found and removed from patrick bedroom these chemicals and safety data sheets describing the chemicals.she attached to her letter the data sheets and a confidential john college faculty list containing home addresses and phone numbers that she asserted mckenzie gude and patrick had improperly obtained.she also attached to the letter fifteen pages of blank montgomery county police department letterhead,which yevsukov believed patrick had obtained for mckenziegude to purchase restricted firearms,because she had found the letterhead with a photocopy of instructions for opening a gun safe.
on july,mckenzie gude drove patrick yevsukov to the local police station where montgomery county police officers interviewed both of them.the officers obtained a signed statement from patrick in which he stated that to his knowledge mckenzie gude never brought a gun to the yevsukov residence.after mckenzie gude requested an attorney,the officers released him without obtaining any statement from him.
later that day,montgomery county detective edward zacarek and montgomery county fire marshal jeffrey ewart completed an application for a warrant to search the rockhurst road residence.the application describes the officers experience,including that zacharek,a year veteran with the police department,had extensive experience investigating firearms related crimes and executing search warrants,and that ewart,a firefighter for nine years and fire marshal for six months,was currently assigned to the arson and explosive unit and had training and experience with identification of explosive and destructive devices.the application describes with particularity mckenzie gude suspected criminal activity and the items sought in the space provided for the place to be searched,the application identifies the rockhurst road residence and describes its appearance.
the affidavit provides the following details from the police investigation 
on,ludmila yevsukov responded to the gaithersburg city police station to report that her nephew patrick yevsukov and his friend colin mckenzie gude brought an ak style assault rifle to her apartment on.she also advised that patrick yevsukov is a intern sic with the montgomery county police.yevsukov is a current student at john college high school in washington,and mckenzie gude just graduated from johns college high school.
she also advised that colin mckenzie gude has been constantly discussing weapons and explosives with her nephew patrick yevsukov.colin mckenzie gude also brought chemicals to the house with computer material safety data sheets detailing the chemicals.the chemicals were acetone,nitric acid,hydrochloric acid,sulfuric acid,methyl ethyl ketone,and nitromethane.these chemicals are fuels and oxidizers that can be used to manufacture explosive devices.
the affidavit goes on to describe the faculty list,police letterhead,and gun safe instructions that yevsukov had attached to her letter.further,the affidavit explains that the ak style assault rifle is registered to a joe gude with the maryland state police,and that colin mckenzie gude is years of age,and is prohibited from owning or possessing any firearms due to his age.although the affiants averred that they believe d that evidence of the above mentioned crimes was contained in the aforementioned premises,the rockhurst road residence,they failed to state that mckenziegude or joseph gude lived at that address.
a state court judge issued a warrant to search the rockhurst road residence that same day,and at approximately noon,members of the montgomery county police department and the montgomery county fire marshal office executed the search.the officers seized various items from mckenzie gude bedroom,including several weapons,assorted gun parts,two vests,hundreds of rounds of ammunition,chemicals and other materials that could be used to make explosive devices,and instructions for making such devices.detective zacharek described the seized items on the search warrant inventory that he prepared and provided to mckenzie gude mother.
in a separate search of patrick yevsukov former residence,montgomery county police officers also recovered evidence of five pipe bomb detonations.among this debris,a latent fingerprint of mckenzie gude was recovered from the adhesive side of a piece of tape that was attached to some wires and a battery.
four months later,in november,a federal grand jury indicted mckenzie gude for knowing possession of a firearm,specifically,a destructive device,which was not registered to him,in violation of d.mckenziegude moved to suppress the evidence seized from the rockhurst road residence,claiming the search warrant affidavit was constitutionally defective because it failed to link him to the rockhurst road residence.mckenzie gude further contended that the officers had made material misrepresentations and omissions in the affidavit,entitling him to a hearing to determine its veracity.
at a motions hearing in july,the district court received as exhibits the police incident report describing the police investigation of mckenzie gude and yevsukov july,letter.upon consideration of this evidence,the court refused to suppress the seized evidence,finding that the officers executing the warrant,whom the district court characterized without objection from the defendant as the affiants,relied in good faith on the warrant because,apart from the affidavit,it clear where mckenzie gude lives.that is indicated in the report that made to the police officer.the court also denied mckenzie gude motion for a hearing,concluding that the affiants had not made material misrepresentations or omissions in the search warrant application.mckenzie gude then entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal these suppression rulings.
at mckenzie gude sentencing hearing,his friend,patrick yevsukov,testified that he and mckenzie gude detonated pipe bombs together on approximately five occasions and talked daily about explosive devices and firearms.patrick also testified about a plan that he and mckenzie gude had formulated,but never actually executed,to purchase firearms with obliterated serial numbers from a fellow high school student.during the planned purchase,they would carry mckenzie gude weapons for protection in case anything went wrong.
the district court also considered the testimony of an expert on explosive devices,fbi agent richard stryker,who had examined the evidence seized from mckenzie gude bedroom.agent stryker testified that mckenzie gude had possessed enough chemicals to construct at least ninety explosive devices and sixteen initiators,which are necessary to ignite the devices.he also opined that based on his training and experience,mckenzie gude most likely had possessed this amount and combination of chemicals in order to make explosive materials.
the district court then calculated mckenzie gude sentencing guidelines range.the court denied mckenzie gude request for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,finding that the record evidence belied his statement to the probation officer that he had never assembled or detonated any explosive devices.further,over mckenzie gude objections,the court applied two enhancements.with an offense level of,criminal history category i,the court calculated mckenzie gude sentencing range as months and imposed a sentence of months incarceration to be followed by three years of supervised release.mckenzie gude noted a timely appeal.
mckenzie gude initially contends that the district court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the rockhurst road residence.we review de novo the district court legal determinations we review the court underlying factual findings for clear error.united states allen,cir.
the government has conceded that the search warrant application and affidavit in this case failed to provide the requisite nexus between mckenzie gude and the target residence.the government asks,however,that we apply the leon good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.see united states leon,permitting a court to proceed immediately to a consideration of the officers good faith see also united states bynum,cir.
in leon,the supreme court held that a court should not suppress the fruits of a search conducted pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant unless a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate authorization.leon,at.given that mckenzie gude argues that the warrant was invalid solely because the affidavit failed to link him and his alleged criminal activity to the rockhurst road residence,leon requires that we assess whether the officers harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of this factual predicate.id.at.
leon states that officers can not be found to have acted with objective reasonableness and suppression remains the appropriate remedy when they rely on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.id.at internal quotations omitted.the government contends that the officers acted with objective reasonableness by relying on the affidavit and additional evidence known to them.the government maintains that this additional evidence the police report and yevsukov july letter stating mckenziegude lived at the rockhurst road property show ed beyond dispute that the officers had good quality information linking the criminal activity,the defendant,and the target residence.appellee br.at.mckenzie gude conceded at oral argument before us that had the officers included this additional evidence in their affidavit,the search would have been justified.he argues,however,that leon does not permit a court to look outside the four corners of the affidavit in assessing an officer objective good faith.appellant br.at.thus the question before us is whether,in determining an officer good faith,a court may properly look beyond the facts stated in the affidavit and consider uncontroverted facts known to the officers but inadvertently not disclosed to the magistrate.
leon instructs that the inquiry is confined to the objectively ascertainable question whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal in light of all of the circumstances.at emphasis added accord herring united states,d united states dequasie,cir.for this reason,we have consistently rejected the notion that reviewing courts may not look outside the four corners of a deficient affidavit when determining,in light of all the circumstances,whether an officer reliance on the issuing warrant was objectively reasonable.see,united states perez,cir united states legg,cir united states edwards,cir.
for example,in legg we held it proper to consider any contemporaneous oral statements to the magistrate in conjunction with the supporting affidavit in assessing the reasonableness of an officer reliance on a warrant.at.we expressly rejected the argument that leon categorically precludes application of the good faith exception when the affidavit examined in isolation lack s sufficient indicia of probable cause.id.at.in doing so,we pointed out that leon merely noted that an officer reliance on an affidavit that lacked indicia of probable cause could not be reasonable but never considered whether an officer reliance on some other information,in combination with the affidavit,could be reasonable.id.
thus,we believe that leon presents no barrier to holding that the experienced officers in this case,who swore out the affidavit and executed the search,acted with the requisite objective reasonableness when relying on uncontroverted facts known to them but inadvertently not presented to the magistrate.a number of our sister circuits agree.see united states marion,cir holding uncontested information known to the executing officers but not presented to the issuing judge was sufficient to demonstrate their reliance on the warrant was objectively reasonable united states dickerson,cir finding officers acted in good faith when they knew facts not presented to the magistrate that gave them probable cause to search united states taxacher,cir relying on facts known by the officer but not presented to magistrate in determining whether the officer acted in objective good faith under all the circumstances emphasis omitted 
refusing to consider such information risks the anomalous result of suppressing evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant supported by the affidavit of an officer,who,in fact,possesses probable cause,but inadvertently omits some information from his affidavit.bynum,at see also united states owens,cir holding exclusionary rule inapplicable when officers made an honest mistake in reporting the wrong address in the affidavit and were thus justified in using common sense and reliable information known to them outside the four corners of the warrant and affidavit.
moreover,contrary to the suggestion of mckenzie gude,we do not believe that a court abandons the objective inquiry required by leon when it considers the uncontroverted facts known to the officer,which he has inadvertently failed to disclose to the magistrate.of course,leon requires an assessment of an officer objective reasonableness that can not turn on the subjective good faith of individual officers.leon,at.but this limitation simply precludes courts from inquir ing into the subjective beliefs of law enforcement officers.id.at emphasis added.it does not require courts to disregard specific,uncontroverted facts known to the officers.see also herring,at noting in dicta that the circumstances relevant to the good faith inquiry frequently include a particular officer knowledge and experience,but that does not make the test any more subjective than the one for probable cause,which looks to an officer knowledge and experience.
although leon expressly eschewed fruitless inquiries into the minds of police officers to ascertain motive,leon,at,nowhere does leon find irrelevant actual uncontroverted facts known to as opposed to subjective beliefs held by an officer.such facts are certainly relevant in the qualified immunity context,which requires courts to ascertain whether a reasonable officer could have believed a search was lawful in light of clearly established law and the information the searching officers possessed.anderson creighton,d.indeed,in that context,the court has carefully differentiated between a examination of the information possessed by the searching officials and an inquiry into officials subjective intent.id this analogy has special force given that the supreme court has held that the same standard of objective reasonableness that courts appl y in the context o
