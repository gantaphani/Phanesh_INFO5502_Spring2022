the four defendants in this case filed separate appeals that were consolidated upon motion by the government.although the defendants raise numerous arguments on appeal,only two questions warrant discussion we address whether a waiver in a proffer agreement that allows the government to use a defendant proffer statements as part of its at trial is valid and enforceable.we also consider whether admission of that proffer statement violated the confrontation clause rights of other defendants who were implicated in that proffer statement.as discussed below,we find no reversible error and affirm all four convictions.
this case involves various criminal acts related to drug dealings in camden,new jersey.without delving into the details of each criminal act,it is enough to know that this case concerns a gang called the perez organization.from january to september,this gang was led by enrique ricky perez,a cooperating witness,and defendants bernard murray and allen tito allen resto.defendant lorenzo fu quan hardwick managed one of the drug corners or sets controlled by the perez organization,and defendant jose rodriguez was one of the primary baggers for the gang,responsible for processing the drugs into individual bags for street sale.various disputes erupted between members of the perez organization and competing drug dealers.three individuals were shot to death,and several others were badly injured.
on february,a federal grand jury in camden,new jersey,issued an eight count superseding indictment naming murray,resto,hardwick,and rodriguez as defendants the charges in the indictment included conspiracy to distribute and possess narcotics,and possession and brandishing of firearms while engaging in that conspiracy trial commenced on april,and on june,a jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.rodriguez received a sentence hardwick,murray,and resto received life sentences on the conspiracy count,and additional consecutive sentences for their c convictions.
the defendants appealed on numerous grounds the most salient of which was whether the admission into evidence of a redacted proffer statement,after the close of the government,violated defendants constitutional rights under the confrontation clause.because we find that the use of the proffer statement was harmless error,and we find no merit in the other issues brought on appeal,we affirm.the government concedes,however,that the sentences for hardwick,murray,and resto should be reduced to only one c conviction each accordingly,we remand for appropriate resentencing of these three defendants on their c counts.
during the investigation before trial,murray entered into a proffer agreement with the government.under this proffer agreement,murray agreed to cooperate with the investigators by answering questions truthfully and completely,and the government agreed not to use these statements against him at trial in its.the proffer agreement provided for an exception,however,if the government needed to rebut any evidence or arguments offered on murray behalf.murray app.murray was interviewed under this agreement on october,and october.during these interviews,he admitted to planning and participating in the slaying of two individuals,hiram chubby rosa and kenneth smoochie allen.
after the close of its,the government filed a motion in limine to introduce murray proffer statements.although murray did not testify at trial,the government argued that murray had breached the proffer agreement by attempting to elicit contradictory evidence,that murray had a lesser role in those killings through.
the district court granted the government motion,finding that the conducted by murray counsel contradicted the proffer statements and thus triggered the waiver.to allay any confrontation clause concerns,the district court ordered that all references to murray be redacted and replaced with neutral references such as others or another person.in addition,the district court instructed the jury that it could consider the proffer statements only to assess murray guilt,and not the guilt of any other defendant.
murray challenges the district court ruling on two grounds.first,he argues that he did not trigger the waiver because his only impeached the credibility of the government cooperating witnesses,without contradicting his proffer statements.second,he contends that,even if the waiver was triggered,the government waived its ability to introduce the proffer statements because it did not object contemporaneously to the or make a timely motion to admit rebuttal evidence.additionally,hardwick,resto,and rodriguez complain that the admission of murray proffer statements after the close of the government violated their rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.
the enforceability of the waiver 
as a threshold matter,we consider whether the waiver clause in murray proffer agreement was enforceable before determining whether it was properly invoked.ordinarily,the federal rules of evidence prohibit the use of statements made by a defendant during plea negotiations.specifically,federal rule of evidence provides 
except as otherwise provided in this rule,evidence of the following is not,in any civil or criminal proceeding,admissible against the defendant who made the plea or was a participant in the plea discussions any statement made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result in a plea of guilty later withdrawn.
see also.f providing that the admissibility of any plea,plea discussion,or related statement is governed by rule.
in united states mezzanatto,d,the supreme court held that a defendant could waive his rights under rule and rule as long as there is no affirmative indication that the agreement to waive was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily.but the mezzanatto court only considered the enforceability of proffer waivers for impeachment purposes,and five justices expressed doubt as to whether a waiver could be used to admit the defendant statement in the government.id.at.ginsburg,concurring warning that a waiver to use such statements in the case in chief would more severely undermine a defendant incentive to negotiate,and thereby inhibit plea bargaining id.at.souter,dissenting expressing concern that a defendant who gives such a waiver will be unable even to acknowledge his desire to negotiate a guilty plea without furnishing admissible evidence against himself then and there.
nevertheless,circuit courts that subsequently have considered the question have upheld the use of proffer waivers at trial.see united states velez,cir united states krilich,cir see also united states rebbe,cir upholding admission of proffer statements in rebuttal united states burch,extending the majority opinion in mezzanatto to allow the admission of plea statements in the.we are persuaded by the reasoning of these courts and find that the waiver agreement at issue in this case was enforceable.
triggering the waiver 
determining whether murray triggered the waiver requires an analysis of the terms of the waiver.a proffer agreement is a contract and its terms must be read to give effect to the parties intent.united states barrow,cir quoting united states liranzo,cir see also united states williams,cir stating that plea agreements are analyzed according to contract law principles united states,cir plea agreements,although arising in the criminal context,are analyzed under contract law standards.because the interpretation of a contract generally is a question of law,we review the district court interpretation of the terms of the waiver de novo.barrow,at see also united states bernard,cir we exercise plenary review over the question of whether the terms of a plea agreement have been violated.if the waiver applies to this case,we review the district court evidentiary rulings admitting murray proffer statements for abuse of discretion.barrow,at.
the terms of the waiver here were expansive,allowing the government to use murray proffer statements not only to him,but also to rebut any evidence or arguments offered on his behalf.emphasis added.barrow,at.compare krilich,at demonstrating more narrowly tailored waiver terms.moreover,upon reviewing the trial transcripts,it is clear that murray triggered the terms of the waiver by attempting to shift the blame for ordering the deaths of rosa and allen.
regarding rosa death,murray attempted to elicit testimony that another drug gang,led by mark lee,had motive to kill rosa.murray elicited testimony that one of rosa associates was attempting to sell drugs in lee territory,leading to a loss in profits.murray also attempted to insinuate that the van in which moore was arrested might have been the same van used in rosa killing.murray pursued these lines of questioning even though he had confessed in his proffer statements that he ordered rosa killing.
likewise,murray attempted to show that ricky perez gave the order and the gun to kill allen.in a cooperating witness,david lopez,who had admitted to shooting allen,murray repeatedly asked whether perez ordered allen death,even though lopez had testified that he acted on murray orders.murray also repeatedly questioned perez whether he ordered lopez to kill allen,and whether he gave lopez the gun used to shoot allen.murray also elicited testimony from perez that allen was disrupting perez drug sets and affecting his profits,in an attempt to pin the motive on perez.
the testimony elicited from these witnesses on was aimed at inferring that lee and perez,rather than murray,were responsible for the murders of rosa and allen,contrary to the statements murray made under the proffer agreement.see united states frazier,cir holding that,in certain circumstances,an attorney of a witness is tantamount to the assertion of an argument.
murray explanations for these lines of questioning are unavailing.according to murray,his questioning was intended only to impeach the credibility of the government cooperating witnesses and to challenge their recollections of certain events.nevertheless,the district court felt murray was also attempting to challenge any recollections regarding murray role in the killings,thus opening the door for the government to invoke the waiver to rebut these attempts accordingly,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting murray proffer statements.
timeliness of exercise of rights under the waiver 
the record reflects that the government waited seven days before objecting to one of the conducted by murray,and waited twelve days before objecting to two other.murray argues that the government failure to make contemporaneous objections constituted a waiver of its right to admit his proffer statements under federal rule of criminal procedure and federal rule of evidence a.we disagree.
murray argument conflates the right to object to the introduction of evidence with the right to enforce a contract.see liranzo,at agreements,such as cooperation agreements and proffer agreements,are interpreted according to principles of contract law.the government was not lodging an objection to murray line of rather,it was exercising its contractual right under the proffer agreement.the proffer agreement did not preclude murray from introducing evidence or making arguments contrary to the proffer agreement,nor did it provide the government with a right to object when murray did so.see velez,at a defendant remains free to present evidence inconsistent with his proffer statements,with the fair consequence that,if he does,the government is then permitted to present the defendant own words in rebuttal.citation omitted.instead,it provided the government with the right to use the proffer statements to rebut any arguments offered on murray behalf.thus,the government did not waive its right to introduce the proffer statements by not objecting contemporaneously to the.
confrontation clause 
hardwick,resto,and rodriguez argue that the admission of murray proffer statements violated their rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.although the district court ordered the statements to be redacted to replace any references to murray with neutral terms such as others or another person,they argue that they were prejudiced even by these neutral terms,which strongly implicated them in the killing of rosa in light of earlier evidence placing them in the van used in the shooting.
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,extended to the states by the fourteenth amendment,guarantees a criminal defendant right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.this right includes the ability to witnesses.see pointer texas,d.
in bruton united states,d,the supreme court held that the introduction of a defendant statement,which directly implicated his by name,violated the confrontation clause right of the.even though the jury was given clear instructions not to consider the confession in determining that guilt,the supreme court held that it could not accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for the constitutional right of.id.at.the supreme court reasoned that there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not,or can not,follow instructions is so great that the practical and human limitations of the jury system can not be ignored.id.at.
subsequently,the supreme court held in richardson marsh that this problem could be cured by redacting the confession to eliminate not only the name,but any reference to his or her existence,d.critically,the confession in richardson differed from the one in bruton because it had been redacted so completely that it was no longer incriminating on its face,and became so only when linked with other evidence introduced at trial.id.at.the supreme court declined to extend bruton in that case because the risk of potential prejudice to the no longer outweighed the pragmatic necessity of joint trials.n o opinion was expressed on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant name has been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun.id.at.
but the supreme court revisited that question in gray maryland,d,holding that redactions that substituted the name with placeholders such as blank spaces or the word deleted did not pass muster.such placeholders were problematic because they refer red directly to the existence of the nonconfessing defendant.id.at.in the supreme court view,the redacted statements in gray so closely resemble d bruton unredacted statements that the law required the same result.id.
since gray,we have considered the constitutionality of redacted confessions in two cases united states richards,cir,and priester vaughn,cir.in richards,the defendant confession stated that he had planned the robbery at issue with a friend.other testimony showed that the two were friends.we held that this reference to the friend was just as blatant and incriminating as the word deleted in the gray case.at 
in priester,however,we found that substitutions such as the other guy,someone,someone else,the guy,and another guy did not violate the confrontation clause where there were at least fifteen perpetrators in various cars involved in the shooting.at.unlike richards,where the word friend unequivocally pointed to richards,the only other,priester involved so many perpetrators that the phrases the other guy or another guy were bereft of any innuendo that tie d them unavoidably to priester.id.at.
what these decisions underscore is that the nature of the linkage between the redacted statement and the other evidence in the record is vitally important in determining whether a defendant confrontation clause right has been violated.even redacted statements will present confrontation clause problems unless the redactions are so thorough that the statement must be linked to other evidence before it can incriminate the.see richardson,at.see also gray,at.finding issue with redactions that leave inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.
assessing the kind of inference present here,and not the simple fact of inference,leads us to conclude that the admission of murray proffer statements violated the confrontation clause rights of murray.gray,at.noting that redactions that leave inferences do not satisfy the concerns of bruton and richardson,which must depend in significant part upon the kind of,not the simple fact of,inference.although this trial involved multiple,only including charged with killing rosa.redacted references to others in the van referred directly to their existence,and the unavoidable inference was that they were the ones who exited the vehicle and started firing their weapons at rosa.murray app.the redacted version of the text explicitly excluded perez and murray,the only other passengers,from the others who left the van.because murray exercised his right not to testify at trial,hardwick and resto were unable to confront him and challenge his testimony.this violated the confrontation clause 
although we conclude that the district court erred in admitting the proffer statements,we will affirm if we find the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.richards,at.an error is harmless if it does not affect substantial rights of the defendant.united states jimenez,cir quoting.a.this occurs when the record shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.united states fallon,cir quoting chapman california,d.as we have stated,an otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say,on the whole record,that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting delaware van arsdall,d.
the evidence in this case was more than sufficient to support the jury verdict,even without the offending proffer statements.at trial,several witnesses testified to the participation of hardwick and resto in the murders of rosa and allen.ricky perez detailed the roles played by himself,resto,murray,and hardwick in the killings of rosa and allen.another witness named arnaldo gomez described the escalating dispute between rosa and hardwick.david lopez,who admitted that he personally shot allen,testified that he,perez,murray,and resto planned the killing.the prosecution also offered testimony of a new jersey police ballistics expert that shell casings from the rosa murder scene matched those found at the murder scene of the third victim,troy james,coupled with testimony from ricky perez that murray admitted killing james with the same that resto used to kill rosa.
the overwhelming evidence convinces us that the district court error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see monachelli warden,sci graterford,cir a bruton violation will not result in a reversal where the independent,properly admitted evidence of the defendant guilt is so overwhelming,and the prejudicial effect of the admission so insignificant by comparison,that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the improper use of the admission was harmless error.quoting schneble florida,d.accordingly,we will affirm 
the defendants raise a host of additional arguments on appeal,see note,supra,none of which has merit.the government,though,has agreed that the multiple consecutive sentences imposed on hardwick,murray,and resto under c should be remanded with instructions to vacate all but one c conviction each,in compliance with a justice department policy memorandum requiring a separate predicate offense for each c charge 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the jury verdict as to all four defendants,and remand only for resentencing of murray,resto,and hardwick consistent with the justice department policy memorandum.
