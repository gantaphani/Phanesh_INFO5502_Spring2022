defendant clyde tse was convicted of distributing cocaine in violation of a.in evaluating one of his claims on appeal relating to a limitation on the of the government principal witness,we must address the important differences in analysis between admitting a prior conviction to impeach a defendant testimony and admitting such a conviction to impeach the testimony of a government witness.we must also address tse challenges to the admission of evidence of a subsequent drug transaction,the adequacy of the district court limiting instructions about that transaction,two additional limitations on his ability to impeach the testimony of the principal government witness,and the admission of allegedly prejudicial testimony by that witness.after full consideration of these issues,we affirm.
on november,agents of the drug enforcement agency dea attempted to record a drug transaction between tse and a cooperating witness,stephen williams.the dea agents outfitted williams with an audio transmitter called a kel.the device allowed the agents to listen to and record williams conversations,but did not allow them to communicate with williams.after searching williams and his car to ensure that he did not have any drugs or cash,the agents gave him and instructed him to purchase crack cocaine from tse.
at approximately,williams drove to tse residence in mattapan,massachusetts.the dea recorded the ensuing conversation in which williams told tse that he had only and that he wanted to buy a half ounce of crack cocaine for that amount.tse told williams to return in ten minutes.williams left tse residence and again met with the dea agents.they instructed him to return to tse house to make the drug purchase.at approximately williams returned to tse house where tse was on the phone,apparently receiving directions to a nearby location.after the phone call,tse told williams we on,and said that they needed to travel just around the corner.tse and williams left the house and entered williams car.
as williams and tse drove off,the dea agents lost the signal from williams kel transmitter.despite their attempts to follow williams,the agents were not able to record any other conversations between williams and tse that evening.however,shortly after williams and tse drove off,a member of the dea surveillance team saw williams car parked on a nearby street,only a few blocks from tse residence.at least one person was sitting in the car.
at trial,williams testified that he and tse drove to a house only a few minutes away.williams remained in the car while tse spoke with a man in the doorway and entered the building.according to williams,tse returned several minutes later and gave a bag of crack cocaine to williams.williams and tse then drove back to tse house,where tse gave williams a scrap of paper with tse pager number written on it.
after williams dropped tse off at his residence,he met with the dea agents and handed over the drugs and the scrap of paper on which tse had written his pager number.dea laboratory tests confirmed that the drugs that tse had allegedly supplied to williams included grams of crack cocaine.
on february,williams again participated in a dea operation targeting tse.he used the pager number that tse had given him after the previous transaction to contact tse.in a recorded call,williams and tse spoke in a mutually understood code about a drug transaction.tse agreed to sell grams of cocaine to williams for.williams was again outfitted with a kel transmitter,and dea agents followed williams to the meeting place with tse.when tse arrived,he provided williams with powder cocaine.this time,the dea agents were able to record the entire transaction.
on september,a grand jury charged tse with two counts of distributing a controlled substance in violation of a.count one alleged that tse had distributed crack cocaine during the november transaction count two alleged that tse had distributed powder cocaine during the february transaction.on december,tse pled guilty to count two and proceeded to a jury trial on count one.
because the dea agents had been unable to record the november transaction,the government relied heavily on williams testimony to describe the events of that evening.williams was not an ideal witness,and tse primary strategy was to discredit williams testimony.through both direct and,the jury heard,inter alia,that williams had used and sold drugs in the past,had been convicted of at least one crime,had made inaccurate statements to the grand jury about his prior involvement with drugs had received substantial compensation for his work as a dea informant,and had purchased a new car shortly after receiving payments from the dea.
the trial lasted four days,ending on december.despite tse aggressive impeachment of williams testimony,the jury found tse guilty of distributing a controlled substance during the november transaction.on april,the district court sentenced tse to months in prison on each count as noted,he had pled guilty to count two of the indictment to be served concurrently.
on appeal,tse claims that the district court made a number of errors.first,tse argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of the february transaction.second,tse argues that the court gave inadequate limiting instructions to the jury about the proper use of evidence of the february transaction.third,he argues that the district court erred in limiting his of williams by preventing him from impeaching williams credibility by introducing evidence that williams had been convicted of assault and battery against a police officer,introducing evidence that charges against williams stemming from a traffic stop were dismissed after williams began cooperating with the dea,and refreshing williams memory with an employment application he had filled out several years earlier.finally,tse argues that the district court impermissibly allowed the government to solicit prejudicial evidence from williams during redirect examination.we address each of tse arguments in turn,relating the relevant details of the trial where appropriate.
at trial,the government sought to introduce evidence of the february transaction,arguing that such evidence had special relevance under federal rule of evidence b the government offered several theories of admissibility.first,it argued that the february transaction demonstrated tse intent in meeting with williams on november.because tse had argued in his opening statement that his november meeting with williams did not involve a drug transaction,the government reasoned that evidence of tse intent was at issue in the case second,the government argued that the february evidence was admissible to boost williams credibility since the february transaction was similar to williams description of the november transaction.third,the government argued that tape of the february transaction showed that tse had sold drugs to williams on previous occasions because,when williams called to arrange the february deal,both he and tse began speaking about the transaction in a mutually understood code without an initial discussion of whether tse could procure drugs.finally,the government argued that the february transaction demonstrated a criminal association between tse and williams,creating an inference that,if their purpose for meeting on february was to carry out a drug transaction,their purpose for meeting on november was likely to carry out a similar transaction.
tse objected that evidence of the february transaction had no special relevance because he had admitted that he and williams were together on november during the time of the alleged drug transaction.he argued that there was therefore no need to admit evidence to demonstrate the relationship between williams and tse.rather,evidence of the february transaction could only be used by the jury to draw a forbidden propensity inference if tse had sold drugs to williams on february,he likely sold drugs to williams on november.
after hearing arguments on this issue,the district court admitted the evidence,ruling that the evidence had special relevance within the scope of rule b because it demonstrated that tse and williams had a criminal association in february the court did not specify the probative value of this criminal association,stating only that the criminal association was one that the government may have evidence of.the court also ruled that the probative value of the february transaction was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.thus,the court ruled that evidence of the february transaction was not barred by rule the defense objected to these rulings.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court determination that prior bad act evidence was admissible pursuant to rules b and.see united states varoudakis,cir.a district court may admit evidence of a defendant other bad acts only if that evidence meets the requirements of both rule b and rule.to be admissible under rule b,the evidence must have special relevance to an issue in the case such as intent or knowledge,and must not include bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.varoudakis,at quoting united states frankhauser,cir see also united states jesus,cir permitting the introduction of bad act evidence if the evidence is relevant for purposes other than proof of a defendant bad character or criminal propensity.second,pursuant to rule,the probative value of the bad act evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.see also varoudakis,at.a trial court may admit evidence of other bad acts indicating a criminal association even when the evidence describes an event that occurred later than the charged crime.united states procopio,cir a later criminal association increases the likelihood of an earlier is all that relevance requires and numerous cases permit such reasoning from a later event or condition to an earlier one.citations omitted.
in a conspiracy case,the district court may admit evidence of other bad acts if they tend to suggest a criminal association between the alleged conspirators.see procopio,at.evidence of a criminal association among the alleged conspirators can be probative in several respects.it can demonstrate the background of a relationship,a collaboration among several parties,or a mutual trust between conspirators.see varoudakis,at admitting evidence of a prior bad act to demonstrate mutual trust between alleged conspirators jesus,at e vidence of other bad acts can be admitted to explain the background,formation and development of the illegal relationship and,more specifically,to help the jury understand the basis for the relationship of mutual trust citations omitted procopio,at stating that evidence of a subsequent criminal association was helpful to the government claim that the two men had collaborated in a prior robbery.it can also rebut a defendant claim that his association with the alleged conspirators was innocent.see united states rodriguez,cir in particular,the government evidence must overcome the possibility that a particular defendant association with criminal was wholly innocent or that,if he was with them at the scene of criminal activity,he was merely present,without guilty knowledge or intent.
tse argues that,because he was not charged with conspiracy,his collaboration with other parties is not at issue.we disagree.tse he was with williams on november but that he did not participate in a drug transaction on that tse relationship with williams directly in issue and material to the case and thus permits the court to admit evidence of a subsequent criminal association.jesus,at.see also rodriguez,at holding admissible evidence of another of defendant drug ventures with the same participants to rebut defendant claim that,on the occasion of the charged crime,he was an innocent bystander united states lopez,cir following decisions upholding the admission of evidence of prior drug involvement for the purpose of rebutting defense claims of innocent association united states,cir admitting other act evidence to rebut defendant defense that he was merely present in an apartment that contained evidence of a drug conspiracy.
in this case,the court properly admitted evidence of the february transaction to refute tse claim that his meeting with williams in november was innocent.evidence of the february transaction between williams and tse,including their use of coded language,indicated that they had collaborated on similar transactions in the past and that they both understood the nature of their meeting.although the government did not have to demonstrate an agreement,as it would have in a conspiracy case,this evidence was still critical to demonstrate the nature of tse association with williams,which helped to refute tse claim that their november meeting was innocent.
evidence of other bad acts always carries with it a danger of a forbidden propensity inference.but rule b requires only that there be some other permissible reason,subject to the requirements of rule,to admit the evidence.here,evidence of the february transaction refuted tse claim that his association with williams was innocent.thus,the district court properly admitted the evidence under rule b 
after ruling on the admissibility of the february evidence,the district court gave the following limiting instruction to the jury 
the defendant is charged in this indictment with an offense said to have occurred on november.the government is offering evidence of another transaction in february of that the defendant is not charged with in this case.the evidence is offered as it may bear on your assessment of whether the government case regarding the november incident is sufficient or not,including whether the government has established that the defendant knowingly and intentionally participated in a drug transaction on november,as alleged in the indictment.the evidence of the other incident may or may not,in your judgment,support a conclusion that he was a participant in such a transaction in november.the february incident,if it occurred,if you find that it occurred,which is the first question,and if you do,you may consider it for that purpose if it bears on the defendant knowing and intentional participation in a similar transaction in november.you may not consider it as evidence if it were that of the defendant character or general propensity to be involved in criminal activity.this is not evidence about the defendant or his instincts or propensity.it is evidence that may or may not,as you judge appropriate,be used in considering what inferences you might make about the evidence concerning the november transaction.
following this instruction,the government solicited testimony from one of the dea agents who monitored the february transaction,and played an audio tape of that transaction.
tse objected that the court limiting instruction did not state that the jury can only use evidence of the february transaction for the very specific purpose that the government has suggested here,which is that there is some kind of relationship between williams and tse.the court responded that i do want to be arguing the government case,so i do want to suggest there a connection.the court then noted tse objection.
on appeal,tse challenges the adequacy of the district court limiting instructions to the jury.upon request by the defendant,a district court must instruct the jury on the permissible use of other bad act evidence admitted against the defendant.huddleston united states,d t he trial court shall,upon request,instruct the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted.the first circuit pattern jury instructions explicitly state that the bad act evidence can not be used to infer guilt based on the defendant character and that the other act evidence may be used only for specific enumerated purposes see pattern crim.jury instr.cir.however,b y their terms,those instructions are precatory,not mandatory.a district court possesses wide discretion to instruct in language that it deems most likely to ensure effective communication with jurors.united states gomez,cir.see also pattern crim.jury instr,preface although we believe that the pattern instructions will be helpful in crafting a jury charge in a particular case,it bears emphasis that no district judge is required to use the pattern instructions,and that the court of appeals has not in any way approved the use of a particular instruction.united states palmer,cir the district court has considerable leeway as to the phrasing and timing of a curative instruction.because tse objected below to the formulation of the instruction,our review is for abuse of discretion to determine whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.united states ranney,cir citations omitted see also united states picciandra,cir we review the propriety of instructions to a jury under the abuse of discretion standard.
the court instruction adequately limited the jury consideration of the february evidence.first,the court specifically instructed that y ou may not consider it as evidence if it were that of the defendant character or general propensity to be involved in criminal activity.this is not evidence about the defendant or his instincts or propensity.second,the court identified the proper use for evidence of the february transaction the evidence of the other incident may or may not,in your judgment,support a conclusion that tse was a participant in such a transaction in november y ou may consider the february evidence for that purpose if it bears on the defendant knowing and intentional participation in a similar transaction in november.thus,the court instructed the jury that it could not use evidence of the february transaction to make a propensity inference and that it should use the evidence only to determine tse knowledge and intent at the time of the alleged november transaction we find no abuse of discretion in the court instruction.
at the end of the trial,prior to jury deliberations,the court again offered a limiting instruction regarding evidence of the february transaction 
you may not consider evidence of the february transaction as indicating that the defendant is of bad character and therefore someone who had an inclination or propensity to commit the crime that charged.a person may not be convicted of having a bad character or inclination.he may only be convicted if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the offense as alleged in the indictment.
although tse objected to some portions of the instructions given prior to jury deliberation,he did not object to the portion of those instructions concerning evidence of the february transaction.he raises an objection to this instruction for the first time on appeal.
when an objection to a jury instruction is forfeited,we apply the plain error standard.connelly hyundai motor,cir.relief under the plain error standard requires an error,that is plain,that is likely to alter the outcome,and that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
the court instruction on other bad act evidence at the end of the trial only told the jury that it must not use evidence of the february transaction to draw a propensity inference.unlike the earlier instruction just before the evidence was admitted,this instruction did not tell the jury the limited purpose for which it should use that evidence.while it would have been preferable for the trial judge to use the more complete instruction again,the plain error standard can not be met.the jury had previously been given a full instruction on the proper use of the february evidence.we can not conclude that the failure to specify proper use of the february evidence during the second instruction altered the outcome of this trial in any way.
confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo in order to verify that the trial court afforded the defendant a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.when that constitutional threshold is crossed,we examine the trial court restrictions on the manner and extent of for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
tse argues that the district court impermissibly limited his of williams on three occasions.first,the court did not allow tse to impeach williams with williams previous conviction for assault and battery against a police officer.second,the court did not permit tse to offer evidence of charges against williams,later dismissed,stemming from a traffic stop on september.tse sought to use these charges to demonstrate that williams had a motive to cooperate with the government.finally,the court did not allow tse to attack williams credibility by demonstrating that williams had made false statements on an employment application.we address each argument in turn.
conviction for assault and battery against a police officer 
tse attempted to impeach williams credibility by introducing evidence of williams prior conviction for assault and battery against a police officer abpo.at first,the district court agreed that the evidence was admissible pursuant to federal rule of evidence a however,at a sidebar conference,the court addressed a related matter tse motion to exclude tse own convictions,one of which was for abpo,if tse should choose to testify.the court viewed the admissibility of williams conviction as closely related to the admissibility of tse conviction,stating that a lthough it not an identical analysis,it close enough that it may be that if it allowed in this case,it would be allowed in the other as well.the court later reiterated 
and if a particular offense is admitted as impeachment for the witness under rule a,then that may result in a similar ruling with respect to the defendant,although i note there is a distinction in a between an accused and someone who is not an accused.but since they do i know the language makes a distinction.i not sure to the rule aspect of it.
after hearing counsel arguments about whether any of tse convictions should be admitted if he were to testify,the court again compared williams abpo conviction to tse abpo conviction,stating that if it probative enough in one case,it has to be probative enough in the other,it seems to me there is a difference in standards of admissibility,but i not sure it a pertinent difference with respect to this.the court added i do know that there,in fact,a different standard,except that maybe it a caution to make sure that it has probative value finally,the court determined that it would keep them both out,ruling that neither williams abpo conviction nor tse abpo conviction was admissible.tse objected and now argues on appeal that the court improperly excluded williams abpo conviction 
rule provides different standards for admitting prior convictions to impeach the accused and to impeach witnesses other than the accused.when the witness is the accused,evidence of a prior conviction shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.when the witness is other than the accused,such evidence shall be admitted,subject to rule.id.rule in turn states that evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
this dual approach is the result of a amendment to rule.prior to that amendment,the rule did not explicitly distinguish between the accused and witnesses other than the accused.rather,a district court could admit prior convictions against any witness if it determined that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweigh ed its prejudicial effect to the defendant.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,joseph mclaughlin,matthew bender ed stating the language of rule prior to the amendment.the language of the rule,explicitly protecting only against prejudice to the defendant in a criminal case,seemingly provided no protection to litigants in civil cases or to prosecution witnesses in criminal cases.see green bock laundry mach,d holding that the version of rule required courts to admit prior convictions against civil litigants regardless of prejudice,and noting that impeaching evidence detrimental to the prosecution in a criminal case shall be admitted without any such balancing of probative value against prejudice.
the amendment did not disturb the special balancing test for the criminal defendant who chooses to testify.advisory committee notes on amendment.rather,the amendment made prior convictions of witnesses other than the accused explicitly subject to the rule analysis.see id.t he ordinary balancing test of rule is appropriate for assessing the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment of any witness other than a criminal defendant.
this change may not have been aimed explicitly at providing protection for witnesses other than the accused in a criminal trial.see richard uviller,essay credence,character,and the rules of evidence seeing through the liar tale,duke,a solid argument might be made that the entire purpose to the amendment to rule a was to clarify its application to civil cases.nevertheless,whether intended or not,the amendment of rule a has had a dramatic impact on the impeachment of prosecution witnesses in criminal cases.id.at.p rosecution witnesses should be shielded from impeachment by prior conviction if revealing the prior conviction would result in prejudice to the prosecution.id.at emphasis in original.indeed,the advisory committee notes indicate that the drafters were aware of the amendment impact on government witnesses 
some courts have read rule a as giving the government no protection for its witnesses.this approach is rejected by the amendment.there are cases in which impeachment of government witnesses with prior convictions that have little,if anything,to do with credibility may result in unfair prejudice to the government interest in a fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to a witness.
advisory committee notes on amendment citations omitted.thus,there is no doubt that we must apply a rule analysis to prior convictions of government witnesses in a criminal prosecution 
although rule sets out two different evidentiary standards for admitting prior convictions for impeachment,it does not make clear whether the court application of each standard requires a substantively different analysis.some commentators have suggested that rule provides greater protection to the accused than it does to other witnesses in the use of prior convictions for impeachment.see weinstein,supra,if the witness to be impeached is the accused in a criminal case,the rule establishes a more stringent discretionary standard for admissibility.others are skeptical that the difference between the two balancing tests is sufficiently different to draw a practical distinction in the evidentiary showing required for admission of a prior conviction.see uviller,supra,at suggesting that the practical possibility of such fine calibration of the danger of prejudice is dubious.although the nature of the distinction is elusive,uviller,supra,at,the drafting of the rule suggests that the distinction is intentional.if the drafters had wanted to apply the same evidentiary test to all prior convictions,they could easily have stated a universal rule instead of differentiating between the accused and all other witnesses.we therefore examine closely the two standards to determine the precise nature of their differences.
to describe accurately the distinctions in rule a,however,we must first unravel a linguistic oddity in its language.with respect to a witness other than the accused,the rule provides that a conviction shall be admitted,subject to rule.the instruction that convictions shall be admitted indicates that rule is a rule of inclusion any conviction meeting rule requirements will be admitted.however,the reference to rule complicates the analysis.that rule,applicable when a party objects to otherwise relevant evidence,provides that evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.thus,by its language,rule is a rule of exclusion.these conflicting formulations of inclusion in rule and exclusion in rule raise some uncertainty about whether the impeaching party here tse,who sought to impeach williams with his prior conviction bears the burden of demonstrating the superior probative value of the prior convictions to justify admission of the evidence,or whether the impeached party here the government,which sought to avoid the impeachment of williams with his prior conviction bears the burden of demonstrating the danger of unfair prejudice to justify exclusion of the evidence.see uviller,supra,at noting this distinction.
the advisory committee notes offer some clarification regarding the use of a prior conviction to impeach government witnesses the notes state that the rule balancing test protects the government in criminal cases and that o nly when the government is able to point to a real danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes will the conviction be excluded.advisory committee notes on amendment.therefore,although the proponent of the admission of the evidence of a prior conviction is the accused who seeks to impeach the government witness,the government bears the burden of protecting its witnesses from such impeachment by demonstrating to the court,pursuant to rule exclusionary rule,that the probative value of the conviction at issue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,or the other grounds for exclusion noted in rule 
this standard of prejudice differs from the standard of prejudice applicable to the court consideration of requests by the government to impeach a defendant with prior convictions.the court may exclude a prior conviction of the accused,offered for the purpose of impeachment,if the prejudicial effect of the conviction merely outweighs its probative value the court may exclude a conviction of a government witness,offered by the accused for the purpose of impeachment,only if the danger of unfair prejudice from the conviction substantially outweighs its probative value.
in addition,rule protects government witnesses only against the danger of unfair prejudice,while rule protects the accused against any prejudicial effect.see united states smith,cir noting that rule protects only against unfair prejudice rather than all prejudice united states,cir a ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial it is only unfair prejudice which must be avoided.usually,courts use the term unfair prejudice for evidence that invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.varoudakis,at see also united states currier,cir noting that unfair prejudice is prejudice that causes a jury to base its decision on something other than the established proposition in the case quoting weinstein evidence.thus,while a court must weigh all potential prejudicial effect to the defendant when deciding whether to admit a prior conviction of the accused,it must weigh only the kind of prejudice that can be deemed unfair when deciding whether to admit the prior conviction of a government witness.
these distinctions substantially outweighs versus outweighs,and unfair prejudice versus prejudicial effect support the assertion of the weinstein treatise that the standard for the admission of prior convictions of the accused is stricter than the standard for the admission of prior convictions of a government witness.these distinctions also recognize that the potential prejudice to the defendant from the admission of prior convictions is simply not the same as the potential prejudice to a government witness.in particular,there is a heightened risk that a jury will use evidence of a prior conviction of the accused to draw an impermissible propensity inference 
i n virtually every case in which prior convictions are used to impeach the testifying defendant,the defendant faces a unique risk of,the danger that convictions that would be excluded under.will be misused by a jury as propensity evidence despite their introduction solely for impeachment purposes.
advisory committee notes on amendment.see also uviller,supra,at t he outstanding difference between harm to a defendant and harm to other witnesses is undeniable a jury might conclude from the testifying defendant criminal career despite vociferous instructions from the court to the contrary that he committed the crime charged because of a demonstrated propensity to engage in criminal conduct.that kind and degree of damage can not be suffered by the prosecution or its witnesses.moreover,revelations of past convictions may inflame the jury.see,united states beahm,cir excluding evidence of a prior conviction in part because it was likely to inflame the jury and thus prejudice the defendant.
in contrast,the prior convictions of a government witness are unlikely to inflame the jury or invite a propensity inference 
the probability that prior convictions of an ordinary government witness will be unduly prejudicial is low in most criminal cases.since the behavior of the witness is not the issue in dispute in most cases,there is little chance that the trier of fact will misuse the convictions offered as impeachment evidence as propensity evidence.
advisory committee notes on amendment.rather,the prior convictions of government witnesses are more likely to cause unfair prejudice to the government interest in a fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to the witness.id.while these are important concerns,see united states,cir affirming district court decision to exclude prior crime of government witness involving dishonesty where defense was able to impeach the witness with evidence of more recent dishonest acts,trial courts will be skeptical when the government objects to impeachment of its witnesses with prior convictions.advisory committee notes on amendment.
we summarize.with respect to the use of prior convictions for impeachment,rule distinguishes between the accused and mere witnesses.a court may admit a conviction of the accused only if the probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.by contrast,a court shall admit a conviction of a government witness unless that conviction should be excluded under rule.the burden under rule is on the party opposing admission,who must show that the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.in this case,in considering the admission of a prior conviction of tse and a prior conviction of williams,the government principal witness,the district court appeared to apply a uniform standard of exclusion.if so,the failure to apply the different standards for exclusion was an error of law 
however,any such error was harmless.a evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.united states rose,cir.the government bears the burden of persuasion to show that the error is harmless.id.in conducting a harmless error analysis,the court must mull the ruling in context,giving due weight to the totality of the circumstances and avoid unnecessarily interven ing in a process protected defendant rights.united states wilkerson,cir citations omitted.
the excluded evidence of williams prior conviction was unmistakably cumulative.see also rose,at.the jury heard evidence that williams had been convicted of at least one crime that he had made false statements to the grand jury and on a job application that he had been paid a significant sum for his work as a dea informant and had bought a new car soon after the november transaction that he had not reported his earnings from the dea on his tax return,despite having been told to do so and finally,that he had dealt and used illicit drugs in the past.the jury had ample reason to closely scrutinize williams credibility in this case.it is highly probable that any error in excluding williams abpo conviction had no impact on the verdict.
traffic stop 
as a general matter,a defendant has the right to a prosecution witness about matters that might cause the witness to be biased against the defendant.see,united states barrett,cir a defendant has a right to an accomplice as to the nature of any agreement he had with the government or any expectation or hope that he may have that he will be treated leniently in exchange for his cooperation.however,a defendant must lay a proper foundation before evidence of bias is admitted.bui dipaolo,cir a defendant must present a satisfactory foundation for the critical elements on which his hypothesis of bias depends.
moreover,once the defendant sixth amendment right to establish bias has been satisfied,the district court has the discretion to limit the scope of the bias inquiry.see bui,at t o the extent that the petitioner is suggesting that a criminal defendant has license to a prosecution witness concerning every conceivable theory of bias,he is plainly wrong.barrett,at t he court has the discretion to limit once the defendant sixth amendment right to establish the potential bias of the has been satisfied.the district court discretion allows it to exclude evidence of previously dismissed criminal charges against the witness.united states,cir finding no abuse of discretion where the district court prohibited the defendant from a prosecution witness about a dismissed charge of weapons possession.
tse laid no foundation for his line of questioning about the traffic stop.the record does not indicate that charges against williams were dropped in return for williams cooperation with the dea,and tse never attempted to offer evidence to this effect.indeed,if such an agreement did exist,the government would have been obligated to disclose it along with its disclosures about williams compensation for his role in the dea stings.see giglio united states,d holding that failure to disclose impeachment material against a government witness is a violation of due process.tse questioning relied solely on a theory of quid pro quo entirely unsupported by evidence.
moreover,tse right to question williams about his potential bias in favor of the government was satisfied by other lines of questioning.tse established that williams began working at the boston housing same organization that employed one of the dea task force members in the tse sting he had testified as a cooperating witness in a previous trial.he established that williams had been intermittently unemployed prior to working for the dea,and that the dea had,on certain occasions,helped him pay routine bills and expenses.he further established that williams had purchased a new car in the fall of,and that he had signed a loan application listing the dea as his employer and a monthly income of.williams direct examination testimony established that the dea had paid him for his work as an informant.in light of this other evidence of bias,the district court acted well within its discretion in excluding evidence of the traffic stop.
employment application 
tse attempted to attack williams character for truthfulness by asking williams about allegedly false statements that williams had made on an employment application in.although the court initially ruled that tse could not question williams about the application,it agreed to revisit the issue on the next day of trial.when tse renewed his request the following day,he said he would use the employment application to refresh williams memory if williams could not recall the statements he had made on the application.the government argued that tse could question williams about the application but could not use the application to refresh williams memory because doing so would be tantamount to using extrinsic evidence to impeach,which is expressly prohibited by federal rule of evidence b the court agreed with the government,noting that the alleged misrepresentations at issue in this case were collateral because they did not relate directly to any matter at issue in the case.the court allowed tse to question williams about the employment application but prohibited tse from using the application itself to refresh williams memory.tse counsel asked williams about only two statements on the employment application the dates of his employment at the gillette company,and the statement that he had been a student at bunk
