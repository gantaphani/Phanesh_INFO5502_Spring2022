defendant gabriel ceballos ceballos was convicted in the united states district court for the northern district of new york,following a jury trial before thomas mcavoy,judge,on one count of conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin and cocaine,in violation of a and,and one count of conspiracy to bribe a public official,in violation of b a and bribery conspiracy he was sentenced principally to a prison term for the narcotics conspiracy offense and a term for the bribery conspiracy offense,to be served concurrently.ceballos appeals from so much of the judgment as reflects his bribery conspiracy conviction,contending that the evidence at trial was insufficient to permit an inference that he was a member of that conspiracy.we agree and reverse so much of the judgment of the district court as convicts him of conspiring to bribe a public official.
background 
the present prosecution arose out of a undercover investigation called operation wild card,conducted jointly by several law enforcement agencies,including the united states drug enforcement administration dea,the and naturalization service ins which has since ceased to exist as an independent agency,see homeland security act of,stat,and the new york state state police.the investigation culminated in a indictment charging more than three dozen individuals with narcotics trafficking,immigration violations,bribery,conspiracy.ceballos was charged with one count of narcotics conspiracy and one count of bribery conspiracy,and he stood trial alone.
the principal government witnesses at ceballos trial were ins special agent thomas,dea special agent ulises delgado,and state police senior investigator samuel mercado.there was no testimony from any cooperating coconspirator.the evidence at trial showed the following.
operation wild card 
the primary goal of operation wild card or the operation was the identification,arrest,and conviction of drug traffickers operating in the new york city area.as a secondary goal,the law enforcement agents sought out aliens who were present in the united states illegally or who were engaged in criminal activity.in the operation,mercado and delgado posed as drug dealers who distributed in upstate new york and canada pretended to be a corrupt ins official who was willing,in exchange for cash,to provide illegal aliens with documents evidencing permanent resident alien status,also known as green cards.mercado and delgado dealt with individuals who both brokered green cards for illegal aliens and distributed narcotics.
one such broker was pedro gonzalez gonzalez or pedro,who eventually led the agents to ceballos.the general flow of the transactions was as follows.mercado and delgado purchased narcotics from gonzalez they were to pay him partly in cash and partly in green cards that they would obtain for illegal aliens with the help of the supposedly corrupt ins official.mercado and delgado generally charged gonzalez between and per card higher prices were charged for aliens who had criminal records or prior immigration problems,crediting these amounts against the price of the narcotics they received from gonzalez.gonzalez received payments from the aliens for the green cards.he obtained narcotics from a supplier,planning to pay the supplier partly out of the cash he received from the aliens and partly out of the cash to be received from mercado and delgado upon their resale of the drugs.gonzalez transported the aliens to a prearranged meeting place,usually a diner near albany,from where they would be taken to the ins official to begin their processing on those trips gonzalez also delivered the narcotics.mercado and delgado were to pay the ins official out of the cash generated by the sale of the narcotics they received from gonzalez.
between june and june,delgado,who had responsibility for receiving and processing the delivered drugs,and mercado,who arranged for the aliens to meet with the ins official,had many dealings with gonzalez.during that period,gonzalez brought the agents aliens for processing.between june and,he delivered to mercado and delgado grams of cocaine and quantities of heroin ranging from approximately to grams.delgado would receive the drugs and transfer them to another dea agent for testing and safekeeping.the aliens would be taken to one of two adjacent motel rooms that housed the operation.in that room,the supposedly corrupt ins official would fingerprint the aliens,take information relevant to applications for permanent resident alien status,and instruct the aliens on how to answer questions they might be asked by ins officials in the future.in the adjacent room,agents videotaped the fraudulent activity.
after gonzalez had made a delivery of grams of heroin on october,for which gonzalez charged the agents approximately,the agents gave him only a small payment and delayed paying the remainder.their goal was to impede gonzalez ability to pay his supplier and to force him to turn to the agents for help in explaining that inability,thereby revealing his supplier identity.as hoped,gonzalez looked to the agents for help as a result,the agents learned that gonzalez source for the october heroin was one of the aliens they had processed earlier in october,euler soto gallo.thereafter,the agents dealt directly with gallo for the drugs he supplied,and gallo,like gonzalez,brought aliens to the agents for green cards.
on march,gonzalez brought the agents six aliens,along with one kilogram of relatively pure heroin that delgado testified would,after dilution,have a street value of from to more than million.gonzalez and delgado had previously agreed that the agents would pay gonzalez a total of,comprising for the heroin and as a delivery fee.mercado learned that gonzalez had bought the heroin for approximately.see tr.gonzalez was going to be making about a profit.
the agents charged for green cards for the six aliens brought on march.deducting that amount from the total to be paid to gonzalez,the agents owed him.delgado and gonzalez had agreed that the agents would have some days to make payment,although the balance could be reduced further if gonzalez brought additional aliens for green cards.the agents again delayed making full payment to gonzalez,hoping to force him to identify the supplier of these drugs.on april,delgado and gonzalez spoke by telephone.gonzalez said he needed the money to pay his supplier delgado responded that he and mercado had encountered problems in bringing in drug sale proceeds from canada and had lost some,forcing them to delay payment to gonzalez.although the agents offered to help gonzalez explain the delay,gonzalez resisted introducing them to his supplier,whom he described as a man who ran a computer business.during the next several weeks,gonzalez brought additional aliens for processing and thereby reduced the agents debt to him from to.
on may,gonzalez buckled under the pressure he was receiving from his supplier,and he asked mercado to speak directly with the supplier to explain why gonzalez had not been able to pay the rest of the debt.as discussed in part below,gonzalez had his supplier,who was eventually identified as ceballos,telephone mercado.
a week or so later,delgado and gonzalez discussed the possibility of the agents buying kilograms of cocaine at per kilo.in,they agreed that on june,gonzalez would bring several aliens to albany,and kilograms of cocaine would be brought in another car by one of the supplier workers.on june,delgado and gonzalez spoke several times while gonzalez was waiting for the second driver,whom he identified as his supplier son.gonzalez stated that he was going to the home of his supplier,and a new york city surveillance team followed gonzalez to the home of ceballos.delgado testified that,ultimately,the planned june deliveries did not come to pass because gonzalez 
had spoken to the father again and the father was able to get a hold of the son,the son was okay,but the ten kilograms of cocaine were in a vehicle,the vehicle could not be moved because it was hot,meaning the police was sic around,so at this point it could not be moved.as soon as things calmed down,it was hot or the police was sic around,then his son,you know,would be able to finish doing this deal.
trial transcript tr.
mercado and delgado remained in contact with gonzalez for the next several days,and on june,gonzalez revealed that he had only four kilograms of cocaine for the agents and that the supplier was raising the price.delgado urged gonzalez to try to get the remaining six kilograms,and they agreed that gonzalez would bring aliens,with a second car transporting the cocaine,on june.the agents relayed this information to the surveillance team,with instructions to track the second car,intercept it when convenient,and arrest the driver.
on june,members of the surveillance team observed gonzalez and five men rendezvous on a street corner in new york city with the second car,whose driver was later identified as ceballos son,sergio ceballos sergio.gonzalez briefly spoke with sergio and motioned two of the five men into sergio car.gonzalez and the other three men then returned to gonzalez car,and the two cars departed.sergio car was soon stopped by the surveilling agents.four kilograms of cocaine were found in the trunk,and sergio was arrested.
when gonzalez arrived at the agreed upstate diner later that day to meet with delgado and mercado,he was upset because he had lost sight of the car carrying the cocaine.he shortly received a telephone call informing him that the driver of that car,his supplier son,had been arrested.the call was from the supplier under repeated questioning from mercado,gonzalez confirmed that the supplier was the man they had referred to as the computer guy,whose first name was gabriel,and who was the supplier to whom mercado had spoken on may.gonzalez lamented the fact that two of the aliens had been in the son car because they did have anything to do with the cocaine deal.tr.
the transactions phase of operation wild card essentially ended on that day.on june,approximately persons were arrested,including ceballos,who was revealed to operate a computer business.when mercado heard ceballos speak,he identified ceballos as the supplier to whom he had spoken by telephone on may.
b.the conversations of may,
on may,while mercado was away on vacation,he received numerous voice mail messages from gonzalez.when he reached gonzalez,gonzalez said he was under a tremendous amount of pressure from his supplier to pay the rest of the money owed for the kilogram of heroin delivered on march.gonzalez wanted to bring more aliens for green cards in order to raise the cash to pay his supplier mercado responded that he was out of town on business and could not have any aliens processed or get any money to gonzalez before the following week.gonzalez then asked mercado to call and talk to this guy directly and explain to him it not me,i not trying to not pay him the money,it that we have been able to raise money so i can pay the source.tr.at.mercado agreed to talk to the supplier,instructing gonzalez to have him call mercado.
mercado,whose undercover name was danilo,testified that he received the supplier call no more than two minutes later.on direct examination by the government,he described the ensuing conversation as follows 
i said hello,and i go you probably do know who i am,i danilo,a good friend of pedro,he wanted you to call me.he said yes,that why i calling.i told him,i would like to explain to you a little bit about our business.we have a little business that we do,we process people for certain items,you know,these invitations that the word i used.right now i in south carolina on business,you know,some business,i ca get to him until next week,i asking as a favor to me,not to pedro,to me,if you can give him until next week until i get back,saying i promise told him,i will give you my word,i will have that money,or he will have some money for you next week.he says i do know if i can wait that long,i do know if i can wait that long.i said well,just understand that it not him,it actually my fault.so i started to accept responsibility on behalf of pedro.he ready to go,he got the people ready to go,i am not ready to go.can we wait until next week he said well,let me see,let me talk to pedro,but i not going to promise anything,because they on my back and i on his back,and that the way it is.i said well,do me that favor,if you can.i would appreciate it.and i hung up.
tr.on redirect examination,mercado also described that may conversation with first name the agents did not learn until may,and whose full name they did not learn until late follows 
i engaged with the defendant gabriel ceballos about that pedro and i have a business that has to do with some invitations and people that come up to see me.i did get into the details.he understood that.he acknowledged that he was aware of that and,because of that,we were going to raise some money.the problem we have is i ca meet with him until next week because i down here on business.as soon as i get back,he bring some people up,process them,and he be able to get some money to you.that how i was trying to buy the time for him.but the defendant gabriel ceballos understood what i was talking about.his issue was the time factor.
immediately following his conversation with ceballos,mercado received a call from gonzalez,asking whether ceballos had called.mercado responded that he had and that mercado had perhaps bought gonzalez a week to pay the debt.mercado testified that this conversation with gonzalez was interrupted when gonzalez received a call from ceballos,who acknowledged having spoken to mercado.gonzalez later informed mercado that ceballos did give him time,but next week was all he was going to give next week was going to be it.tr.
after learning ceballos identity,the agents obtained his telephone records.at trial,records were introduced showing nearly two hundred telephonic contacts between gonzalez and ceballos between april and june.no wiretaps had been placed on the telephones of targets of the operation,however,and the government presented no evidence as to the contents of any of the conversations.
c.the defense case 
the defense called as its only witness ceballos son sergio,who by then was serving a sentence of five years to life imprisonment for possession of cocaine as a result of his arrest on june.sergio testified that when he was arrested,he was driving two people,whose names he did not know,to albany at the behest of gonzalez.gonzalez had called him the night before to make that request and had promised to pay him for that service.sergio testified that he had not known the cocaine was in his car and that he had simply received a bag for gonzalez from a mutual friend.
sergio testified that he had never engaged in any illegal activity with his father.he had not lived with his father while growing up and as an adult sergio had lived with various relatives or with his wife.he saw his father from time to time in a bar they both frequented,and he spoke with his father often on the telephone.sergio testified that ceballos was not involved with the cocaine sergio was carrying on june.sergio was not asked any questions as to whether his father had any involvement in his transport of the aliens.
d.the verdict 
in summation,the government argued that the drug and bribery conspiracies were so interrelated as to be a single conspiracy,though they were charged in two counts because two substantive statutes were involved 
these two conspiracies,although charged in separate counts because they involve a violation of separate statutes,the two conspiracies are really interconnected,they woven together.in some sense they one conspiracy,related,but you have to consider them separately for purposes of the indictment 
tr.emphasis added.
in arguing that ceballos knew of the bribery conspiracy,the government argued both that his may conversation with mercado showed such knowledge and that ceballos had been aware of ceballos inability to pay euler soto gallo,the supplier of grams of heroin who had also been an alien processed in the operation for a green card 
i t the green card scheme that really funded the drug transactions in this case.and it was the attractiveness of the green cards to the brokers,to the people who they solicited which generated large amounts of cash which ultimately ended up in the hands of the sources of supply,sources like euler,sources like this defendant.you have to ask yourself,did these sources know that the cash was being generated in that fashion.and,clearly,in the case of euler,he did.i mean,he came up and went through the process himself.but this defendant knew,too,i submit.and the proof of that is in that may conversation.when mercado tells him,hey,we going to try and generate a little cash for pedro,going to try to help him out of his problem,you know,we got this thing going.you recall investigator mercado testimony on that.he said that ceballos knew what he was talking about.of course he knew what he was talking about.he knew,because that how he was getting paid.and that the reason why he would front such a large quantity of drugs like or package of heroin to a guy like pedro gonzalez.a guy with a pretty bad credit history in the drug game since he stiffed euler with the grams that soto gallo delivered in october.
tr.the government argued that 
the substance of the may call showed that ceballos knew about this immigration scheme,he knew how money was being generated and,in fact,the result of it was that he gave pedro a little more time to pay.and he did that because he was convinced that this was a cash generating machine that he could rely on.
the jury found ceballos guilty of both conspiracy to traffic in narcotics and conspiracy to bribe a public official.ceballos was sentenced principally to a term of imprisonment for the narcotics conspiracy offense,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and to a prison term for the bribery conspiracy offense,to be served concurrently with the prison term imposed on the narcotics conspiracy count,and a term to be served concurrently with the term.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,ceballos does not challenge his narcotics conspiracy conviction,and he concedes that,as a result of his march conversation with mercado,he knew of the existence of the bribery conspiracy.but he contends that his conviction of bribery conspiracy should be reversed on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to permit a finding that he joined in or participated in the bribery conspiracy.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
in order to prove a conspiracy in violation of,the government must show that two or more persons entered into an agreement to commit an offense against the united states and that an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed.see,united states desena,cir united states monaco,cir,cert.denied,d.in order to convict a given defendant of conspiracy,the government must prove that he knew of the conspiracy and joined it,see,direct sales united states.desena,at,with the intent to commit the offenses that were its objectives,see,direct sales,at.united states reyes,cir,that is,with the affirmative intent to make the conspiracy succeed,see,united states vargas,cir,cert.denied,d united states cianchetti,cir.the agreement that is the gist of conspiracy may be tacit rather than explicit,see,direct sales,at,and w here the existence of a conspiracy has been proved,evidence sufficient to link another defendant with it need not be overwhelming and it may be circumstantial in nature,desena,at internal quotation marks omitted.
however,knowledge of the existence and goals of a conspiracy does not of itself make one a coconspirator.cianchetti,at see,direct sales,at.desena,at united states casamento,cir.there must be something more than m ere knowledge,approval of or acquiescence in the object or the purpose of the conspiracy,cianchetti,at internal quotation marks omitted the defendant attitude towards the forbidden undertaking must be more positive he must in some sense promote their venture himself,make it his own,have a stake in its outcome,id.internal quotation marks omitted,or make an affirmative attempt to further its purposes,see,direct sales,at.the evidence must show that t here is more than knowledge,that t here is informed and interested cooperation.furthermore,to establish the intent,the evidence of knowledge must be clear,not equivocal.id.at.
where the conspiracy involves a crime,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to violate the substantive statute.united states samaria,cir.the bribery that was the objective of the conspiracy at issue on the present appeal is a crime,as the statute prohibits a person directly or indirectly,from corruptly giv ing,anything of value to any public official with intent to influence any official act.b a.see generally united states growers of california,d for bribery in violation of b a there must be a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act emphasis omitted.
a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction bears a heavy burden.united states best,cir,cert.denied,d.in reviewing such a challenge,we must credit every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,see,united states carson,cir,cert.denied,d,and defer to the jury determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,and to the jury choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence,united states morrison,cir.we must affirm the conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,we conclude that,from the inferences reasonably drawn,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,best,at quoting jackson virginia,d emphasis in jackson.
nonetheless,the jury inferences must be based on evidence and must be reasonable.see generally goldhirsh group,alpert,cir the jury role as the finder of fact does not entitle it to return a verdict based only on confusion or speculation its verdict must be reasonably based on evidence presented at trial.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we have reversed conspiracy convictions for lack of evidence that a given defendant intended to join the conspiracy where,for example,the defendant agreed to act as a drug courier if certain conditions were met,but ultimately stated that he would not participate,see casamento,at or where the defendant initially acknowledged that he was able to supply drugs,but was reluctant to do so,and later unequivocally disassociated himself from the venture and stated that he wanted nothing to do with it,united states steinberg,cir,cert.denied,d or where the defendant had stated that he might be able to help arrange for the receipt and distribution of narcotics,but was never heard from again,see cianchetti,at.where the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict the defendant,the judgment of conviction must be reversed and the indictment dismissed.see,burks united states,d.
the government suggests on this appeal,as it did at trial,that ceballos knew about the bribery conspiracy prior to his may conversation with mercado,arguing that this was evidenced by the fact that ceballos fronted such large amounts of narcotics to the agents through gonzalez without immediate payment,referring in part to the evidence that on march,ceballos had supplied a kilogram of heroin.government brief on appeal at.similarly,in its summation to the jury,the government argued that the evidence revealed that ceballos knew of the bribery conspiracy prior to the may conversation because 
mercado in his testimony said that ceballos knew what he was talking about.of course he knew what he was talking about.he knew,because that how he was getting paid.and that the reason why he would front such a large quantity of drugs like or package of heroin to a guy like pedro gonzalez.a guy with a pretty bad credit history in the drug game since he stiffed euler with the grams that soto gallo delivered in october.
tr.emphasis added.we have several difficulties with these arguments.
first,mercado did not testify that ceballos already knew what mercado was telling him on may.rather,mercado testimony,on redirect examination,was that mercado explained the business he had with gonzalez and that ceballos understood what i was talking about.tr.emphasis added.
second,the government inference that ceballos understood,prior to the may conversation,the workings of the business,is not based on mercado testimonial description of ceballos statements.as can be seen from mercado testimony,quoted in part above,the only actual statements attributed to ceballos by mercado were as follows a in response to mercado identification of himself as danilo,the friend that gonzalez wanted ceballos to call,he said yes,that why i calling b in response to mercado statement that,as a result of the business mercado had with gonzalez of processing people for certain items,gonzalez would have some money for ceballos next week,he says i do know if i can wait that long,i do know if i can wait that long and c in response to mercado importuning ceballos to wait a week,he said well,let me see,let me talk to pedro,but i not going to promise anything,because they on my back and i on his back,and that the way it is.tr.no other statements were attributed to ceballos.
mercado testimony inferring that ceballos understood what i was talking about tr.must be read in light of his testimony that,at the very beginning of the may conversation,mercado had explained his business to ceballos i told him,i would like to explain to you a little bit about my business with gonzalez tr,telling him,we have a little business that we do,we process people for certain items,you know,these invitations that the word i used.see also tr.i received the call from gabriel ceballos.at that time i identify myself as to who i am,and he recognized who i was talking on behalf of,which is pedro gonzalez,and his situation with him,gabriel ceballos,and i offered to help in a way that i could.and i started to explain that.mercado did not testify that ceballos understood anything about the business prior to mercado explanations.
in sum,mercado did not testify to any statements by ceballos that indicated ceballos had already known of the business prior to hearing mercado explanation.mercado testimony was that he explained,and ceballos understood.
the government argues that ceballos already knew of the bribery conspiracy because that how he was getting paid tr.government brief on appeal at the jury easily could conclude that ceballos supplied such large amounts of drugs to the agents with the full knowledge and expectation that the bribery of the public official would generate the money to pay for the drugs.these arguments are not supported by the proof.first,there was no evidence that ceballos knew that part of the money he had received for his drugs prior to may came from aliens who were obtaining fraudulent green cards.although the government summation referred to sources like euler soto gallo,sources like this defendant tr,the comparison was inapt.euler soto gallo knew of the bribery conspiracy because he was brought by gonzalez to the agents to obtain a green card and was the supplier of the narcotics for which that processing was partial payment.and thereafter eliminating gonzalez as the middleman for these transactions,euler soto gallo himself brought the agents narcotics and other aliens for processing.ceballos,in contrast,was not an alien processed by operation wild card for a green card as the government acknowledged in summation,ceballos was a naturalized united states citizen.and ceballos never brought the agents any aliens for processing.thus,ceballos,except for the fact that he was a drug supplier,was not shown to be at all like euler soto gallo.
moreover,mercado did not testify that he told ceballos on may that this business had generated the payments to ceballos in the past.mercado testified that he informed ceballos,that pedro and i have a business having to do with people and documents and,because of that,we were going to raise some money.tr.emphasis added.mercado trial testimony did not include mention of any statement to ceballos that the agents had in the past routinely paid gonzalez for drugs through the processing of aliens.
although the government also points to the fact that there were nearly two hundred telephone contacts between gonzalez and ceballos between april and june,it presented no evidence as to the contents of those conversations.it is a given that gonzalez was obtaining narcotics from ceballos,which obviously necessitated conversations.but any suggestion that those telephone conversations also included discussions of bribing an ins official to process illegal aliens for green cards is wholly speculative.
the government argues that ceballos gave drugs to the agents and relied on the future bribery of the public official to get paid.government brief on appeal at.this argument is factually flawed and,in the absence of proof,unreasonable.in fact,ceballos did not sell the narcotics to the agents he sold drugs to gonzalez,who resold a hefty the agents.the agents had no transactions with ceballos,and indeed had no communication with him other than mercado telephone conversation with him on may.
further,the suggestion that ceballos relied on the business for payment is simply not reasonable,given the evidence of record.although the government contends that an inference of ceballos reliance is supported by mercado testimony that the quantities of drugs he purchased from gonzalez were larger than he had ever purchased before,and that he was only able to make these purchases because he could use the green cards to pay for the drugs government brief on appeal at,that contention suffers from at least two flaws.first,while mercado testimony that he could not afford to buy the drugs with cash reflected the knowledge of the agents,there was no evidence whatever that anyone shared this knowledge with ceballos.second,the agents inability to pay for the drugs without using processing as currency was a consequence of the fact that they were not really drug fact that clearly was not known by ceballos.real drug dealers resell their drugs.without any evidence of reliance,it is not reasonable to surmise that ceballos was relying on the business to bring him a payment of for heroin that could have a resale street value of several million dollars.
finally,the government argues that ceballos knowledge of the bribery conspiracy was the only possible explanation for his willingness to front such large amounts of narcotics government brief on appeal at,especially to a guy like pedro gonzalez,a guy with a pretty bad credit history in the drug game since he stiffed euler with the grams that soto gallo delivered in october tr.but we have seen no evidence that gonzalez was generally perceived by drug suppliers as a bad credit risk,nor any evidence that ceballos was ever aware of the october dealings between gonzalez and euler soto gallo.
in sum,the government suggestion that ceballos knew of and relied on the bribery conspiracy prior to mercado explanation of it in the may conversation is unsupported by the evidence.
mercado testimony as to his may conversation with ceballos was of course sufficient to show ceballos knowledge from that time forward as a result of that conversation.but as discussed above,a defendant may not be convicted of conspiracy merely because he knows of,approves of,or acquiesces in the objective of a conspiracy.there must be proof that he intended to join the conspiracy,that is,that he participated in it,or in some way made an affirmative attempt to further the conspiracy purposes,or made it his own venture in the sense of having a stake in its outcome.such proof was lacking here.
mercado testified that when he asked ceballos to give gonzalez another week to pay the drug debt,ceballos said he was not going to promise anything.tr.although ceballos thereafter stated to gonzalez that he would allow gonzalez another week to pay,his mere forbearance from insisting on immediate payment did not make it reasonable to infer that he thereby joined the bribery conspiracy.there was no indication that ceballos performed any act in order to facilitate,or any act that could have had the effect of facilitating,the processing of additional aliens in the following week.ceballos mere patience did nothing wh
