background 
the present prosecution arose out of investigations into the narcotics trafficking activities in brooklyn,new york,and elsewhere in the united states,of a group of men known as the patio crew.the evidence at stewart trial included testimony from law enforcement officers,cooperating members of the patio crew or crew,and others.
briefly summarized in the light most favorable to the government,the trial evidence included the following.stewart and emile dixon were members of the patio crew,a gang that had controlled narcotics trafficking in the flatbush section of brooklyn for more than a decade.the crew distributed powder cocaine and crack cocaine and was vigilant in protecting its flatbush territory through the use of threats,assaults,robberies,and murder.stewart and dixon were regarded by other crew members as particularly inclined towards violence.the crew had a code of vengeance against anyone who cooperated with law enforcement authorities in the vernacular of the crew members,who were jamaican nationals,the rule was informer for dead,meaning that if an informer cooperated with the police,the i nformer must die.trial transcript tr.at see also id.at i nformers must dead stewart brief on appeal at t he credo of the streets included the rule keep your mouth shut never become an informant never snitch there was even a popular saying on the street,snitches for dead,which was a warning that meant death to informants.
in the summer of,stewart became aware that marijuana was being sold at one of the crew locations by robert thompson ragga,who was not a member of the crew.on july,complaining of ragga competition in front of stewart building see tr,stewart approached other patio crew members and asked if anyone had a fire stick,meaning a gun tr.later that day,ragga was shot several times.he was seriously injured,but recovered.
ragga at first refused to reveal the identity of his assailant to the police see,tr.he would say only that he had been in his jeep stopped at a red light when a man ran up,opened the door,and started firing a gun at him see id.at.eventually,however,ragga informed the police that the shooter had been stewart ragga so testified before a grand jury in march.in the meantime,ragga had told several others,including his girlfriend,his brother steven,and the mother of two of his children,that he had been shot by stewart.
immediately after the shooting of ragga,stewart had fled brooklyn for buffalo,new york,where he continued to participate in the crew narcotics distributions.in january,stewart was arrested in buffalo on new york state drug charges he was eventually returned to brooklyn to face outstanding charges with respect to an unrelated shooting in brooklyn.as discussed in greater detail in part.below,stewart,while being detained first in buffalo and then in brooklyn,sent several messages to ragga urging him not to identify stewart in a lineup and not to testify against him with respect to the shooting of ragga.ragga was undeterred,and in late march he informed a police detective that stewart was the person who had shot him.thereafter,stewart had several telephone conversations with dixon,who urged ragga not to testify against stewart.ragga refused to agree not to testify.on july,in a shooting,ragga was killed by dixon.
dixon and stewart were eventually indicted on federal charges,including several relating to the murder of ragga.stewart was charged with conspiring between july and july to murder ragga and with attempting to murder ragga on july,for the purpose of maintaining and increasing his position in the patio crew,a racketeering enterprise,in violation of a.because the government sought the death penalty against dixon for the actual murder,the two defendants were tried separately.at stewart trial,the government was allowed to introduce evidence from a police detective and several other witnesses that ragga had told them that the man who shot him on july,was stewart.see,tr.stewart was convicted on the counts,as well as the other counts described above.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,stewart contends,inter alia,that the admission of testimony that ragga had identified him as the july,shooter violated his rights under the confrontation clause.his other contentions include a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on one count and a contention that the district court failed to consider the appropriate factors in imposing sentence.finding no merit in his contentions,we affirm the judgment.
