acting without a warrant,an agent from the drug enforcement agency dea placed a global positioning system device gps on the subaru impreza driven by appellant stephen aguiar.the data gathered by the gps aided law enforcement in identifying avenues of investigation,supported applications for wiretap warrants,and led investigators to other evidence collected and introduced at trial.appellants sought to suppress the evidence gathered with the aid of gps data,arguing that the placement and tracking violated the fourth amendment.the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions,denied the motion.aguiar and appellants corey whitcomb and william murray were convicted on multiple counts flowing from a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and heroin.
following appellants convictions,the supreme court handed down united states jones,which held that the government installation of a gps device on a target vehicle,and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle movements,constitutes a search for fourth amendment purposes,footnote omitted.jones left open the question of whether the warrantless use of gps devices would be reasonable and thus lawful under the fourth amendment where officers ha ve reasonable suspicion,and indeed probable cause to conduct such a search.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.as we find the government actions in this case fall within the exception to the excusionary rule set forth in davis united states,we decline to reach the issue of whether the search was unconstitutional 
background 
in,members of the burlington police department bpd who were investigating a cocaine and heroin distribution ring focused their attention on leads indicating that aguiar was transporting cocaine from massachusetts into vermont.william murray was suspected of being one of aguiar main cocaine distributors,and corey whitcomb became a target of the investigation later on.based on the information developed by bpd,in early the dea joined the investigation.
on january,dea agent richard carter installed a gps device on aguiar impreza without either a search warrant or consent.carter later installed gps trackers on other cars driven by aguiar,and changed the batteries in the devices as needed.once installed and activated,the gps device transmitted a live signal to a dea server,which showed the precise location of aguiar car in real time.law enforcement agents were able to use the gps data to remotely monitor the car movements.the dea developed software that allows agents to save,track and analyze the data generated by the gps device.the dea began receiving gps data the day the device was attached,and continued to collect gps data from aguiar vehicles until his arrest on july.
using data generated by the gps device,dea agents were able to identify additional suspects and obtain pen register and trap and trace orders,as well as a title iii order allowing agents to wiretap aguiar cell phone.at trial,the government introduced various evidence developed with the aid of the gps data,including maps depicting aguiar travel routes,surveillance photos,and testimony of officers who made visual observations of aguiar and his activities.
following their indictments and arrests,appellants moved to suppress the data collected from the gps device.the district court denied the motion.it relied on united states knotts,for the proposition that a person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.seeing no material distinction between the beeper devices used to track vehicle movement in knotts and the gps devices used here,the district court ruled that the warrantless use of a tracking device on public roads did not violate the fourth amendment.appellants were convicted after a jury trial,and this appeal followed.
we review the factual findings on which the district court suppression ruling was based for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government the legal conclusions on which this ruling was based are reviewed de novo.united states watson,cir internal quotation marks,alteration and italics omitted.the appellants here contest the denial of their motion to suppress the gps data and evidence derived from that data,based on the supreme court decision in united states jones.all seek to vacate their convictions and remand the case to the district court for a new suppression hearing.
i.the state of the law on tracking technology.
we start with an examination of the law prior to the decision in jones,beginning with united states knotts.in knotts,the police were investigating a conspiracy to manufacture controlled substances,including methamphetamine.at.with the permission of the container owner,the police placed a beeper inside of a five gallon drum containing chloroform purchased by one of the defendants.when defendant picked up the container,the police followed the defendant car by tracking the radio signal emitted by the beeper,and eventually tracked the container to a cabin used by the defendant.id.at.the police then obtained a search warrant for the cabin,based in large part upon the data collected through use of the beeper.id.at.defendant sought to suppress the evidence obtained based on the warrantless monitoring of the beeper.the supreme court found no fourth amendment violation,stating that a person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.id.at.
the supreme court next addressed the issue in united states karo,where a beeper was used to track an object inside of a private residence,rather than in a public area.as in knotts,government agents installed a beeper inside a container,then used the beeper to track the movement of the container to various locations,including a number of private residences and a commercial storage facility.at.defendants moved to suppress the evidence collected from within one of the private residences,and the supreme court agreed that using the beeper to monitor the movement of the container within private residences violated the fourth amendment.id.at.the karo court held that a t the risk of belaboring the obvious,private residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by a warrant,and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.id.the karo court distinguished knotts 
the monitoring of an electronic device such as a beeper is,of course,less intrusive than a search,but it does reveal a critical fact about the interior of the premises that the government is extremely interested in knowing and that it could not have otherwise obtained without a warrant.the case is thus not like knotts,for there the beeper told the authorities nothing about the interior of knotts cabin.the information obtained in knotts was voluntarily conveyed to anyone who wanted to look,at,at here,as we have said,the monitoring indicated that the beeper was inside the house,a fact that could not have been visually verified.
after knotts and karo,tracking technology evolved and law enforcement began employing gps devices instead of beepers.in united states mciver,the ninth circuit considered the argument that placing a gps device on a vehicle constituted a trespass and rejected it because the vehicle was parked outside the curtilage of a home when the device was attached,such that defendant lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy cognizable under the fourth amendment.mciver,cir abrogated by jones.at.nor did placing the gps device constitute an illegal search and seizure,as 
mciver did not produce any evidence to show that he intended to shield the undercarriage of his toyota from inspection by others.furthermore,in placing the electronic devices on the undercarriage of the toyota,the officers did not pry into a hidden or enclosed area.
id.at.in addition,
mciver did not present any evidence that the placement of the magnetized tracking devices deprived him of dominion and control of his toyota,nor did he demonstrate that the presence of these objects caused any damage to the electronic components of the vehicle.under these circumstances,we hold that no seizure occurred because the officers did not meaningfully interfere with mciver possessory interest in the toyota.
the ninth circuit reached the same result in united states pineda moreno,where the government conceded the appellant car was parked within the curtilage of his home when the gps device was placed.cir,vacated.finding the driveway where the vehicle was parked had no gate,no no trespassing signs,and no features to prevent someone standing in the street from seeing the entire driveway,the ninth circuit concluded appellant lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the driveway.id.at.the ninth circuit also found that like the beeper at issue in knotts,
t he only information the agents obtained from the gps tracking devices was a log of the locations where pineda moreno car traveled,information the agents could have obtained by following the car.insofar as pineda moreno complaint appears to be simply that scientific devices such as the tracking devices enabled the police to be more effective in detecting crime,it simply has no constitutional foundation.we have never equated police efficiency with unconstitutionality and decline to do so now.
id.at quoting knotts,at.
similarly,in united states garcia,the seventh circuit found the warrantless attachment of a gps device to a vehicle was not a search,cir,abrogated by jones.at.the seventh circuit found the gps device merely acted as a substitute for an activity,namely following a car on a public street,that is unequivocally not a search within the meaning of the amendment.id.at emphasis in the original 
it was not until the circuit issued its decision in united states maynard in august of that a circuit court found attaching a gps tracking device to a suspect car violated the fourth amendment.the circuit found that the police used the gps device to track defendant movements hours a day for days as he moved among scores of places,thereby discovering the totality and pattern of his movements from place to place to place.id.at.that monitoring gave the police access to information not exposed to the public 
first,unlike one movements during a single journey,the whole of one movements over the course of a month is not actually exposed to the public because the likelihood anyone will observe all those movements is effectively nil.second,the whole of one movements is not exposed constructively even though each individual movement is exposed,because that whole reveals more sometimes a great deal more than does the sum of its parts.
id.emphasis in the original.the maynard court concluded that the warrantless use of a gps device to track a suspect movements offended the constitution,and further found that the gps data was essential to the government case against defendant antoine jones.id.at.accordingly,the court overturned the convictions obtained against jones based on those data.
the supreme court took up the case,now captioned united states jones.the court held that the government installation of a gps device on a target vehicle,and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle movements,constitutes a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.id.at footnote omitted.the supreme court explained that 
i t is important to be clear about what occurred in this case the government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information.we have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment when it was adopted.entick carrington,eng,is a case we have described as a monument of english freedom undoubtedly familiar to every american statesman at the time the constitution was adopted,and considered to be the true and ultimate expression of constitutional law with regard to search and seizure.
id.quoting brower cnty.of inyo.the court rejected the government argument that jones lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the underbody of the jeep to which the gps device was attached 
because jones fourth amendment rights do not rise or fall with the katz formulation.at bottom,we must assur e preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the fourth amendment was adopted.kyllo,supra,at.as explained,for most of our history the fourth amendment was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas persons,houses,papers,and effects it enumerates.katz did not repudiate that understanding.
jones.at footnote omitted.
ii.the state of the law.
while jones settled the issue of whether the warrantless use of a gps device to track a suspect movements constitutes a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment,jones did not address the issue of whether the warrantless use of gps devices would be reasonable and thus lawful under the fourth amendment where officers ha ve reasonable suspicion,and indeed probable cause to execute such a search.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a warrantless search is per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.katz united states,footnote omitted.to safeguard fourth amendment rights generally,the supreme court has crafted the exclusionary rule,requiring the exclusion of evidence when the police exhibit deliberate,reckless,or grossly negligent disregard for fourth amendment rights.united states stokes,cir internal quotation,citation and alteration omitted.however,t he fact that a fourth amendment violation occurred,that a search or arrest was unreasonable does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies.herring united states.indeed,exclusion has always been our last resort,not our first impulse.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the exclusionary rule is subject to a exception,crafted by the supreme court in davis.courts grappling with the issue of warrantless gps searches conducted prior to jones often found that their analysis turned on whether the exception applied.see united states sparks,cir noting few courts have grappled with the warrant question so far,largely because the searches at issue in recent cases occurred,allowing the government to argue,and a number of courts to find,that the exception would apply even if the searches were unconstitutional.cert denied,wl.
the exception provides that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.davis.at.davis involved officers who conducted a search of an automobile contemporaneously with an arrest,in accordance with binding circuit precedent.id.as defendant case progressed,that precedent was overruled,meaning the search at issue ended up violating the fourth amendment.because the officer acted on reliance in the law at the time of the search,the davis court declined to suppress the evidence collected during that search as would ordinarily be required under the exclusionary rule.id.at.noting that the exclusionary rule is a prudential doctrine created by this court to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty,with the goal of deter ring future fourth amendment violations,id.at internal quotation mark and citation omitted,the davis court stressed the goal of deterrence must be balanced against 
the substantial social costs generated by the rule.exclusion exacts a heavy toll on both the judicial system and society at large.it almost always requires courts to ignore reliable,trustworthy evidence bearing on guilt or innocence.and its effect,in many cases,is to suppress the truth and set the criminal loose in the community without punishment.our cases hold that society must swallow this bitter pill when necessary,but only as a last resort.for exclusion to be appropriate,the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh its heavy costs.
id.at citations omitted.invoking its decision in united states leon,the court observed 
the basic insight of the leon line of cases is that the deterrence benefits of exclusion var y with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue.when the police exhibit deliberate,reckless,or grossly negligent disregard for fourth amendment rights,the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and tends to outweigh the resulting costs.but when the police act with an objectively reasonable belief that their conduct is lawful,or when their conduct involves only simple,isolated negligence,the deterrence rationale loses much of its force,and exclusion can not pay its way.
id.at internal citations omitted.thus,searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule when those cases are later overturned.at.
several of our sister circuits have applied the exception in cases where warrantless gps searches were conducted,and did not require the evidence collected by those searches be suppressed.see sparks,at united states andres,cir cert denied.united states pineda moreno,cir cert denied.several district courts have also applied the good faith exception to allow evidence obtained from warrantless gps searches to stand.see,united states baez,d,where,as here,law enforcement officers at the time they act have a good faith basis to rely upon a substantial consensus among precedential courts,suppression of probative evidence is too high a price to pay because of the subsequent supervention of that consensus by the supreme court.united states leon,d,as there was no binding precedent authorizing the practice at the time,davis did not control,but after examining precedent as of,the court finds that the agents conduct in the use of the gps tracking device was objectively reasonable united states oladosu,d evidence would not be excluded where at the time the gps device was attached to defendant vehicle,the supreme court had approved the warrantless use of beeper technology and two circuit courts had extended that rule to gps devices.
other courts,however,adopted a much stricter rule,finding the precedent at issue must be within the circuit and specific to the facts at hand.united states katzin,cir.katzin first held that the police must obtain a warrant prior to attaching a gps device on a vehicle,thereby undertaking a search that the supreme court has compared to a constable concealing himself in the target coach in order to track its movements.id.at quoting jones.at.the third circuit then declined to apply the exclusionary rule,finding knotts and karo are both distinguishable given the lack of a physical intrusion in those cases,the placement by police of the beepers inside containers,and the marked technological differences between beepers and gps trackers.id.at.katzin also rejected reliance on cases,finding such reliance would eviscerate the notion that clear and precedent should control and thus contradicts the basic principles of stare decisis.id.at.a number of district courts have reached similar conclusions.see united states robinson,d,holding in davis extends only to binding precedent united states lee,d,limiting exception to binding appellate precedent united states lujan,sa,wl at although the placement and use of a gps tracker in this instance was per se unreasonable without a warrant under the fourth amendment,because there was an independent basis for pulling lujan over in arkansas and separate probable cause as well as valid consent to search his vehicle,the evidence will not be suppressed.
iii.application of jones and davis.
the government here concedes,as it must,that attaching a gps tracking device to aguiar car without a warrant is a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.it urges us to find that its actions fall within a number of different execptions to the exclusionary rule.as we agree with the government that the exception applies here,we do not reach any of its alternative arguments.
we start by addressing what is binding appellate precedent within the meaning of davis.in the context of statutory interpretation,binding precedent refers to the precedent of this circuit and the supreme court.see dorozhko,cir.prior to jones,our circuit lacked occasion to opine on the constitutionality of using electronic tracking devices attached to vehicles,either of the beeper or gps variety.however,the supreme court did have occasion to address the issue in both knotts and karo,and we find that at the time the gps tracking device was applied to aguiar car in january,law enforcement could reasonably rely on that binding appellate precedent.
the supreme court decision in knotts stood for the proposition that the warrantless use of a tracking device to monitor the movements of a vehicle on public roads did not violate the fourth amendment.at.further,karo discounted the importance of trespass in placing a device,stating that a physical trespass is only marginally relevant to the question of whether the fourth amendment has been violated.u.at.karo de minimis treatment of the trespass issue gave no indication that the issue of trespass would become the touchstone for the analysis in jones.moreover,karo brushing off of the potential trespass fits logically with earlier supreme court decisions concluding that the physical characteristics of an automobile and its use result in a lessened expectation of privacy therein.new york class.nor is there an expectation of privacy when a car travels public thoroughfares where its occupants and its contents are in plain view,cardwell lewis.taken together,law enforcement could reasonably conclude placing a gps device on the exterior of aguiar vehicles did not violate the fourth amendment.
moreover,we find the beeper technology used in knotts sufficiently similar to the gps technology deployed by the government here.see,sparks,at finding defendants failed to distinguish in any substantive way how the installation of a beeper differed from the installation of a gps device.like the device at issue in knotts,the gps device allows law enforcement to conduct the same sort of surveillance it could conduct visually,but in a more efficient and manner.appellants argue that the gps surveillance here continued over a period of months,tantamount to the sort of dragnet type law enforcement practices the knotts court specifically declined to address.knotts,at.but the record indicates that the gps device was used to track aguiar vehicles on public thoroughfares,with technology undertaking an activity that police officers would have physically performed in the past.insofar as respondent complaint appears to be simply that scientific devices such as the beeper enabled police to be more effective in detecting crime,it simply has no constitutional foundation.id.
our conclusion that the officers here relied in good faith on knotts in placing the gps device on aguiar vehicles is reinforced by the fact that several sister circuits reached similar conclusions.see pineda moreno,at holding that gps tracking device used to monitor individual movements in his vehicle was not a search,relying on knotts garcia,at same see also,united states jesus nunez,cr,wl,at united states burton,d united states moran,d.these cases are not binding precedent and thus do not control our analysis under davis,but do support the conclusion that relying on knotts was objectively reasonable.see,katzin,at noting that at the time the gps device in question was placed,there was a circuit split on the issue of whether the warrantless use of such devices violated the fourth amendment.
at bottom,sufficient supreme court precedent existed at the time the gps device was placed for the officers here to reasonably conclude a warrant was not necessary in these circumstances.plainly,the landscape has changed,and law enforcement will need to change its approach accordingly.
iv.appellants remaining arguments.
a.the denial of a franks hearing.
as part of its investigation into aguiar activities,the government sought a pen register and trap and trace warrant.in his april,application for a hybrid pen and trace order,dea agent couture affirmed that on january,a confidential informant placed a recorded phone call to aguiar at.however,in his supporting affidavit for the june,hybrid order,couture stated that the january phone call was placed to aguia
