opinion of the court 
this interlocutory appeal arises out of a case in which andre blaylock sued five officers of the philadelphia police department under,alleging false arrest,excessive force,and malicious prosecution.at the close of discovery,the officers moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied that motion,and the officers now appeal.
we lack the benefit of the district court views as to what facts are subject to genuine dispute with respect to the claims of excessive force and malicious prosecution,and we will therefore vacate the district court order denying summary judgment on those claims and remand pursuant to the supervisory rule we announced in forbes lower merion,cir.we will dismiss the portion of the officers appeal relating to the false arrest claim for want of jurisdiction under johnson jones,d.
the parties to this case agree that on october,defendant police officers brian reynolds,jeffrey walker,and thomas liciardello arrested andre blaylock while he was sitting on the steps of north street in philadelphia.he was held on various drug charges until he was released on february,and the charges against him were dropped.the parties dispute how his arrest and incarceration came about.
according to andre blaylock,on october,reynolds received a tip from an informant to the effect that dana and omar blaylock relatives of andre were selling drugs near the block of north street in philadelphia,and were storing drugs at north street and at two other addresses in the same area after receiving the informant tip,reynolds performed a record check on omar and dana,which connected them to the latter two addresses and revealed that both had several prior arrests.reynolds shared that information with walker.the parties agree that omar was incarcerated during all times relevant to this case.walker and officer louis cujdik set up surveillance that afternoon and observed dana and another black male participate in drug transactions at north street.that same day,cujdik met with a confidential informant and arranged a controlled narcotics purchase,in which the informant gave prerecorded buy money to dana in exchange for two plastic bags of crack cocaine provided by dana accomplice.
on october,walker and cujdik arranged for another controlled purchase at the same location,and observed dana and his accomplice performing additional drug transactions.walker and cujdik set up another controlled buy that afternoon.after obtaining police photographs of dana and omar blaylock to confirm their identities as the men he observed selling drugs,walker filled out an affidavit of probable cause,identifying dana and omar as the people he had observed,and obtained a search warrant for north street and for the other two addresses the informant identified in the initial tip.
on october,andre blaylock was sitting on the steps of north street,and officers reynolds,walker,and liciardello arrested him.according to andre,the officers handcuffed him,threw him on the ground,and beat him,despite the fact that he did not resist,possessed no contraband,and was not the person the police had observed selling drugs with dana.after complaining repeatedly of his injuries,andre was taken to the hospital.after the arrest,the officers filled out an investigation report,which is nearly identical to the affidavit of probable cause,but substitutes andre name for omar throughout the description of what the officers observed prior to arresting andre.
the officers largely agree with andre allegations,but with a few important exceptions.first,according to them,andre was the person they observed selling drugs with dana.the officers believed that that person was omar because of the informant tip and because andre resembled the police photograph of omar.although officer reynolds record check showed that omar was incarcerated at the time,he insists that he believed that the record check had given him erroneous information.
second,the officers dispute andre allegation that they used excessive force in arresting him.according to them,they ordered andre to lie on the ground while they applied handcuffs,andre complied,and no significant force was used.
finally,although andre denies that he possessed any contraband or that the officers confiscated any contraband from him,the officers assert that when andre was in detention,they searched him and seized crack cocaine from his waistband,and that the charges against him were dismissed only because the crack was suppressed.
at the close of discovery,the officers moved for summary judgment on all of andre claims on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court heard argument on the motion and denied it on may.the officers filed a notice of appeal the following day and,on june,the district court filed a memorandum in support of its order,explaining its denial of qualified immunity on the false arrest claim.blaylock reynolds,wl.june.
our jurisdiction to hear this appeal depends on whether we may treat the district court order as a final decision of the district court within the meaning of.under the collateral order doctrine,an interlocutory order of a district court may be treated as a final decision if it conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.johnson jones,d quoting puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d quoting coopers lybrand livesay,d see also mitchell forsyth,d same 
a district court order denying a motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds generally meets the first and third criteria,because qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,and is therefore effectively lost if a case is permitted to go to trial.saucier katz,d mitchell,at.same.the more difficult question is whether and to what extent the appealed order resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action.
in an interlocutory appeal of this type,we lack jurisdiction to review questions of evidence sufficiency.johnson,at.that is,if a district court determines that there is sufficient record evidence to support a set of facts under which there would be no immunity,we must accept that set of facts on interlocutory review.schieber city of,cir citing johnson see also forbes twp.of lower merion,cir when a defendant argues that a trial judge erred in denying a motion because the judge was mistaken as to the facts that are subject to genuine dispute,the defendant argument can not be entertained under the doctrine but must instead await an appeal at the conclusion of the case.once we accept the set of facts that the district court found to be sufficiently supported,however,we may review the district court conclusion that the defendants would not be immune from liability if those facts were proved at trial.see behrens pelletier,d johnson permits petitioner to claim on appeal that all of the conduct which the district court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the qualified immunity standard of objective reasonableness.rivas city of passaic,cir i f a defendant in a constitutional tort case moves for summary judgment based on qualified immunity and the district court denies the motion,we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove but we possess jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.quoting ziccardi city of philadelphia,cir.
thus,for each of andre blaylock claims our jurisdiction to review the district court order denying summary judgment depends on whether the defendants appeal raises pure questions of law or whether it challenges the district court determination of which facts were sufficiently supported by evidence.
in johnson,the supreme court recognized that it is often a difficult endeavor for a court of appeals to try to separate an appealed order reviewable determination that a given set of facts violates clearly established law from its unreviewable determination that an issue of fact is genuine.at.the court suggested that district courts should assist the courts of appeals by stating the facts that they assume when they deny summary judgment,and noted that when the district courts do not do so,a court of appeals may have to undertake a cumbersome review of the record to determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.id.in forbes,we made a supervisory rule to enlist the assistance of the district courts 
we announce a supervisory rule to be followed in all subsequent cases in which a summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity is denied on the ground that material facts are in dispute.so that we can carry out our review without exceeding the limits of our jurisdiction under johnson jones we will henceforth require the district courts to specify those material facts that are and are not subject to genuine dispute and explain their materiality.
at.when presented with an interlocutory appeal in which the district court has not followed that directive,we have remanded for it to do so.see,hamilton leavy,cir applying the forbes rule in the context of absolute immunity and remanding estate of smith marasco,cir remanding for additional findings on the qualified immunity issue and for more specific findings on the actions of the individual defendants.
in this case,the district court did not discuss the excessive force or malicious prosecution claims in its memorandum opinion because it apparently did not understand the defendants to have asserted a qualified immunity defense with respect to those claims.blaylock,wl at at the close of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,claiming failure of proof on all claims and qualified immunity on the false arrest claim.on appeal,the officers insist that they did assert such a defense,and our review of their motion and memorandum of law filed with the district court persuades us that they are correct.although the officers focused most of their briefing on the false arrest claim,they also argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive force and malicious prosecution claims.the transcript of the motion hearing reflects some discussion of those claims,but we are unable to discern from the transcript with any certainty what the district court reasons were for denying the officers motion for summary judgment on them.we will therefore apply the supervisory rule of forbes,and remand so that the district court can address the defendants qualified immunity arguments on andre claims of excessive force and malicious prosecution and,if it rules against the defendants,specify those material facts that are and are not subject to genuine dispute and explain their materiality.forbes,at.
the substance of andre blaylock false arrest claim is that the defendants arrested him without probable cause on that claim,we do have the benefit of the district court analysis in support of its decision to deny the officers motion for summary judgment and we will therefore address it.
the qualified immunity standard is one of objective legal reasonableness.harlow fitzgerald,d.although the question of what facts the arresting officer knows is relevant to the inquiry,his subjective motivation for making the arrest is not.devenpeck alford,d anderson creighton,d harlow,at.accordingly,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity here if a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest andre blaylock in light of clearly established law and the information the arresting officers possessed.hunter bryant,d anderson,at.
as noted above,we lack jurisdiction to review the district court determination of which facts are subject to genuine dispute.the ultimate conclusion of objective legal reasonableness whether,accepting the district court determination of which facts are subject to genuine dispute,a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest andre,is a question of law that we may properly resolve.see wright city of,cir weaver shadoan,cir.
the officers precise position with respect to the false arrest claim is not completely clear,but a fair reading of their brief suggests two officers had probable cause to arrest andre because,even if he had not been involved in selling drugs,they could reasonably have mistaken andre for omar blaylock at the time of the arrest,or could reasonably have mistaken andre for the person they observed selling drugs with dana.to accept either of those propositions would require us to review the district court determination of which facts are subject to genuine dispute which,as we have already emphasized,johnson jones precludes us from doing in an interlocutory appeal.
the defendants first theory presupposes that defendants had knowledge of facts providing a reasonable basis for concluding that omar was dana accomplice,and that the person they arrested was omar.the district court appears to have found that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that officers in defendants position had reason to believe that omar was in prison and,accordingly,could have no reasonable basis for concluding at the time of the arrest that andre was omar blaylock,wl at.if we accept,as we must,that the officers knew that omar was in prison,then it was plainly unreasonable for them to have mistaken andre for omar.to entertain the officers arguments to the contrary would require us to review the district court determination that their knowledge was subject to genuine dispute,which we lack jurisdiction to do under johnson jones.
in support of their second the officers could reasonably have mistaken andre for the person they observed selling drugs with officers assert that they observed a person who looked like omar selling drugs with dana.even if they knew that omar was in prison,they had the informant tip that omar was selling drugs with dana.thus,the officers argue,they could reasonably have surmised that the informant mistook dana accomplice for omar.further,even accepting that andre was not the accomplice,they could have mistaken him for the accomplice because he resembles omar photograph.in other words,because the evidence suggests that both dana accomplice and andre resemble omar,dana accomplice and andre could reasonably have been mistaken for each other.that logic is dubious,but even if we accept it,that would not help the defendants,because the district court determined that the degree of resemblance between andre and omar and between dana accomplice and omar are both facts subject to genuine dispute.see blaylock,wl at.
the defendants resist that conclusion by arguing that the degree of resemblance between andre and dana accomplice is not a historical fact,but is more in the nature of the ultimate conclusion of arguable probable cause,and that we may therefore make an independent determination of whether the officers acted reasonably in arresting andre.the defendants note that the record contains police photographs of both andre and omar and argue that the photographs are undisputed evidence of the similarity in appearance between andre and dana accomplice,and that this court can examine the photographs for itself and hold that the officers had at least arguable probable cause to arrest andre.in support of their argument,they rely principally on gilles davis,cir,in which we made an independent in part on a videotape that was in the the defendant police officer had at least arguable probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for disorderly conduct and was therefore entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.
in gilles,however,we reviewed a district court grant of summary judgment,and we therefore had no reason to consider the limits that and johnson jones place on our jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals in qualified immunity cases.more directly on point,however,is the supreme court recent decision in scott harris,d in scott,a police officer scott pursued a fleeing motorist harris and,after ap
