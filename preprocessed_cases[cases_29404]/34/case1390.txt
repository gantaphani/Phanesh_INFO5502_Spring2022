tyson ditch appeals from an order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed under.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm the order of the district court.
at approximately on february,ten gunshots were fired into the front door of the apartment of dasha yenney,ditch former girlfriend.the police arrived,and,upon investigation,found bullet fragments and a casing from a nine millimeter bullet outside of the apartment.yenney informed the police that she had recently received harassing telephone calls from ditch,and that ditch had been arrested in the past for harassing and physically abusing her.while the police were investigating the crime scene,ditch telephoned yenney.when the police attempted to speak to him,he terminated the call.the police traced the call to ditch brother residence and obtained warrants to search the residence.upon execution of the warrants,the police found ditch asleep in the attic of the residence,and,approximately fifteen feet away from him,a nine millimeter ruger pistol.the police arrested ditch and took him into custody.later,based upon a ballistics analysis,the pennsylvania state police laboratory determined that the bullet fragments and casing retrieved from the crime scene were fired from the same pistol seized from the attic.
on june,ditch appeared without counsel at a preliminary hearing.at the hearing,ditch asked the presiding judge for a continuance in order to seek counsel.he related to the judge that he had made several telephone calls to an attorney,but had not yet received an answer to his calls.the judge denied the request,reasoning only that twenty days had elapsed since the arraignment.after presenting ditch with a waiver of counsel form,which ditch refused to sign,the judge proceeded with the hearing.at the uncounseled hearing,ronald fry,a witness for the commonwealth,identified ditch as the individual he saw leaving the apartment building in the early morning hours of the day of the incident.
at trial fry testified that he made a positive identification of ditch at the preliminary hearing.he also made a positive identification of ditch at trial,but only after he was permitted to leave the witness stand and approach the defense table.he testified that he could not identify ditch from the witness stand because his eyes are.fry further admitted that he was legally blind and was not wearing glasses at the time of the incident.he testified,however,that he did not have any difficulty seeing ditch through his apartment window at the time of the incident,even though his window was located approximately ten or fifteen feet away from yenney apartment door.he testified that the area of the apartment building in which he saw ditch was.
following trial,ditch was convicted by a jury of criminal attempt to commit burglary,reckless endangerment of another person,and unlawful possession of a firearm.he was also convicted of the summary offense of criminal mischief.ditch was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of to fifteen years.on may,the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed ditch convictions,and on december,the pennsylvania supreme court denied ditch petition for allowance of appeal,which was filed nunc pro tunc.
on june,ditch filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the district court under,challenging several aspects of his convictions.the district court denied the petition and found no basis for issuance of a certificate of appealability coa.
on december,this court granted ditch request for a coa with respect to two issues whether the district court erred in denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus as to ditch claim that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel at his preliminary hearing and whether the district court erred in denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus as to ditch claim that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to file a motion to suppress the identification which occurred at the uncounseled preliminary hearing we have jurisdiction to review ditch claims under and.
ditch first argument is that the district court should have granted his habeas petition because he was denied his right to counsel at his preliminary hearing in violation of the sixth amendment of the constitution.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that while ditch was denied counsel at his preliminary hearing,he is not entitled to habeas relief because the constitutional error was harmless.
we begin our analysis by considering ditch claim that he had a right to,but was denied,counsel at his preliminary hearing.in coleman alabama,d,the supreme court held that a defendant was entitled to representation of counsel at his alabama preliminary hearing.the court reasoned that under alabama law a preliminary hearing is a critical stage of the criminal prosecution.id.the court noted that at an alabama preliminary hearing,the accused is discharged or held to answer,as the facts may warrant,and that the hearing seeks to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and serves to protect the accused from groundless prosecutions,among other things.id.at.the court then delineated the advantages of a lawyer assistance at such a hearing 
first,the lawyer skilled examination and of witnesses may expose fatal weaknesses in the state case that may lead the magistrate to refuse to bind the accused over.second,in any event,the skilled interrogation of witnesses by an experienced lawyer can fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in of the state witnesses at the trial,or preserve testimony favorable to the accused of a witness who does not appear at the trial.third,trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the state has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial.fourth,counsel can also be influential at the preliminary hearing in making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric examination or bail.
id.at.in light of the defendant inability to realize these advantages on his own,the court concluded that the defendant was as much entitled to the aid of counsel at the alabama preliminary hearing as at the trial itself.id.
applying the reasoning used in coleman,we conclude that a pennsylvania preliminary hearing is also a critical stage in a criminal prosecution.at a pennsylvania preliminary hearing,the commonwealth may assume charge of the prosecution and recommend to the issuing authority that the defendant be discharged or bound over to the court.see.a.at the hearing,the commonwealth bears the burden of establishing at least a prima facie case that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably the one who committed it.commonwealth oliver,citations omitted.moreover,as in alabama,a principal function of the hearing in pennsylvania is to protect the accused right against an unlawful arrest and detention.id.
because the pennsylvania preliminary hearing is a critical stage of a criminal prosecution,we likewise conclude that ditch was entitled to the assistance of effective counsel at that hearing.see coleman,at.commonwealth carver,it is axiomatic that the preliminary hearing is a critical stage of a criminal proceeding,at which the accused is entitled to the assistance of effective counsel.commonwealth rines,it is,of course,well settled that a defendant is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel at a preliminary hearing.see also commonwealth sawyer,commonwealth redshaw.
based upon the record before us,it is clear that ditch was denied his right to counsel at the preliminary hearing.at the beginning of the hearing,ditch informed the state court judge that he wished to secure representation and requested a continuance to do so,but the judge denied the request,reasoning only that twenty days had elapsed since the arraignment.there is nothing in the record to suggest that ditch waived or forfeited his right to counsel.thus,we conclude that ditch was denied his right to counsel at his preliminary hearing in violation of the sixth amendment.
having concluded that ditch was denied his right to counsel,there remains the question of relief.ditch argues that the denial of counsel warrants automatic vacatur of his conviction.in support,he argues that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage of the prosecution and that at his preliminary hearing a witness made a positive identification of him which was later used against him at trial.for the reasons given below,we conclude that the test to be applied in this case is whether the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing was harmless error.
a denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing does not automatically entitle an accused to vacatur and a new trial.see coleman,at.in coleman,the supreme court found that the defendants were denied their right to counsel at their preliminary hearing,but remanded for a determination of whether the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing was harmless error.id.indeed,coleman stands for the proposition that even though a preliminary hearing may be a critical stage in the criminal process,a denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing does not automatically warrant vacatur.
ditch other argument in support of vacatur is more persuasive,albeit ultimately unavailing.ditch underscores that a witness identification made at the uncounseled preliminary hearing was later used against him at trial.he claims that the lack of counsel under these circumstances infected the entire proceeding and warrants vacatur.see satterwhite texas,d stating that only those sixth amendment violations that pervade the entire proceeding can never be considered harmless emphasis added.
notably,coleman does not address the appropriate relief in a case involving a denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing where evidence obtained from the hearing is later used against the defendant at trial.in coleman,the state trial court prohibited the use at trial of any of the evidence gathered at the uncounseled pretrial proceeding.indeed,in prescribing a harmless error analysis,the coleman court specifically noted that the trial court had scrupulously observed that prohibition.at.citing for comparison the case of white maryland,d.thus,while as a general proposition coleman provides support for application of a harmless error standard in cases involving the denial of counsel at preliminary hearings,we can not rest our conclusion solely on that case.
insofar as evidence obtained from the uncounseled preliminary hearing was later used against ditch at trial,this case resembles white,supra.in white,the defendant admission of guilt entered at a preliminary hearing without counsel was later used against the defendant at trial.at.in white,unlike the case in coleman,the supreme court found structural error and vacated the defendant criminal conviction without a showing of prejudice.id.at.however,as with coleman,this case is factually distinguishable from white,in that the tainted evidence here was a witness positive identification of the accused,not an irreversible admission of guilt.thus,the question of relief presented by the facts of this case is not squarely addressed by either coleman or white.
although neither coleman nor white is apposite,we find solace in another line of supreme court case law which clearly prescribes a harmless error standard in cases involving the admission of evidence at trial of uncounseled pretrial identifications.see gilbert california,d prescribing a harmless error standard to the admission at trial of testimony of an uncounseled pretrial identification moore illinois,d in view of the violation of petitioner sixth and fourteenth amendment right to counsel at the pretrial corporeal identification,and of the prosecution exploitation at trial of evidence derived directly from that violation,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for a determination of whether the failure to exclude that evidence was harmless constitutional error.in both gilbert and moore,the supreme court opined that the ultimate admission of evidence of an identification made at a pretrial proceeding without counsel is subject to a harmless error standard.
since the ultimate admission of evidence of an uncounseled identification is subject to a harmless error standard,we conclude by extension of gilbert and moore,that the underlying denial of counsel is also subject to a harmless error analysis.unlike the irreversible admission of guilt in white,the admission of an uncounseled identification does not necessarily pervade the entire proceeding,satterwhite,at,nor is it necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,sullivan louisiana,d.in sum,based upon the confluence of coleman,gilbert and moore,we hold that the denial of counsel at ditch preliminary hearing is subject to a harmless error standard,even though evidence of the identification made at the hearing was later used against him at trial.
next,we address ditch related contention that even if no structural error occurred,he is entitled to a presumption of prejudice under united states cronic,d.in cronic,the supreme court identified three situations implicating the right to counsel that involved circumstances so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.bell cone,d quoting cronic,at.the cronic court said that the first and m ost obvious situation in which a presumption of prejudice applies is a complete denial of counsel.at.the court explained that a trial would be presumptively unfair where the accused is denied the presence of counsel at a critical stage.id.ditch argues that because he was denied counsel at a critical stage of litigation,he is entitled to an automatic presumption of prejudice under cronic.
ditch argument has some appeal.under an expansive reading of cronic,a denial of counsel at any critical stage,including a preliminary hearing,would warrant a presumption of prejudice.however,we conclude that cronic should be read in a more limited fashion.we agree with the court of appeals for the fourth circuit in united states owen,cir,which case is discussed below,that cronic prescribes a presumption of prejudice only with regard to those critical stages of litigation where a denial of counsel would necessarily undermine the reliability of the entire criminal proceeding.
in owen,the defendant claimed that he was denied his right to counsel at his criminal arraignment and that he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice under cronic.id.at.the owen court disagreed with the defendant claim that he was denied his right to counsel,but indicated that even if he had been denied his right to counsel,he was not entitled to a presumption of prejudice under cronic and the error was harmless.id.at.the court opined that cronic relies on a narrow usage of the phrase critical stage to mean a proceeding at which a denial of counsel would necessarily undermine the reliability of the entire criminal proceeding.id.at.the owen court observed that,in other cases such as coleman,the supreme court has used the phrase critical stage in a broader sense,to refer to all proceedings at which the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches,including those at which the denial of such is subject to harmless error analysis.id.thus,while owen arraignment was a critical stage of litigation at which the right of counsel attaches under coleman,an uncounseled arraignment would not necessarily undermine the entire criminal proceeding requiring a presumption of prejudice under cronic.id.at.accordingly,citing to coleman,the owen court applied a harmless error analysis.id.
like our sister court in owen,we read cronic in a limited fashion.a denial of counsel at any critical stage at which the right to counsel attaches does not require a presumption of prejudice.rather,a presumption of prejudice applies only in cases where the denial of counsel would necessarily undermine the reliability of the entire criminal proceeding.see also hammonds newsome,cir interpreting cronic in a limited fashion takacs engle,cir coleman harmless error analysis remains good law.because we can not conclude that the denial of cou
