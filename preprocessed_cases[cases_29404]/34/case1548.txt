following a jury trial in the western district of north carolina,james ernest lespier was convicted of two offenses arising from the killing of his on the reservation of the eastern band of cherokee indians.count one of the indictment alleged that lespier committed murder,in violation of and count two alleged that he used a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,namely murder,in contravention of c a iii and j.for those convictions,lespier received two consecutive life sentences.
on appeal,lespier challenges the district court denial of judgments of acquittal,two of the court evidentiary rulings,and its decision not to instruct the jury on the offense on count one of murder.as explained below,the court properly denied the acquittals and did not err in its evidentiary rulings.although the court should have instructed on the murder offense,such error was invited by lespier and can not be used to disturb his convictions or sentences.consequently,we affirm.
lespier victim was his mandi smith,with whom he had a son on may,lespier,an enrolled member of the eastern band of cherokee indians,spent the day fishing with his friend bill caley and smith.that evening,lespier hosted a fish fry at his residence,located in indian country within the boundaries of the eastern cherokee reservation.the festivities were disrupted,however,when lespier and smith began arguing,which prompted lespier to give caley a ride home from the party.after returning to his residence,lespier shot smith in the back of the head with a caliber revolver,killing her instantly.
at about on may,lespier called,screaming incomprehensibly but ultimately conveying the message that smith had been shot and was dead.around,police officers responded to the call and encountered lespier as he walked out of his home.lespier was covered in blood,and officers understood little of what he was saying.indeed,the blood on lespier back was so thick that it seemed like it was motor oil,id.at,and the officer who handcuffed lespier got blood all over his uniform and hands,id.at.
after handcuffing lespier,the officers went inside his residence,where they found smith lying on the floor.smith was clad only in her underwear and socks,and one of the socks was rolled down off of her heel.she had blood on and about her head,the front of her body,and her back,and the officers could hear a child screaming upstairs.once they had secured the crime scene,one of the officers retrieved lespier and smith son from an upstairs bedroom,covered the little boy head,and carried him out of the home.
upon examining smith body,the paramedics found a single gunshot wound on the back of her head.there was a large amount of blood under the back of smith head,and her wound was obvious ly an injury that was not survivable.smith skin was also mottled,indicating that the blood had had time to pull away from her skin and pool in other parts of her body or bleed out completely.id.at.in addition,there was a lot of blood around her torso and on the floor.id.based on s wirl marks in the blood that were somewhat dry,it appeared as though the crime scene had been cleaned up.id.at.a caliber revolver was found under smith left leg,and a single oxycodone pill,in a plastic baggie,lay near her right armpit.
several shots appeared to have been fired into the walls of the home and,on the sofa immediately beside smith body,officers discovered an unloaded shotgun with a fresh crack in the wooden stock.while securing the shotgun,a piece of wood broke off the stock.blood had also been deposited on the door frame and doorknob leading into the house,on the deck,and on a set of keys in front of the entertainment center in the living room.
in a closet near the stairwell,officers located a gun safe containing prescription pills and ammunition.according to smith stepfather,frazier price,lespier had shown him two firearms in the safe a couple of days before the shooting.at that time,lespier advised price that h e always kept the firearms locked in the safe when smith was around because she had stolen money and pills from him.finally,in the driveway connected to the home,and jammed up underneath the front end of a car,officers noticed a travel bag with a torn strap.id.at.the bag contained clothing and makeup belonging to smith.
during the investigation,an fbi firearms toolmark examiner tested the revolver and ammunition using ballistics gel.the fbi expert determined that the muzzle of the revolver was between five and fifteen centimeters from smith skin at the time of the fatal gunshot.another fbi expert found gunshot residue on both smith and lespier,indicating that they had each handled or been in close proximity to a weapon being fired.
john davis,who conducted an autopsy of smith body,concurred that the wound inflicted by the revolver was not a contact gunshot wound,but was inflicted from an intermediate distance,that is,somewhere between contact and distant.relevant to the blood found on lespier,davis said that smith heart had stopped beating immediately after she was shot,causing her blood to drain only by gravity,rather than through spurting or pumping.davis explained that an individual who attempted cpr,as lespier would later claim to have done,would not have blood on his front side,because there was no source of bleeding on the front of smith body.in addition,davis stated that the mottled appearance of smith skin would take at least a couple of hours to set in.id.at.finally,davis calculated the trajectory of the gunshot that had killed smith.the shot,which entered the back of her neck three centimeters below the base of the skull and two centimeters left of the midline,inclined from her left to right by ten degrees and upward by thirty degrees.
in addition to the fatal gunshot wound,smith had fresh abrasions on the inside of her right forearm,and a significant localized hematoma on the top of her head.davis opined to the jury that the strap of the travel bag found in the driveway could have caused the abrasions on the inside of smith arm,and that the hematoma found on smith head was fresh and had been inflicted by something flat.
in the hours,days,and months following smith murder,lespier gave the authorities and others several exculpatory versions of the relevant events.because his shifting accounts of what occurred played a central role in lespier prosecution and trial,we briefly summarize such statements,highlighting their inconsistencies.
while still at the scene of smith murder in the early morning hours of may,officer cherie dennis asked lespier to explain what happened,recording his statement hereinafter the first statement.in his first statement,lespier said that,earlier that night,he had tried to take a pill from smith.when he did so,smith seized his revolver and started shooting,leading to her accidental death 
she got mad because i tried to take a pill from her.she took my gun and started shooting all over the house.i tried to tell her please stop,please stop.my little boy started screaming and crying.i keep my gun right inside the little door.it a closet where i keep all my guns.she grabbed my pistol.she had shot like four or five shots left.it went off when we started wrestling back and forth over the gun.we fell on the floor and it went off and she started bleeding,blood,pouring blood,from the back of the head.i tried to tell her to stop.i was laying on the couch when she started shooting.she was shooting above my head.when i grabbed her,i thought her arm with the gun was away from her.when i asked her to stop,she yelled at me,give me my pill back.my son was upstairs.
officer dennis then transported lespier to the police station,where she noticed that that the entire seat of her patrol car was covered in blood.id.at.
at approximately on may less than three hours after the call fbi agent randy cosby arrived at the police station and met with lespier,who was yet covered in blood from head to toe.cosby collected lespier clothing,permitted him to wash,and began to interview him around the second statement.in his second statement,lespier added several new details and revised others.lespier recounted that smith sat down in the recliner in the living room,and that she pointed the revolver at him shortly thereafter.smith then fired off to lespier left side,demanding between shots that lespier return her pill.consistent with his first statement,lespier recounted that he was able to grab hold of smith and struggle with her,and that they fell to the ground,with smith underneath him.id.at.on top of smith,still struggling for the revolver,smith arms went above her head and,as she attempted to kick lespier,the gun discharged,and smith grew still.id.at.lespier then added that he attempted to give smith resuscitation,and called when his efforts were unsuccessful.lespier told cosby that he did not know that the shotgun stock had been cracked,that he kept the shotgun lying on the top of his living room couch,and that he left it unloaded when his son was in the home.lespier gave no indication that the shotgun had been used in the struggle.
after a short break at the police station,detective mary lambert proceeded to interview lespier.lespier began speaking with lambert around,again adding new details and changing others the third statement.though his second statement had lespier and smith struggling briefly on the floor,in his third statement lespier recounted that as they hit the floor,the gun went off.lespier also related that,when he and smith fell,his forearm struck the side of her face,and that he thought he had broken her neck.lespier explained that he then put his finger into the hole in smith neck,adding that the revolver was in smith right hand and that he did not touch it.
at detective lambert suggestion,lespier agreed to reenact his struggle with smith,using lambert body to illustrate how smith may have shot herself.in unsuccessfully attempting to do so,lespier manipulated lambert wrist into a painful position,prompting lambert to stop the reenactment.at that point,lespier got real emotional and asserted again that he and smith went to the floor and the gun went off.in making his third statement,lespier first asserted that he had grabbed the shotgun,and that it may have rolled down the back of the living room couch.
detective lambert then continued her interview,asking lespier to go over his story again,and explaining that she wanted to make sure that she was clear on what he was actually saying.lespier complied making his fourth statement,recounting that smith had embarrassed him at the fish fry by running her mouth and bringing the pill up again.id.at.lespier added that he,smith,and their son took bill caley home after the neighbors had left the fish fry and that,upon returning to the residence,lespier put their son to bed.back downstairs,he and smith discussed getting back together,and,at one point,lespier told smith that she was just mad because her future hubby outdid her again fishing.id.at.lespier elaborated that smith got up and went crazy,brandishing the revolver and telling lespier to give her her pill.id.at.at that point,lespier decided to shoot her in the leg because he was scared.he thought she was going to shoot him.id.at.rather than shoot smith,however,lespier claimed that he slung the shotgun at her,at her leg.id.smith then fired at him and,while he was trying to get the revolver from her,they went to the floor.id.lespier added that smith tried to bite him,and he asked lambert to look for bite marks on his forearm,which she did not find.in his fourth statement,lespier revealed that he must have picked up the revolver,and indicated that he did not think smith was dead.id.though lambert did not ask whether the shotgun had discharged,lespier said that t he shotgun did go off in the house.id.at.
agent cosby then conducted another interview,which began around on may and lasted approximately an hour the fifth statement.lespier account of his struggle with smith changed yet again.in his fifth statement,lespier recounted that he was straddling smith during the struggle,standing over her while she was on her back.while atop smith,lespier grabbed the gun and pulled it toward his chest in an upward motion.during that motion the gun discharged,and she laid there still,unresponsive.id.
for whatever reason,lespier was released from police custody later in the day on may.that evening,he talked to his friend bill caley and,in an entirely new version of the shooting the sixth statement,told caley that smith was standing there with a pistol pointing at him as he came through the door of lespier house after having given caley a ride home.according to his sixth statement,lespier repeatedly asked smith what she was doing,then grabbed the gun,after which they went to wrestling over the gun and they fell and the gun went off.id.
davis completed his autopsy of smith body the following day may,and the inconsistencies identified between davis findings and lespier various exculpatory statements prompted the authorities to charge lespier with murder.lespier turned himself in that day.on june,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging lespier in count one with murder and in count two with the use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.six months later,on december,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment,the operative indictment in this case.count one alleged that lespier had committed murder,and count two realleged that he had used a firearm in relation to a crime of violence 
while in custody awaiting trial,lespier described the shooting of smith to his fellow inmate mitchum turpin.lespier insinuated to turpin that he waited some time after the shooting before calling,and admitted that he left the blood on his face so when they showed up they would be able to see it.
several months prior to the trial,the prosecutors notified lespier lawyers that they intended to present evidence,pursuant to federal rule of evidence b,of lespier prior threats and physical violence against smith.specifically,the prosecutors sought to introduce ten instances of domestic violence and four threats of violence.
lespier opposed the use of any rule b evidence,and the district court considered and ruled on the motion on may,the first day of trial.after consideration of the proffered evidence and the applicable legal principles,the court excluded certain prior bad acts and reserved judgment on others,conditioned on the prosecutors ability to establish a proper foundation.ultimately,the court permitted the evidentiary use of certain threats and physical violence by lespier against smith in the years leading up to her murder.smith sister,tasha,told the jury that she saw lespier shove smith through a glass window,resulting in gashes and cuts on smith back.tasha also described an incident when lespier grabbed a heavy wooden mail holder and turned and threw it at smith,hitting her in the area of the head.in addition,tasha recounted that lespier told her that he hated smith,once going so far as to threaten to put rat poison in her food.id.at.lespier also said to tasha that he could just kill smith,strangle her.id.finally,tasha described a horrifying experience when smith and her son came to stay with tasha after a fight with lespier.lespier called smith repeatedly until,when smith finally answered on speakerphone,lespier threatened to come to tasha house,tie smith to a chair,shoot their son in front of her,and finally shoot smith and then turn the gun on himself.id.at.
smith grandmother,dorothy conner,recounted a violent incident that took place at her home on mother day in.while cooking outside on a grill,conner saw smith run out of the house,pursued by lespier with a knife,while smith carried their son in her arms.bill caley,lespier friend,told the jury that on one occasion,lespier hung up on smith and stated,need to shoot that bitch in the face.the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the rule b evidence could be considered only for the limited purposes of lespier intent and the absence of an accident,that such evidence was not relevant to lespier character,and that the jury could not infer,based on character,that lespier may have committed the acts charged in the indictment 
leading up to trial,on may,lespier notified the government of his intent to call two expert witnesses.first,lespier desired to offer evidence from a human biomechanical expert to present a computer animation depicting the event in question to show the possibility that the event did in fact occur as the defendant described in statements given to law enforcement.second,lespier intended to call an expert in human psychology to offer testimony concerning the alleged inconsistencies in the statements made by the defendant and to offer an opinion as to possible reasons for such alleged inconsistencies.id.at.the government opposed only the psychology expert 
the district court addressed the issue of the psychology expert on the first day of trial,by which time defense counsel had produced a report explaining that the expert testimony would focus on the neurological effects of extended sleep deprivation.after reviewing the report,the court agreed with the government and excluded the psychology expert testimony,ruling that although lespier lawyers could argue for discounting inconsistencies in lespier exculpatory statements,the proposed expert testimony would invade the province of the jury.the jury then heard,over the course of six days,the trial evidence summarized above.
at the conclusion of the prosecution evidence,and again at the close of all the evidence,lespier unsuccessfully sought judgments of acquittal.after denying the renewed acquittal motion,the district court turned to issues relating to jury instructions.lespier opposed an instruction,pertinent to count one,which would permit the jury to convict on the offense of murder.more specifically,his lawyer explained that lespier was not asking for second degree and characterized the proposed instruction as an attempt by the government to change the rules now that they indicted him on first degree.when the court asked if lespier wanted the case to go to the jury on first degree and only first degree,his lawyer again said that t hey charged him,we standing trial for that,and that what we want.id.at.the government argued in favor of a murder instruction,asserting that it was not entirely up to the defendant that both first degree and the lesser included of second degree ought to be submitted and that the court should submit to the jury every lesser included that the evidence supports.id.at.
shortly thereafter,lespier lawyer reiterated his client opposition to a murder instruction,urging the district court to confirm lespier desire in that regard.the court then questioned lespier himself,explaining that his lawyer had informed the court that lespier did not seek for a lesser included offense to be submitted to the jury,which would mean that the jury would decide simply that lespier was either guilty of murder or not guilty,and would not be given the opportunity to convict as to some lesser offense,such as murder or possibly voluntary manslaughter.lespier then confirmed that he had discussed the issue with his counsel,and that it was his personal decision to submit count one to the jury on the murder charge only,opposing any instructions on the offense.before concluding on the point,the court again asked lespier to confirm that it was his own decision to proceed in that manner.lespier responded,yes,sir,your honor,it is.id.at.
after a brief recess,the government renewed its request for a murder instruction,contending that this court unpublished decision in united states silvia supported its position.see cir.july,unpublished.the court rejected silvia,instead interpreting our decision in united states baker,cir,to support the proposition that a trial court may decline a offense instruction requested by the prosecution when the defendant objects.accordingly,the court instructed the jury that it could convict lespier on count one only if it found the elements of murder.
in closing,the prosecution relied extensively on the various conflicting exculpatory statements made by lespier,asserting that lespier did tell you anything he did even tell you the same story,much less something that was believable or truthful.the government set forth its own version of the relevant events,suggesting inferences that the jury could draw from the evidence.the prosecution theorized that smith had attempted to leave lespier residence,making it to the driveway before having her bag ripped from her arm by lespier.lespier then clubbed smith over the head with the shotgun,cracking its stock and causing the deep bruising found by the medical examiner.lespier had retrieved the revolver from the locked safe,and simply executed smith by shooting her at close range in the back of the head.after that,lespier dragged her a little bit and made that sock come up,then got blood all over his back by flipping smith over the shoulder,with blood draining down out of the hole,down his back.id.at.finally,lespier fired multiple shots into the walls of his residence in order to support his fabricated stories.
accepting the prosecution evidence as sufficient,the jury found lespier guilty of both charged offenses,including murder.on march,lespier was sentenced to life imprisonment on each count,to be served consecutively.lespier timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
lespier raises three appellate contentions.first,he challenges the district court denial of judgments of acquittal.second,lespier maintains that the court abused its discretion in permitting the introduction of evidence,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of evidence,of his prior threats and violence against smith,and precluding his psychology expert testimony on the effects of sleep deprivation.finally,in a reversal of his failed trial strategy,lespier now asserts that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could convict on the offense of murder.
we begin with the district court denial of judgments of acquittal,which we review de novo.see united states kellam,cir.when a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,we will sustain a guilty verdict if there is substantial evidence to support it,drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the prosecution.see united states whitfield,cir.
in challenging the district court denial of acquittals,lespier characterizes the evidence as legally insufficient in two respects.first,he maintains that there was no evidence suggesting that he,rather than smith,had pulled the trigger of the revolver.second,lespier asserts that there was no evidence to support the inference that his fatal shooting of smith was a premeditated act.
each of the foregoing contentions is readily refuted.in the light most favorable to the prosecution,the evidence permitted the jury to find ample incriminating facts supporting the two convictions,including the following 
in the past,lespier had physically abused and repeatedly threatened to kill smith 
on the evening of the fatal shooting,smith sought to leave lespier home,proceeding as far as the driveway before a bag containing makeup and clothing was ripped from her arm 
lespier hit smith on the head with the shotgun with sufficient force to crack its stock 
lespier had retrieved the murder weapon,the caliber revolver,from a locked safe 
based on the trajectory of the gunshot that killed smith,a wound was not possible 
lespier had tampered with the crime scene,moving smith body,wiping up her blood,and planting the revolver and a pill near her body 
lespier waited some period of time before calling and 
lespier made multiple false exculpatory statements seeking to explain the relevant events.
predicated on the foregoing,together with the balance of the record,it is clear that the government presented substantial evidence proving that lespier committed murder in the first degree,as alleged in count one.the district court therefore properly denied judgments of acquittal.
next,we consider lespier evidentiary contentions,that the district court erroneously admitted evidence pursuant to rule b and improperly excluded lespier psychology expert.we review those evidentiary rulings under the abuse of discretion standard.see united states rooks,cir.
lespier maintains that the district court erred in its rule b ruling relating to his prior threats an
