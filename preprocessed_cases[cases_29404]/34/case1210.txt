police arrested terrell davis after finding him in a jeep with nearly a kilo of cocaine in the backseat.the arrest led to a conviction for possession with intent to distribute.as evidence that davis recognized the cocaine in the jeep,the government proved at trial that he had two prior convictions for possessing cocaine.yet the government never proved that the cocaine from his past was similar in appearance,quantity,or form.we acknowledge that some of our cases admitting prior criminal acts under federal rule of evidence b have been expansive.but our expansiveness is finite,and this case crosses the line.we will vacate davis conviction and remand.
the events at issue took place on a wintry afternoon over two years ago.two philadelphia police officers were patrolling near market street roughly four miles west of independence hall and the liberty bell.this is a dangerous part of the city where drug deals and robberies are commonplace.officer clifford gilliam parked his patrol car,and officer shawn witherspoon joined him on foot.on the opposite side of the street,the officers spotted a black jeep grand cherokee,later determined to be from enterprise rent a car.inside were two men,terrell davis and jamar blackshear.the jeep engine was running but nothing seemed amiss.
after a period of time,davis and blackshear began to act suspiciously.they reached toward each other with body motions that were consistent with the exchanging of narcotics in a narcotics transaction.the officers exited their patrol car and approached the jeep.upon noticing the officers,davis and blackshear had expressions of shock on their faces,and they tossed something into the backseat.they exited the jeep and quickly walked away so quickly,in fact,that blackshear did not bother closing his door.officer gilliam stopped blackshear and patted him down to search for weapons.he instead found a wad of cash in his pocket.in the meantime,officer witherspoon stopped davis and patted him down.he found a similar amount of cash.
everything indicated to the officers that this was a drug deal the suspicious movements,the hurried departures,the wads of cash,and the neighborhood itself.knowing that guns often accompany drug deals,the officers decided to search the jeep for weapons and to see if there were any other occupants.officer witherspoon tried to look through the tinted rear window,but it was too dark.so he opened the driver door and saw a handgun wedged between the driver seat and the middle console.at that point,the officers arrested davis and blackshear and placed them in the patrol car.
the handgun was not the only item in the jeep.officer witherspoon returned and spotted an opaque shopping bag in the backseat.it was open and contained a white substance.the officers requested a dog,which alerted to the presence of drugs.the officers obtained a warrant and recovered ten cell phones,a pair of binoculars,and two shopping bags with roughly grams of cocaine distributed among nine smaller ziploc bags.the cocaine itself was compressed into the shape of a brick and had a street value over.
davis and blackshear were charged with possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute under a and with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime under c.they were also charged with aiding and abetting under.
davis and blackshear filed a motion to suppress all evidence from the jeep.they argued that because the jeep front driver side window was tinted,the officers could not have seen the alleged reaching,gawking,and so they could not have had any cause for suspicion in the first place.the district court inspected the jeep and discovered that the window was in fact tinted.the court nonetheless denied the suppression motion.it credited the testimony of the officers who said that the window had been on the day of the arrests eight months earlier.it also credited the testimony of an enterprise employee who said that neither enterprise nor the manufacturer had tinted the windows and that since the arrests over fifty people had rented the jeep.
the defendants then pursued separate paths.blackshear pled guilty but reserved the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.he received two consecutive sentences plus four years of supervised release.davis opted for a jury trial.as the trial approached,the government asked permission to introduce davis two prior convictions for possessing cocaine.the district court consented,stating that the convictions were admissible under federal rule of evidence b to show that davis recognized the drugs in the jeep.at trial,the jury heard testimony from a range of witnesses,including officers gilliam and witherspoon keith festus,the owner of a nearby store and a narcotics expert.the jury ultimately found davis guilty of the drug crime but not guilty of the gun crime.he received a sentence plus four years of supervised release.
davis raises four issues on appeal the denial of his suppression motion,the admission of his prior convictions,and two other evidentiary issues 
davis first argument is that the officers illegally stopped him after he exited the jeep.this would make the cocaine inadmissible as the product of an illegal seizure.where a motion to suppress has been denied,we review the order for clear error as to the underlying facts,but exercise plenary review as to its legality in the light of the court properly found facts.united states brownlee,cir quotation marks omitted.the district court rejected davis constitutional argument,and with good reason 
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.the general rule is that a search or seizure is unreasonable if the police lack either probable cause or a courts have created several exceptions to the warrant requirement.see kentucky king,noting that the ultimate touchstone is reasonableness.over the past few decades,the supreme court has created a broad exception to both requirements an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow,citing terry ohio.this exception also allows officers to search the passenger area of a vehicle without probable cause or a warrant if they conduct a lawful stop and reasonably believe that the suspect is dangerous and has a weapon inside.see michigan long.
davis constitutional argument turns on whether the officers had a reasonable suspicion when they first stopped him.and that turns on whether the front driver side window was tinted at the time of the arrests for if it was,the officers could not have seen through it,and they would have lacked any reason to suspect an illicit transaction.though the district court inspected the window at the suppression hearing and saw that it was tinted,the court found that it was not tinted on the day of the arrests eight months earlier.
that finding was not clearly erroneous.for one thing,officers gilliam and witherspoon both testified that the front driver side window,unlike the rear window,was when they saw the jeep.and an enterprise employee testified that neither enterprise nor the manufacturer had tinted the window and that over fifty people had rented the car between the arrests and the hearing.he also said that another renter could have been responsible for the tint.anybody could have put it on.this testimony supports the district court finding.to be sure,the police took a picture of the jeep on the day of the arrests,and the front and rear windows appear to have the same tint.but the picture was taken at night in low lighting.davis also points to a witness who testified at the suppression hearing that the window probably was a little tinted.but the district court found that his testimony was not particularly credible for a number of reasons.
the record thus contains no evidence that plainly contradicts the officers testimony.and when the district court decision is based on testimony that is coherent and plausible,not internally inconsistent and not contradicted by external evidence,there can almost never be a finding of clear error.united states igbonwa,cir.as a result,the district court did not clearly err when it found that the window was.
nor did the district court err in concluding that the officers had a reasonable suspicion to stop davis.the officers observed odd behavior through the front window an exchange,shocked expressions,and tossing motions.davis and blackshear rapidly left the car and began walking away,the latter failing to close the car door.and the activity took place in a area.the officers thus had a reasonable suspicion that a crime might be afoot.see terry,at wardlow,at recognizing presence in a high crime area,unprovoked flight,and nervous,evasive behavior as factors supporting a reasonable suspicion see also united states bonner,cir concluding that flight from a traffic stop creates a reasonable suspicion.
the officers also had authority to search the jeep.the pat downs revealed large wads of cash,suggesting that davis and blackshear were in the middle of a drug deal.because drug dealers often carry guns,the officers had a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that davis and blackshear were dangerous and might have weapons inside the jeep.long,at quotation marks omitted see also united states arvizu.that belief allowed the officers to search the jeep for weapons.during the search,they found something else cocaine in the backseat but they clearly can not be required to ignore the contraband discovered while conducting a legitimate terry search of the interior of the automobile.long,at.for these reasons,we will affirm the denial of davis suppression motion.
davis second argument is that the district court erred in admitting his two prior convictions for possessing cocaine.we review that decision for an abuse of discretion.united states butch,cir noting that a decision is an abuse of discretion if clearly contrary to reason and not justified by the evidence quotation marks omitted.though we have held that some prior drug convictions are admissible under federal rule of evidence of b,we have never held that a possession conviction is admissible to show knowledge or intent in a distribution trial.we decline to do so today.
american courts have long excluded evidence of a person prior bad acts.this tradition reflects a fear that the jury will place too much weight on past crimes and prior misdeeds.i t is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudice one with a bad general record and deny the accused a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.michelson united states,see also richard uviller,evidence of character to prove conduct illusion,illogic,and injustice in the courtroom,a s the special conditions of predictive value coalesce,the potential for prejudice also rises.the risk is that jurors will focus on evidence of prior acts,believing that someone with a criminal record can not change and discounting any evidence to the contrary.
over the past two hundred years,the rule has changed much in form but little in function.in the early days of the common law,courts used an inclusionary approach evidence of prior acts was presumptively admissible unless it was relevant only to the defendant propensity to commit a crime.see julius stone,the rule of exclusion of similar fact evidence america,harv.in the nineteenth century,the rule slowly became exclusionary such evidence was presumptively inadmissible unless the proponent could show that it was relevant to one of several specific purposes,such as motive or intent.see id.at concluding that american courts applied this rule on the mistaken belief that the exclusionary approach was part of the english common law.but that trend faded,and courts began to use different approaches some inclusionary,some exclusionary.see united states long,cir noting the division of authorities.the federal rules of evidence settled the matter in,establishing a uniform inclusionary approach.united states green,cir.yet this change,like the nineteenth century switch from the inclusionary to the exclusionary approach,did not give rise to any significant change in the admissibility of such evidence.kenneth melilli,the character evidence rule revisited.
the modern approach is set forth in federal rule of evidence b.evidence of a crime,wrong,or other act is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.b.that principle seems strict,but evidence may be admissible for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.b.uncontroversial at the time of adoption,rule b has become the most cited evidentiary rule on appeal.see thomas reed,admitting the accused criminal history the trouble with rule b,temp.
the text of rule b has led to a test.evidence is admissible only if it is offered for a proper purpose under rule b relevant to that purpose sufficiently probative under the rule balancing requirement and accompanied by a limiting instruction,if requested.see green,at see also huddleston united states,discussing these four requirements all this really means is that such evidence must have a nonpropensity purpose and satisfy the same relevancy requirements as any other evidence.
and yet the relevancy requirements pose problems of their own in this context.indeed,the problems are in many cases insurmountable.see uviller.at the test of ordinary relevance is often an insuperable barrier.for starters,the evidence must be relevant to a proper purpose,and it must be relevant in a way that avoids any propensity inference.see united states sampson,cir.consider a defendant who has been convicted of manslaughter.in a later assault prosecution,the government might want to use the conviction,perhaps to prove intent.but that use is off limits if the only reason the conviction is relevant to intent is the inference that because the defendant has committed manslaughter before,he must have committed assault now.see id.at.in addition,the conviction must be relevant based on what the factfinder knows about the prior act.so even if the defendant was convicted of intentional manslaughter,the conviction will be relevant to intent only if the jury knows the act was intentional and not reckless or negligent.
that is why the use of evidence requires care from prosecutors and judges alike.in proffering such evidence,the government must explain how it fits into a chain of inferences a chain that connects the evidence to a proper purpose,no link of which is a forbidden propensity inference.id.at.and then the district court,if it admits the evidence,must in the first instance,rather than the appellate court in retrospect,articulate reasons why the evidence also goes to show something other than character.id.at.the reasoning should be detailed and on the record a mere recitation of the purposes in rule b is insufficient unfortunately,these requirements are so often honored in the breach that they resonate about as loudly as the proverbial tree that no one heard fall in the forest.united states givan,cir mckee,dissenting.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that davis convictions for possessing cocaine were inadmissible to prove knowledge or intent in his trial for possessing with intent to distribute.the district court abused its discretion by admitting this evidence,and we will vacate davis conviction.
davis was twice convicted of possessing cocaine under pennsylvania law once in and once in.the government filed a motion to introduce these convictions,advancing a pentad of purposes.this evidence is relevant to prove the defendant plan to,knowledge of,and intent to distribute possess cocaine,and absence of mistake or accident.to its credit,the able district court admitted the convictions as relevant to a single purpose clearly,evidence of his prior convictions for possession of crack cocaine makes it more likely than not that davis knew that the white substance in the plastic bag on the back seat of the jeep was cocaine.the government now argues on appeal that the evidence also was relevant to intent.see appellee br.at.
knowledge and intent are indeed proper purposes under the first part of our rule b test.and t here is no question that,given a proper purpose and reasoning,drug convictions are admissible in a trial where the defendant is charged with a drug offense.sampson,at.we have held,for example,that evidence of past distribution is relevant to prove knowledge of the same or different drug in a later distribution trial,givan,at the evidence that givan had been convicted of distribution of cocaine makes givan knowledge of the presence of the heroin more probable than it would have been without the evidence.united states boone,cir considering the defendant past acts as evidence that he was not an ignorant united states vega,cir e vidence of vega participation in a prior drug conspiracy is probative of his knowledge of,and relationship with a member of,a later drug conspiracy.and we have held that evidence of past distribution is relevant to prove intent to distribute in a later distribution trial,united states lee,cir lee prior drug trafficking conviction was properly admitted as evidence that lee intended to distribute any drugs in his possession.givan,at boone,at.we have even held that evidence of past distribution is relevant to prove knowledge of a different drug in a later possession trial.united states lopez,cir.but we have never held that a possession conviction is relevant to prove either knowledge or intent in a distribution trial,and rightly so.
knowledge.possession and distribution are different in ways that matter something that both the district court and the government failed to appreciate.as to knowledge,one who possesses a drug might not recognize the same drug when prepared for distribution.the packaging or quantity might be different,and objects in greater quantities often have an appearance or smell of their own.take water,which is transparent by the drop but blue in the ocean,or powdered sugar,which is floury on a donut but dense in a bag.in this case,the jury knew only that davis had been twice convicted of possessing cocaine.see appellee br.at.the jury knew nothing of the packaging or quantity that led to those convictions,so it could not have known whether davis past helped him to recognize the nearly one kilogram of cocaine in the jeep.
then there is the problem that the cocaine from davis past might have been in a different form.cocaine is consumable either as a powder or as one of several bases,most often crack.see depierre united states.neither form particularly resembles the other.as its name suggests,powder cocaine is a powder specifically,a salt that can be compressed or loose.see david sklansky,cocaine,race,and equal protection,stan.on the other hand,crack cocaine is hard and waxy and often resembles small rocks or crystals.see id.this distinction matters,and the jury did not know which form davis had possessed back in and.for all the jury knew,the cocaine could have been a dash of powder on a golden tray.it could have been hidden in the lining of a suitcase.or it could have been crack cocaine in crystal form,in liquid form,rolled up in paper,or stuffed in a syringe.in any of those instances,davis past would not have helped him to identify the compressed powder in the backseat.
the two prior convictions thus fail the second part of our rule b test,the relevancy requirement.see.explaining that evidence is relevant if it is probative of a consequential fact.based on the stipulation before it,the jury had no way of knowing whether davis experiences made him any more likely to recognize the cocaine in the backseat.the convictions simply were not probative of davis knowledge.see givan,at mckee,dissenting noting the difficulty when there is absolutely nothing on this record that would allow the jury to make any meaningful or relevant comparison between past and present drugs.at best,the convictions had such limited probative value that they fail the third part of our test,the balancing requirement.see.allowing courts to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.either way,the convictions are inadmissible to prove davis knowledge.
the government nonetheless urges us to follow lopez and givan.in lopez,we held that the defendant participation in a conspiracy was admissible in a possession trial to prove knowledge of heroin,a different drug altogether.lopez,at the conviction was admissible for the purpose of rebutting the defendant anticipated claim of innocent association with,and lack of knowledge of,the heroin found near his bunk.and in givan,we held that the defendant conviction for distributing cocaine was likewise admissible to prove knowledge and intent in a trial.givan,at.these cases are at the outer bounds of admissibility under rule b.see david culberg,note,the accused bad character theory and practice,notre dame,criticizing lopez and givan.at all events,the two cases are distinguishable because the defendants had been convicted of dealing cocaine,and drug dealers presumably have more knowledge of drugs in general.by contrast,a possession conviction does not imply a similar level of knowledge.
intent.nor does a possession conviction imply an intent to distribute.possession and distribution are distinct acts far more people use drugs than sell them and these acts have different purposes and risks.a prior conviction for possessing drugs by no means suggests that the defendant intends to distribute them in the future.acts related to the personal use of a controlled substance are of a wholly different order than acts involving the distribution of a controlled substance.one activity involves the personal abuse of narcotics.united states ono,cir.the other usually involves the implementation of a commercial activity for profit.id.as a result of these differences,davis convictions again fail the second part of our rule b test.
in cases such as this,there is an danger that jurors will infer that the defendant character made him more likely to sell the drugs in his possession.but that is precisely the type of inference that rule b forbids.any other conclusion would run the risk of unraveling the rule 
i f the act of possessing or using marijuana is to be admissible to prove intent to transport and sell marijuana,or,to go even further,to prove intent to transport and sell a different drug,then there is no reason why participation in any crime could not be used to prove intent to engage in any other crime,or why any robbery could not be used to prove the requisite intent with respect to any other robbery.a rule allowing such evidence would eviscerate almost entirely the character evidence rule.
david leonard,the new wigmore.a treatise on evidence evidence of other misconduct and similar events d see also charles alan wright kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure evidence ed.t he routine use of the intent exception under rule b could easily destroy the exclusionary rule.
we join other circuits in declaring that a possession conviction is inadmissible to prove intent to distribute.the sixth circuit,for example,held that possession of a small quantity of crack cocaine for personal use on one occasion sheds no light on whether the defendant intended to distribute crack cocaine in his possession on another occasion nearly five months earlier.united states haywood,cir.the seventh and ninth circuits have suggested likewise.see united states santini,cir holding that prior convictions for simple possession were not similar to the importation of marijuana and thus lack probative value ono,at distinguishing between possession and distribution in dicta united states monzon,cir concluding that evidence of the defendant prior marijuana possession was not probative of his intent to distribute cocaine united states marques,cir distinguishing between personal use versus resale enriquez united states,cir concluding that a trial was unfair because the court had admitted evidence of marijuana possession to show intent to sell heroin.but see united states walsh,cir allowing the admission of a possession conviction in a distribution trial because the conviction involved distribution amounts.other circ
