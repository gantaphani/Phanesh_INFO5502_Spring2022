defendant carlos helped to operate a business that injected clients with liquid silicone and other substances for wrinkle reduction and related cosmetic purposes.the business was fostered by misrepresentations about such matters as the nature of the substances being injected and the attendant health risks.a jury convicted defendant of eight offenses involving the introduction of adulterated devices and new drugs into interstate commerce with intent to defraud and mislead.a d,a.
the district court imposed a prison term.defendant then filed a direct appeal,which we held in abeyance pending a district court ruling on defendant motion for new trial.the denial of that motion prompted a second appeal.having scrutinized defendant various arguments,we affirm in all respects.the pertinent facts are stated in the light most favorable to the government insofar as the defendant attacks the adequacy of the evidence to support a conviction.
from june until march,defendant and a collaborator named sergio lopez operated a business in puerto rico called esthetics international,ei,which was devoted to nonsurgical cosmetic improvements.the primary treatment consisted of injecting liquid silicone into the face and other areas of the body for purposes of wrinkle reduction.defendant and lopez ran ei on the premises of a beauty salon owned by an individual named evelyn valentin.they visited the salon approximately one week per month,often arriving from the dominican republic where they conducted a similar operation.lopez performed the promotional and administrative work and interviewed prospective clients,while defendant purchased and transported all materials and administered the injections.
the scheme involved four separate products.most frequently used was the liquid silicone,which defendant purchased under the brand name silicex from a venezuelan company.he injected some clients with an alternative substance known as karthy swed,which he purchased from a guatemalan company.defendant also used two drugs lignocaine injection bp and.the former was an anaesthetic the latter was used to treat granulomas,which are nodules of hard tissue that can result from silicone injections.defendant carried these substances with him in a handbag to and from the salon.
misrepresentations were made to prospective clients.chief among these were false assurances that defendant and lopez were doctors and that the substances had been approved by the food and drug administration fda and had negligible ei occasionally retained a physician to evaluate prospective clients.but the physician did not supervise defendant when the injections were administered.the silicone was not described as silicone but as a biopolymer,said to be a natural product derived from minerals.the karthy swed was said to be shark cartilage in fact,it was petroleum jelly.
lopez,in charge of recruiting new customers,was the source of most such comments,but defendant also contributed to the deception several witnesses described specific instances where he claimed to be a doctor or denied that silicone was involved.nearly persons ended up being evaluated for possible treatment approximately ended up being injected.between june and march,ei collected payments of almost,often by way of credit cards.
misrepresentations were also made to the government.after encountering problems getting the substances through customs and border protection at the airport,defendant decided that false papers were needed to facilitate that process.at his request,the venezuelan company in its shipment papers stopped describing the silicone as an implant and instead referred to the contents as various capular treatments.also at his request,the guatemalan company created an information sheet that falsely described the karthy swed as a relaxing facial mask for topical use containing cartilage 
in,defendant was indicted along with lopez and valentin for wire fraud.specifically,the three were charged with causing wire communications to be transmitted in interstate commerce as part of a scheme to obtain money by false pretenses.the indictment listed seven instances in which five ei clients identified by their initials made charges to american express credit cards each of the seven counts,in other words,concerned a specific act of wire fraud perpetrated against a specific individual on a specific date.
lopez and valentin pled guilty,while defendant went to trial.in september,after discharging a hung jury,the court granted defendant motion under.c for judgment of acquittal.by way of explanation,it stated that the government has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt the specific intent to defraud in this case.
less than three months later,defendant was indicted on the current charges.the statute in question,the federal food,drug and cosmetic act,bars the introduction into interstate commerce of any adulterated device or new drug see a,d.any such violation is a felony if committed with the intent to defraud or mislead,id.a otherwise,it is a misdemeanor.the indictment charged a conspiracy covering the same time period as the indictment 
the indictment also charged eight substantive violations,five involving the silicone and three involving the other three substances respectively one of the silicone charges was later dismissed.these counts listed the dates on which,and the countries from which,the substances were introduced either from the dominican republic or venezuela.although the indictment included the intent to defraud or mislead element in each count,it did not identify the victim s.
before trial,defendant moved to bar the government from relitigating the issue of intent to defraud.pointing to his earlier acquittal,and citing the doctrine of issue preclusion also known as collateral estoppel,he contended that all evidence pertaining to the fraud issue should be excluded and all counts accordingly reduced to misdemeanors.the government filed an opposition that was perhaps ambiguous it could be read to say that the fraud evidence would be limited to showing defendant efforts to defraud or mislead government agencies but it also suggested that issue preclusion would only bar evidence of fraud pertaining to the five clients listed in the earlier indictment.
the magistrate judge appears to have construed this opposition to mean that defendant was being charged with intent to defraud or mislead only government agencies and officials,not ei clients.largely for this reason,he issued a report and recommendation r r proposing that the motion be denied.but the district judge,in adopting that recommendation,voiced a different interpretation.applying review because of defendant failure to object to the r r,he stated emphasis added 
though no intent to defraud was earlier found under the wire fraud statute as to particular end users clients,the government is entitled to prove under that defendant had the intent to defraud other end users government agencies.
defendant voiced no objection to this declaration.
during the trial,the government offered a smattering of evidence concerning the efforts to mislead customs,but it focused overwhelmingly on the false statements made to the clients other than the five clients listed in the indictment,the same type of misrepresentations concerning the identity and safety of the implants and defendant status as a physician that were presented at the first trial.the government did the same during closing argument,making only a passing reference to the customs matter.
defendant filed no contemporaneous objection to the evidence of fraud on other clients except in one minor respect not pertinent here,stating that he d id have a problem with that.such evidence was received,inter alia,through the testimony of lopez the main government witness,valentin the salon owner who was also a client,and four other clients.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.thereafter,a rule motion for judgment of acquittal was denied after extensive hearings.
the court held eight days of sentencing hearings.the government there put lopez and various ei clients on the stand to establish,inter alia,the number of victims and amount of loss defendant,acting pro se,was allowed to lopez for five days.after filing a direct appeal,defendant submitted a rule motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence which,when ultimately denied,prompted a second appeal,which has been consolidated with the first.
issues involving evidence of defrauding clients.defendant main complaint on appeal is that the government impermissibly altered its theory of the case in midstream.according to defendant,the government told the grand jury and the magistrate judge that the issue was not how the clients were fooled but,rather,how government agencies were defrauded or misled in order to get the products into the country.at trial,however,the government allegedly shifted its focus to the issue of fraud on the clients,the subject of the first trial.this new tack is said to have violated issue preclusion and other constitutional protections.
issue deemed to implicate double jeopardy protection in criminal that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment,that issue can not again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.ashe swenson,d accord,bobby bies,d issue preclusion bars successive litigation of an issue of fact or law that is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and is essential to the judgment.internal quotation marks omitted.an acquittal will thus bar prosecution on new charges if a fact necessarily determined in the prior proceeding is an essential element of those charges.see,united states dray,cir.
while it is often hard to tell whether an issue of ultimate fact was resolved in a defendant favor in an earlier proceeding,no such problem exists here as already noted,the district judge in the trial specifically found that intent to defraud the five listed clients had not been proven.according to defendant,this ruling establishes as a fact that he did not intend to defraud any of the approximately other clients who were injected 
we do not agree that issue preclusion barred the government evidence but,at the outset,put to one side a different government response to the claim.it is true,as the government points out,that the evidence of defendant intent to deceive customs provides an adequate foundation for invoking a felony provision.various courts have held,and defendant does not dispute,that the government can satisfy a by establishing an intent to defraud or mislead a government enforcement agency.see,united states arlen,cir united states bradshaw,cir.
here,the government presented evidence of defendant efforts to deceive customs regarding the nature of the substances being brought into the country.defendant challenges the sufficiency of such evidence but that is a different matter and in any event the evidence was sufficient.nevertheless,that was slight compared to the evidence showing that customers were misled and was lightly touched upon in the government closing argument.
further,if issue preclusion barred the evidence of defrauding of customers,its introduction could have been unduly prejudicial in a case that was based on defrauding only of government officials.and,to top the matter off,the sentence appears to have been driven importantly by evidence that the customers were defrauded.so,while the government reliance on defrauding of the government officials might still pass muster,we think the stronger answer is that issue preclusion did not bar evidence that defrauding of customers occurred other than the five customers already mentioned.
ei clients were recruited and injected individually or in small groups.that defendant did not intend to defraud five of them over a span does not necessarily mean that he lacked such intent with respect to all of the others who were recruited and injected over a span.united states brown,cir holding that,after acquittal of fraud charges involving sale of one condo,collateral estoppel did not bar subsequent fraud prosecution for similar financing scheme involving contemporaneous sale of second condo in same complex 
a crime involving multiple victims could in principle be successively prosecuted in one case after another and,even where collateral estoppel did not apply,successive bites at the apple might,in extreme circumstances,raise concerns about abuse implicating the courts authority under the common law or even constitutional doctrine.but united states dixon,d.in any event,the circumstances here do not appear abusive and defendant is relying upon issue preclusion and not some independent doctrine based solely on due process.
besides his claim,defendant makes a couple of related arguments.first,he says that the government alleged shift as to the victims violated his right to an independent grand jury,produced an indictment that did not adequately notify him of the charges,and amounted to a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance.yet,each of these arguments mistakenly assumes that the indictment needed to identify the defrauded or misled victim s.
the elements of a a violation are a violation of,committed by someone with the intent to defraud or mislead.the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant intended to defraud or mislead someone,but the indictment need not specify the intended victim the focus is on defendant intent,not the victim identity.
arlen,at see also id.at rejecting similar argument that fatal variance had occurred id.at noting that motion for bill of particulars could always be used to gain specifics.
defendant also complains of unfair surprise.given that the district court ruling on the magistrate judge report specifically allowed evidence of fraud on ei clients,and given that defense counsel stated he d id have a problem with that,this claim falls short.defendant may have been unhappy with the trial evidence but it could hardly have come as surprise.
rule motion for judgment of acquittal.in challenging the denial of his motion under.c for judgment of acquittal,defendant makes two preliminary mistakes.first,he relies on new,the testimony provided by lopez at review of sufficiency challenges is confined to evidence presented at trial.united states combs,cir,cert.denied,d united states torres,cir.
second,because of the numerous issues presented and the legal limitations of the brief,he seeks to incorporate by reference the arguments made in his rule motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence again,lopez testimony at sentencing.such a practice has been consistently and roundly condemned,gilday callahan,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and any incorporated argument is ordinarily deemed forfeited,see,sleeper farms agway,cir,even when advanced by a pro se litigant,see,cofield first.trust,wl,at cir,per curiam.
once the new evidence and the incorporated arguments are set aside,little remains.defendant does properly present one argument that lopez ignorance of the nature of the substances being particular,his unawareness that the silicex consisted of that the conspiracy as charged in the indictment never existed.yet lopez testified that he did know from the outset that it was illegal to use the products as implants in the united states.and the government need not show that the conspirators knew all the details of the conspiracy.united states,cir.
beyond this,defendant in his brief refers in skeletal fashion to a trio of other rule contentions.each of these assignments of error can be deemed waived for lack of sustained argument.see,united states zannino,cir.each improperly relies in part on lopez testimony at sentencing.and based on the evidence at trial,each proves meritless.one example will suffice since they are not properly presented and the government brief deals sufficiently with them all.
as to counts involving the introduction of silicone from venezuela,he contends that not even one piece of material evidence was seized in puerto rico,and nobody testified that the product would ever be used to inject anybody in puerto rico.yet lopez testified directly that the silicone used in puerto rico was obtained by defendant from the venezuelan company.shipping documents reveal that the company sent a shipmen
