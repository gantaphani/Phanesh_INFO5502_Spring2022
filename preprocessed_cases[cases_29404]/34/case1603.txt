after lenny ortiz was indicted for two drug trafficking crimes conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of a,he filed a motion to suppress the cocaine discovered in and taken from a secret compartment in his vehicle,alleging that the search of the vehicle violated his fourth amendment rights.the district court granted the motion on the ground that the search exceeded the scope of ortiz consent.
because we conclude that the district court applied the wrong legal standards for determining whether law enforcement officers had consent to search ortiz vehicle and,in any event,whether they had probable cause to search it,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on august,the maryland state police received a tip from the new jersey state police that a white mitsubishi automobile,which was believed to be connected with large volumes of drugs and money in the new jersey area,was heading southbound on i and was approaching the delaware memorial bridge.the new jersey state police described the vehicle,supplied its license plate number,and indicated that the vehicle was suspected of containing drugs and money,based on information given by an informant with whom the new jersey state police were working.the maryland state police circulated the information to its troopers and alerted them to look out for the vehicle.
soon after receiving the dispatch,trooper richard decker spotted the vehicle traveling southbound on i in baltimore county,maryland,traveling miles per hour over the speed limit.trooper decker pulled the vehicle over,which was occupied only by its driver,lenny ortiz,and notified the maryland state police that he had stopped the vehicle.trooper decker was instructed to drag out the traffic stop in order to enable a more experienced officer and a drug dog to arrive at the scene.he was also instructed not to tell ortiz that he was being stopped for anything more than a routine traffic violation.
as trooper decker approached the vehicle,he detected a strong scent of air freshener coming from the vehicle,and as he began speaking with ortiz,he saw several cans of freshener in the vehicle.this contributed to decker suspicion that drugs were indeed in the vehicle because he understood that air fresheners were often used as a masking agent to cover up some types of illegal drugs.
upon decker request,ortiz produced a new york driver license,the vehicle new jersey registration card,and an expired insurance card.as these records revealed that ortiz was not the owner of the vehicle,ortiz explained that he had borrowed it from the owner.when asked for further information,however,ortiz stumbled over the owner name,saying that he only knew her last name.at a later point,he also could not supply the owner telephone number.ortiz appeared very nervous and was also unable to explain his destination.
trooper decker returned to his cruiser to check out ortiz license,warrant status,and criminal history,determining that ortiz driver license was valid,that no warrants were outstanding against him,and that he had no criminal history.while decker was writing a warning ticket,trooper jeremiah gussoni arrived.on his way to the scene,trooper gussoni spoke directly with new jersey state police trooper larry williams,who told gussoni that the mitsubishi had frequently been used to transport contraband,drugs,and money in the new jersey and new york area that the vehicle course heading south on i past the delaware memorial bridge was extremely unorthodox for this vehicle and that he suspected that the vehicle would have drugs or large amounts of currency in it.
upon trooper gussoni request,ortiz stepped out of the vehicle so that gussoni could pat him down and speak with him further.during the conversation,ortiz acknowledged that his license might be suspended in virginia.when asked whether there were any drugs or money inside the vehicle,ortiz said no.trooper gussoni then requested permission to search the vehicle for drugs,and ortiz responded,yes,telling gussoni that he was in no rush,they could take their time,and they were free to search his vehicle.during this conversation,trooper gussoni observed that ortiz was scared to death.the officers did not,however,search the vehicle at that point because they had not yet completed the traffic stop.as they later explained at the suppression hearing,maryland state police policy requires the troopers to secure consent after completing the traffic stop and telling the suspect he is free to leave.nonetheless,decker and gussoni determined that they would not let ortiz leave before properly searching the vehicle,a determination that they did not share with ortiz.
trooper decker completed writing a warning ticket and handed it to ortiz,along with ortiz other papers,telling him he was free to leave and shaking his hand.decker then expressed his concern to ortiz that the vehicle might be stolen and asked whether he could look around for signs of tampering or theft.when ortiz responded,sure,sure,trooper decker asked further,are you sure you do mind ortiz replied,i stand right here and wait.
troopers decker and gussoni then searched the vehicle while ortiz stood a short distance away,speaking with a third officer from the maryland department of transportation who had responded to the alert,and he never objected to any of the actions pursued by the troopers during the course of their search.the troopers later explained that in conducting their search they were looking for signs of tampering or theft such as a popped ignition,a shaved key,wires,tools such as screwdrivers or bolts,broken windows,and damage to exterior locks.they were also looking for the concealed vehicle identification number vin,which is located in a different spot for each make,model,and year of vehicle,to compare it with the openly displayed vin on the dash of the vehicle,because it was common for automobile thieves to alter or replace the openly displayed vin.two minutes into the search,trooper gussoni lifted up the back seat in his effort to locate the concealed vin,and under the seat,he observed a hidden compartment.when the officers opened the compartment,they uncovered six kilograms of cocaine.ortiz was then placed under arrest.
the time that elapsed between when ortiz was first pulled over and when he was arrested was approximately minutes.
after ortiz was indicted for drug trafficking,he filed a motion to suppress the cocaine,arguing that the search of his vehicle violated his fourth amendment rights because whatever consent he gave was tainted by the unreasonable length of the traffic stop,and the search exceeded the scope of the consent he gave and therefore violated the general rule that officers must acquire a warrant before conducting the search.
the district court concluded that the maryland state troopers exceeded the scope of consent given to them by ortiz and,for that reason,granted ortiz motion to suppress,entering its order on january.in reaching its decision,the court concluded that the length of the detention was not unreasonable and therefore not violative of the fourth amendment that the maryland state police had reasonable suspicion that drugs were in the vehicle,but not probable cause that ortiz gave consent to search for drugs before the traffic stop was completed but that the troopers could not,under maryland state police policy,rely on that consent because it was given before completion of the traffic stop that ortiz gave his consent a second time to search the vehicle,but this time to make sure the vehicle was not stolen and that because persons generally are not aware that a concealed vin could be under the back seat of the vehicle,ortiz did not authorize the troopers to lift up the back seat to search for the concealed vin.accordingly,the court concluded that in removing the back seat,trooper gussoni violated ortiz fourth amendment rights and that the subsequent seizure of the cocaine was therefore illegal.
the government filed this appeal from the district court order.
to justify the maryland state police search of ortiz vehicle and the seizure of the cocaine found there,the government contends that ortiz voluntarily gave his consent to search the vehicle for drugs,a consent that he never withdrew,and that nothing in the events following his consent justified an inference that this consent was withdrawn that ortiz also voluntarily consented to a search of his vehicle for evidence of tampering or theft,which reasonably included authorization to search for the concealed vin to confirm that the displayed vin was not altered and for other evidence outside the vehicle main compartment and that the troopers in any event had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained contraband and therefore could be searched.
ortiz concedes that trooper decker had an adequate justification to pull him over for driving miles per hour over the speed limit.he asserts,however,that the traffic stop became unconstitutional because trooper decker extended it longer than would have been necessary to complete the traffic stop.ortiz argues that the officers unnecessarily prolonged and manipulated the traffic stop in order to search for drugs,and that this deceptive conduct nullified the legal effect of any consent that ortiz gave to search the vehicle.alternatively,he argues that the search as conducted went beyond the scope of his consent because the officers were searching for drugs rather than signs of auto theft or tampering.finally,ortiz argues summarily that the maryland state police did not have either a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot or probable cause to believe that contraband was in the vehicle.
the applicable legal principles are well established.the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and provides that no warrant shall issue,but upon probable cause.const.amend.iv.although law enforcement officers may stop a vehicle that they observe is violating a traffic law a stop that amounts to a seizure for purposes of the fourth amendment,see terry ohio,the officers may not detain the vehicle for longer than necessary to accomplish the purposes of the stop,illinois caballes.any detention longer than reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the stop must be justified by at least a reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity.see united states sokolow,united states mason,cir united states foreman,cir.a reasonable suspicion is demonstrated when an officer is able to point to specific and articulable facts which,taken together with rational inferences from those facts,evince more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch of criminal activity.united states branch,cir quoting terry,at internal citations omitted.when an officer has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,he may detain the suspect so as to permit the officer to allay the suspicion.mason,at.
of course,if the officer has probable cause to believe that a search of the vehicle would uncover contraband,he may search the vehicle,see united states ross,carroll united states,and if he has probable cause to believe that the suspect has committed a crime,he may arrest him,herring united states.probable cause is a flexible standard that simply requires a reasonable ground for belief of guilt and more than bare suspicion.brinegar united states.and a standard requiring only a reasonable ground for belief of guilt requires less of a showing than does the formal standard.see illinois.gates,standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence,useful in formal trials,have no place in the magistrate decision,because probable cause is only the probability,and not a prima facie showing,of criminal activity see also united states humphries,cir t he standard does not require that the officer belief be more likely true than false.
a suspect consent to search provides an exception to the fourth amendment warrant and probable cause requirements.see florida jimeno.once a defendant voluntarily gives consent,a search that falls within the scope of that consent is constitutionally permissible.see schneckloth bustamonte.moreover,any consent given is valid until it is withdrawn by the defendant.united states lattimore,cir en banc.
these principles govern the proper disposition of this case,and we begin with the question of whether the maryland state police had probable cause to search ortiz vehicle.
in the district court,the government argued that the maryland state police indeed had probable cause to believe that ortiz vehicle contained contraband.the government pointed to a communication from the new jersey state police,stating,white mitz.montero nj heading sb i cds n.the communication also provided the telephone number of new jersey state trooper larry williams,with whom maryland state trooper gussoni spoke after the mitsubishi was discovered traveling southbound on i in baltimore county.trooper williams told gussoni that the mitsubishi was being utilized to transport drugs money,as discovered in connection with a narcotics investigation he was handling with the drug enforcement agency.williams advised that,based on information received from an informant,the vehicle was usually transporting the drugs money in northern new jersey and southern new york.williams indicated that he had arranged for a silent alert,which would call on law enforcement officers to let trooper williams know if they spotted the vehicle so that he could continue to trace its movements.finally trooper williams advised that he had received contact from another new jersey state trooper who observed the mitsubishi heading southbound on i and approaching the delaware memorial bridge.trooper williams indicated that this course of travel was unusual based on trooper williams investigation.the government argued that all of this information,coupled with the information developed by the maryland state police after they stopped ortiz,provided them with probable cause to believe that contraband was in the vehicle.the maryland state police observed the overwhelming odor of air fresheners coming from ortiz vehicle and the presence of multiple air fresheners in the vehicle ortiz uncertainty about the ownership of the vehicle ortiz uncertainty and confusion about his destination and his nervousness.taken as a whole,the government maintained that this evidence constituted probable cause which would justify a search of the vehicle even had ortiz not consented.
the district court found the facts as they were presented by the government and concluded that they gave rise to reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot but could not be said to constitute probable cause.the court explained 
if one were to write on a clean slate this combination of factors might be considered as justifying the search of a vehicle being driven on a public roadway,where the expectation of privacy may well be deemed to be less than the expectation of privacy to which one is entitled in a private home.
perhaps what is needed is the formulation of a new test for assessing the constitutionality of the search of a vehicle on a public roadway,something between reasonable suspicion and probable cause.one does not need to look far to find the test that arguably should be applied.it is known to every lawyer and judge and is found in the more likely than not instruction concerning the preponderance of the evidence standard that is routinely given in most civil cases.application of that test here would render the search of the vehicle that the defendant was driving compliant with the fourth amendment because the troopers were certainly in possession of information that made i t more likely than not that drugs were located within the vehicle.
emphasis added.thus,the district court assumed that the reasonable suspicion standard was a less demanding standard than the preponderance standard and that the preponderance standard was a less demanding standard than the probable cause standard.on that assumption,the court concluded that the maryland state troopers had,by a preponderance of evidence,justified their belief that contraband was in the vehicle,but that the preponderance standard was insufficient to establish
