carvajal and his brother managed a currency counterfeiting fruits of which they used to purchase crack an apartment complex located on street in new york city.the two brothers lived in one apartment several of their associates slept in the other.upon learning about the criminal activity from a confidential informant,the united states secret service obtained a warrant for carvajal arrest and search warrants for the two apartments.the search warrants authorized the secret service to confiscate any counterfeit currency,computers and printers used to create counterfeit currency,crack cocaine,and drug paraphernalia found in the apartments.an attached affidavit,authored by a member of the counterfeiting squad for the secret service,indicated that carvajal kept three firearms in his apartment.
at six in the morning,twenty secret service agents simultaneously executed the search warrants and arrest warrant at the two apartments.following their arrival at the apartment building,the agents split into two teams and dispersed to the sixth and tenth floors.the ten agents assigned to carvajal apartment huddled in the hallway around his door and prepared for entry.an attempt to slide a fiberoptic scope under the apartment door did not yield any information,prompting the supervising agent to radio the signal to execute the warrant.one agent pounded on the door to carvajal apartment and yelled police receiving no response within five seconds,the agents brought out their battering ram,struck the door three times,and breached the entrance.as they fanned out inside the apartment,carvajal brother ran toward the agents holding a firearm.two agents responded with gunshots to the brother head and.an agent standing outside the apartment building,hearing the gunshots,looked up and watched as a computer printer and handgun fell from the apartment window.the secret service collected the printer and handgun from the courtyard behind the apartment,as well as drug paraphernalia and printing supplies from within the apartment.
the government indicted carvajal on ten counts arising out of his counterfeiting and crack cocaine scheme.prior to trial,carvajal sought to suppress the evidence obtained during the search,alleging the government obtained the evidence in violation of the fourth amendment and.he did not dispute the fact that the agents knocked on his door and identified themselves as the police,but argued the unreasonableness of the agents pause.at the suppression hearing,the district court rendered an oral judgment denying carvajal motion 
the simultaneous execution of the warrants on two neighboring apartments,the ease of communication by cell phones and other means,and the ability to destroy evidence,at least major parts of the evidence,by discarding them out the window in an area where others may also be involved with narcotics,and the kinds of contraband make it important for speedy and efficient execution of the warrant.
even at in the morning,the kinds of loud knocking that occurred and noise of the battering that occurred would have caused occupants within,if they had a reasonable belief of their own propriety,to say,stop,i answer the door,do break in the door,i coming,or anything like that.there was no such mention of anything of this,and the officers,i hold,were looking and listening for such evidence,and accordingly,they were justified in ramming down the door.
carvajal proceeded to trial,where he was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to make and distribute counterfeit currency,four counts of passing counterfeit currency,and one count of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.he was found not guilty of distributing crack cocaine,of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime,of illegally possessing a firearm,and of destroying evidence to avoid its seizure.this appeal followed.
the government and carvajal dispute the propriety of the agents actions under the fourth amendment and.whether such a violation occurred,however,is irrelevant the exclusionary rule has no application when a defendant alleges a violation of the rule under either the fourth amendment or.as a result,the district court properly admitted evidence obtained during the search of carvajal apartment.
the fourth amendment principle and share the same common law roots,overlap in scope,and protect the same interests,which necessitates similar results in terms of the exclusionary rule application.section authorizes federal officers to break open doors or windows for entry or exit in certain circumstances 
the officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house,or any part of a house,or anything therein,to execute a search warrant,if,after notice of his authority and purpose,he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.
although first codified in,see act of june,ch,tit.xi,stat,f rom earliest days,the common law drastically limited the authority of law officers to break the door of a house to effect an arrest.miller united states,d footnote omitted.by enacting,congress codified this common law tradition,thereby demonstrating its reverence of the law for the individual right of privacy in his house.id.at.the fourth amendment,the scope of which is established,at least in part,by reference to the traditional protections afforded by the common law,likewise incorporates this principle the framers of the fourth amendment thought that the method of an officer entry into a dwelling was among the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure.wilson,at.accordingly,under the fourth amendment and,e very householder,the good and the bad,the guilty and the innocent,is entitled to the protection designed to secure the common interest against unlawful invasion of the house.miller,at.
law enforcement officers who execute a search warrant at a residence generally must give notice of their authority and provide the occupant a reasonable opportunity to respond before entering.wilson arkansas,d.the fourth amendment inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding a search incorporates this principle the method of an officer entry into a dwelling is among the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search or seizure.id.although suppression provides a potent deterrent for any number of unreasonable searches and seizures under the fourth amendment,the supreme court in hudson,d,concluded that a police officer violation of the fourth amendment rule does not require suppression of the evidence obtained in the ensuing search.
hudson involved a conceded violation of the fourth amendment where state police officers executing a search warrant announced their presence upon arrival,but entered three to five seconds later without permission from the occupant.id.at.in holding that the officers violation of the rule did not mandate suppression,the court reasoned that,w hether that preliminary misstep had occurred or not,the police would have executed the warrant they had obtained,and would have discovered the gun and drugs inside the house.id.at emphasis in original.in other words,th
