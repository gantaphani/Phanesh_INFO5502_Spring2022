ronald charles appeals from his conviction for assault on a federal officer in violation of after a jury trial in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.he makes two claims that the district court erred in allowing the admission of evidence related to charles possession of drugs and that the district court erred in allowing the government case agent,who was allegedly also a victim of the assault,to sit at the government counsel table.
background and facts 
we state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,consistent with record support.united states noah,cir.on august,two agents from the drug enforcement agency dea,john barron and jonathan shankweiler,were conducting surveillance of an individual in springfield,massachusetts.driving separately in unmarked cars,they lost the targeted car.the two agents pulled into a parking lot at a walgreens,where they waited,hoping the target would reappear.the area,mason square,was known by the agents as a site of and violent crime.while the agents waited,they observed several people in a time span pull up in vehicles,park,signal to one another,get out,and walk across the four lanes of the street to the river inn motel.the individuals would return to their cars within a minute to a minute and a half and drive away.barron surmised that retail drug dealing was in progress.
deciding to investigate,the agents drove to the river inn motel,where they parked.as the agents were operating undercover,they were wearing polo shirts and jeans,but had guns and badges at their waists.the agents saw two men on the balcony taking a real hard look at the agents as they were pulling into the parking lot.barron told his partner to cover his badge,which both agents did with their shirts.barron entered the building stairwell first,followed by shankweiler.once they were inside,the agents tucked their shirts back in to make the badges and guns clearly visible.
charles was standing on the landing of the stairwell.he had a plastic baggie in his hands,and he was concentrating very intently on it.barron concluded the baggie was consistent with crack cocaine packaged in a retail distribution amount.charles was trying to tie the baggie h e was just really,really concentrating on it and did not see barron until the agent was about four to six feet away.barron concluded at that point that there was probable cause to arrest charles,so barron announced,stop.police.charles,however,looked at the agents and ran away from them,up the stairs to his left.barron reached for charles shirt and arm and told him,stop.police,several times.charles then changed direction and tried to come back down the stairs between the agents and in so doing pulled them over the landing.the agents spent about a minute in the stairwell trying to gain control of charles,who was flailing his arms,flailing his feet,trying to pull the agents down the stairs.he was using the railing with one arm trying to pull away from the agents,whacking their arms,chest,head,torso,whatever he could with his arms flailing trying to get away.charles managed to make contact with most of the agents upper bodies,arms,shoulders,and heads.shankweiler also yelled,stop.police,multiple times.barron struck charles on the arms,leg,neck,and face during the struggle,trying to make him release the railing.charles dropped the baggie he had been trying to tie.the agents eventually got a little bit more control of charles and brought him from the stairs onto the landing,although charles was still fighting.the three spilled out to the doorway to the left in the hallway,where charles continued to resist.
once the struggle had moved into the hallway,bystanders began gathering and were starting to be pretty verbally abusive to the agents.charles was yelling,help me.help me.these guys are hurting me.the agents said police several times in the hallway.they started to get control of charles,when he suddenly jumped back up.barron testified that as charles came back up,one of his hands reached up and grabbed me and my side,on the side i hold my firearm.barron explained his fear my concern was that if the gun came out,myself,my partner,possibly charles,if my partner observed that gun,would be killed.as a result of this concern,barron dealt charles a blow with his knee,which broke charles nose.charles let go of the holster and then rolled on the ground with his hands underneath him,refusing to comply with the agents orders to show his hands.shankweiler,concerned that charles might have a gun in his waistband,sought to reach charles hands.
the struggle lasted about seven minutes.once charles was sufficiently under control,shankweiler left to search for the baggie charles had dropped but was unable to find it.shankweiler called the springfield police for help since charles was still struggling to get up.the police arrived they first helped to control the crowd and then assisted the agents in handcuffing charles.at trial,the government played for the jury a motel video surveillance tape taken during the events the initial encounter in the stairwell was not,however,visible in the video.
springfield police took charles to the police station,where shankweiler and dea special agent james clifford read charles the miranda warnings.when shankweiler asked charles,do you understand,after the warnings,charles said,what the agents did was uncalled for.i was just resisting.
in the process of booking charles,police found in his pocket a plastic baggie,which contained traces of crack cocaine.charles was subsequently transported to the hospital for treatment of his nose.the next day,barron awoke with a decent size bruise on his arm.
on july,a federal grand jury returned a superceding indictment charging charles with two counts of assault on a federal officer,in violation of one count of assault with physical contact and bodily injury of barron,see b,and one count of assault with physical contact of shankweiler,see a.on july,the government filed a motion in limine to admit evidence the plastic baggie seized from charles pursuant to.b.the district court granted the motion by endorsed order over charles objection,stating at the hearing on the motion 
if charles had drugs on him,that is an explanation for why he would be fighting to not be taken into custody.and so it seems to me that the issue of whether charles was in possession of drugs at the time comes into the case to allow the government to argue that this fellow was not defending himself from any assault.he has a bag in his possession which had cocaine residue in it,and that shows that he was doing exactly what the officer said he was doing,and,b,it also shows that he was defending himself 
so i do unhappy with the idea of putting the bag in because there is a risk that the jurors will say,well,this guy is a jerk.he selling drugs.the heck with him.we find him guilty of anything the government wants us to find him guilty of because he a bad person and he selling drugs,and that not a proper use of the evidence.
but on the other hand,there is a quite proper use of the evidence for the government to show what was really going on here and was this really likely to have been simply a case of some police officers attacking someone or was it a case of an individual who was caught and was doing everything he could do to tear himself out of the grasp of the officers and bolt out of there 
the court disagreed with charles claim that unfair prejudice outweighed probative value,saying i think the unfair prejudice is fairly minimal and i think the probative value is fairly great.the court subsequently gave a detailed limiting instruction when the government introduced the baggie at trial 
charles is not charged with any offense at all.
i only letting the evidence with regard to what the government perceived was going on that evening to come before you to give you context as to what was going on,and you may use the evidence to the extent that you find it helpful in determining the issues relating to the assault charges.
but the mere fact that the defendant was involved in some kind of drug distribution,if he was,does not necessarily mean that he assaulted the officers.and you should not assume simply because you may find that he was involved in this activity that he necessarily committed the assaults 
i do believe that it appropriate for you to have an idea of what the context was at least as the government perceives it and so you may consider the evidence solely for that purpose and that the reason that i allowing this evidence to be put before you.
charles also objected pretrial to barron sitting at the counsel table during trial in his role as case agent and asked the district court to sequester him like any other witness.the government stated that it would put barron on the stand first and then ask him to remain at counsel table.the court considered the issue and ruled on august,that barron could sit at counsel table.the court stated 
there was one issue with regard to special agent barron who the case agent.i do see any prejudice with having him sit at counsel table especially if he going to be testifying first.he was here for the entire suppression hearing.he heard testimony.he familiar with the case.
i just do see any prejudice.the defendant will be here in the courtroom.i think there some balance there.so i going to deny defendant motion to sequester the case agent,special agent barron.all other witnesses in the case will remain outside the courtroom until it time for them to testify.
during the voir dire,the court questioned the potential jurors about possible bias in favor of law enforcement witnesses.the court instructed the potential jurors that you should not give the law enforcement officer testimony any more weight or any less weight just because the person happens to be a law enforcement officer.the judge later reiterated similar instructions about the importance of treating government agent testimony in the same manner as the testimony of others before the jury left for deliberations.a jury trial began on august.
at trial,charles defended himself on the theory that he was surprised by two unidentified white men in the stairwell of the river inn motel and defended himself against an assault by these two men.charles put on three witnesses.hermant patel,the hotel manager,testified that the agents walked by his office before entering the motel stairwell.when he asked the officers if he could help them,they showed him their badges.patel did not see any of the struggle from his office,but he heard loud,indistinct talking.
amber stone,a friend of charles,also testified.she lived at the motel and was sitting on a balcony during the incident.she observed the agents arrive in the parking lot.while she did not see firearms or badges,she testified that i t was obvious they were police because she had seen them there at the river inn about every day so they looked like police to her.she added,i know that ronald charles already knew that they were police.stone did not see the encounter in the stairwell or hear the agents identify themselves until later,but she did see charles on the hallway.she testified that one of the officers hit charles with a fist or elbow,and charles was just standing there.
charles aunt,ulcinea vaz,also testified.she was living on the third floor of the river inn motel and was in her room on the day in question.she did not see the stairwell encounter,but she heard a whole bunch of noise and heard ronald charles yelling,auntie chumby,help me.she went down a flight of stairs and saw two police officers beating up ronald charles.she knew they were police.she testified that when she asked them why they were fighting with charles,the agents replied,because we are trying to get some drugs.she said the agents told her charles was resisting arrest,and she replied,how could he resist arrest and both of you are on him she testified she was not sure whether she saw the agents firearms and badges.
the court instructed the jury not only on the charges in the indictment but also on the lesser included offenses of assault with physical contact or simple assault.the elements of the charged crime included the requirement that at the time of the assault the agents were engaged in the performance of their official duties as special agent s of the drug enforcement administration.the court also instructed the jury on 
if the defendant knew of the official identity or purpose of john barron,and barron used only reasonable force to carry out his purpose,then the defendant has no valid claim of.a person has no right to resist arrest,even if it turns out that the arrest was unlawful,if the person is aware of the official identity and purpose of the arresting officer and the officer does not use unreasonable force.
if,on the other hand,you find that the defendant had no knowledge of the official identity or purpose of john barron,and that the defendant reasonably believed that he was the subject of a hostile and imminent attack against his person by john barron,then the defendant was entitled to use reasonable force to defend himself.
the court instructed that the burden was on the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in.
charles argued to the jury that he was acting in and that the officers used unreasonable force.he argued that the officers were not performing their official duties but were on a lark of their own.he attacked the agents investigative procedures and credibility and argued that the only one to have seen charles with the baggie of crack was agent barron.he also argued that barron bruise did not constitute a bodily injury.
the jury returned its verdict on august,finding charles guilty of two counts involving physical contact against the officers in violation of a.it found him not guilty of the greater offense of assault resulting in bodily injury.on february,the court entered judgment,sentencing charles as a career offender to months in prison and three years supervised release.charles does not contest his sentence as such.
discussion 
on appeal,charles argues that the district court erred in allowing into evidence the testimony and evidence concerning his possession of drugs,on the grounds that the evidence was not relevant and was excessively prejudicial.the government responds that the evidence was admissible as part of the narrative of the incident and was relevant both to establish the charged offenses and to assess charles contention that he was acting in,unaware that the agents were law enforcement agents.the government further argues that the court limiting instruction adequately addressed the risk of unfair prejudice.
charles argues additionally that it was a violation of both.and his constitutional right to due process to allow barron,the case agent and victim in the case,to sit at counsel table with the government attorney.the government responds that there was no error because rule permits a case agent to sit at counsel table,and crime victims have a statutory right not to be excluded from the courtroom.further,charles can not show that he was prejudiced by barron presence because barron testified first,the court instructed the jury that law enforcement testimony should not receive special deference,and the government did not use barron to make an improper appeal to emotion.
we affirm charles conviction.
admissibility of evidence relating to drug use 
this court reviews preserved challenges to a district court evidentiary rulings regarding relevance and unfair prejudice for abuse of discretion.united states richardson,cir.our review of the admission of testimony not objected to at trial is for plain error.united states medina,cir.
here,barron testimony that before the arrest he saw charles concentrating upon and trying to tie a baggie consistent with crack cocaine packaged in a retail distribution amount was not objected to,hence its admission is reviewable on appeal only for plain error.evidence that,subsequently,after the arrest,charles was found to possess a baggie with traces of crack cocaine was objected to.hence we review the admission of the later evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.because,however,both pieces of evidence clear the discretionary hurdle,we need not tarry over the easier questi
