robert perkins is currently serving a sentence in state prison for his conviction on charges related to the armed robbery,kidnapping and wounding of james martin in.based on a certificate of appealability coa,perkins now appeals to this court from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
evidence offered by the state at perkins original trial indicated that perkins and his brother michael restrained and robbed martin after martin came to the perkins house to visit perkins sister vanessa martin had earlier shown vanessa a cash settlement of roughly he had received the previous summer as the result of a car accident.perkins and his brother then drove martin to his parents home where martin also lived restrained his parents and stole jewelry,cash,and other valuables from the residence and finally drove martin to a desolate stretch of road,where they shot him several times before fleeing.
although wounded,martin made his way to the steps of a nearby house,and the police were called.once they arrived,the police asked martin what had happened and who was involved.martin initially hesitated before identifying his assailants,asking the police to protect his family when the police agreed to do this,martin identified robert and michael perkins as the ones who had shot him.martin was then transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital,during which time he was accompanied by one of the responding officers.en route and at the hospital,martin repeated his identification of robert and michael perkins,and he later told police that a third person,hassan parham,was also involved in the crime.
the case went to trial in state court in february.the prosecution relied principally on martin testimony including his identification of the perkins brothers as the men who had kidnaped,robbed and shot him.no other witnesses testified against perkins,and no identifiable fingerprints or other physical evidence was offered by the state.although martin parents were robbed by the same individuals who kidnaped martin,the assailants had put on masks by the time they entered the house and were not identifiable by martin parents.
at trial,the defendants challenged martin credibility.martin admitted that he had sold drugs to robert and michael perkins on multiple occasions,and in addition martin had been arrested for trafficking cocaine and illegally possessing a firearm five days before the trial and also faced charges in connection with a march arrest for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.the defendants suggested that he was testifying falsely so as to curry favorable treatment with respect to these charges martin denied this and,when questioned by the prosecutor,countered the suggestion as follows 
q at any time have you talked to any member of the district attorney office in regards to any of your pending cases 
a no,i have.
q in regards to the cambridge assault and battery offense,did you ever speak to anyone in the district attorney office in regards to that particular case 
q and,in regards to the case that you just recently have been charged with on january of,have you ever spoken to anyone in the district attorney office about that pending case or any 
a no,i have not.
q are you here to testify because you required to or as a result of what happened to you on that day 
a yes,i am.
q and is there any other reason why you are here 
a because he perkins shot me and tried to kill me.that why.
during redirect,martin was again asked by the prosecutor whether anyone had offered him any promises,rewards,or inducements to testify,and he responded,no.
at the trial conclusion,the jury found perkins and his brother michael guilty on all counts but acquitted parham,the third and.perkins conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in september.commonwealth perkins.he filed several motions for a new trial in state court thereafter,each of which was denied failing to obtain relief there,perkins eventually brought a federal habeas proceeding in federal district court.
the federal case had its origin in allegations originally made in perkins second motion for a new trial.there perkins asserted that martin had been induced to testify by the boston police,that the prosecutor failed to disclose this inducement as required by brady maryland,d,and that the prosecutor knowingly allowed martin to perjure himself by denying inducements.in a supporting affidavit,an acquaintance of perkins claimed that martin had admitted to him that he testified against the perkins brothers because an officer of the boston police had told him that if he testified the officer could help him out with his drug trafficking case.in his own affidavit,perkins said that the first affiant had reported this to perkins.
the state trial judge denied the motion,finding neither affidavit credible or material.perkins then moved for reconsideration of the denial of his motion,this time supplying an affidavit from martin himself averring that at the time of martin arrest shortly before the perkins trial,a boston police officer had stated to martin that his testimony in the perkins armed robbery case would make things a lot easier for him in his drug case,and that he eventually ended up testifying against the perkins brothers because he felt his cooperation in that case would go a long way in helping him in his drug trafficking case.
however,martin also swore that he did not lie in his testimony against the perkins and reaffirmed that he was robbed and shot by robert perkins and michael perkins.the trial judge denied the motion for reconsideration and the state appeals court affirmed,noting that martin had identified perkins as one of his assailants long before his arrest on drug charges that martin never wavered from this accusation that martin affidavit,insomuch as it reiterated that perkins had robbed and assaulted him,confirmed his trial testimony and that the trial judge,who decided the motion for a new trial,was in the best position to evaluate whether an evidentiary hearing on the issue was necessary.see perkins,at.
unsuccessful at the state level,perkins amended an habeas petition to include the disclosure and subornation of perjury claims made in his second motion for a new trial.this petition was denied by the district court in august.perkins russo,wl,at.the district court applied the same prejudice standard to perkins claim that the prosecutor failed to disclose martin inducement to testify and his claim that the prosecutor failed to correct perjured testimony.of the latter claim,the court stated that the first circuit treats such actions like a brady violation and as subject to an identical prejudice inquiry and denied the petition because it was reasonable for the state court to conclude that the verdict would have been identical had martin disclosed his alleged conversations with the police.id.at.
perkins sought a coa on multiple grounds,including an assertion that both the state court and the federal district court had applied an incorrect prejudice standard to his subornation claim.according to perkins,a criminal defendant alleging subornation of perjury need show only any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury,united states agurs,d,whereas a successful brady claim requires a showing of a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d emphasis added.the district court granted the coa,narrowing the issue to whether perkins established prejudice under the more standard of materiality for subornation of perjury claims.perkins russo,wl.
the and effective death penalty act aedpa ordinarily requires those seeking review of a state court decision to show that the decision was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the contrary to language requires that the state court apply a rule that in terms or effect contradicts supreme court precedent,williams taylor,d the unreasonable application of language requires that the
