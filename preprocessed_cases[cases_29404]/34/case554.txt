ugochukwu ossai appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed by the district court pursuant to the hobbs act,a,for committing and conspiring to commit robbery.we affirm.
background 
on december,two dunkin donuts cassidy and john at their workplace in bedford,new hampshire.at approximately,cassidy went out to the parking lot and met defendant ugochukwu ossai and ossai girlfriend,chanrathana khem also a dunkin donuts employee,who were parked in a volkswagen jetta.ossai told cassidy that he planned to rob the dunkin donuts later that evening,showed cassidy a gun,and asked whether cassidy wanted to participate in the robbery.cassidy then returned to the store.
at around,while occupied on the telephone,chick noticed that the side door of the store was open.chick looked outside and saw a jetta parked with a female driver matching khem description.when chick returned to the store to resume his phone call,he saw a person wearing a ski mask,ossai enter through the side door,carrying a handgun.ossai ordered chick to lay down on the floor.when chick knelt instead,ossai placed his hand and the gun at the back of chick neck,and stated i do not want to hurt you.meanwhile,ossai had passed cassidy a pillowcase,into which cassidy emptied from the cash registers.ossai fled.
when the police arrived at the store,chick informed them that he had recognized the robber voice,and that based on ossai frequent visits and phone calls to khem while she was working at the store,he believed that ossai was the robber.manager april pena,who returned to the store after the robbery,told the police that she had been so busy during the morning shift that she had forgotten to insert a new videotape into the store surveillance system that day.consequently the tape in the machine would have stopped recording at noontime.manager pena and officer paul roy reviewed the tape,which bore a date and time stamp on each frame,and confirmed that the last recordings occurred shortly before noon that day.accordingly,pena and officer roy concluded that there was no videotape recording of the robbery.although pena thought she had given the tape to officer roy,roy testified that he did not receive it.
within an hour of the robbery,the police stopped and arrested ossai,who was subsequently indicted on one robbery count under the hobbs act,a,and one conspiracy count the district court denied ossai pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment,which was based on the government putative loss or destruction of the store video surveillance tape.following a jury trial,ossai was convicted on both counts.
at sentencing,the district court increased the base offense level by two points due to the fact that ossai had physically restrained his victim,john chick.although months was the prescribed maximum sentence within the applicable guideline sentencing range gsr,the district court imposed a sentence,citing inter alia,ossai extensive history of violent and behavior.ossai now appeals from the final judgment of conviction and sentence.
discussiona.the missing surveillance tape 
ossai first challenges the disallowance of the motion to dismiss the indictment due to the alleged destruction or loss of the store surveillance tape by the government.as noted,store manager april pena testified i that she had forgotten to put a new tape in the store surveillance system at noon on the day of the robbery,and upon entering the office after the robbery she immediately noticed that the orange light on the system was off indicating that the system was not recording,and ii that captain roy and she replayed the last fifteen minutes of the tape in the machine,and determined that it contained video of the restaurant only up to noontime on december.
ossai does not contend that the missing tape is exculpatory in the sense that it would establish that someone else committed the robbery.rather,ossai concedes that the government adduced overwhelming evidence that he committed the robbery.instead,as he contended at trial,ossai argues that the government could not charge him under the hobbs act,given that both cassidy and chick were complicit in the robbery,thus he employed neither actual force n or threatened force in taking the money from chick.see united states skowronski,cir ossai maintains that chick,as the shift supervisor,possessed a key to the locked office where the video surveillance equipment was kept,that he could have tampered with the surveillance tapes in order to conceal his and cassidy participation in the inside theft,and that the missing tape might have exhibited signs that chick had stopped or rewound the tape in order to prevent its recordation of the activities in the store at the time of the supposed robbery.
a defendant who asserts a due process claim based on the government failure to preserve evidence must show that the government,in failing to preserve the evidence,acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence,which possessed an apparent exculpatory value and,which is to some extent irreplaceable.thus in missing evidence cases,the presence or absence of good or bad faith by the government will be dispositive.united states femia,cir citing california trombetta,d see united states marshall,cir noting that defendant bears the burden of proof on a femia motion.the district court denied the ossai motion,crediting the testimony by pena and captain roy that pena had forgotten to insert a new tape in the recorder at noon on december,and that they reviewed the stamped tape after the robbery and determined that it ceased recording shortly after noon on december,some seven hours before the robbery.
we review conclusions of law de novo,whereas subsidiary findings of fact,whether the police acted in bad faith are reviewed only for clear error.see united states garza,cir,cert.denied,d.we will determine that clear error occurred only if,after due regard for the district court opportunity to assess witness credibility,and after reviewing the evidence as a whole,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.see united states zajanckauskas,cir.
the district court finding that the missing tape was not exculpatory is not clearly erroneous.pena testified that she kept fifteen numbered video tapes on hand in her office,that she normally although not always inserted a new tape in the recorder every noontime,and after she had used all fifteen tapes,she would record over them during the ensuing cycle.as the tapes were recording,the equipment superimposed the date and time of the recording on each frame of the footage.pena was required by her employer to review the recorded tapes at least once a week,primarily to detect theft by employees.
as pena,who had been advised of the robbery,was driving back to the dunkin donuts,she was almost not absolutely she had forgotten to change the surveillance tape that noon,because she had been extremely busy and during the morning shift.when she arrived at her locked office following the robbery,the fact that the orange light on the equipment was off,an indication that the equipment was not recording only served to confirm her belief that she had forgotten to change the tape,as did the fact that the tape had rewound itself to the beginning.pena testified that when a tape reached the end of its recording period,the equipment automatically rewound the tape to the beginning.pena and captain roy the tape to the last fifteen minutes of the recording,reviewed this,and determined that it was a recording of the store premises at or around noontime on december.as concerns who had access to the locked office in her absence,pena testified that she did not believe that chick had a key,but she was not sure.
if we were to assume,arguendo,the defense theory that chick and ossai were coconspirators a theory later rejected by the jury,and that chick had both the motive and opportunity to tamper with the surveillance system,there are but three conceivable factual scenarios.first,if pena did forget to change the tape at noon on december,chick might have entered the locked office after pena left at,checked the recorder,determined that the tape was not running and thus would not contain any evidence that an armed robbery did not occur at on december,and simply left the tape alone.in such circumstances,the tape could not have been exculpatory,since it would contain no evidence of the chick tampering.
second,ossai implies that,if pena recollection that she did not insert a new surveillance tape at noon was wrong,chick would have observed the new december tape in its seventh hour of recording,and either stopped the tape before rewound and erased that portion of the december tape that had recorded the restaurant at the time of the alleged robbery rewound the tape to the beginning in the hope that pena would mistake it for the old december tape that had stopped recording at noontime and automatically rewound.ossai relies on pena concession that,after the robbery,she did not review the beginning of the tape in the machine,but only the last fifteen minutes.the defense is correct that the interruptions in the action and the stamps would have been evidence of possible tampering,but this is precisely why it seems unlikely that chick,not knowing ahead of time which sections of the tape the police eventually would choose to review,would have hazarded this approach.
we know for a fact,in any event,that chick took none of these actions.pena the tape to the last fifteen minutes of the recording,reviewed this footage,and confirmed that it was a recording of the store just before or around noontime on the.if,however,chick had stopped,erased rewound the december tape,as posited by the defense,the last fifteen minutes of that tape would have been a recording of a different morning shift on or about december,since the last time that tape had been used was some fifteen days before the robbery,and only seven hours at the beginning of the december tape would have been recorded over by the time of the robbery.
had pena changed the tape at noon on december,chick might have observed the tape in the process of recording,rewound it,and replaced it with the december tape to make it appear that pena had not changed the tape at noon.if that occurred,however,it would not be the missing tape which was exculpatory,but the december tape which chick removed from the machine,a tape that pena likely would have recorded over at a later date without any knowledge that it contained a recording of the restaurant at on december.
given the elaborateness of the tampering theory advanced by the defense,ossai failed not only to carry the burden to prove that the missing tape was in fact exculpatory,but that the police would have found its exculpatory value readily apparent.see femia,at see also united states colon osorio,cir noting that an appellate court may affirm a district court judgment on any ground apparent in the appellate record.although pena testified that she gave the tape to captain roy,roy testified that he did not take it into custody,largely because his and pena review of the tape had convinced roy that it had failed to record the robbery and therefore was not relevant evidence.roy testimony is plausible inasmuch as law enforcement officers do not normally collect evidence they deem immaterial to the offense under investigation.further,while the defense subsequently developed the theory that chick was complicit in the offense,ossai can not demonstrate that the police lost or destroyed the tape at a time when they reasonably would have foreseen its relevance to the defense theory.to assume such prescience on the part of the police officers would necessitate that they had reason to suspect that chick was a coconspirator in the fake robbery.
for these reasons,we agree with the district court that the tampering theory advanced by the defense is unavailing.garza,at.
b.the sufficiency of the evidence 
ossai next contends that the government adduced insufficient evidence on an essential element of the hobbs act robbery,that the december robbery in some way obstruct ed,delay ed or affect ed interstate commerce.a see supra note.april pena testified on direct examination that,had ossai not stolen the,she would have deposited it into the owner bank account the next day,and the owner would have used the deposited money to run the business,which necessarily required the ordering of products manufactured outside of new hampshire.on,however,the defense inquired whether pena would have reduced her purchase orders by because of the robbery.she replied that the robbery did not affect her because they depended entirely on the volume of her recent sales.
challenges to the sufficiency of the record evidence are reviewed de novo,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict we will affirm unless the evidence is insufficient to permit the jury rationally to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,each essential element of the charged offense.united states,cir.
the ossai argument falters,as it incorrectly presumes that the pena testimony on negated her testimony on direct.in order to establish the interstate nexus element prescribed by subsection a,the government need only adduce evidence of a realistic probability that the robbery had some slight or minimal impact on interstate commerce.see united states brennick,cir finding nexus evidence sufficient in light of similar testimony regarding a robbery of from a store with gross monthly sales of million the pena testimony that she would have deposited the stolen funds in the business bank accounts,which the owner customarily uses to make purchases for the business,plainly sufficed.the pena testimony establishes simply that she could not trace the loss of the to a reduction in any particular purchase order that she made,or that the store owner made subsection a interstate nexus element does not turn on such accounting niceties,however,and the government need not prove that the precise funds stolen were certain to be used in future business purchases.united states nguyen,cir see united states jamison,cir affirming hobbs act conviction even though the victim stated that some unspecified portion of the stolen money might not have been used for future interstate purchases united states gray,cir noting that government need not quantify interstate effect,cert.denied,d.as pena was not able to deposit the in the business account,the assets of a business which customarily transacts business in interstate commerce were depleted.for purposes of a,it matters not that the actual effect of the robbery may be slight or even untraceable.see brennick,at.
c.the reasonableness of the sentence 
the physical restraint sentencing enhancement 
ossai next contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentencing enhancement for using physical restraint against chick during the course of the robbery,placing the gun to chick head to force him to kneel.b b requiring a enhancement if any person was physically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense.ossai argues that b b should be triggered only if defendant tied,bound or locked up the victim,or forced the victim to accompany him to another location to prevent the victim escape.finally,ossai maintains that the b b enhancement amounts to impermissible under the sentencing guidelines,in that the method by which he restrained a dangerous already triggered a enhancement under b.see,united states,cir reversing enhancement as,but noting that is not automatically impermissible under the guidelines.
a sentence imposed under the sentencing guidelines is to be reviewed for reasonableness.united states alli,cir citing united states booker,d.normally,the district court must determine the applicable gsr,assess whether other factors identified by the parties warrant a sentence above or below the gsr,consider the sentencing factors set forth in a,and explain its reasons for imposing the ultimate sentence.id.thus,a sentence which exceeds the maximum gsr may be reasonable in the circumstances.see,united states moreland,cir,cert.denied,d united states jordan,cir,cert.denied,d.our emphasis will be on the district court provision of a reasoned explanation,a plausible outcome these criteria are deference to different judgments by the district judges on the scene.united states,cir en banc,cert.denie
