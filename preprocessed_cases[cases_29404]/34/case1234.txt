appellant florencio rolan appeals the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania denial of his petition for habeas corpus.rolan was convicted of murdering paulino santiago in.his original petition for habeas corpus sought relief based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court granted the petition,and we affirmed.after a retrial,the jury convicted rolan of murder again.he submitted a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus.the district court denied the petition.rolan now appeals.for the reasons stated herein,we will affirm the district court order.
background 
in,florencio rolan was convicted of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in the shooting death of paulino santiago paulino or santiago.the superior court summarized the events surrounding the shooting and leading up to rolan arrest as follows 
on the evening of friday,may,the victim,paulino santiago,and robert aponte were selling marijuana near and wallace streets in philadelphia.paulino brother,francisco,and rolan were nearby,among a crowd estimated at thirty to fifty people.around a driver pulled up to buy a nickel bag,five dollars worth of marijuana.aponte and paulino santiago argued over who should get the money for the sale.rolan sided with aponte,his cousin.the argument continued for about fifteen minutes until rolan departed for the house of a friend across the street.francisco santiago went to an abandoned house,at wallace street,a few doors from the corner,to relieve himself.his brother followed.
it is undisputed that a few minutes later,inside the abandoned house,rolan killed paulino santiago with a single shot to the chest from a caliber rifle,then fled out a back alley and left the neighborhood.police found the rifle in the alley about a block away from the abandoned house.the next day rolan fled to new york city,and was not apprehended until the following november,when he returned to pennsylvania after waiving extradition.
commonwealth rolan.
during the trial,francisco santiago,the victim brother,testified that rolan argued with paulino on a street corner.after arguing outside,francisco testified that he and paulino entered an abandoned house nearby and that rolan followed,carrying a rifle.rolan demanded money from paulino.rolan then shot paulino and ran out of the house.
another witness,edwin rosado,provided contrasting testimony.rosado stated that paulino entered the abandoned house after rolan,not before.rolan did not testify at trial.the jury convicted rolan and sentenced him to death.rolan appealed.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed the conviction on october.
in,rolan filed a petition under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.rolan testified at the pcra hearing that paulino entered the house after he was already inside,and charged at him with a kitchen knife.rolan also testified that he entered the house unarmed,but found a loaded rifle lying on the floor of the house,picked it up,and fired at santiago in.he also testified that trial counsel,melvin goldstein,failed to investigate two witnesses who would have bolstered a theory daniel vargas and robert aponte.
vargas testified at the pcra hearing.according to vargas,rolan entered the house unarmed,after which paulino ran into the house with a kitchen knife in hand threatening to kill him.the pcra court held that goldstein had been constitutionally ineffective at the penalty phase of the trial and vacated rolan death sentence.after a penalty phase retrial,the jury sentenced him to life in prison.the superior court affirmed,and the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur.
in,rolan filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court the district court granted the habeas petition,holding,among other things,that goldstein had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate vargas testimony and failing to call him as a witness.this court affirmed the district court decision granting rolan writ of habeas corpus.see rolan vaughn,cir.
the commonwealth retried rolan in.by that time,many of the key witnesses had passed away.the prior testimony of those now unavailable witnesses was read into the record.during the prosecutor closing argument,he highlighted vargas absence from the trial and his vargas failure to testify until the pcra hearing.the trial court instructed the jury that both rolan and the commonwealth knew of vargas at the first trial,but that rolan counsel failed to call him as a witness.the trial court did not explain to the jury that rolan failure to call vargas,at the first trial,was due to his trial counsel ineffectiveness,as rolan had requested.rolan was convicted of first degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime.he received a sentence of life imprisonment.
rolan appealed the second conviction.the superior court ordered him to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal,pursuant to pennsylvania rule of appellate procedure b rule b statement.rolan filed the rule b statement.the superior court rejected all of the claims appearing in his rule b statement and affirmed the trial court.see commonwealth rolan.rolan did not seek allocatur in the pennsylvania supreme court and did not file a pcra petition.
in november,rolan filed a petition for habeas corpus in the district court.the magistrate judge assigned to the matter recommended in her report and recommendation r r that rolan petition for habeas corpus be denied.specifically,the magistrate judge largely referencing the superior court substantive analysis held,inter alia,that rolan claim of a due process violation based on the prosecutor closing argument,regarding vargas failure to come forward earlier,was procedurally defaulted and,in the alternative,adopted the superior court merits analysis denying the claim the superior court conclusion that the prosecutor comments regarding rolan failure to raise during the first trial were not improper was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent the superior court rejection of rolan prosecutorial misconduct claim relating to the prosecutor comments about his silence was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent the superior court determination that francisco santiago prior testimony was properly admitted at trial was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent and rolan claim regarding the prosecutor alleged misrepresentation of key facts and impermissible comments on inadmissible evidence was procedurally defaulted and,therefore,not subject to habeas review.
the district court approved and adopted the magistrate judge r r by order dated november.rolan filed a timely appeal.we granted a certificate of appealability only as to the following issues 
appellant arguments arising out of the prosecutor statements regarding daniel vargas failure to come forward earlier whether the prosecutor statements regarding appellant failure to mount a case theory until constituted prosecutorial misconduct whether the prosecutor comments regarding appellant silence but not his failure to testify at trial violated his fifth amendment privilege against whether the introduction of francisco santiago prior testimony was a violation of rolan confrontation clause rights and whether the prosecutor various alleged misstatements of the evidence in closing arguments rose to the level of a due process violation.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction,pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the appeal from the district court final order denying the petition under and c a.
iii.standard of review 
procedural default challenges 
title requires that a habeas petitioner exhaust the remedies available in the state courts before a federal court can exercise habeas corpus jurisdiction over his claim.in order for rolan to fulfill this requirement,he must have presented both the factual and legal substance of his claims in the state court highest tribunal.see castille peoples,d.procedural default occurs when a claim has not been fairly presented to the state courts,is unexhausted and there are no additional state remedies available to pursue,see wenger frank,cir or,when an issue is properly asserted in the state system but not addressed on the merits because of an independent and adequate state procedural rule,see mccandless vaughn,cir.ordinarily,violation of firmly established and regularly followed state rules will be adequate to foreclose review of a federal claim.there are,however,exceptional cases in which exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.lee kemna,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
aedpa deference 
if the claim was not procedurally defaulted,and was adjudicated on the merits by the state court,we afford the state court determinations deference under aedpa.in doing so,we determine whether the state court determinations,
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
absent adjudication on the merits,our review of the claim is de novo.bond beard,cir.
iv.analysis 
rolan claims before this court consist of three prosecutorial misconduct claims,a fifth amendment claim and a confrontation clause claim.we will address each of these claims in turn.
prosecutorial misconduct 
rolan argues that his conviction should be vacated based on the prosecutor statements regarding vargas failure to testify earlier in the case vargas statements claim the prosecutor comments about rolan failure to assert the theory until statements claim and the prosecutor alleged misstatements of evidence in his closing argument misstatements of evidence claim.the district court,adopting the superior court conclusions,held that rolan claims regarding the prosecutor comments about vargas and alleged misstatements of evidence were procedurally defaulted rolan now appeals the procedural default conclusions as well as the district court determination that his prosecutorial misconduct claims each lack merit.
procedural default issues 
the district court held that rolan vargas statements claim was waived due to an independent and adequate state procedural ground specifically,pennsylvania rule of appellate procedure b,which requires the appellant to file a concise statement of the matters complained of on appeal.the superior court and district court both held that rolan had not asserted the vargas statements claim in his rule b statement,and therefore,waived any relief based on those claims.see commonwealth robinson,where the trial court orders an appellant to file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal under rule b,any issue not contained in that statement is waived on appeal.
rolan argues that paragraph of his rule b statement sufficiently conveys his concerns about the prosecutor statements regarding vargas testimony while we acknowledge that he raises this claim within the context of a broader argument regarding the trial court jury instructions,we find that his rule b statement was sufficient to allow the court to identify his claims relating to the prosecutor statements about vargas in his closing arguments.see commonwealth lemon.is intended to aid trial judges in identifying and focusing upon those issues which the parties plan to raise on appeal.see also commonwealth butler,when the trial court has to guess what issues an appellant is appealing,that is not enough for meaningful review.therefore,rolan substantially,if imperfectly,complied with the requirements of rule b.lee,at.consequently,rolan claim concerning the vargas statements was not procedurally defaulted.the district court procedural default determination on this point is erroneous thus,the issue is preserved for our review.
the district court adopting the superior court rationale also held that rolan had waived his misstatement of evidence claim for failing to comply with rule a of the pennsylvania rules of appellate procedure rule a.rule a states,t he argument shall be divided into as many parts as there are questions to be argued and shall have at the head of each part the particular point treated therein,followed by such discussion and citation of authorities as are deemed pertinent.here,we must consider whether the superior court application of rule a is appropriate for precluding federal habeas review.see lee,at.
rolan brief before the superior court provided detailed factual allegations with copious citations to the record.rolan explicitly stated that the prosecutor misrepresented important pieces of evidence in his closing argument pointed to fifteen examples of alleged misstated evidence,with citations to the record incorporated the statement of facts into his argument section by reference and included a discussion on the issue of prosecutorial misconduct.in support of his misstatements of evidence claim,rolan cited cases where the pennsylvania supreme court reversed convictions based on an improper remark in closing arguments,see,commonwealth smith,commonwealth toth,and emphasized the cumulative effect of the numerous statements identified in the facts section.although rolan did not provide a verbatim recitation of each alleged misstatement in the argument section of his brief,he did provide ample notice of the nature of his claims by identifying the specific facts involved in the misstatements of evidence claim.
rolan discussion sufficiently identified his claim for the court.given rolan substantial compliance with rule a,procedural default is not appropriate.therefore,the superior court application of rule a should not preclude our consideration of rolan federal habeas claim.the district court procedural default determination on this ground is in error consequently,this issue is preserved for our review.
prosecutorial misconduct merits analysis 
before considering the merits of rolan claims,we must first determine the appropriate standard of deference.rolan asserts that aedpa deference does not apply to the state court determinations regarding the vargas statements claim because the state court never adjudicated the claim on the merits.rather,the superior court and later the district court adopting the same rationale dismissed his claim as defaulted under rule b,and then found in the alternative,that his claim lacked merit.we must now determine whether aedpa deference applies when a state court decides a claim on procedural grounds and,alternatively,on the merits.
the weight of authority of our sister circuits suggests that the merits analysis is owed aedpa deference.see stephens branker,cir w e agree with our sister circuits that an alternative merits determination to a procedural bar ruling is entitled to aedpa deference.brooks bagley,cir w e must consider whether the court alternative merits ruling receives aedpa deference.we think that it does.the language of the statute does not draw a distinction between cases involving alternative rulings it refers broadly to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also zarvela artuz,cir busby dretke,cir johnson mckune,cir.
the supreme court decision in harris reed,d provides additional guidance on this point.in harris,the supreme court considered the application of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine to claims on habeas review and held that state courts may both rely on state procedural bars and reach federal substantive questions in denying habeas relief 
moreover,a state court need not fear reaching the merits of a federal claim in an alternative holding.by its very definition,the adequate and independent state ground doctrine requires the federal court to honor a state holding that is a sufficient basis for the state court judgment,even when the state court also relies on federal law.see fox film muller.thus,by applying this doctrine to habeas cases,sykes curtails reconsideration of the federal issue on federal habeas as long as the state court explicitly invokes a state procedural bar rule as a separate basis for decision.in this way,a state court may reach a federal question without sacrificing its interests in finality,federalism,and comity.
harris,at.this language suggests that where a holding provides sufficient basis for the state court judgment,it should be upheld by the federal court.the supreme court language does not limit the federal court consideration based upon whether such state court articulations form the primary basis for its decision,or an alternative and sufficient basis for the decision 
we similarly believe that in referencing adjudication on the merits,aedpa draws no such distinction for alternative rulings.rather,it suggests that where a state court has considered the merits of the claim,and its consideration provides an alternative and sufficient basis for the decision,such consideration warrants deference.consequently,after considering our sister circuits analyses alongside the supreme court articulation in harris,we will apply aedpa deference to the superior court alternative holding on the merits of rolan claim 
when analyzing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct,the key question is whether a state prosecutor comments to the jury so infec ted the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.greer miller,d quotation marks and citation omitted.more specifically,a reviewing court must examine the prosecutor offensive actions in context and in light of the entire trial,assessing the severity of the conduct,the effect of the curative instructions,and the quantum of evidence against the defendant.moore morton,cir see also united states rivas,cir a mistrial is not required where improper remarks were harmless,considering their scope,their relation to the context of the trial,the ameliorative effect of any curative instructions and the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction.citations omitted.invoking this standard,we address each prosecutorial misconduct claim in turn.
in his closing,the prosecutor made the following statements regarding vargas failure to testify at the previous trial 
danny vargas in,characterized as an alibi witness,did want to cooperate,did want to give a statement,did want to testify.
then thirteen years later,thirteen years later,can you imagine this in,they parachute him in out of nowhere to say,oh,this was,i saw paulino santiago with a knife 
and the only thing that was missing from danny vargas testimony thirteen years after the crime were four little words once upon a time.once upon a time.because if ever there was a fairy tale being spun in a court of law by a witness,it was spun in by danny vargas.thirteen years later it was fairy tale time.
now,the defendant was arrested in november of.we have these proceedings in.vargas knows they going on because the da detective goes out to interview him as a possible witness for the defendant.and yet he does come to court,does testify,does tell the defendant or his family anything about seeing the victim with a knife.their witness.
where has he been for thirteen years,until he finally takes the stand and testifies at the proceedings in 
h ow do they even know thirteen years later to go speak to vargas and take his affidavit are they psychic are you guys psychic,that you somehow just know what did you find,the phone book and look through it for all the hispanic names and say danny vargas,this is a guy that might know something,let go talk to him 
vargas affidavit was the very first time anyone ever heard from danny vargas.
the very first time we have anything from danny vargas is in february of when he completes and signs under oath by a notary public this affidavit setting forth these facts,deposing these facts which he testified to in when he testified were true,accurate and correct to the best of his information and belief.
these comments were intended to convince the jury that vargas testimony was unreliable because he did not immediately come forward.however,rolan avers that the comments were misleading because the jury was never told that this court had found trial counsel,goldstein,to be ineffective for not investigating vargas as a witness.according to rolan,the commonwealth should not have been allowed to comment on vargas failure to testify without attributing the absence to the prior ineffective assistance of counsel ruling rolan also argues that the trial court failure to provide a sufficient curative instruction further exacerbated the impact of the prosecutor comments rolan assertion that our prior ineffective assistance of counsel finding bears any impact on the second trial is without merit.we will,however,consider his due process claim,and determine whether the district court properly found there to be no constitutional violation.
considered in the context of the entire trial,the prosecutor statements did not infect the trial with unfairness so as to constitute a denial of due process.see greer,at.the prosecutor comments focused on the fact that vargas failed to come forward with his version of the events for thirteen years.although rolan attempts to ascribe vargas prior absence solely to goldstein ineffectiveness,vargas testimony suggests that he made a personal decision not to provide additional information at the early stages of the case.when approached by law enforcement in may of as a possible alibi witness for rolan,vargas did not disclose that he had information about the case and stated that he was not willing to provide a statement.he further testified that he did not tell anyone what he knew about the case until he spoke to rolan attorney in.he stated that he did not tell police officers at the scene what he knew and did not reach out to family members of either rolan or the victim to say that he had additional information.it was not until he saw rolan in jail,that he decided to reveal his version of the events to rolan counsel thirteen years later.
the commonwealth attempts to undermine vargas testimony were important because vargas provided testimony that conflicted with the commonwealth theory of the case.according to the commonwealth,his failure to come forward,or otherwise support rolan theory at the initial trial,had adverse implications regarding his credibility.however,the statements complained of were not the only means by which the prosecution attacked vargas credibility.in fact,the jury was faced with other evidence that undermined vargas testimony,the fact that no knife was found at the crime scene despite his testimony that paulino came charging in with a knife and the testimony of other witnesses supporting the commonwealth theory of the case.see greer,at.when a defendant contends that a prosecutor question rendered his trial fundamentally unfair,it is important as an initial matter to place the remark in context.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.
the trial court also provided an instruction to cure any prejudice raised by the prosecutor closing arguments.app.at ladies and gentlemen,daniel vargas was known to both the commonwealth and the defense at the time of the prior proceedings in.however,prior defense counsel failed to call daniel vargas at the earlier proceeding in.in light of the other evidence and the court curative instruction,the denial of rolan due process claim based on the prosecutor comments about vargas was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,greer.
second,rolan alleges prosecutorial misconduct based on the prosecutor comments regarding his failure to previously raise a theory of the case.the prosecutor stated 
they claim self defense.years later they claim self defense.where was the self defense in may of where was the self defense for the five months that that man was a fugitive from the law where was the self defense when he went to brooklyn and hid out until the police caught him 
self defense what does he do does he contact the police does he call them on the phone does he surrender himself does he get a lawyer no.he runs and he hides.
where was the self defense in when these proceedings were going on and the witnesses were being called to testify 
he never contacted the police,never got a lawyer,never surrendered,never called a t some point do you call the police and tell them,look,i killed somebody,i had to,he had a knife,i had no choice,he was going to stab me.that call never came.never came.
when they did catch the defendant in november of,they brought him back to philadelphia and they processed him and they told him multiple times,you are being charged with the murder of paulino santiago,sir,you are being charged with his murder.and the only statement he made was,i know i need help.that it.that it.i know i need help.that it.
app.at.in granting rolan first petition for habeas corpus,we held that goldstein failure to investigate and put forward a theory was objectively unreasonable.see rolan,at although the decision to forgo a claim is of the type that may be entitled to a presumption of validity,goldstein decision not to present the defense can not be according sic the normal deference to strategic choices because it was uninformed.
rolan now objects to the prosecutor comments,arguing that they implied that rolan did not assert a theory at trial because it was a fabrication,not because of his ineffective trial counsel.the prosecutor comments about rolan failure to previously assert were not so injurious so as to result in a due process violation under greer the statements were a permissible attack on rolan credibility.the prosecutor discussed rolan failure to assert alongside other evidence,such as his flight to new york after the shooting,to allow the jury to determine the reliability of his testimony that he acted in.rolan attempts to characterize vargas unavailability at the initial trial and rolan failure to assert as resting solely on goldstein ineffectiveness.however,it is impossible for us at this juncture to know what would have happened if goldstein had effectively investigated vargas as a potential witness and whether or not vargas corroboration had any impact on rolan failure to otherwise assert.as the superior court previously stated,our prior determination of ineffectiveness does not grant rolan both a new trial and virtual immunity from any challenge to the credibility of his claim.commonwealth rolan.
because the trial court provided an instruction explaining why evidence of rolan theory was not previously presented and because there is other evidence in the record to further discredit rolan assertion of,the superior court holding that the prosecutor comments did not result in a due process violation was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,greer.we will affirm the district court denial of federal habeas relief on this ground.
third,rolan asserts prosecutorial misconduct based on a number of alleged misstatements of the evidence in the prosecutor closing argument.according to rolan,the prosecutor articulated discrepancies between vargas affidavit and his pcra testimony that did not exist.specifically,rolan argues that the prosecutor erroneously claimed that vargas affidavit stated that the santiago brothers and rolan all went into the house together.he also alleges that the prosecutor misstated evidence by referencing vargas testimony about paulino santiago entering the house with a knife and then stating that vargas failed to include facts about the knife in his original affidavit.additionally,rolan claims that the prosecutor mischaracterized the following rosado testimony about if and when he saw rolan with the murder weapon whether the caller saw rolan enter the house with a rifle and the amount of time and extent of the police search of the house.finally,he avers that the prosecutor improperly emphasized the consistency of francisco santiago statement to the police with his preliminary hearing and trial testimonies despite the trial court ruling that the police statement was inadmissible.not surprisingly,the commonwealth asserts that the prosecutor statements were fair and proper arguments within the context of the trial.
considering these statements within the context of the case,we find no constitutional violation rather,the record indicates that the alleged misstatements were either supported by other statements in the record or acceptable arguments based on the trial testimony and the defense arguments further,the trial court provided adequate instruction to cure any harm caused by the prosecutor characterizations of the evidence.it instructed the jury to rely on the evidence presented at trial and to form their opinions of the case based on their independent recollections of the testimony,not the arguments of counsel the superior court holding that the prosecutor comments did not result in a due process violation was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,greer.we will affirm the district court denial of rolan petition for habeas corpus on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.
fifth amendment claim 
rolan further avers that the prosecutor comments about his silence violated his fifth amendment privilege against the fifth amendment guarantees n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.the supreme court has recognized that where a prosecutor,on his own initiative,asks a jury to draw an adverse inference from a mirandized criminal defendant silence or to treat that defendant silence as substantive evidence of guilt,the defendant privilege against is violated.doyle ohio,d we hold that the use for impeachment purposes of petitioners silence,at the time of arrest and after receiving miranda warnings,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
during trial,the prosecutor stated 
when they did catch the defendant in november of,they brought him back to philadelphia and they processed him and they told him multiple times,you are being charged with the murder of paulino santiago and the only statement he made was,i know i need help.that it.that it.i know i need help.that it.
app.at.rolan characterizes this statement as a comment on his failure to make a specific statement,the fact that he was silent on the matter.however,the record clearly indicates that the prosecutor did not comment on rolan silence,but rather on the substance and limited nature of what he did say.neither the fifth amendment nor doyle shield a defendant from a prosecutor comments about statements made to the police.therefore,the superior court decision to deny rolan claim on this ground was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent as stated in doyle we will affirm the district court denial of rolan petition for habeas corpus for violation of the fifth amendment.
confrontation clause 
because francisco santiago died before rolan retrial,the transcript of his testimony from rolan original trial and his preliminary hearing was read into evidence.rolan now argues that the trial court decision to admit santiago testimony violated his rights under the confrontation clause because he was deprived of an adequate of the witness because we find no constitutional error,we reject rolan position that the santiago testimony should be struck from the record and a retrial granted.
in crawford washington,d,the supreme court held that testimonial statements may not be offered against a defendant at trial unless the declarant of the statement is unavailable and the defendant had an opportunity to the declarant.id.at.where testimonial evidence is at issue,however,the sixth amendment demands what the common law required unavailability and a prior opportunity for.we now must consider whether the superior court determination that admitting francisco santiago testimony at trial did not violate rolan rights under the confrontation clause is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,crawford.see d.
in rolan first habeas corpus proceeding,we held that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective by failing to investigate rolan theory and failing to call two witnesses in support of that theory.rolan now argues that his prior counsel was ineffective in his of francisco santiago because prior counsel did not question him about inconsistent statements or explore a grant of immu
