pierre jenkins filed claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution under and new york law,as well as state law claims of libel,slander and intentional infliction of emotional distress,against city of new york,the new york city police department nypd and detectives mack,parrino,hunter and schulman.jenkins appeals from a december,judgment of the district court glasser,granting defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissing all claims.for the reasons stated below,we vacate in part and affirm in part,and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
between june and july,a series of robberies and a homicide occurred in brooklyn,new york.based on witness and victim descriptions,the police came to believe that the same person was involved in each of the crimes.in a number of the robberies and the homicide,witnesses indicated the participation of a second individual.the robberies were labeled robbery pattern and assigned to detective parrino of the brooklyn robbery squad,and the homicide was assigned to detective mack at the precinct in brooklyn.
during the first robbery,the victim red honda civic was stolen.the honda was subsequently described by five of the other robbery victims as the vehicle used by their assailants.when police recovered the honda on july,they discovered,along with property belonging to one of the robbery victims,the fingerprints of derrick blyther.on july,detectives parrino,schulman and hunter went with members of the brooklyn robbery squad to blyther apartment to arrest him 
what happened next is in sharp dispute.by jenkins and blyther account,early that morning they were startled by a loud banging at the door and,when blyther opened the door,they claim,the police burst in with guns drawn,threw blyther to the ground and placed him in handcuffs.other officers headed straight for jenkins,who was sitting on the couch,forced him to the ground and placed him in handcuffs as well.blyther and jenkins insist that at no point did they attempt to flee.
the police offer a different account.the police contend that upon knocking on blyther door and announcing their presence blyther and jenkins came running out of the apartment.detectives tackled both men and placed them in handcuffs.in his deposition,detective mack testified that tackling a suspect who attempts to flee constitutes the use of physical force and would be noted in a police report.yet,the means of apprehension form prepared by detective hunter on the date of arrest makes no mention of the suspects attempted flight or use of physical force during the arrest.neither jenkins nor blyther was charged with resisting arrest.not a single document suggests that either jenkins or blyther attempted to flee the apartment.in their depositions in this action,however,detectives amodeo and hunter recounted the escape attempt.
jenkins and blyther were taken to the precinct and placed in lineups by detective mack.jason chambers,who witnessed the murder of david diaz,identified jenkins as the shooter.later that evening,two victims of the robbery pattern crimes,keith golden and vinette tummings,identified jenkins as one of their assailants.several witnesses also identified blyther.both men were put in jail.jenkins was arraigned on several counts of murder and robbery.prosecutors presented evidence against jenkins to two separate grand juries which indicted jenkins on the murder and robbery charges.
during the course of jenkins criminal proceeding,the new york supreme court juviler,held a hearing on jenkins motion to suppress the lineup identifications under united states wade,d and dunaway new york,d.judge juviler denied jenkins wade motion,finding the lineups free from undue suggestion,but granted jenkins dunaway motion,finding the lineup identifications were fruits of an unlawful arrest,without probable cause.the court then granted the prosecutor request to demonstrate that courtroom identifications by these three witnesses would have a source independent of the lineup.
almost eight months after the arrest,an assistant district attorney interviewed blyther,who informed him that harvey dixon,not jenkins,was the second perpetrator in the murder of david diaz and the robbery of keith golden.in addition,blyther noted that his accomplices in the other robberies were various crack heads from around the neighborhood.blyther was clear that jenkins was not involved in any of the robbery pattern crimes.
over three days in late march,judge juviler conducted the independent source hearing.during the hearing,chambers was asked whether the detectives conducting the lineup said anything to him to suggest whom he should pick out.chambers responded that the lineup was kind of pressured.they said,you got to pick somebody.it was like,you got to get him.pick somebody.during the break between the first and second days of the hearing,chambers was presented with a photo array that included harvey dixon.chambers then recanted his identification of jenkins and instead identified dixon as the man who shot diaz.when asked why he picked jenkins as the shooter during the precinct lineup,chambers stated,because the detectives were,like,you had to pick somebody.i just wanted to go home and they were just,like,forcing me to pick somebody.judge juviler later noted that jenkins does resemble dixon.because chambers was the only witness linking jenkins to the diaz murder,prosecutors decided to drop the murder charges against jenkins.they continued to pursue the robbery charges,however,on the expectation that judge juviler would permit courtroom identifications by tummings and golden.
on april,judge juviler concluded that prosecutors failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that courtroom identifications by golden and tummings would have a source independent of the lineup identifications.with respect to tummings,judge juviler indicated he was troubled very much by the corrosive effect of the lineup procedure which came to light when tummings testified.judge juviler found that when the police called tummings to request that she come view the lineup,they told her that they had caught the guy and that he fit her description.shortly after that,she learned from golden that the police had found his watch on the guy.while we know that the guy turned out to be blyther,this was not evident to tummings.judge juviler stated that the conduct of the police,in conjunction with tummings eagerness to bring someone to justice,created a serious risk that tummings would pick out the person in the lineup who closest resemble d the person who had robbed her.
with respect to golden,judge juviler found that the police had shown golden his stolen watch after telling him that someone in the lineup was in custody.the police did not say who in the lineup was the suspect and the person with the watch,but the police conduct in the context of the previous fact created a substantial risk that golden would pick the person in the lineup who was most like the second robber.
with the eyewitness identifications suppressed,the district attorney moved to dismiss the robbery charges.on may,all charges against jenkins were dismissed.by the time of his release,jenkins had spent nearly nine months in prison.
jenkins filed a claim for damages under and new york law against the city of new york,the nypd,and detectives mack,parrino,hunter and schulman,asserting federal and state law false arrest claims,and various other claims.defendants sought summary judgment on all causes of action.the district court divided jenkins false arrest claims into two groups based on the relevant periods detention and detention.
with respect to jenkins detention,the district court noted judge juviler finding that jenkins initial arrest was not supported by probable cause and gave that finding preclusive effect.the district court nevertheless dismissed jenkins claims,finding the detective defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court noted that an arresting officer is immune from personal liability for false arrest so long as he has arguable probable cause.in the district court view,detectives shulman,hunter and parrino had arguable probable cause because,when they discovered jenkins at blyther apartment,he generally matched the witnesses descriptions of the second perpetrator and attempted to flee.the district court concluded that the detectives were reasonable in believing they had probable cause to arrest and were therefore entitled to qualified immunity.
with respect to jenkins detention,the district court noted that during the hearing judge juviler found that the lineups were free from undue suggestion,and suppressed the lineups only because they were obtained as the fruit of an unlawful arrest.the district court held that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine is a rule of evidence,applicable only in criminal trials and can not be successfully invoked to support a claim.the district court gave preclusive effect to judge juviler initial finding that the lineups were free from suggestion the court did not mention judge juviler subsequent finding at the independent source hearing that,in his view,the lineup procedures had a corrupting effect.the district court concluded that after chambers identified jenkins as the shooter in the diaz murder,jenkins arrest was based on probable cause.the district court therefore granted defendants motion and dismissed jenkins detention claims.
the district court also dismissed jenkins additional federal and state law claims,and his claims against the city of new york and the nypd.this appeal followed.

jenkins false arrest claims 
in the state criminal proceeding,judge juviler found that the police did not have probable cause to arrest jenkins at blyther apartment.the district court gave that finding preclusive effect,citing and migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d.there is no doubt that a federal court must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered.migra,at.in our view,the proper application of new york law required that judge juviler finding not be given preclusive effect.
in new york,collateral estoppel has two essential elements.first,the identical issue necessarily must have been decided in the prior action and be decisive of the present action,and second,the party to be precluded from relitigating the issue must have had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination.juan cortines,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.generally,a nonparty to the prior litigation may be collaterally estopped by a determination in that litigation only if he has a relationship with a party to the prior litigation such that his own rights or obligations in the subsequent proceeding are conditioned in one way or another on,or derivative of,the rights of the party to the prior litigation.new york cent.mut.fire ins,see also brown city of new york.
the new york court of appeals has held that the relationship between a municipality and the district attorney is not one of privity.in brown,the plaintiff sued the city of new york for false arrest and moved for summary judgment.at.plaintiff asserted that the city was collaterally estopped from claiming probable cause for the arrest because the court in the criminal proceeding had determined that the plaintiff arrest was unlawful.id.the appellate division agreed,noting that the city had a full and fair opportunity to contest the prior determination inasmuch as the state and the city,although distinct legal entities,had interests in the criminal prosecution making one privy to the other.id.the court of appeals reversed the city and the district attorney are separate entities and do not stand in sufficient relationship to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel.id.at.
detectives mack,shulman,hunter and parrino were witnesses in,but not parties to,jenkins criminal proceeding.the detectives are no more in privity with the state than the city was in brown.for if the city is not in privity with the state,neither are the city employees.it was therefore error for the district court to preclude defendants from asserting that they had probable cause to arrest jenkins 
although the district court held that the detectives lacked probable cause to arrest jenkins as a matter of law,it found that they did have arguable probable cause and dismissed jenkins state and federal false arrest claims because the detective defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.qualified immunity protects an official from liability under federal causes of action but is not generally understood to protect officials from claims based on state law nevertheless,a similar doctrine exists under new york if the detective defendants were entitled to qualified immunity under federal law,summary judgment would be similarly appropriate on jenkins state law false arrest claim.
under federal law,a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity where his conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known,or it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that his actions were lawful at the time of the challenged act.cerrone brown,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d,and citing anderson creighton,d.there is no doubt that the right to be free from arrest without probable cause was clearly established at the time of jenkins arrest.see martinez simonetti,cir collecting cases.therefore,jenkins federal false arrest claim turns on whether the detectives probable cause determination was objectively reasonable.an officer determination is objectively reasonable if there was arguable probable cause at the time of is,if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on whether the probable cause test was met.lennon miller,cir see also escalera lunn,cir golino city of new haven,cir 
arguable probable cause should not be misunderstood to mean almost probable cause.the essential inquiry in determining whether qualified immunity is available to an officer accused of false arrest is whether it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that probable cause existed.see anderson,at.saucier,at.section claims under the fourth amendment are evaluated for objective reasonableness.there should be no doubt that probable cause remains the relevant standard.if officers of reasonable competence would have to agree that the information possessed by the officer at the time of arrest did not add up to probable cause,the fact that it came close does not immunize the officer.
in new york,the action of false arrest or false imprisonment is derived from the ancient action of trespass and protects the personal interest of freedom from restraint of movement.broughton state.where an officer makes an arrest without a warrant,the presumption arises that the plaintiff arrest was unlawful.id.at.however,t his presumption is rebutted if,applying the reasonable,prudent person test,the arresting officer,acting in good faith,had reasonable cause for believing the person to be arrested to have committed a felony.dillard city of syracuse,quoting people coffey.while the requirement of good faith under new york law might be interpreted to require a factual determination of the officer subjective intent,this is not the case.similar to the federal doctrine,if,when the facts are construed in favor of the plaintiff,the officer probable cause determination was objectively reasonable,the court under new york law should dismiss the plaintiff false arrest claim at the summary judgment stage.see molina city of new york,affirming dismissal of false arrest claim on summary judgment where undisputed facts indicated officers probable cause determination was reasonable iorio city of new york,same batista city of new york,same.
thus,under both new york and federal law,summary judgment dismissing a plaintiff false arrest claim is appropriate if the undisputed facts indicate that the arresting officer probable cause determination was objectively reasonable.see cerrone,at dillard,at.if,however,on the undisputed facts the officer would be unreasonable in concluding probable cause existed,or if the officer reasonableness depends on material issues of fact,then summary judgment is inappropriate for both new york and federal false arrest claims.
the district court concluded that,on the undisputed facts,the detectives were reasonable in believing they had probable cause to arrest jenkins at blyther apartment.we disagree.the district court based its finding of reasonableness on the following analysis 
when they arrested jenkins,the officers knew that a second man was alleged to have been involved in some of the incidents in robbery pattern and diaz homicide.the officers were in possession of conte stolen red honda on which they discovered blyther fingerprints.when the officers encountered jenkins at john place,he was in the presence of blyther,a known suspect in the crimes,and he generally matched the complainants descriptions of the second perpetrator.these facts permitted the officers to make the reasonable inference that jenkins was involved in the crimes for which they set out to arrest blyther.furthermore,after the police identified themselves and apprehended blyther,jenkins fled from the apartment.a suspect flight may provide reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.thus,the officers could have reasonably believed that they were justified in detaining jenkins after he ran out of the apartment.
moreover,the officers could have reasonably believed that they lawfully detained jenkins at the precinct for five hours until they organized the lineups and gathered witnesses to view them.
citations omitted.
this analysis is flawed for several reasons.the district court assertion that jenkins attempted to flee is problematic,as that fact is vigorously disputed.jenkins and blyther testified that when blyther opened his door,police stormed into the apartment,threw them both to the ground and placed them in handcuffs.both men stated that they made no attempt to flee.although detective mack testified that tackling a suspect attempting to flee is something he would note in a report,not a single document suggests that jenkins or blyther attempted to escape.thus,jenkins flight was very much at issue.because jenkins flight played an important part in the district court finding of arguable probable cause,it was also clearly material.a district court may not grant summary judgment if there exists a genuine issue of material fact.see cotarelo village of sleepy hollow police dep t,cir citing celotex catrett,d.on the defendants motion for summary judgment,the district court was obligated to construe this factual ambiguity in jenkins favor.see dallas aerospace,cis air,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.instead,the district court construed the facts in favor of the detectives 
the district court assertion that jenkins generally matched the complainants descriptions of the second perpetrator is tenuous.descriptions of the second perpetrator by witnesses of the robbery pattern crimes and the diaz murder revealed only two common characteristics the second perpetrator was male and black.aside from gender and race,the descriptions varied broadly,furnishing the detectives with an age range of to years,a height range of to tall,and a weight range of to pounds.the second perpetrator hair was described as either a short afro,in long skinny braids,or dread locks.
on appeal,defendants wisely refrain from suggesting that because jenkins physical characteristics fell within these ranges the match established probable cause.they rely instead on the assertion that jenkins matched the general description provided by nancy lorient.lorient was robbed three days before jenkins arrest.she described both of her assailants as between twenty and years of age,one as tall,pounds,and the other as tall,pounds.in addition,she indicated that one man had dread locks and wore a white.as to the other,she initially indicated that he wore a blue with burgundy stripes however,two hours later she described the shirt as with burgundy letters.on the date of his arrest,jenkins was years old,six feet tall,pounds,and wore a shirt with alternating bands of blue and orange each about three inches in width 
officers may,in certain circumstances,base probable cause on a victim description of her assailant.it has long been established,however,that when that description could have applied to any number of persons and does not single out the person arrested,probable cause does not exist.wong sun united states,d united states jackson,cir united states rosario,cir.although jenkins weight and age have some congruence to the estimates given by lorient,these similarities hardly singled jenkins out as an accomplice in the robbery.see jackson,at rosario,at.
the extent to which jenkins shirt matched the one described by lorient might have become significant to the probable cause determination,but only if jenkins was tied to the lorient crime through his presence at blyther home in the early morning hours.the district court referred to blyther as a known suspect in the robbery pattern crimes,and indeed he was.blyther fingerprints were discovered in the stolen honda.the police therefore had probable cause to believe blyther was involved in the six robberies in which the honda was described by witnesses as the getaway vehicle.lorient,however,indicated that the suspects approached and fled on foot.thus,the police lacked probable cause to believe blyther was involved in the lorient robbery with nothing tying blyther to the lorient robbery,the fact that jenkins was discovered in blyther apartment wearing a shirt somewhat similar to the one described by the victim three days earlier is at best a coincidence.it certainly does not establish probable cause 
probable cause is,of course,evaluated on the totality of the circumstances.united states patrick,cir citing brinegar united states.a person flight from the police,his presence in the company of an individual suspected of criminal activity,and the fact that he matches even a vague description provided by a witness,are certainly factors to be considered in evaluating probable cause.the significance of each of these factors may be enhanced or diminished by surrounding circumstances.in this case,jenkins alleged flight was inappropriately factored into the district court analysis as it was a disputed issue of fact.moreover,under the particular circumstances of jenkins arrest,it would be unreasonable to base probable cause on his presence in blyther apartment and the description provided by lorient.jenkins did fall within the general physical description provided by lorient and was wearing a shirt that might have been similar to the one she described,but there was no evidence connecting that crime to blyther,let alone jenkins.jenkins presence in blyther apartment,on its own,created no more than a suspicion worthy of investigation.summary judgment dismissing jenkins false arrest claims for the period was therefore in error.
jenkins false arrest claims 
the district court dismissed jenkins federal and state claims of false arrest for the period because the identifications established probable cause to believe jenkins committed the crimes and,thus,his arrest thereafter was lawful and,alternatively,the detectives reasonably believed they had probable cause for the arrest after the lineup identifications and were thus entitled to qualified immunity.
the district court rejected jenkins argument that the police could not reasonably have relied on the lineups to establish probable cause because the lineups were improperly conducted.the district court felt bound to give preclusive effect to judge juviler finding that the lineups were properly conducted and free from undue suggestion.here as well,the district court misapplied new york collateral estoppel jurisprudence.the error here,however,involves a different aspect of the doctrine.jenkins was a party to the prior criminal proceeding and,thus,the identity of the parties requirement for preclusion is met.however,jenkins success in the criminal proceeding prevents invocation of collateral estoppel against him on this issue.
in new york,the danger inherent in the doctrine of collateral an erroneous first decision on an issue will be perpetuated in subsequent remedied to an extent by the requirement that the doctrine not be applied when there is no opportunity for appellate review.see johnson watkins,cir citing malloy trombley.if a party has not had the opportunity to appeal an adverse finding,then it has not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue.id.citing people medina,appeal denied.hence,collateral estoppel will not bar reconsideration of an issue if there is an inability to obtain review or there has been no review,even though an appeal was taken.id.citations omitted accord restatement second of judgments cmt.a if review is unavailable because the party who lost on the issue obtained a judgment in his favor,the general rule of collateral estoppel is inapplicable by its own terms.
this principle is of substantial import in the context of a criminal proceeding ultimately dismissed.new york courts have held that facts determined in a pretrial suppression hearing can not be given preclusive effect against a defendant subsequently acquitted of the charges.this rule is predicated on the defendant lack of an opportunity to obtain review of an issue decided against him.johnson,at citing,as examples,williams moore,people howard,appeal denied,people sweeper,once the criminal charges against jenkins were dismissed,he had no reason to seek appellate review of judge juviler earlier wade ruling.thus,judge juviler finding that the lineups were not unduly suggestive was not final for collateral estoppel purposes.see williams,at.at the summary judgment stage,therefore,the suggestiveness of the lineups is determined by reviewing all the facts in the light most favorable to jenkins,not by reference to the state court findings.
tummings and golden identified jenkins at and,respectively,on july.the conduct of the police in administering the tummings and golden lineups was less than perfect.it is true that at the hearing judge juviler concluded that the lineups were free from undue suggestion.however,at the subsequent independent source hearing judge juviler concluded that additional evidence had come to light indicating that the lineup procedures did have a corrupting effect.the police called tummings and told her that they had caught the person who robbed her and that he had in his possession property belonging to one of the other victims.tummings was then placed in a room with golden,who earlier was told that his stolen watch had been recovered from one of the suspects.golden shared this information with tummings.although the watch was recovered from blyther,not jenkins,this was not evident to tummings or golden.tummings testified that she felt confident in identifying jenkins in the lineup because the police said they caught the person with another victim stuff in the car that i described.the state court indicated that it was troubled very much by the corrosive effect of the lineup procedure because the police created a substantial risk that golden and tummings would simply pick an individual in the lineup who most closely resembled their assailant,rather than pick no one at all.
that conduct,however,did not negate the existence of probable cause.in new york,k nowledge by a complainant that the suspect is in a lineup does not,of itself,taint the lineup.people ferrer.when a complainant is brought to a police station to view a lineup,it is implicit that the lineup will contain at least one suspect,otherwise there would be no point whatever in conducting the lineup.people green,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.this court similarly has held that although the police generally should refrain from informing a witness that the suspect is in the lineup,a lineup is not unduly suggestive merely because they do so.sales harris,cir.it must be recognized that any witness to a crime who is called upon to view a police lineup must realize that he would not be asked to view the lineup if there were not some person there whom the authorities suspected.united states gambrill,even when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to jenkins,the golden and tummings lineups were not so flawed as to undermine probable cause.thus,after jenkins was identified by golden and tummings,his detention was lawful and summary judgment on his state and federal false arrest claims for the period after those identifications was appropriate.
chambers earlier identification,however,is problematic.chambers testified that on two occasions the police told him that he had to pick someone out of the lineup.chambers picked jenkins,but eventually recanted that identification and instead picked harvey dixon out of a photo array as the man who shot diaz.when asked why he picked a different person in the photo array than at the lineup,chambers responded,because the detectives were,like,you had to pick somebody.and i just wanted to go home and they were just,like,forcing me to pick somebody.taking chambers testimony as true,the police did more than simply increase the odds that he would pick a person most closely resembling the perpetrator rather than pick no one at all.they took the option to not pick anyone off the table.such conduct would render the lineup so defective that probable cause could not reasonably be based upon it.
in sum,while summary judgment dismissing jenkins false arrest claims on the basis of the chambers identification was error,summary judgment dismissing jenkins false arrest claims for the period after he was identified by golden and tummings was appropriate.
liability of the city of new york 
jenkins complaint also names the city of new york as a defendant.jenkins alleges that the city,through its agency,the nypd,grossly failed to train and adequately supervise its police officers in the fundamental law and procedure of arrest,search and seizure the district court dismissed jenkins federal false arrest claim against the city,relying on monell dep t of social servs.of the city of new york,d.in monell,the supreme court held that a municipality may be found liable under section only where the municipality itself causes the constitutional violation at issue.id.at.
the district court apparently dismissed jenkins state law claim of false arrest against the city as well,but failed to provide any explanation as to why it did so.
section claim against the city of new york 
jenkins argues that the city is liable because it failed to train and adequately supervise its employees.this is a permissible theory of liability under.see city of canton,ohio harris,d walker city of new york,cir.however,under the failure to train theory,the supreme court has held that the inadequacy of police training may serve as the basis for liability only where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.harris,at.only where a municipality failure to train its employees in a relevant respect evidences a deliberate indifference to the rights of its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city policy or custom that is actionable under.id.
this court has identified three requirements before a municipality failure to train or supervise constitutes deliberate indifference.walker,at.first,the plaintiff must show that a policymaker knows to a moral certainty that her employees will confront a given situation.id.citing harris,at.second,the plaintiff must show that the situation either presents the em
