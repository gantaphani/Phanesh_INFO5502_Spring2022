after a jury trial,appellant eddie samir was found guilty of committing a carjacking that resulted in the death of his.he now challenges that conviction,arguing that the evidence against him was insufficient to support the jury verdict that he had the requisite intent to commit a carjacking.he also claims that the trial judge made several erroneous evidentiary rulings,erred in excluding the testimony of a proffered expert witness on the flaws in eyewitness identification,and erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after a government agent referred in his testimony to a polygraph examination that appellant had been summoned to take.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the conviction.
appellant was a police officer for the commonwealth of puerto rico in guayama.in,he married the victim,yesenia ortiz.they had one daughter together and were then divorced in february.ortiz disappeared approximately two months later,on april,while driving her car in guayama.about two weeks after her disappearance,her car was found in an area where smoke had been seen on the night she had disappeared.the car had been intentionally burned with an accelerant,such as gasoline,and the victim body was never found.appellant quickly became a suspect in the investigation of his disappearance.during the following month,he made several incriminating admissions linking him to her murder.
on april,a grand jury indicted appellant and two for conspiracy to commit a carjacking count one,carjacking resulting in death count two,and using fire to commit the felonies of conspiracy and carjacking count three.the government later dismissed all charges against the two and counts one and three against appellant.appellant then faced one charge for committing a carjacking resulting in death,in violation of.
the jury trial began on september.during its,the government sought to describe a pattern of abuse and stalking of the victim by appellant in the months leading up to the victim disappearance.often over appellant objections,several prosecution witnesses recounted their own observations of his abuse,stalking,and threats as well as statements made by the victim describing the same.
in his defense,appellant presented alibi witnesses,including his brother,who claimed that he spent the early evening of april fishing with appellant.appellant then testified that she went to get ice cream with him when he returned from fishing.appellant also testified,denying involvement in the victim death and denying making the incriminating statements.he also denied several of the incidents of abuse and stalking described by prosecution witnesses.
at the close of evidence,appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.the court denied the motion.on september,the jury found appellant guilty of carjacking resulting in death.the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment followed by five years of supervised release this appeal followed.
although appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the intent element of the carjacking conviction,he also claims that the district court erred in the admission of certain evidence.because our resolution of those evidentiary challenges affects the body of evidence we may consider in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,we will assess the evidentiary challenges first.see united states,cir.we review a trial court decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.united states gilbert,cir.
hearsay challenges 
the statements 
appellant contends that rosa ramos,a coworker and friend of the victim,was improperly allowed to testify about hearsay statements made by the victim.hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c.under the federal rules of evidence,hearsay statements may not be admitted unless they fall within an exception or exclusion to the hearsay rules.
appellant challenges ramos testimony that the victim told her that bruises on her arm were caused by appellant and that she was afraid,afraid of him,and that she observed appellant pass the victim in a hallway and nudge her with his elbow,a seemingly minor incident that nonetheless caused the victim to become upset and to los e control.over defendant hearsay objections,the court ruled that this evidence was admissible under rule,which excepts excited utterances,or rule,which excepts statements about then existing mental,emotional,or physical condition s also known as the state of mind exception.
the government correctly concedes that the victim statements to ramos about past abuse by appellant were neither excited utterances nor admissible expressions of the victim state of mind.excited utterances are statements related to a startling event made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.there is no evidence of a startling event occurring anytime near the victim identification of her bruises or her statement that she feared appellant.we also agree that the statement identifying the cause of the victim bruises was not admissible as a statement of then existing mental,emotional,or physical condition.as for her statement that she was afraid of appellant,while it did describe an emotional condition,the government acknowledges that ortiz state of mind was not relevant to any issue in this case 
the defendant also attacks statements recounted by the victim mother,maria cristina.in particular,appellant claims that the district court erred by admitting acosta testimony that,after being confronted with her adultery,the victim accused appellant of following her everywhere and said that she could not have lunch in peace because of his stalking.appellant also claims that acosta was erroneously allowed to testify that the victim called the defendant an abuser and said that he would drop the baby at her from far away,that she was afraid the baby might drop.the government concedes that these hearsay statements were not admissible under the state of mind or excited utterance exceptions.we agree 
the protective order 
appellant also challenges the district court admission of evidence that the victim obtained a protective order against him in february.he argues that the admission of evidence of the protective order constructively amounted to admission of indirect testimonial hearsay in the form of the statements of the victim required to obtain the protective order,even though no such underlying statements were actually admitted into evidence.as such,according to appellant,the evidence about the protective order violated his rights under the confrontation clause.
we do not reach the merits of appellant novel hearsay argument because we find that appellant has waived the right to make this argument on appeal.united states rodriguez,cir a party waives a right when he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it a waived issue ordinarily can not be resurrected on appeal.evidence about the existence of the protective order was first admitted during the direct examination of the victim mother,acosta,when the government inquired about the protective order.the defendant made no objection to her testimony about the order,which included the following interchange 
acosta yesenia said that she would obtain a court protective order.and i would tell her,no,not to do it,because i got scared,was scared,and i thought that would make him even angrier,and that he could hurt her or worse.
prosecutor do you know if yesenia,in fact,requested a protective order 
acosta yes.she went and she filed it anyway.
prosecutor after that day,what conversations,if any,did you have with the defendant concerning the protective order 
acosta he went home and told me yesenia had obtained a court protective order.and he told me he knew what he would do before they disarmed him.
during of acosta,appellant counsel asked questions about the protective order later,however,appellant objected when the government sought to enter the actual protective order into evidence or,alternatively,to have the court take judicial notice of the dates the order was issued and later dismissed at the victim request.the government stated that the purpose of entering one of these two pieces of evidence was only to establish the date it was filed and later retracted.appellant then argued for the first time that the order itself picks up on her statements.the statements are testimonial for crawford purposes.
in response to appellant objection,the court suggested taking judicial notice that,she requested,and a protective order was issued february,and she requested that it be dropped,and it was dropped on the.the court pointed out,accurately,that there was already evidence about the existence of a protective order in the record.the following interchange occurred 
the court counsel,you have all the testimony in the record that he did know she had requested a protective order,and when he found out,he got all upset.come on,let do and there testimony here that she requested the protective order.
counsel for appellant i know it is true.
the court there testimony here that she requested the protective order and that the father insisted,and she withdrew it after the father insisted.what all the fuss i do understand it.
counsel for appellant so what would the court state to the jury 
the court the court will not state anything do you have any objection that i take judicial notice of the protective order,which is what is before the court 
counsel for appellant judicial notice as to the dates only,not as to the contents.
the court of course 
counsel for appellant okay.
the court do you have any objection that i take judicial notice of it 
counsel i do,your honor.
the court let do it that way then 
while appellant initial failure to object to the introduction of testimony about the existence of a protective order may have led only to forfeiture of his objection,allowing us to review the challenge for plain error,rodriguez,at united states olano,d,the subsequent compromise about judicial notice of the protective order indicates a conscious relinquishment of his objection that amounted to waiver of the right to object to the substance of the compromise.a party who identifies an issue,and then explicitly withdraws it,has waived the issue.rodriguez,at.we therefore do not reach appellant claims that the protective order relied on hearsay statements and that in so doing it violated his rights under the confrontation clause.the order may be considered as part of the body of evidence underlying appellant conviction.
rule b challenge 
appellant also argues that the district court committed error under federal rule of evidence b in admitting evidence about his prior abuse and stalking of the victim.appellant moved in limine for a determination of the admissibility of this evidence before trial.acknowledging the necessity of balancing the prejudicial effect of the evidence against the probative value of the prior conduct or bad acts,the district court determined that it was better to reserve its ruling on the motion,declaring that t he court will consider s objections to the government b evidence if and when they arise during trial.as it turned out,that opportunity never arose because appellant never again raised his objections.we therefore review his claims for plain error.
the federal rules of evidence prohibit the introduction of evidence of a person prior acts in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.therefore,evidence of prior acts may not be used for the sole purpose of proving that a defendant had a propensity to commit a crime.united states jimenez,cir.such prior act evidence is admissible,however,for other relevant purposes,such as to prove motive,intent,preparation,or plan.b.
we have previously adopted a test for evaluating the admissibility of evidence challenged under rule b.see united states,cir.first,a court must determine whether the proffered evidence has special relevance in other words,whether it is relevant to any purpose other than to prove that a defendant has a propensity to commit a crime.id.if the court finds a special relevance for the evidence,it must then evaluate it under federal rule of evidence to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice.id.
we first note that appellant brief does not make clear which items of evidence he claims were erroneously admitted in violation of rule b.nonetheless,even giving him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that he objects on rule b grounds to all of the evidence of his stalking and abuse of the victim,we find no plain error.in pretrial motions,the government set forth how it planned to use the evidence.citing supporting case law from other circuits,it claimed that the evidence was not excluded by rule b because it was inextricably intertwined with the crime charged and was necessary to provide coherence to its case.that rationale was apt.
as we note in our sufficiency of the evidence discussion,see infra part iii,the government has the particular burden in carjacking cases to prove that a defendant acted with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm to the victim at the moment of the carjacking.see.this is true here despite appellant argument that his principle defense was that colon misidentified him as the man she saw struggling with yesenia and that he was elsewhere at the time of her that he did the acts alleged but did them with innocent intent.see united states lynn,cir this circuit has maintained that intent is in issue when it is an element of the crime charged,regardless of the defense presented.
the evidence of appellant intentional physical harm of the victim in the past had special relevance,at,because it was probative of his intent to cause her harm at the time he seized her car.as we note in discussing other issues in this case,appellant was seen inside the victim car,striking her,immediately before her disappearance.although this evidence alone might arguably suffice to establish the defendant intent to cause the death of the victim at the time of the carjacking,we see no reason why the government should have been precluded from introducing some evidence of the defendant prior abuse of the victim for the purpose of further illuminating his intent to cause her death or serious bodily harm at the time of the carjacking.indeed,at closing argument,the defendant argued to the jury that the government had not proven the elements of the crime,including the intent element,and appellant now challenges on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence on the intent element specifically.
furthermore,the evidence of appellant stalking had special relevance because it demonstrated appellant motive to commit the intense jealousy.given appellant claim that he was innocent of causing the victim disappearance and death,the government was entitled to establish that motive to commit the crime.evidence of appellant stalking revealed that he was obsessed with the victim whereabouts and activities.at one point,he placed a tape recorder in her car without her knowledge.listening to her private conversations,he became convinced she was having an affair.according to the government theory,the jealousy aroused by that knowledge led appellant to kill the victim.indeed,he had previously stated to one of her friends that he was capable of killing her if he believed she were with another man.
finally,the government used the evidence of stalking to argue that appellant was able to intercept the victim car on a deserted road on april,because his constant surveillance allowed him to easily locate her.therefore,the evidence of stalking also had the special relevance of demonstrating appellant means to commit the crime.
given the special relevance of appellant physical abuse of the victim to his intent to cause her serious bodily harm or death at the time of the carjacking,and given the special relevance of the stalking to the appellant motive and means to commit the crime,there was no error in the admission of the prior act evidence.moreover,even if there was such an error,we must remember that we are dealing here with a claim of plain error,which requires us to find both prejudice and serious impairment of the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings to warrant reversal.united states ziskind,cir.in that regard,we note all of the evidence relating to appellant threats to do physical harm to the victim,which included his statement to the victim friend that he was capable of killing the victim if he believed she was with another man,his statement to the victim that i am macho,and you have to respect me,made while choking the victim and overheard by her mother,and his statement to her mother that i know what i will do before they disarm me,made upon learning about the protective order.in our view,those threats are not evidence of prior bad acts.they are more appropriately viewed as admissions by the defendant that he intended to do harm to the victim.in light of this evidence,we are confident that there was no plain error in the admission of evidence of prior abuse and stalking.
having determined which of the challenged evidence may be considered in evaluating appellant sufficiency of the evidence challenge,we now reach the merits of that challenge.in so doing,we will ignore the statements we have deemed to have been erroneously admitted.
appellant claims that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for judgment of acquittal and claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.c hallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the denial of a the motion for judgment of acquittal raise a single issue,united states morillo,cir quotation marks and citation omitted,which we review de novo.united states thompson,cir.we inquire whether,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,a reasonable factfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.thompson,at.in other words,this court must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record.united states hatch,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.a sufficiency claim therefore presents daunting hurdles for a defendant to overcome.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
appellant claims that his conviction must be overturned because the government failed to prove that he acted with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm to the victim at the moment of the carjacking.the carjacking statute under which he was convicted,reads 
whoever,with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,shipped,or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation,or attempts to do so,shall if death results,be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to life,or both,or sentenced to death.
we said in united states,cir,that the element of intent must be established at the time the defendant takes control of the motor vehicle.the judge instructed the jury to apply the standard of telling them to find appellant guilty only if the government met its burden to prove,inter alia,that the defendant intended to cause the death of yesenia when he took the motor vehicle.given this instruction,the question for us is whether the evidence permitted a reasonable jury to find the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt.
the evidence easily supports that conclusion.first,eyewitness diana colón recounted seeing appellant sitting in the passenger seat of the victim car shortly before her disappearance.the car was pulled to the side of the road and the passenger door was open.colón observed appellant striking the victim,and heard the victim say leave me alone.one of the passengers in colón car,sidia lebrón testified that she heard colón identify the victim and appellant,both of whom colón knew personally,as they drove by.this episode,in which appellant was seen inside the victim car,striking her,was the last time the victim was seen.hours later,her car was intentionally set ablaze in an abandoned field.
in addition to this eyewitness evidence,there was also the copious evidence of appellant prior threats and physical assaults against the victim,from which a reasonable jury could conclude that appellant had the intent to seriously harm or kill ortiz when he took control of her vehicle.for example,witnesses testified about appellant claims that he was capable of killing ortiz if he believed she was with another man,and the evidence showed that at the time of her disappearance he believed that she was dating another man.there was also evidence that appellant had choked the victim while yelling i am macho,and you have to respect me,and that he had once hit her so forcefully that she fell backward into a parked car.furthermore,the victim mother testified that appellant threatened that he knew what he would do before they disarmed him after the victim received the protective order.finally,the evidence also showed that appellant stalked the victim up until the night of her disappearance and was obsessed with her location and activities.for example,after the couple separation,appellant constantly phoned the victim parents home to ask where she was,often speaking in an angry and demanding manner.appellant also followed the victim and her friends during their lunch hour,and,at one point,secretly placed a tape recorder under the seat of her car so that he could record her conversations.
and then there are appellant damning admissions after the victim disappearance that linked him to her murder.on april,appellant admitted to colleagues in the puerto rico police that he had been upset and angry with the victim and a man with whom he believed she was having an affair.on april,appearing nervous and worried,he asked sergeant digno what would happen if the victim were found wearing his sweater.on june,when sergeant daniel,a longtime friend and colleague of appellant father,told appellant that there was enough evidence to file charges against him and also against his younger brother,appellant responded that he had acted alone and that his brother had not been involved.when promised not to involve the press if appellant would tell the police what had happened to the victim and take them to her body,appellant responded by promising to tell him everything related to yesenia case the next day.after that conversation,former puerto rico police commander jovito also spoke with appellant and encouraged him to confess immediately.appellant refused,saying that he wanted his family to learn what had happened first because he lived in a small town and it would create a scandal,but promised to take them to the body after speaking to his family.when miró asked appellant whether he was sorry for what he had done to yesenia,appellant responded that he was sorry.miró then told appellant that there was a helicopter waiting to take them to the body,but appellant responded that a helicopter would not be necessary to reach it 
from this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that appellant had the intent to kill or seriously harm the victim when he took control of her car on the night of april.we therefore reject his challenges to the district court denial of his rule motion for acquittal and to the sufficiency of the evidence proving that he had the requisite intent to commit a carjacking.
we now address various challenges brought by appellant that would,if successful,result in a new trial.
restrictions on impeachment 
appellant argues that the district court erred by restricting the introduction of evidence that he claims would have impeached the victim statements about his stalking and abuse.
the recorded conversations 
appellant argues that the district court erred in excluding from evidence tape recordings of the victim talking to passengers in her vehicle and on her cellular telephone while she was driving.the recordings were made by appellant months before her disappearance,by surreptitiously placing a tape recorder under the driver seat of the victim car.during direct examination of appellant,his counsel sought to play the recordings to the jury for the purpose of impeaching the hearsay statements of the victim,entered through government witnesses,that described appellant abuse.this is the hearsay testimony that the government has acknowledged was wrongly admitted.
when a hearsay statement has been admitted under rule,rule allows a party to attack the credibility of the hearsay statement by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness.appellant theorizes that the tapes impeached the victim accusations of abuse not because of what she actually said on the tapes,but because of how she said it.according to him,her tone and attitude as reflected on the tapes corroborated the fact that she was having an affair and was not,in fact,afraid of berríos.at trial,counsel for appellant argued 
yesenia in those tapes is very calm.she very cool.she is joking,she is laughing.she says that,well,he might kill me go ahead.she does sound afraid at all.she never says that i have been hit,abused.in fact,it says that when that mother fucker,if he knew who the ties were for he would kill she laughing.
the district court prohibited appellant from entering the tapes,but based its rejection of the evidence on a misreading of the rules of evidence.the court first ruled that the tapes could not be used under rule to impeach the victim allegations because she was not a declarant,stating that t he definition of declarant under the rules of evidence specifically,is a person who takes the witness stand.in fact,the rules of evidence define declarant as a person who makes a statement.b.the court later stated that the evidence was inadmissible to impeach the victim under rule because the statements appellant sought to impeach were not hearsay but rather exceptions to hearsay.this was also mistaken the admitted statements were hearsay even if,as the court ruled,the statements were excepted under rule from rule prohibition against hearsay.they thus were appropriate subjects for impeachment under rule.
however,despite the mistaken logic for excluding the tapes,there was no error in their exclusion,and we are not wedded to the lower court rationale,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.united states shinderman,cir quoting intergen grina,cir.here,the tapes were inadmissible as impeachment evidence because their contents did not contradict the statements appellant sought to impeach.see united states hale,d a basic rule of evidence provides that prior inconsistent statements may be used to impeach the credibility of a witness.as a preliminary matter,however,the court must be persuaded that the statements are indeed inconsistent.united states zaccaria,cir see also united states finley,cir rule extends the privilege of impeaching the declarant of a hearsay statement but does not obliterate the rules of evidence that govern how impeachment is to proceed.
the tapes,which were transcribed by the fbi shortly before trial,recorded the victim discussing appellant abuse and stalking.for example,she discussed on the tapes how appellant had searched her car at least two times while it was parked and how he often followed her car.the following exchange between the victim and her sister yessica,who was riding in the victim car,was recorded on the tapes 
yesenia yoa everybody feels sorry for sammy,but nobody feels sorry for me what bothers me the most is that he wants to appear as the victim.
jessica joa but,yesenia,what i saying is what we are afraid of,too is that he try to do something to you.
yoa well,jessica,let him do it.let him do it.
joa or the baby girl.
yoa he not going to do anything to the baby girl.
joa yes,but,to you 
yoa and,let him do it.what am i going to do 
joa and if he kills you or something 
yoa let him kill me 
joa but do you think he is capable of that 
yoa oh,jessica well,i do know jessica,i do know.
this is just one of the interchanges caught on tape that corroborate the government case against appellant.far from impeaching the victim alleged statements of abuse,the tapes tell the story of a young woman plagued by a possessive,stalking husband.although we have only read the transcripts of the tapes and acknowledge that appellant argument relies on the declarant tone of voice,appellant can not avoid the fact that the contents of the tapes,rather than contradicting ortiz allegations of abuse,strongly corroborate those allegations.rather than proving,as appellant asserts,that the victim was not,in fact,afraid of berríos,the tapes record the victim stating that deep inside,i am a little scared of berríos.in sum,we agree with the government that hearsay statements indicated that had abused and stalked her said nothing on the tapes even suggesting that did not do so.because the recordings do not contradict the victim hearsay allegations of abuse,there was no error in the district court exclusion of the tapes 
ortiz relationship with a district attorney 
appellant also argues that the district court abused its discretion in sustaining government objections to questions asked on of the victim mother and her about the victim alleged affair with a district attorney.appellant argues that he should have been allowed to introduce evidence that yesenia affair was with serrano in particular to impeach the inference sought by the government from the fact that a domestic violence complaint had been filed against him,to infer that the complaint was only filed because of serrano influence in the district attorney office.this inference is so insubstantial that the district court was well justified in excluding the evidence.moreover,appellant desired inquiry into the victim alleged affair with a district attorney would not meet the strictures of rule because of its high potential for prejudice compared to its low probative value.we therefore find no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to allow this inquiry,which could reasonably be seen as merely an attempt to impugn the character of the victim.
exclusion of an expert witness on eyewitness identification 
appellant argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to present testimony from an expert witness regarding the reliability of eyewitness identification.we review a decision to exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion,united states diaz,cir we are deferential toward a district court decision,united states corey,cir.
appellant sought to introduce expert testimony on the factors influencing the perception and memory of the government eyewitnesses,colón and lebrón.colón testified that she had seen appellant sitting in the victim car,striking the victim,shortly before the victim disappearance.at around on april,colón was driving with two friends from guayama town center toward a restaurant in guayama branderi ward.as she approached branderi,colón was forced to stop her car because two vehicles blocked the road.on the right side of the road,blocking her way,was a green hyundai,similar to appellant car,and on the left was a toyota,similar to the victim car.colón flashed her high beams and the green hyundai sped away.colón then moved forward slowly.as she passed the champagne toyota,she saw that its passenger door was open and the interior light was on.she saw the victim sitting in the driver seat of the vehicle and appellant in the passenger seat.colón knew the victim because her husband worked with the victim father,ánibal,and she knew appellant because of his marriage to the victim.as they passed the car,lebrón,who was a passenger in the car,heard colón say,those are ánibal daughter and.colón testified that as she drove by the toyota she heard the victim say,leave me alone,leave me alone,and saw appellant striking her.as colón continued to pass the car,appellant stopped hitting the victim and made eye contact with her.colón testified that she did not stop driving because it was dark.as they approached the restaurant and the area grew lighter and more populated,one of colón passengers called.apparently,the passenger got a busy signal and did not retry 
in a pretrial motion,appellant sought the court permission to retain geoffrey loftus,a professor of psychology and a specialist in perception and memory,as an expert witness appellant proffered that loftus would testify about the factors influencing colón and lebrón perceptions and memories of the night of april.in a written opinion,the district court denied the motion to retain loftus and ruled his testimony inadmissible.united states,d.
although appellant urges us to adopt a rule that would categorically allow expert testimony on the flaws inherent in eyewitness identification we have consistently maintained that the admission of such testimony is a matter of discretion and have refused to adopt such a blanket rule for its admission or exclusion.united states stokes,cir,vacated on other grounds,d summarily vacating in light of united states booker,d united states brien,cir.we adhere to that position.while such testimony will sometimes comply with the strictures of federal rule of evidence the rule that governs expert testimony because it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,other times it will not.see brien,at.in order to assist district courts faced with deciding whether to admit such expert testimony,we have suggested factors that influence its usefulness under rule,such as the reliability and helpfulness of the proposed expert testimony,the importance and the quality of the eyewitness evidence it addresses,and any threat of confusion,misleading of the jury,or unnecessary delay.id.at.
the district court in this case carefully considered the factors that we have set forth as relevant to the issue of whether to admit expert witnesses on eyewitness identification,d at.it first examined the importance of the eyewitness evidence that loftus sought to address.id.at.while it acknowledged that the eyewitness account was an important part of the government case,the government did not rely solely on that testimony.other important evidence included the defendant incriminating statements before and after the disappearance,and the evidence of his stalking,threats,and physical abuse of the victim.
quoting the advisory committee note accompanying rule,the district court noted that 
there is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.
id.at quoting.advisory committee notes.the district court explained that loftus had identified three issues relevant to the case the accuracy of colón original perception of the two people in the vehicle,the accuracy of colón memory of having verbally identified the vehicle occupants,and the accuracy of lebrón memory that colón identified the individuals in the car.id.at.according to the proffered report,loftus would analyze these three issues in relation to factors such as general lighting conditions,the consequences of illumination from a car interior light,the eyewitness possible lack of attention,and information,and testify that any confidence displayed by colón and lebrón should not,contrary to common sense,be construed as a reflection of the accuracy of their memories.id.quoting report of loftus.
the district court observed that these,lack of attention,and particularly susceptible to exposure through without the benefit of expert testimony.it therefore found that an expert witness on eyewitness testimony would be less helpful in this case,unlike a situation in which an identification was made after a long delay or under conditions of extreme stress,id.at citing united states harris,cir,or when the witness faculties were impaired at the time of the event,id.citing state whaley.the court concluded that loftus testimony was not relevant in the incremental sense that,if admitted,it likely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.id.quoting pepsi cola of bottling,cir.instead,loftus testimony in this case would involve little more than a credibility determination within the ken of the ordinary judge and,say,dna identification.id.quoting brien,at.
finally,the district court concluded that loftus proffered testimony had the potential to be seriously misleading in light of jurors possible tendency to give undue weight to expert testimony.the court wrote 
while often invaluable to the search for truth,these experts testimony carr ies a great deal of inherent reliability,which jurors can often confuse for infallibility.in cases such as this one,where vigorous and competent can adequately flesh out the possible effect of factors such as lighting,lack of attention,and information on the eyewitness es identifications without exposing the jury to this type of prejudice,expert testimony can,and should,be excluded.
id.at.after this careful assessment of the relevant considerations,the district court concluded that the proffered expert testimony should be excluded.this ruling was not an abuse of discretion 
denial of appellant motion for a mistrial 
appellant argues that he should have been granted a mistrial after a government witness inappropriately testified that appellant had been summoned to san juan to take a polygraph test during the course of the investigation into the victim disappearance.defense counsel immediately objected to the testimony,requested a sidebar,and moved for a mistrial.the district court denied the motion for a mistrial.after sidebar,however,in the presence of the jury,the court granted appellant request to strike the witness reference to the polygraph test and admonished the witness,saying 
y ou are to testify only what you asked.i believe you had received some instructions from the assistant attorney that you were not to go into certain you were about to go into not to volunteer any information.if you do,i going to strike your whole testimony.
also in the presence of the jury,the court admonished the government by stating,i going to allow you again to talk to the witness,advise him properly as to what are the areas that you are asking him.if he volunteers any information,the government is going to be in trouble.
after these warnings,the court adjourned for the evening.in the morning it offered a curative instruction to the jury,reiterating its instruction at the beginning of the trial that the jurors were to disregard any testimony which had been ordered stricken.it then continued 
you should totally disregard the testimony provided yesterday about a polygraph test allegedly offered to the defendant this means that you can not consider it in any way or fashion during your deliberations in this case 
to be sure,it is troubling that a polygraph test was mentioned in the presence of the jury.the defendant concern about the potentially prejudicial effect of the mention of the polygraph is understandable.polygraph results are rarely admissible at trial.see,devries paul fire and marine ins,cir reserving the question whether a per se prohibition against the use of lie detector tests is appropriate,but noting that polygraph evidence has long been considered of dubious scientific value and hence has been deemed irrelevant by the federal courts.quotation marks and citation omitted see also united states johnson,cir united states dotson,cir.
nonetheless,we disagree that the brief mention of the possibility of a polygraph examination warranted a mistrial.first,although the government witness mentioned that the defendant was summoned to take a polygraph examination,he did not say whether appellant actually took the test or describe its results.furthermore,the witness was immediately reprimanded in front of the jury and the testimony stricken.the next day,the jurors were given a lengthy curative instruction that reminded them of their duty to follow the judge instructions to disregard the testimony.swiftness in judicial response is an important element in alleviating prejudice once the jury has been exposed to improper testimony,and appellate courts inquiring into the effectiveness of a trial judge curative instructions should start with a presumption that jurors will follow a direct instruction to disregard matters improvidently brought before them.united states sepulveda.cir.
given all of these considerations,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to grant appellant motion for a mistrial.
harmlessness of other evidentiary errors 
as discussed earlier,we have concluded that the district court erroneously admitted certain statements entered through the testimony of the victim friend,ramos,and her mother,acosta.specifically,we concluded that the following statements were inadmissible the victim identification of her bruises as having been caused by appellant her statement that she was afraid of appellant her statement that appellant was an abuser her statement that appellant would throw their baby at her and her statement that she could not have lunch in peace.because these statements should not have been admitted,we did not consider them as part of the body of evidence supporting appellant conviction.nevertheless,we must now consider whether the erroneous admission of the statements was harmless.if,if appellant was prejudiced by the must be granted a new trial 
the essential inquiry in harmless error review is whether the improperly admitted evidence likely affected the outcome of the trial.united states dunbar,cir quoting united states tom,cir.this inquiry is and includes consideration of such factors as the centrality of the tainted evidence,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the use to which evidence was put,and the relative strengths of the parties cases.united states isler,cir quoting united states,cir.
the accusations were repetitious of other evidence of appellant stalking,violent threats,and violence,and were,therefore,neither unique nor central to the government proof of appellant stalking and abuse.this other evidence included acosta eyewitness account of an incident in which appellant choked the victim in the hallway of her home while saying i am macho,and you have to respect me,as well as testimony from appellant former neighbor that months before the separation she saw appellant hit the victim so hard that the victim fell backwards into a parked car.furthermore,evidence of appellant stalking came in through the testimony of the victim friends who regularly ate lunch with her and observed that appellant constantly monitored her,even up to the day of her disappearance,when he appeared during their lunch hour.there was also evidence that appellant would constantly telephone the victim parents after the separation and inquire in a menacing manner about the victim whereabouts his admissions on these phone calls revealed he was tracking the victim closely.one time,he told the victim mother,i going to give her a little time for her to return back with me.and if she does come back with me,i know what i going to do.
finally,the government case included the admissions made by appellant in the months following the victim disappearance,and the eyewitness testimony placing him in the victim car,abusing her,moments before her disappearance.in light of their lack of centrality to the government case,their redundancy,and the relative strength of the government case against appellant,we find that the statements were harmless 
although appellant life sentence means that he will never serve the term of supervised release,the sentencing guidelines instruct courts to impose a term of supervised release whenever imposing a sentence of imprisonment of one year or more.for class a felonies,the sentence should be least three years but not more than five years.terms of supervised release following life sentences are,therefore,not uncommon.see,united states mitchell,cir united states,cir united states,cir.
however,appellant is mistaken that ramos testimony that the victim lost control and started crying after appellant elbowed her in the hallway was a hearsay statement.there is no statement involved in this testimony.
we note that appellant brief,in making this argument,mischaracterizes acosta testimony.acosta did not say that the victim made these accusations after being confronted with her adultery.rather,acosta said that the victim made the allegations after being told that the defendant had surreptitiously recorded her in her car.
appellant also challenges the admission of the hearsay statements on the ground that their admission violated his rights under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.appellant concedes that the hearsay statements admitted through the testimony of ramos and acosta were not testimonial for purposes of the confrontation clause analysis set forth by the supreme court in crawford washington,d.nonetheless,he argues that we should apply the older rule of ohio roberts,d,to the hearsay and find it to be in violation of the confrontation clause because it was not introduced through a firmly rooted hearsay exception and did not bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.ohio roberts,at.however,the supreme court held in davis washington,d,that the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsay.united states earle,cir.we therefore reject appellant argument that the hearsay admitted through acosta and ramos violated his rights under the confrontation clause.
counsel for appellant pursued a line of questioning about the timing of the protective order,suggesting that ortiz had obtained the order only after her family learned that she was having an affair with another man.appellant apparently sought to minimize the effect of the protective order by suggesting that the victim accused appellant of domestic violence and filed the protective order as a means to excuse her affair.after a few questions on the matter,the district court sustained the government objection to this line of questioning.
in a criminal case,the court shall instruct the jury that it may,but is not required to,accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.g.it is therefore not clear why the judge stated that he would not state anything about the fact to the jury.
in the end,however,the judge silence on the significance of judicial notice did not matter.the evidence of the dates of the protective order resulting from the court judicial notice was never given to the jury.
the court instruction on the elements of the charged crime was now in order for the defendant to be found guilty of that offense,which i just read to you,the government has to prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt first,that the defendant took a motor vehicle from the person of yesenia.second,that the defendant did so by force and violence.third,that the motor vehicle previously had been transported,shipped,or received in interstate commerce.fourth,t hat the defendant intended to cause the death of yesenia when he took the motor vehicle.and last,that as a death resulted from the commission of the closing argument,the government argued to the jury that it should find the defendant guilty if it found,inter alia,that the defendant had the intent to murder yesenia when he took the car.
after this conversation,appellant spoke to his father and aunt alone.appellant aunt called a lawyer,who also arrived and spoke with appellant.after speaking with his family and his lawyer,appellant made no more incriminating statements.
we fail to see how the victim alleged affair during this time would impeach her statements about appellant abuse.
evidence at trial showed that appellant searched ortiz car while it was parked at her office in february and was upset to find men ties,which he believed were a gift for another man.
the government argues that there are other reasons for excluding the tapes,citing the rule against impeachment on a collateral matter through extrinsic evidence and,in light of the fact that there is no question that the recordings were made illegally,the federal statute prohibiting use of illegally made recordings in legal proceedings.see.because we have determined that the tapes did not contain prior inconsistent statements,however,we need not address these alternative grounds for exclusion.
lebrón gave testimony about the incident that was consistent with colón testimony.however,although she saw a man and woman in
