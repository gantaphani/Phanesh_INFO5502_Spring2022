before us are a pair of interlocutory appeals in a criminal case.both grow out of a federal indictment filed on october,charging paul decologero and six associates with criminal racketeering in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act rico,c conspiracy to violate rico,id.d and an array of related crimes.we refer to paul decologero as decologero even though several have the same last name.
the government alleged that decologero headed a criminal enterprise the decologero crew that used brutal tactics to gain control of a portion of boston drug trade and murdered a woman aislin silva when the members thought she might betray them.in addition to the rico counts,the indictment specified a number of federal crimes charged in separate counts involving drugs,guns,robberies,the case of the slain for the purpose of witness tampering.
rico violations require not only participation in a criminal enterprise but also participation in a pattern of racketeering activity,which in turn requires proof of at least two of a list of specified federal or state crimes,murder,extortion,robbery,drug trafficking.in jargon,such acts are called predicate acts or racketeering acts ras,and,in this indictment,a number of the acts charged as federal crimes in separate counts of the indictment were restated as ras in support of the rico counts.a table listing the ras is attached to this decision.
nominally the indictment identified fourteen separate ras,but several had subparts,each constituting a sufficient predicate act under rico for example,the attempted and ultimately successful murder of the woman was expressed in ra as five separate crimes,subpart was conspiracy to murder under state law,subpart was attempt to murder under state law.the indictment thus effectively contained predicate acts only partly overlapping with the substantive counts because some counts were not ras and some ras,state crimes were not counts.different defendants were implicated in different ras only paul decologero was implicated in all.
four years before the present indictment was filed,decologero had been acquitted of rico violations in united states carrozza,crim,wl.following the present indictment,decologero moved to dismiss the new rico charges against him and one drug conspiracy count on double jeopardy grounds.the district court rejected this claim,finding that the rico violations alleged in carrozza were different than those charged in the current case.decologero now appeals from this ruling under,the denial of a double jeopardy defense being immediately appealable.abney united states,d.
at one of the hearings,the district court had expressed concern that the scope of the number of counts,ras and criminal charging a jury and having them understand virtually impossible.then,in an oral ruling at a further conference,the district court without further explanation sua sponte divided the case as described immediately below into two separate trials.on motion by the government for reconsideration,the court entered a written order adhering to the separation,saying 
i t is necessary to divide this case into separate trials,pursuant to this court inherent authority and responsibility for managing trials before it so as to protect the interests of the parties and the public in just determination of a criminal proceeding with simplicity in procedure,fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.united states shea,quoting.
the district court ruling divided the charges in the indictment into two separate trials,ordering that three substantive counts involving robberies and unlawful possession of firearms be postponed until a second trial at some unspecified date further,the court ordered that four of the fourteen racketeering acts that the government included as predicate acts for the rico charges be postponed until this second trial.see attached chart.this left ten ras and seventeen substantive counts for the first trial the government had voluntarily dismissed three firearms counts.
the government then filed a from the court decision to postpone four of the ras until a later trial,arguing that this order effectively dismissed and foreclosed the four postponed ras since double jeopardy doctrine would prevent the government from bringing rico charges based on these ras in a later trial.alternatively,the government said that the order exceeded the district court case management authority.the district court stayed trial pending the resolution of the appeals.
before us now are three difficult questions the merits of decologero double jeopardy claim which is clearly appealable now under abney,at.whether we have jurisdiction over the government contesting the case management order the defendants dispute jurisdiction and,if so,whether the district court exceeded its authority in its division of the case insofar as it limited the ras available to the government in the first trial.we address the questions in that order.
double jeopardy.decologero argues that,having been acquitted of the rico charges in carrozza,he is shielded by the constitution prohibition of double jeopardy from the rico charges although not necessarily from the counts in the present case.this is so if,but only if,the rico charges in the two cases are the same.const.amend.v see,united states marino,cir.based on a comparison of the two indictments as drafted and the proffer of evidence by the government,we conclude that the new rico charges are not barred.
the carrozza indictment charged nine defendants with conducting the affairs of the patriarca family of la cosa nostra through a pattern of racketeering.la cosa nostra is the notorious crime syndicate also known as the mafia.the patriarca family,a new england branch of this organization,was headed by raymond patriarca until,at which point francis salemme was the.the carrozza defendants were charged with attempting to usurp control of the patriarca family from salemme after patriarca death.see marino,at detailing evidence in carrozza case.
the carrozza indictment covered the period from to,although evidence of events occurring through was presented at trial.decologero was charged in eight substantive counts,including rico and rico conspiracy,conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder,various firearms charges,and a cocaine distribution conspiracy.the rico counts listed him as a participant in only three of the fourteen ras conspiracy to murder fourteen individuals,attempted murder,and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.he was acquitted of all charges in.
the present indictment charges the defendants with participating in a nominally different decologero crew said by the government to be a separate entity from the patriarca la cosa nostra lcn family,yet structured in a similar manner to a crew or regime of la cosa nostra and aligned with the carrozza faction of the patriarca family.according to the charge,the decologero crew aim was controlling,supervising,and financing illegal activities,including generating money through robbery and drug sales for the personal use of members and to build up a war chest of firearms,weapons,and ammunition which was to be used,in part,to support the carrozza faction.
if the double jeopardy problem turned solely on whether the two cases involved the same enterprise,we would be faced with a hard question.the rico statute loosely defines an enterprise to include not only any legal entity,a corporation but also any union or group of individuals associated in fact.although the decologero indictment alleges that the carrozza faction and decologero crew were separate enterprises,the proffered evidence could support the view that both were part of a vertically organized endeavor,with decologero somewhere in the middle of the organizational pyramid.
past cases have stressed that conspiracies can not be artificially broken up for the purpose of bringing separate cases,see braverman united states,and there is no reason why the rule should be any different for rico enterprises.but whether there was one enterprise or two need not be resolved.every circuit to have examined the issue has agreed that double jeopardy only bars successive rico charges involving both the same enterprise and the same pattern of racketeering activity in our view the current rico charges do involve a different pattern than the old.
in deciding whether two patterns are the same for double jeopardy purposes,other circuits all employ some variation of a totality of the circumstances analysis,using factors not necessarily those used in evaluating the identity of conspiracies.see united states,cir conspiracy,cert.denied,d united states dean,cir rico.these factors include the time,the place,the people,and the nature and scope of the activities involved in each indictment.
here,little overlap exists in the type of crimes centrally charged as racketeering acts in the two cases.the carrozza indictment ras focused on the systematic murder of rival mafia pattern of murders and attempted murders of members of the salemme faction including attempted murder of francis salemme to seize control of the patriarca crime family.the specific ras alleged include conspiracy to murder fourteen people,attempted murder of six,and successful murder of two,as well as a cocaine conspiracy and several charges.in the present indictment,the only murder alleged was committed simply as part of a failed attempt incident to the crew main activities 
the murder aside,the ras alleged in the current case centered on robbery and drug trafficking,primarily the former.by contrast,not a single carrozza ra involved robbery.thus,while the pattern in carrozza could be viewed primarily as murders connected by an aim to secure power,the pattern in the present case appears to be a more conventional collection of robberies and drug trafficking offenses,the single murder being merely a means of protecting the conspiracy from the police.
the other of persons,time,and less but do not preclude the conclusion that the two patterns are different.the carrozza indictment identified eight defendants paul is the only member of the decologero crew who was charged in carrozza,there as a subordinate member of the carrozza faction rather than as a leader of his own crew.still,the carrozza indictment named one fnu first name unknown decologero among the thirty unindicted,so at least one and perhaps more of the other defendants in the current case may have been involved.
as for time and place,the locations involved in the two indictments are basically the greater boston the time periods overlap only slightly.the carrozza indictment alleged rico violations that ran from though,although at trial the government offered proof that the conspiracy to obtain power continued through january.the present indictment alleges that the decologero crew operated from through the beginning of.again,this is consistent with the view that there may have been one enterprise but does not disturb the conclusion that there were two patterns.
in summary,all of the incidents constituting substantive crimes and all of the ras in the present indictment are different from those charged in the carrozza case.whether the enterprise in the two cases is the same may be open to debate,but the pattern is different,which defeats the double jeopardy claim.whether any of the background evidence offered in the first trial is relevant and admissible in the second is a matter for the district judge.
decologero argues alternatively that collateral estoppel prohibits the present rico charges against him or at the very least precludes the government from making any reference to the war for control of the patriarca family.see ashe swenson,d.our authority on decologero appeal is based on his double jeopardy claim and we decline to consider other issues even if we could.see swint chambers county comm n,d.the district court can consider in due course what effect,if any,collateral estoppel doctrine may have appeal of the scheduling order.the government is directed to the scheduling order issued sua sponte by the trial court,citing the court inherent authority and responsibility for managing trials.the court ordered that three substantive counts and four racketeering acts be postponed until a second trial at some unspecified later date the rest of the case would be tried at the first trial.the government motion for reconsideration was denied.
on its interlocutory appeal,the government does not formally contest the postponement of substantive counts to a second trial,but only the exclusion of four ras.the government says that if this court orders the four ras to be reinstated for the first trial,the district court may well decide to reinstate the postponed counts directed to the same acts obviously,it would do little to reduce complexity at the trial if the counts are postponed but the ras remain to be proven by the same evidence.
an order severing or deferring counts is generally not immediately appealable.see united states bloom,cir.by contrast,the court treatment of the ras presents a puzzle on both and the we start naturally with the former.to understand just what the district court did and how it matters requires additional both to the jurisdictional question and to the merits.
as explained earlier,the original indictment listed fourteen ras but,with subparts,amounted effectively to different acts decologero was charged in all fourteen of the ras of the other defendants,one was named in nine,one in seven,and the remaining two defendants were named in four each.see attached chart.the ras not only involved separate criminal acts but were violations of over a dozen different federal and state statutes,murder,robbery each of which would require instructions to the jury as to the elements of the crime.
before making her sua sponte ruling,the district judge expressed fear that the level of complexity of the case makes charging a jury and having them understand virtually impossible,and noted that she had a fervent desire to try a piece of the case first.in her later ruling,she selected two specific and on the attached be postponed until some unspecified later date presumably the same time as the trial of the severed substantive counts.both excluded ras involved robberies in violation of the same state and federal statutes as the robberies charged in ras and,which were not postponed.
the court also ordered the government to select two more ras to be postponed,listing four from which to of these ras involved robberies and one involved conspiracy to collect credit by extortionate means.the criterion for exclusion of both counts and ras appeared to be how closely related they were to the murder of silva the district judge repeatedly asked the government to explain how the counts and ras related to silva,and for instance stated that two specific counts would be included in the first trial on the representation that those are guns in silva apartment.if they are not,then those counts do not go forward.
the statute governing appeals by the united states in criminal cases,allows interlocutory appeals in specified situations,two of which are invoked by the government in this case.the first paragraph of the statute allows in pertinent part an appeal from a district court dismissal of an indictment as to any one or more counts,or any part thereof the any part language having been added in in part to resolve a circuit split about the appealability of dismissed ras.see,div.b,tit.iii,stat.
the second paragraph of the statute permits inter alia an appeal from a district court order suppressing or excluding evidence,if made before trial specifically,not after the defendant has been put in jeopardy.the most familiar target of such appeals are orders suppressing evidence as unlawfully seized but the provision equally allows appeal from in limine orders excluding evidence on any ground,because prejudice outweighs probative value under.united states king,cir.
at first blush,the statute first paragraph appears to cover the district court order excluding ras as dismissal of part of a count.of course,the district court here did not purport to dismiss the ras with the three substantive to postpone them to a second trial.on the principle that substance rather than form should preva
