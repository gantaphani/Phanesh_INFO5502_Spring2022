this is a case about soda pop and seawater.in,the csx expedition expedition,a ship bound for port elizabeth,new jersey,docked in san juan,puerto rico to load additional freight.the new cargo included three steel enclosures the containers in which a large volume of phosphoric acid concentrate from which pepsi is been stored for shipment.during the journey,one of the containers was flooded under ten feet of ballast water,while the other two containers were partly submerged.after the expedition reached port elizabeth,the consignee,pepsi cola company pepsi,examined the cargo and accepted the two containers that had only been partially immersed.but,insisting that the integrity of its contents had been compromised,pepsi rejected the container that had been fully submerged.csx lines,csx,which owned and operated the expedition,retained a cargo surveyor who independently inspected the cargo and disputed pepsi assessment.despite the disagreement,pepsi disposed of the contents of the container in late september.
as subrogee of pepsi,appellant atlantic mutual insurance company,atlantic mutual,subsequently brought suit against the expedition,csx,and hyundai mipo dockyard,alleging,inter alia,negligence and breach of contract.in due course,appellees moved for summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,and atlantic mutual subsequently filed a seeking summary judgment as well.the district court mckenna,granted summary judgment to appellees on the grounds that atlantic mutual had failed to submit sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of liability under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa,app.et seq atlantic mutual appeals.
background 
on august,concentrate manufacturing operations pepsico,shipped three containers,numbered seau,seau,and msku,to port elizabeth,new jersey.they were stowed in cargo hold.each of them contained hundreds of plastic pails of phosphoric acid solution from which millions of servings of soda,pepsi,were to be produced.
at on august,three hours after the expedition had left port,ballast tank was intentionally filled with seawater to steady the vessel.later that morning,at approximately,crew members discovered that ballast water had flowed through a starboard opening in tank and flooded cargo hold,where pepsi three steel containers had been placed.by the time the crew detected the flooding,the hold had been filled with roughly ten feet of seawater.although two of pepsi three containers,seau and seau,were only partially submerged,the third container,msku,had been stowed on the bottom tier of the flooded chamber,and,as a result,had been fully submerged for about nine hours.that container held pails of pepsi free concentrate and was shipped pursuant to a bill of lading that expressly incorporated,and was therefore controlled by,the carriage of goods by sea act,app.et seq 
according to atlantic mutual,the container,by virtue of being immersed in ten feet of ballast water for a prolonged period of time,had been severely distorted and deformed and was split on the left side panel near the rear of the container.shortly after the expedition docked in port elizabeth on august,party insured by atlantic mutual and the consignee of the the containers.although pepsi decided to accept the contents of the two containers that had only been partly submerged,it promptly rejected the cargo shipped in container msku,stating that the entire container and contents had been fully submerged and the container itself badly damaged.
on august,lew silver,senior manager of quality for pepsi,examined the contents of the submerged container on pepsi behalf and provided his assessment of the condition of the cargo.he found that the damage to the container seemed to be consistent with the forces of external water pressure substantial enough to distort and tear the steel.silver observed that water had penetrated the surrounding the pails,that the top and sides of these plastic drums,made of high density polyethylene,were completely wet,and that most of the metal caps exhibited varying degrees of rust as a result.in his report,he added i observed that the pallets along the left side of the container,which was bowed and creased inward,suffered some crushing damage.since the pails are made of plastic,any pressure on them from crushing would have caused the spout to deform and the seal around the metal cap to become displaced.on the basis of these observations,and because neither the pails nor the caps were,in silver view,designed to be submerged in ballast water during transit,silver concluded that seawater may have entered into the pails and adulterated the concentrate within.accordingly,he declared the concentrate unfit for use in so doing,he emphasized that the cargo was meant to produce millions of servings of soda destined for human consumption.
silver appraisal of the damage to the cargo did not go uncontested.csx dispatched cargo surveyor,richard allen,to assess what,if any,damage the container and its contents had suffered as a result of the flooding.allen examined the shipment on august,at a warehouse in edison,new jersey to which it had been transported.according to allen deposition,the cargo appeared to be in the same stow configuration as it had been at loading.although he conceded that there were indications that the external surface of the containers had been exposed to ballast water,allen contended that the available evidence did not demonstrate that the pails containing the concentrate had been breached 
examination of the pails revealed that they had been submerged in seawater.there was visible evidence of water accumulation in the folds of the plastic wrap as well as water on the tops of the individuals pails.the metal tab seals showed varying degrees of rust ranging from none to heavy in some areas.the presence of rust on some of the sealing caps did not,in my opinion,indicate that the integrity of the seals had been compromised.upon inspection,the rust was clearly cosmetic.
on the same day as his inspections,allen also asked for an opportunity to examine the concentrate directly.according to allen,pepsi refused the request though pepsi maintains that allen would only have been barred from taking a sample of pepsi free concentrate away from the site concurrently with the refusal,allen was informed that all pails would be destroyed since the contents of the pails had been contaminated because the pails had been submerged in seawater.atlantic mutual confirmed this intention in a september,letter to allen,explaining that the concentrate would probably be destroyed early next week before the lids start popping off.the letter continued if this occurs we will have to have hazmat dispose of it at an expensive cost.in addition,atlantic mutual offered to meet allen at the warehouse if he wanted another opportunity to examine the cargo allen immediately responded to atlantic mutual september letter,explaining that there had been no demonstration of contamination to the product other then sic wetting of the exterior of the pails.he insisted that atlantic mutual agree to a joint examination of the shipment and cautioned that allowing the shipment to remain as is will in all probability result in progressive rusting of the metal caps which could have an effect on the contents.
two days later,allen returned to conduct further examination of the pails exterior and observed considerable progressive rust damage.he was allegedly again prohibited from removing the phosphoric acid solution from the sealed containers,but he examined the tab seals on the pails and found them to be tight with no evidence of movement or loosening and no evidence that the seal had been compromised.based on this second examination,allen reiterated in a letter dated september,that he could not concur with pepsi rejection of the cargo or with its decision to destroy pails of pepsi free concentrate.in this letter,allen yet again asked for samples from the putatively contaminated pails for further examination and testing if necessary.the request went unanswered,and the concentrate was burned at the end of september.by that time,pepsi had submitted a claim to csx for the invoice price of the pails of pepsi concentrate,and for the costs of shipping and destroying the ostensibly unusable cargo 
subrogating to pepsi claim,atlantic mutual brought suit against appellees for,inter alia,negligence and breach of contract.appellees moved for summary judgment under fed.civ.pro.c,and atlantic mutual entered its for summary judgment.the district court mckenna,granted appellees motion and denied atlantic mutual.see atlantic mut.ins.csx expedition,civ.lmm,wl,atlantic mutual ii.the court concluded that atlantic mutual had not satisfied its initial cogsa burden of establishing a prima facie case of liability.specifically,the court found that atlantic mutual uncontested evidence that the pails had been fully submerged in seawater and that the tab seals on the pails were rusted in varying degrees did not sufficiently establish a prima facie case of liability.atlantic mutual ii,wl,at.in the district court view,the fear of contamination was premised only on a specific gravity test conducted on one sample from one pail outside the presence of the defendants under unspecified conditions.id.at.
apart from the court misgivings about the validity of the specific gravity test,the court decided that it would be prejudicial to consider the results of this test since pepsi had precluded appellees from conducting an independent analysis of the contents of the pails,purportedly to protect its secret and formula and control practices.id.quoting pl.count.statement.having excluded the results of the specific gravity test,the court held that atlantic mutual had failed to demonstrate,as cogsa requires for a prima facie case of liability,that its cargo was damaged upon delivery.as a consequence,the court dismissed atlantic mutual claims and entered summary judgment in favor of appellees.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.sec.ins.of hartford old dominion freight line,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.pro.c.the burden of showing that no genuine factual dispute exists rests on the party seeking summary judgment,and in assessing the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to a material fact,the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.sec.ins.of hartford,at internal citations omitted.this standard applies equally to cases,like the instant one,in which both parties applied for summary judgment,and in which the district court granted one motion and denied the other.see morales quintel entm t,cir.
to recover against a carrier for damage to goods shipped pursuant to a bill of lading governed by cogsa,a plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving both delivery of goods to the carrier in good condition,and outturn by the carrier in damaged condition.transatlantic marine claims agency,oocl inspiration,cir quoting vana trading mette skou,cir.we have held that the issuance of a clean bill of lading creates a presumption of delivery in good condition favorable to the plaintiff.transatlantic marine claims agency,at.we have also stressed that the plaintiff has the burden,which remains with it throughout the case,of proving that the goods were damaged while in the carrier custody.caemint food,brasileiro,cir quoting hide nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha.it is only once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that one of the statutory cogsa exceptions to liability applies.see.
in the case before us,appellees do not disagree that the cargo was entrusted to them in good condition what is disputed is what must be proven to establish damages for the purposes of prima facie liability under cogsa,and,hence,whether the concentrate was damaged upon delivery.with respect to these issues,the district court concluded b ecause the specific gravity test conducted by pepsi is the only evidence that could support plaintiff contention that the cargo was damaged upon delivery plaintiff has not established a prima facie case for liability.atlantic mutual ii,wl,at emphasis added.
on appeal,appellant argues the district court erred in excluding the results of the specific gravity test,the specific gravity test,along with evidence of damage to the exterior of the steel container and plastic pails,was enough to establish,at summary judgment,that the cargo was damaged upon delivery,and the loss of the soda concentrate market value,it to its immersion,was sufficient to demonstrate that appellant cargo was damaged upon delivery.because we hold that atlantic mutual evidence of loss of market value establishes,by itself,adequate proof of damage to set out a prima facie case of liability under cogsa,we need not decide whether the district court wrongly excluded the specific gravity test or whether,with or without the results of the challenged test,there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of contamination to survive summary judgment.accordingly,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment,and remand the case for further proceedings.
in order to satisfy the damage upon delivery condition of prima facie liability for a cogsa cause of action,to prove that the goods were damaged while in the carrier custody,caemint food,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,a plaintiff must present evidence a that the cargo was damaged,and b that the damage occurred while the cargo was under the carrier control and not because of any inherent vice of the cargo.siderius amilla,cir citation omitted.in the case before us,the second focuses on when the cargo was damaged,and consequently,whether the damages may be properly attributed to the carrier alleged not in serious dispute.in fact,after csx initially asserted that it had been diligent but nonetheless failed to detect the latent defect in the bilge system that ostensibly caused the flooding of hold,csx filed a revised rule statement in which it acknowledged that due diligence was not exercised,thereby admitting fault and leaving open only the question of whether atlantic mutual cargo suffered damage as a result of appellees negligence.atlantic mutual ii,wl,at.
with respect,instead,to this the pepsi free concentrate in question was actually contend a that atlantic mutual has failed to proffer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the phosphoric acid solution contained in the sealed pails was contaminated by ballast water,and b that atlantic mutual repeated refusals to allow appellees to inspect and directly test the concentrate for themselves precluded a fair appraisal of the supposed damages.because there is an independent ground on which this appeal must be decided in favor of appellant,we need not,however,address either of these contentions by appellees.
it is that the loss in market value of a plaintiff cargo is the presumptive measure of damages in a suit brought under cogsa.see messiniaki aigli,cir generally,the measure of damages is the difference between the fair market value of the goods at their destination in the condition in which they should have arrived and the fair market value in the condition in which they actually did arrive.see also jessica howard norfolk southern ry,cir the carriage of goods by sea act caps a carrier liability at the amount of damage actually sustained,a phrase that courts have interpreted ordinarily to measure damages at the market price of the cargo at the place of destination on the date when it should have arrived.internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
since loss in market value is the ordinary yardstick of damages in a cogsa suit,we believe that evidence of a significantly discounted market value must also suffice to show damage to a plaintiff cargo for the purposes of establishing prima facie cogsa liability.to hold otherwise would produce a bizarre set of rules evidence of market loss would typically be highly relevant at the damages stage of a suit on the issue of how much compensation a plaintiff should receive.but at th
