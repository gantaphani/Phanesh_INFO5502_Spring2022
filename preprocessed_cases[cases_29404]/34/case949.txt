this appeal raises the question of whether a suspect in custody and informed of his rights in accordance with miranda arizona,d,is entitled to the prophylactic bar prohibiting police questioning established in edwards arizona,d right to counsel,and michigan mosley,d right to silence,when he expresses uncertainty with regard to asserting his fifth amendment rights while contemporaneously refusing to sign a waiver of rights form.we believe he is entitled to the prophylaxis and affirm the district court.by unequivocally refusing to sign the waiver form in response to a custodial agent instruction to sign the waiver form if defendant agreed with it,defendant in this case invoked his fifth amendment rights,and therefore his custodial agents were required to refrain from further interrogation.
background 
investigating child pornography possession and internet trafficking,fbi special agents joseph mcardle and james mccaffery visited the home of gordon plugh in rochester,new york,on july.the agents questioned plugh regarding possession of child pornography on his computer and,upon obtaining plugh permission,searched the computer.upon finding child pornography on the hard drive,the fbi obtained an arrest warrant for plugh,and five special agents,including mcardle,arrested plugh at his father residence in wayland,new york,on september.upon handcuffing plugh,mcardle read plugh his fifth amendment rights and asked plugh to sign an form 
according to mcardle,mcardle asked,is that true are you willing to do that the district court found that mcardle had stated to plugh that i f you agree with the statement you can sign the form.united states plugh,d.plugh stated he understood his rights because he was a former arizona department of corrections officer and according to mcardle stated,i am not sure if i should be talking to you,and i do know if i need a lawyer.plugh did not sign the waiver and stated that he did not want to sign anything at that time.agent mcardle wrote refused to sign on the form and then signed the form himself.mcardle testified that plugh refusal to sign was unequivocal.none of the agents asked plugh any further questions while in plugh father home.
during the drive to the fbi office in rochester,the agents transporting plugh told plugh he had been arrested because child pornography had been found on his hard drive.according to the fbi report dictated the day after plugh arrest and signed by mcardle,plugh asked the agents several times for advice on what to do.according to mcardle,the agents stated that they would relay any cooperation made by plugh to the assistant attorney on the case.the agents then told plugh that if plugh wanted to talk about the case,the agents would again advise plugh of his miranda rights,but also told him that they were not going to talk about the case at that point.
when the agents and plugh arrived at the fbi office,the agents placed plugh in a back interview room.they informed plugh that they were about to take him to the marshals for booking and that i f he wanted to make any statements this was the point plugh then indicated he would make statements,and he was of his miranda rights.plugh did not ask for an attorney or indicate he wanted to speak to law enforcement.he then made inculpatory statements regarding downloading and possessing child pornography and admitted to lying to the agents about the existence of a trojan virus on his computer.
plugh was indicted on january,under a a receipt of child pornography and a b possession of child pornography.plugh moved to suppress his july,and september,statements to the fbi,as well as physical evidence seized on july.plugh argued that his statements were involuntary,the product of coercion and violative of the right to counsel.the united states district court for the western district of new york siragusa,denied the motion to suppress the july statements and physical evidence but granted the motion to suppress the september statements.plugh,d at.the district court held that plugh refusal to sign the waiver form was an unequivocal invocation of plugh right to counsel and to remain silent,and that suppression of plugh statements was proper because the officers did not scrupulously honor plugh rights when they repeatedly told plugh that any cooperation would be brought to the attention of the ausa and by telling plugh that he was about to be taken to the marshal office.id.at.the district court noted that even if plugh invoked his right to counsel and his right to remain silent equivocally or ambiguously.suppression was nonetheless required since the agents,at least as to the defendant right to remain silent,failed to limit themselves to narrow questions only for the purpose of clarifying the ambiguity,as required by this circuit under united states ramirez,cir.plugh,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
on appeal the government acknowledges that plugh was clear he did not wish to sign anything,including the waiver,at the time he was arrested at his father home.regardless of that acknowledgment,the government contends that plugh invocation of his fifth amendment rights was not unequivocal and unambiguous.the government constructs its argument on the language the supreme court employed in davis united states,d.
we are called upon to determine whether plugh retained his right to remain silent and his right to counsel by refusing to sign the form when asked by agent mcardle to sign the form if he agreed with its contents,notwithstanding his statements immediately prior that he was not certain he wanted to talk to a lawyer or that he should talk to the interrogating agents.as we see it,we must answer two questions whether plugh refusal to sign the waiver form in this context was an invocation of his fifth amendment rights and if yes,whether the agents,subsequent to plugh refusal to sign the waiver form,properly complied with the prophylactic rules requiring the police to refrain from questioning.we find that the prophylactic rules were applicable to plugh and that the agents did not properly abide by those rules we therefore affirm the district court order suppressing the september,statements.
whether plugh invoked his fifth amendment rights 
a.the fifth amendment protections 
a suspect can not be required to incriminate himself.const.amend.encapsulated in this protection are certain rights the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney,either appointed or retained.see miranda arizona,d.more than forty years ago,the miranda court noted that the prosecution may not use statements made by a suspect under custodial interrogation unless the suspect has been apprised of his fifth amendment rights and the suspect knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waived those rights.id.at.the supreme court in the years following miranda fleshed out the judicial mechanisms for ensuring the viability of these constitutional protections.included among them is the principle that courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights,north carolina butler,d,until the government proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence,colorado connelly,d.put differently,unless the suspect validly waived his rights,we presume he retains them.
cases in this area of the law are fact intensive because of the number of combinations of the circumstances preceding a suspect interrogation the method and manner by which a suspect is informed of his or her miranda rights and the timing of the suspect the time he receives the warnings or later during the interrogation following an initial waiver 
to honor a suspect fifth amendment rights,custodial officers must abide by several prophylactic rules designed to protect the fifth amendment rights that come into play once the suspect is in custody.under miranda prophylactic protection of the right against compelled,any suspect subject to custodial interrogation has the right to have a lawyer present if he so requests,and to be advised of that right.montejo louisiana,d.
there are additional layers of prophylactic protection.once a suspect invokes his fifth amendment rights he is entitled to a second layer of prophylaxis that has its roots in edwards arizona.under edwards prophylactic protection of the miranda right,once such a defendant has invoked his right to have counsel present,interrogation must stop.montejo.at internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,if the suspect initially decides after receiving the warnings that he wishes to remain silent,the custodial officers must scrupulously honor his right to cut off questioning.michigan mosley,d.
an exception to the rule occurs when it is not clear from a suspect statements or conduct whether he is asserting his rights.in such cases,custodial officers may ask clarifying questions to determine if a suspect is exercising his rights.see ramirez,at.but because the default presumption is that a suspect retains his rights and the burden is on the government to prove otherwise,custodial officers who press on with questioning assuming that a suspect statements or conduct are not indications of the suspect desire to retain his fifth amendment rights do so at the risk of suppression of the suspect subsequent statements.
law applicable to determining if plugh invoked his fifth amendment rights 
in this case,the agents presented plugh with a waiver form and no one disputes that plugh refused to sign it.what then are the implications of plugh refusal 
in united states quiroz,this court addressed whether refusal to sign a waiver form may constitute an invocation of a suspect fifth amendment rights.cir.there,the custodial officer asked suspect quiroz to read the forms,asked whether he understood the forms,and simply asked quiroz to sign them.at.quiroz declined to sign until he had spoken to an attorney.id.at.finding that the statement was a direct and complete response to the precise question quiroz had been asked,the court determined that the prophylactic requirement that custodial officers refrain from questioning was triggered at that moment.id.at.the quiroz court had 
no doubt whatever that,had quiroz signed,the custodial officer would have viewed that act as a complete waiver of quiroz rights.we can see no good reason not to treat quiroz refusal to sign forms in the absence of counsel as a refusal that was coextensive with the waiver the custodial officer sought.
in sum,we do not view quiroz refusal to sign the forms as a limited request for counsel,any more than the custodial officer request to sign the forms was a request for a limited waiver.since we do not view quiroz statement as narrower than the custodial officer request,we see no ambiguity.
quiroz instructs us,therefore,a suspect prior or simultaneous affirmative announcements of his willingness to speak,connecticut barrett,d when a custodial officer specifically asks a suspect if he will waive his rights by signing a form and does so in such a way that the accused would interpret a refusal to sign as a negative answer,the suspect has taken sufficient action to trigger the edwards prophylactic rule and the officers must refrain from questioning the suspect 
c.did plugh invoke his fifth amendment rights 
under quiroz,the question is whether plugh refusal to sign the form in light of the agent question is that true are you willing to do that following his statements i am not sure if i should be talking to you,and i do know if i need a lawyer were an invocation of his rights.
while plugh statements,i am not sure if i should be talking to you and i do know if i need a lawyer,appear ambiguous,plugh ultimate refusal to an unequivocally negative answer to the question posed together by the waiver form and mcardle,namely,whether he was willing to waive his rights.mcardle direction to plugh that i f you agree with the statement you can sign the form,plugh,d at,makes the meaning of plugh response less ambiguous than the defendant refusal to sign in quiroz,where the officer simply asked would you mind just signing these quiroz,at.plugh answer in this context,under quiroz,amounts to an invocation,and that is where the inquiry ends because plugh invoked his rights,the custodial officers should have refrained from reinitiating the interrogation,and all subsequent statements made by plugh were properly suppressed see part,infra.
applicability of davis united states 
the government,looking to language in davis united states,d,takes the view that an initial invocation of one fifth amendment rights such as plugh must be unambiguous and that the ambiguity is resolved against plugh.the government argues that plugh did not unambiguously invoke his rights and that therefore,the agents were free to continue to question him.this view seriously misunderstands the sweep of davis 
in davis,the supreme court held that if a defendant validly waives his fifth amendment rights initially and then thereafter attempts to invoke those rights,the defendant bears the burden of showing that the invocation was unambiguous and unequivocal to trigger the prophylaxis rules.davis,at.accord diaz senkowski,cir.davis does not instruct courts how to analyze an initial invocation of one fifth amendment rights following the miranda warnings where no waiver occurred.in our view,davis only provides guidance for circumstances in which a defendant makes a claim that he subsequently invoked previously waived fifth amendment rights.
in order to use statements made by a suspect without counsel present while under custodial interrogation,the burden is on the government to prove the suspect waived his rights.see connelly,at.once the government has met its burden,the suspect has the burden of proving that he resurrected rights previously waived.the invocation must be unambiguous and unequivocal.to avoid difficulties of proof and to provide guidance to officers conducting interrogations,this is an objective inquiry.davis,at.
the court fashioned the rule to avoid transform ing the miranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate police investigative activity.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the rule ensures that a suspect does not use the fifth amendment as a sword to excise unfavorable evidence after discarding it as a shield.
the davis court was careful to note that only after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the miranda rights,law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney.davis,at.emphasis added see also id.at.noting that an ambiguous reference to an attorney would not compel the cessation of questioning emphasis added id.noting that a statement that fails to meet the requisite level of clarity does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect emphasis added id.declining to extend edwards to require officers to cease questioning upon an equivocal statement by a suspect emphasis added.clearly,davis is not in play here.
ii.whether the agents properly honored plugh rights after invocation 
plugh invoked his fifth amendment rights to counsel and silence.w hen counsel is requested,interrogation must cease,and officials may not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present,whether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney.minnick mississippi,d.should the suspect decide to remain silent,the custodial officers must scrupulously honor that decision.mosley,at.
an officer interrogates whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.united states montana,cir quoting rhode island innis,d.interrogation includes both express questioning as well as any words or actions on the part of the police other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.id.quoting innis,at.in montana,this court determined that an officer unsolicited statement informing the defendant that any cooperation would be brought to the attention of the assistant united states attorney constituted interrogation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and in campaneria,we concluded that an officer who stated if you want to talk to us,now is the time to do it had thereby committed precisely the sort of conduct the prophylactic rule seeks to prevent.campaneria,at.
the district court found that the agents repeatedly told the defendant that any cooperation would be brought to the attention of the ausa as well as told plugh that he was about to be taken to the marshal office,so that if he wanted to make any statements this was the time.plugh,d at.we see no clear error in these findings of fact.the district court concluded that the agents conduct constituted impermissible interrogation and,after reviewing this question of law de novo,we agree.
the dissent presses for a reversal premised on the ambiguity of plugh waiver.it acknowledges that under ramirez,at,the police may ask questions to clarify whether the suspect in fact wishes to invoke,or to waive in cases.however,the dissent goes on to note that davis is less restrictive because it specifically declined to limit police to clarifying questions in cases.dissenting op.at.
the dissent overlooks an important part of the district court opinion.the district court held that notwithstanding whether plugh statements were regardless of the significance of plugh refusal to sign the waiver form under quiroz,at suppression is required since the agents,at least as to the defendant right to remain silent,failed to limit themselves to narrow questions only for the purpose of clarifying the ambiguity,as required by ramirez.plugh,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
the dicta in davis suggesting that police need not limit themselves to clarifying questions in that case made sense in that case,but makes no sense at all here.in davis,the officers did not have to limit their questions to resolving an ambiguity of defendant attempt to reassert his fifth amendment rights as the police were not bound to cease questioning until davis unambiguously reasserted his rights.in situations where no waiver has occurred,the police must clarify whether an ambiguous statement is meant as an invocation because edwards set forth a bright line rule that all questioning must cease after an accused requests counsel.smith,at.citation omitted and italics in original.
conclusion 
this is a case about whether a suspect invoked his fifth amendment rights in the absence of any waiver.davis is a case about the steps a suspect must take to demonstrate that he wishes to resurrect and invoke previously waived rights.in the context of the facts of this case,plugh refusal to sign the waiver document was an invocation of his rights and entitles him to edwards prophylaxis.the agents were not permitted to question him.
the district court order of june,granting defendant motion to suppress his statements made on september,is hereby affirmed.
when,after miranda warnings,a suspect is undecided as to whether a lawyer is wanted,or responds ambiguously,the police may renew that inquiry.see united states ramirez,cir w here a suspect has invoked his right equivocally or ambiguously,the officers are permitted to ask narrow questions only for the purpose of clarifying the ambiguity.the issue on this appeal is whether the police are barred from renewing the inquiry if the suspect who says he is undecided also refuses to sign a written waiver of miranda rights.the majority holds that such a refusal to sign a written waiver operates as an invocation of miranda rights and thus precludes any further inquiry by police to resolve the uncertainty.however,because the refusal to sign a waiver is wholly consistent with the expression of uncertainty,i respectfully dissent.
when the government appeals from the suppression of evidence,we review the district court factual findings for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.united states rodriguez,cir.given that standard,the facts are as follows 
after the fbi agents arrested plugh,the agents read him his miranda rights,asked him to sign a written waiver,and inquired orally whether he was willing to waive.plugh said he was not sure whether he wanted to talk to the agents,and said he did not know whether he needed a lawyer.he was certain,however,that he did not want to sign the waiver form,and the agents recorded his refusal to sign.
on the trip to the federal building in rochester,the agents told plugh that while they did care whether he talked to them,they would relay any cooperation to the prosecutor.plugh asked what cooperation meant,but the agents told plugh that they could make no promises,that plugh should say nothing to them about his case,and that they would only discuss the case if plugh explicitly waived after again being read his rights.the agents asked no substantive questions during the drive to rochester.
on arrival in rochester,the agents told plugh that they were going to transfer him to the custody of the united states marshals and that if he wanted to make a statement,the time had come to do so.thereupon,plugh said that he would make a statement the agents again gave miranda warnings plugh signed a written waiver of his rights and the inculpatory statement at issue was made.
police may not use statements made by a suspect under custodial interrogation unless the suspect is apprised of his fifth amendment rights,and waives them knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily.miranda arizona,d.if he invokes his right to counsel,police must cease questioning until the suspect has an attorney present.miranda,at.edwards arizona,d.if he waives,police may go ahead with questioning.davis united states,d.
did plugh refusal to sign a waiver constitute an invocation of his rights notwithstanding his simultaneous oral statement that he did yet know whether he wanted a lawyer or whether he should talk to the agents to effectively invoke the right,a suspect must articulate his desire to have counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for an attorney.davis united states,d.this a suspect has in fact invoked his an objective one that takes into account all of the circumstances.id.at.
plugh oral statements to the agents at the time of the arrest i am not sure if i should be talking to you and i do know if i need a lawyer were equivocal,rendering his decision ambiguous if the record showed no more than these statements,the case would be straightforward plugh would lose.the only wrinkle is that simultaneously plugh refused to sign a written waiver of his rights.
davis instructs that courts must look to all of the circumstances surrounding a purported invocation to determine whether it was unambiguous.davis,at.all of the circumstances oral statements as well as his refusal to sign a indecision and ambiguity.
when a suspect makes ambiguous statements regarding his right to silence,we have held that the police may ask no questions other than to clarify whether the suspect in fact wishes to invoke,or to waive,or to stay on the fence.ramirez,at.ramirez a case that davis was thus more restrictive than davis a case,which specifically declined to limit police to clarifying questions in such circumstances davis at.
if,as the majority opinion seems to suggest,the agents categorically violated the ramirez rule by telling plugh that his cooperation would be relayed to the prosecutor and that this was the point to talk,then suppression is justified on that basis alone.op at.but if that were so,suppression would be warranted regardless of whether plugh statements were ambiguous,in which case all the rest of the majority opinion would be unnecessary.but the majority opinion is not superfluous,if the ramirez rule survives agents did limit themselves to clarification.
the majority cites the following cases to suggest that the sorts of statements the agents made here constitute inappropriate interrogation in violation of the ramirez rule united states montana,cir statement informing the defendants that any cooperation would be brought to the attention of the prosecutor campaneria reid,cir statement suggesting that now is the time for suspect to talk to police.but these statements made by police officers after the suspect had unambiguously invoked his rights.in such cases,statements such as these serve only to badger the suspect to change his mind.see campaneria,at since n othing was ambiguous or equivocal about suspect invoc
