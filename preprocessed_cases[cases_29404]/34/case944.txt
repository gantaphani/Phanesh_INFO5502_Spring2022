john mccallum appeals from a judgment of conviction in the united states district court for the southern district of new york robinson.mccallum was convicted of various narcotics offenses involving crack cocaine and was sentenced principally to months incarceration.we write to address mccallum primary contention,which is that the district court abused its discretion in admitting as similar acts evidence two of his prior narcotics convictions.we conclude that the admission of this evidence,while an abuse of discretion,was harmless error.in a related but separately filed summary order,we dispose of mccallum other claims of trial error.
background 
at trial,the government proved that mccallum and his operated a substantial crack cocaine distribution business in and around spring valley,new york.the conspiracy and substantive offenses charged in the indictment involved narcotics activities that occurred between approximately september of and may of,and that culminated in four controlled buys of narcotics in april and may of.after the final controlled buy,police officers executed a search warrant at mccallum residence and recovered substantial quantities of drugs.
at trial,the government proved mccallum involvement in the conspiracy through the testimony of and cooperating witness darryl wright,who was mccallum partner and resided in the same apartment as mccallum.the government also offered the testimony of lenell brookins,a roommate of mccallum and wright,and the testimony of police officers who had observed mccallum engaging in narcotics transactions and had searched the apartment where the narcotics were seized.the government other evidence included audio recordings in which a confidential informant,david defreese,purchased crack cocaine from wright and mccallum,and phone records indicating narcotics transactions.
prior to trial,the government informed the court that it intended to introduce evidence of mccallum two prior narcotics felony convictions for possession and attempted sale of cocaine.although the government had at hand the drugs that had been seized,the testimony of mccallum partner about their extensive,and a plethora of other evidence of prior narcotics activities,the government nevertheless argued that evidence of the convictions was critical to prove that mccallum knew that the substances he sold were narcotics and that he intended to sell them.the government also asserted that it wished to introduce the periods of incarceration mccallum had served on the two convictions because,without them,much of the charged conspiracy will be difficult for the jury to understand.the court agreed,without significant discussion,to receive the convictions but not evidence of the periods of incarceration.the record sheds little light on why the court believed the convictions were admissible.
during voir dire,potential jurors were asked whether they would be able to follow instructions requiring them to consider the convictions only for the limited purpose of evaluating the defendant knowledge and intent,and whether,after learning of the convictions,they would be able to maintain their presumption of the defendant innocence.over the defense objections,the district court received evidence of the convictions in the form of a stipulation during the government case in chief during the court final charge,the jury was given a limiting instruction with respect to the convictions at the conclusion of the trial,mccallum was convicted of three of the four counts in the indictment,including conspiracy and two substantive narcotics offenses.this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court admission of evidence of prior crimes for abuse of discretion.see united states lombardozzi,cir.abuse of discretion occurs when the court acts in an arbitrary and irrational manner.id.a district court decision to admit evidence is subject to harmless error analysis.a united states madori,cir.the main harmless error inquiry is whether the contested testimony was unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question,as revealed in the record.see united states garcia,cir holding that erroneous admission of evidence was harmless where it had no substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict internal quotation marks omitted.
evidence of prior convictions may be admissible under federal rule of evidence b to show intent,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident,but not to show character or propensity.b.where prior convictions are concerned,the line between intent or knowledge and character or propensity is often a fine one,requiring the thoughtful,focused attention of the district court.the most important reason why this attention is required is that the introduction of prior convictions,unless carefully handled,will undermine the presumption of innocence.
when reviewing the admission of evidence pursuant to rule b,we consider whether the prior crimes evidence was offered for a proper purpose the evidence was relevant to a disputed issue the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice pursuant to rule and the court administered an appropriate limiting instruction.huddleston united states,d.our circuit takes an inclusionary approach to the admission of prior crimes evidence,under which such evidence is admissible for any purpose other than to show the defendant criminal propensity.united states paulino,cir citing united states pitre,cir.yet this inclusionary approach does not invite the government to offer,carte blanche,any prior act of the defendant in the same category of crime.united states garcia,cir see also id.at holding that prior conviction for selling cocaine should not have been admitted to prove intent and knowledge of the charged sale of cocaine,because the government offered and the court admitted the prior conviction as relevant for a very specific show that defendant knew that a taped phone conversation was about a coded drug made no attempt to link the transaction on that basis.
where such evidence is offered for the purpose of establishing the defendant knowledge or intent,we require that the government identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to establishing knowledge of the current act.id.at see also id.at holding that admission of prior conviction was abuse of discretion because the government did not establish that the prior drug conviction was meaningfully probative of the defendant knowledge with respect to the charged narcotics conspiracy t he only similarity between the two drug transactions was that both involved cocaine and t he government did not offer evidence of any other similarity or connection between the two transactions united states brand,cir government must show similarity or some connection of prior act evidence to charged crime in order to establish that the prior act is relevant to a disputed element,such as intent internal quotation marks omitted united states laflam,cir per curiam same.
although the record is not entirely clear,the government offered mccallum prior convictions ostensibly to establish mccallum intent to deal drugs and his knowledge of drug dealing.in any event,as the government correctly contends,mccallum did not concede those issues.in a pretrial memorandum addressing the point,counsel stated as mccallum counsel i can not say at this point unequivocally whether or not knowledge and or intent will be disputed issues in this case.because mccallum counsel did not make a statement to the court of sufficient clarity to indicate that intent and knowledge would not be disputed,those issues remained sufficiently in dispute for the similar acts evidence to be relevant and hence admissible.see united states colon,cir.under these circumstances,the evidence was admissible during the government case in chief.see united states inserra,cir united states zackson,cir.
once the first two prongs of huddleston are satisfied,the court is then required to consider the third prong and decide whether the probative value of the prior crimes is substantially outwei
