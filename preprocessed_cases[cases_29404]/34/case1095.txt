angel rodriguez,faustino delarosa delarosa,edgardo vazquez baez vazquez baez,and kenneth rodriguez appeal from judgments of conviction,entered on october,october,october,and april,respectively,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york duffy.
all four defendants were convicted,after a jury trial,of conspiracy to commit hobbs act robbery in violation of on appeal,defendants rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez principally argue that the district court committed confrontation clause error by admitting a post arrest statement made by rodriguez against them and this error was not harmless.the government concedes that crawford washington,d,which was decided subsequent to trial,establishes that the district court committed confrontation clause error by admitting rodriguez statement against his three.in crawford,the supreme court held that it is confrontation clause error to admit a declarant prior testimonial statement against a defendant unless the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant and the declarant is unavailable to testify at defendant trial.at.the government also concedes that the harmless error standard applies because rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez preserved their confrontation clause arguments below.the government contends,however,that the district court crawford error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
angel rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against them,claiming that,without rodriguez statement,there was insufficient evidence to support a hobbs act robbery conviction,which requires that the plan involve actual or threatened force,or violence,or fear of injury,see a b because their plan was to steal by trick impersonation of dea agents,rather than by force.in the event that we affirm their convictions,each defendant challenges the district court sentencing determinations and requests a remand for consideration of whether to resentence pursuant to this court decision in united states crosby,cir.we address rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez crawford harmless error,sufficiency of the evidence,and crosby arguments here and resolve all of rodriguez claims on appeal in a summary order issued today 
with respect to defendants crawford claims,we hold that the district court erroneous admission of rodriguez statement against rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.with respect to defendants sufficiency of the evidence challenges,we hold that only vazquez baez satisfied his burden of proof.because the proper remedy for the crawford harmless error violation is a retrial and the proper remedy for a successful sufficiency of the evidence claim is acquittal,rodriguez and delarosa hobbs act conspiracy convictions are vacated and remanded to the district court for retrials and vazquez baez hobbs act conspiracy conviction is reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions to enter a judgment of acquittal.see united states tubol,cir vacating defendant conviction and remanding for retrial based on harmful error determination and declining to grant acquittal based on adverse finding on defendant sufficiency of the evidence claim see also united states mcclain,cir suggesting that a new trial is appropriate remedy if confrontation clause error was not harmless.vazquez baez illegal reentry conviction is remanded to the district court,pursuant to crosby,for the limited purpose of providing the district court with an opportunity to consider whether to resentence.
background 
i.the may,drug deal 
defendants hobbs act robbery convictions were based on events that unfolded on may,may,at the corner of street and west end avenue in new york city.as part of an investigation into a york drug pipeline,an undercover dea agent,louis milione,arrived on the scene with a bag full of phony drugs to engage in a drug deal with an individual named alejandro paulino.defendants,unaware that milione was an undercover dea agent,attempted to take milione bag,at least in part,by impersonating dea agents.
specifically,the following events ensued after paulino and milione,with his dea backup team,arrived on the scene on may.paulino instructed milione to remove the bag of drugs from milione car and place it in the car occupied by his cousin,juan santos,which was parked nearby.paulino subsequently departed.approximately at this time,milione dea backup team started monitoring a maroon jeep cherokee that had arrived.angel rodriguez,delarosa,vazquez baez,and rodriguez were later identified as the occupants of the jeep cherokee,which was registered in rodriguez name.delarosa exited the jeep cherokee,walked over to a phone booth,and made a call on his cell phone.rodriguez also exited the jeep.
while agent milione was following paulino instruction to retrieve the bag of drugs,rodriguez and delarosa quickly approached milione.as rodriguez was approaching milione,rodriguez appeared to be talking on a walkie talkie.he also removed from his pocket,and placed around his neck,what appeared to the dea backup team to be a police badge.delarosa did not appear to be carrying anything as he approached milione.approximately at the same time,the jeep cherokee,which was driven by rodriguez,proceeded in the direction of milione,who subsequently gave a distress signal to his dea backup team.
initially,the backup team thought defendants were indeed undercover law enforcement officials,in part,because they were very organized and skilled the way they were handling the situation.the dea backup team soon realized these individuals were not actually undercover agents and started making arrests.delarosa was arrested.police also arrested rodriguez,the driver of the jeep cherokee,and vazquez baez,who was sitting in the backseat.at the time of these arrests,dea agents found a knife in rodriguez pocket and no weapons on delarosa and vazquez baez.rodriguez escaped but later turned himself in and essentially confessed that he made a plan with others to rob the participants in the may drug deal.
ii.the government case against defendants hobbs act robbery 
based on the events of may,defendants were charged with,inter alia,conspiracy to commit hobbs act robbery in violation of in hobbs act robbery conspiracy cases,it is the government burden to establish that defendant knowingly and willingly agreed with two or more individuals to obstruct,delay,or affect interstate commerce by unlawfully taking property by means of actual or threatened force,or violence,or fear of injury.a b.as indicated by the statutory language,a hobbs act conspiracy to rob implies the use of force.the government was also required to establish two elements against each defendant the existence of a conspiracy to rob first element,and knowing participation in that conspiracy second element.see,united states taylor,cir see also united states reyes,cir indicating that existence of conspiracy and knowing participation in conspiracy are separate elements of crime of conspiracy under federal law.
evidence at trial 
rodriguez statement 
according to defendants,one of the most powerful pieces of evidence entered against them was the government introduction of testimony regarding rodriguez statement.in this statement,rodriguez admitted that there was a conspiracy to rob from participants of the may drug deal.specifically,two dea agents testified at trial that rodriguez admitted to planning with paulino cousin and others to rip off the drugs involved in the may sale.a dea agent further recounted that rodriguez confessed that paulino cousin,juan santos,told him the following regarding how to proceed at the drug deal 
and when the person who was bringing the drugs to the scene put the drugs in juan santos vehicle kenneth rodriguez and others were supposed to rob or to take the drugs from juan santos vehicle in front of paulino,who was brokering the deal in the other car.
trial tr.at emphasis added.
the district court rejected defendants confrontation clause argument that rodriguez statement could not be used against them for any purpose.instead,the district court ensured that none of the defendants names were mentioned and allowed the government to admit rodriguez statement solely to establish the first element of the existence of a conspiracy to rob.judge duffy specifically directed the jury not to consider rodriguez statement as evidence that rodriguez,delarosa,or vazquez baez,participated in a conspiracy to second element of the crime.
principal evidence entered against all defendants 
along with rodriguez statement,the following represents the government principal evidence against defendants dea testimony describing the circumstances recounted above and a videotape that captured some of the events in question the two knives that dea agents found inside a console,which was either opened or closed in the jeep cherokee a knife found in rodriguez pocket a hat with two holes cut out of it,stockings,and a walkie talkie found inside the jeep cherokee dea testimony that defendants were conducting what the agents perceived as countersurveillance of the may drug deal evidence indicating that defendants had a high level of coordination as they approached milione a high volume of phone calls between defendants in the days leading up to,and the day of,the event in question evidence that,following the intervention of the dea backup team,rodriguez fled the scene,delarosa was apprehended on the street,rodriguez was apprehended while driving the jeep cherokee,and vazquez baez was found in the back seat of the jeep cherokee.
additional evidence admitted against delarosa and rodriguez individually 
the government admitted delarosa statement against him individually according to delarosa statement,he was on the street looking for work on may when an acquaintance approached him in the maroon jeep cherokee.delarosa was told,according to the statement,that he would receive work if he got into the jeep cherokee.once the jeep cherokee arrived at the scene of the drug deal,delarosa was instructed to exit the jeep and to watch the corner of west and west end avenue.delarosa admitted to following this instruction but did not admit to knowing the purpose of the trip to the scene.
against rodriguez,the government additionally presented rodriguez statement and knowledge and intent evidence derived from rodriguez participation in a separate conspiracy.see federal rules of evidence b section b providing that,while prior act evidence is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,it may be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of intent or knowledge.angel rodriguez statement communicated,in relevant part,that he made a plan with paulino cousin and others to take money by using a badge.
the government rule b evidence against rodriguez consisted of testimony that,on february,officers responded to a dispatch call regarding a disorderly group at a building in upper manhattan.while conducting a search of the building,a police officer observed rodriguez on the roof of the building.close to where police observed rodriguez,police found a bag that contained ropes,harnesses,a chisel,and bolt cutters.in a nearby alleyway,police found a wool ski mask,which the government alleges is similar to the hat with two eye holes that was found in the jeep cherokee on may.
verdict and sentencing 
during deliberations,the jury asked the court to repeat the hobbs act definition of robbery and to further inspect rodriguez and rodriguez statements.on june,the jury convicted all defendants of conspiring to commit hobbs act robbery.along with the hobbs act robbery convictions,the jury convicted vazquez baez of illegally the country following deportation angel rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez were acquitted of conspiracy and attempt to distribute and possess cocaine in violation of the district court denied defendants motions for a judgment of acquittal,see,and principally sentenced rodriguez to months imprisonment,delarosa to months imprisonment,and vazquez baez to months imprisonment.this appeal ensued.
iii.defendants arguments on appeal 
on appeal,rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez challenge their hobbs act robbery convictions,arguing that they deserve a retrial based on the district court crawford error because the admission of rodriguez statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that they should be acquitted of their hobbs act robbery convictions because the government failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain their convictions.
once we remove rodriguez statement from the corpus of evidence,defendants contend,the government can not prove that a conspiracy to rob existed first element or that any of them participated in such a conspiracy second element.the principal argument underlying defendants claims on the first element is that rodriguez statement was the only indication that the conspiracy involved an intent to take drugs by force,as is required in hobbs act robbery cases.the flashing of a badge,in defendants view,is not sufficient to indicate that they intended to take property through actual or threatened force,or violence,or fear of injury within the meaning of the hobbs act.see b hobbs act force.with respect to the second element,each defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence indicating that each of them knowingly participated in the alleged conspiracy.
discussion 
crawford harmless error analysis 
we apply harmless error review to the district court crawford error because,as the government concedes,defendants preserved their confrontation clause claim below.to establish that the error was harmless,the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.see mcclain,at quoting united states casamento,cir see also chapman california,d.
our crawford harmless error analysis relates only to the government evidence of the first existence of a conspiracy to rob.the crawford inquiry only involves this first element because,as mentioned above,the district court instructed the jury to consider rodriguez statement for the sole purpose of establishing the existence of a conspiracy to rob.we presume that the jury followed the instruction not to consider rodriguez statement when considering whether the government established the second rodriguez,delarosa,and vazquez baez,participated in the conspiracy.see mcclain,at.there are no circumstances in this case that counsel us to deviate from this presumption.see united states downing,cir absent evidence to the contrary,we must presume that juries understand and abide by a district court limiting instructions.
first element existence of conspiracy to rob 
applying the harmless error standard,we conclude that the government has failed to establish,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the error complained erroneous admission of rodriguez statement against his not contribute to the jury determination that a conspiracy to take property through actual or threatened force,or violence,or fear of injury existed.see a b.
vazquez baez 
against vazquez baez,the government entered only its principal evidence.see background iia supra.viewing the government principal evidence,reasonable jurors could have determined that there was a reasonable doubt with respect to whether the plan involved hobbs act force because defendants seemed to have solely relied on their impersonation of dea agents as their means to acquire the property two of the knives may have been concealed in a closed console rodriguez was the only person found possessing a knife,which was found in his pocket and rodriguez and delarosa,the two most active participants,were not armed as they approached milione.moreover,vazquez baez was sitting,unarmed,in the back of the jeep cherokee throughout the events described.thus,reasonable jurors,who had not considered rodriguez statement that there was a conspiracy to rob,may have found that the the essential nature of the plan did not involve force,a threat of force,or fear of injury.see generally united states skowronski,cir ruling that while coconspirators need not have agreed on the details of the conspiracy they must have agreed on the essential nature of the plan,abrogated on other grounds by united states amato,cir.
the government argues that the perpetrators use of a police badge was sufficient to establish that the plan involved hobbs act force.we disagree.as an initial matter,we acknowledge that hobbs act force does not require the brandishing of a weapon.in the context of hobbs act extortion,which requires inducement of another property,by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,violence,or fear,or under color of official right the force element,b,this court has indicated that the use of a weapon is not a prerequisite for a finding of force.united states abelis,cir.in abelis we held that a jury could find force where defendants wrongfully and intentionally used an individual reputation as a prominent figure in the russian criminal underworld alone to instill fear.id.at 
when we are examining whether there is hobbs act force in a factual context that does not involve the use of a weapon,it is especially important for us to carefully consider how a reasonable person in the victim position would perceive an action the flashing of a badge the perpetrators knowledge that a victim would perceive such action to be part of a pattern of violence,intimidation,or threats and the perpetrators intention to exploit their victim fears.see united states arena,cir in the case sub judice,the relevant perpetrators were disguised as dea agents and,based on what they knew at the time,the victim was an individual engaged in a high stakes drug deal.as defense counsel aptly stated at oral argument,in this case,the cops were criminals and the criminals were cops.
once a police badge is displayed,a reasonable person could perceive the badge to indicate that the jig is up,rather than to immediately indicate an imminent threat of force of course,if the victim decided to resist arrest,the badge holder might conceivably take additional action that communicates a threat of force.however,when viewing the immediate response to the flashing of the badge alone,which is what we are asked to do in this case,we do not find hobbs act force moreover,the fact that the two individuals who approached milione were unarmed indicates that defendants expected that the badge alone would allow them to take the property unimpeded,thereby obviating the need to use force.
delarosa and rodriguez 
the only additional evidence that was presented against delarosa individually was his statement that he was solely an innocent bystander.see background iia supra.even with this additional piece of evidence,the merits of delarosa crawford argument are much the same as they were for vazquez baez.delarosa statement does not mention weapons of any kind or otherwise provide any additional indication that there was a plan to use force,as defined by the hobbs act.see b.
angel rodriguez statement and the knowledge and intent evidence admitted against him are also not sufficient to render the crawford error harmless.neither indicate that the conspiracy involved hobbs act force.angel rodriguez statement communicated,in relevant part,that he made a plan with paulino cousin and others to take money.it also went on to say that someone was going to jump in with the badge and he going to say that he arrested.while this statement clearly indicates that rodriguez made an agreement with others to use a badge in order to take money from someone else,this statement does not provide us with any additional indication that there was a plan to use hobbs act force.in light of our determination that the use of a badge alone does not always constitute hobbs act force,it is reasonable to conclude that rodriguez admission that the plan was to take property through the use of a badge actually bolsters his claim that he was not part of a plan that involved taking property by force.
furthermore,a reasonable jury could have viewed the rule b evidence regarding rodriguez involvement in a similar conspiracy only to suggest that rodriguez knowledge and intent was to illegally take something.while the use of ropes,harnesses,a chisel,and bolt cutters strongly indicates that rodriguez was intentionally part of a separate conspiracy with an intent to burglarize,it is not relevant to show that he had the intent to use hobbs act force during the events under review.
in sum,we conclude that,without rodriguez critical statement that a conspiracy to rob the drug deal existed,it is not shown beyond a reasonable doubt,with respect to all three defendants,that the government could demonstrate that a hobbs act conspiracy to rob existed.see generally united states forrester,cir error going to the heart of a critical issue is less likely to be harmless.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,each of these three defendants has,at least,established that they are entitled to a retrial.we next examine their sufficiency of the evidence claims to decide if any of these three defendants have further earned entitlement to outright reversal of their hobbs act convictions.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence review 
our review of defendants sufficiency of the evidence claims is stricter than our harmless error review of the crawford error.discussion i supra.our cases have repeatedly affirmed that defendants who challenge their convictions on sufficiency grounds carry a heavy burden.united states bruno,cir quoting united states dhinsa,cir.we will not vacate a conviction on sufficiency of the evidence grounds if,drawing all inferences in favor of the prosecution and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states padilla,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.
additionally,in contrast to our crawford harmless error review analysis,which focused solely on the first element necessary to sustain a hobbs act robbery conviction,our sufficiency of the evidence inquiry demands that we analyze the evidence with respect to both the existence of a conspiracy and participation elements.this is the case because the sufficiency of the evidence claim challenges the underlying conviction as a whole,see,united states gaines,cir,and therefore involves both elements necessary for a hobbs act conspiracy to rob conviction.
first element existence of conspiracy to rob 
once we view all of the circumstantial evidence and draw every inference in favor of the government,we conclude that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt,with respect to all three defendants,that a conspiracy,hinging in some way on the use of hobbs act force,existed.for instance,a reasonable juror could have concluded,based on the totality of the circumstantial evidence,that there was a backup plan to steal the drugs at.there is no question that the use of a knife is sufficient to establish hobbs act force.see,united states woodruff,cir describing a knife as one of several kinds of weapons designed to harm or threaten bodily injury.it is undisputed that three knives were found at the scene.the jeep driver,rodriguez,possessed a knife and had easy access to the two additional knives found in the jeep console.if defendants plan to steal through impersonation was foiled in some way,a rational trier of fact could infer that rodriguez was poised to intervene with his knife.it is reasonable to infer that rodriguez,the owner of the jeep,was also aware that knives were available and could be used if necessary.this circumstantial evidence,along with defendants high level of coordination and communication,is sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that defendants had a tacit plan to use force.
this court has acknowledged that jurors are permitted to infer,based on circumstantial evidence alone,that two or more of the defendants had a tacit understanding to use force or a threat of force.see skowronski,at see also united states glenn,cir stating that a conviction can rest solely on circumstantial evidence.in skowronski,an employee of a jewelry store was convicted of conspiracy to rob the jewelry store.on appeal,the employee made a sufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction,arguing that,because the plan was for him to voluntarily
