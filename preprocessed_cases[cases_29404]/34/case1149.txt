hector gonzalez appeals from an order of the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,denying a motion by gonzalez to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds so much of a indictment filed in the district of connecticut as charges him with two counts of narcotics conspiracy connecticut indictment.in count twelve,gonzalez was one of a number of named defendants,along with others known and unknown to the grand jury charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin.in count thirteen,gonzalez and a number of other named defendants and others known and unknown to the grand jury are charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base or crack.
in an indictment previously filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,gonzalez was charged in a indictment new york indictment,along with two named,with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and attempting to possess with intent to distribute cocaine.gonzalez entered a plea of guilty to the conspiracy count of that indictment,pursuant to a written agreement dated november,with the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york.the district court,faced with the motion to dismiss counts twelve and thirteen of the connecticut indictment for double jeopardy as a consequence of the new york indictment and plea,entered the order denying dismissal subject of this appeal.the district court determined that the heroin conspiracy charged was distinct from the earlier indictment.as to the cocaine conspiracy charged,the district court reasoned that,although the same conspiracy was charged in the new york indictment,the government did not know and could not reasonably have known of the facts supporting the connecticut indictment when the new york indictment was filed.we affirm the order as to both of the counts subject of the district court ruling but for reasons different from those given by the district court in regard to the cocaine conspiracy charged.
background 
in may of,special agents of the drug enforcement administration dea in the eastern district of new york learned that one was interested in purchasing up to ten kilograms of cocaine.this information was furnished by confidential informants who represented that they were prepared to act as suppliers.informed them that he knew of an unidentified buyer from connecticut who would come to new york to purchase the cocaine,but he provided no further information.appellant gonzalez was arrested on june,in queens,new york when he came to make a cocaine purchase from.a search of gonzalez vehicle produced approximately in united states currency,and over in cash was seized from his person.was arrested at the same time and gave a statement to the dea.in the statement,he described the role of gonzalez in the conspiracy to purchase the cocaine to be supplied by the confidential informants.he also implicated a man named jose mota,who apparently acted as a lookout during the attempted cocaine transaction.
dea special agent mark tully testified before the grand jury in the eastern district on june.he was the only witness to testify in regard to the events leading to the arrest of gonzalez and.he testified that a meeting took place on may,in the northern boulevard area of queens,new york between and the two confidential informants.the meeting was conducted under the surveillance of agents of the dea and was.according to tully,agreed to purchase ten kilograms of cocaine at per kilogram from the informants.on june,the informants received a telephone call from,who advised that his people in connecticut were putting the money together and would not be able to complete the purchase until later in the week.further negotiations regarding the purchase price resulted in an agreed price of per kilogram for the ten kilograms of cocaine.
on june,called the informants and advised that he and his people from connecticut were ready to complete the deal,and arrangements were made to meet at a burger king restaurant on northern boulevard.dea agents set up surveillance at that location and,at approximately,observed two individuals arrive in a corsica automobile driven by.the corsica was followed into the parking lot of the restaurant by a red dodge intrepid automobile driven by gonzalez.after a conversation between and the two informants,signaled gonzalez to approach.then all present walked over to gonzalez vehicle.gonzalez opened the trunk,in which the informants saw a bag containing a box with united states currency inside.the confidential informants advised that they were going to get the ten kilograms of cocaine,whereupon the agents arrested and gonzalez.
following the testimony of agent tully before the grand jury,the grand jury charged gonzalez and,as previously noted,with conspir ing to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,a schedule ii narcotic drug controlled substance in violation of title united states code,section a count one and with attempt ing to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,a schedule ii narcotic drug controlled substance,in violation of title united states code,section a count two.both offenses were alleged to have been committed between may,and june,both dates being approximate and inclusive.on july,special agent tully made another grand jury appearance.again,he was the only witness to testify,and his testimony paralleled that given on june.there were only two differences.one was that he identified mota as an individual who arrived with gonzalez and acted as a lookout during the transaction on june.he testified that mota was arrested at the same time as gonzalez and.the other difference in tully testimony was his description of the exact amount of cash found in gonzalez vehicle.thereafter,a superseding indictment was issued charging mota along with gonzalez and with the same crimes covering the same time period charged in the first indictment.
by plea agreement entered into with the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york dated november,gonzalez agreed to enter a plea of guilty to the conspiracy count in return for the dismissal of the attempt count.in the agreement,the office of the united states attorney agreed to make certain sentencing recommendations,and gonzalez agreed not to appeal his conviction or sentence if the sentence were to be within or below the range of imprisonment terms specified in the agreement.among other things,the agreement provided that it is limited to the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york and can not bind other federal,state or local prosecuting authorities.with respect to further administrative proceedings involving gonzalez,the agreement provided that he waives any claim of double jeopardy in the event that said proceedings have been,are,or will be initiated.after his guilty plea was accepted in accordance with the agreement,gonzalez was allowed to remain at liberty until april,when his sentence was imposed.gonzalez presently is serving that sentence,which provides principally for imprisonment for a term of months,and five years of release.
on another track,it appears that special agents of the federal bureau of investigation in connecticut had initiated an investigation in august of into the narcotics trafficking activities of one frank estrada.eventually,separate indictments were returned on november,against estrada and an associate in drug trafficking,isaias soler,by a grand jury empaneled by the united states district court for the district of connecticut.
it appears that estrada was the head of a large organization engaged in the processing,packaging and distribution of narcotics.certain individuals serving as lieutenants in the organization delivered packaged narcotics to dealers.these dealers sold the narcotics at various locations within the barnum housing project in bridgeport,connecticut and in other areas of bridgeport and in other cities in connecticut,including new haven and meriden.the organization obtained wholesale quantities of narcotics,including cocaine and heroin,from supply sources usually located outside the state.the cocaine customarily was converted into cocaine base or crack before being packaged for distribution.members of the organization resorted to violence to maintain the exclusive right to sell narcotics in particular locations.in december,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging estrada,soler and other members of the estrada organization with offenses relating to the nefarious activities of the organization.
early in,jose lugo,who was serving a connecticut state prison sentence,wrote to assistant united states attorney alex hernandez to advise that he had relevant information pertaining to the estrada organization.following the communication,lugo was interviewed by government agents on a number of occasions.he provided valuable information to the agents and shortly thereafter testified at the trial of various codefendants of gonzalez.
in his testimony,lugo described the structure of the organization in great detail and identified a number of individuals who were involved in its activities.he testified about the manner in which the drugs were packaged in small bags,taped and stamped.his testimony included details about the activities of estrada as head of the organization and of the lieutenants who were responsible for getting the narcotics into the hands of the runners or street sellers.as he described it,the lieutenants were also responsible for collecting the sales proceeds from the runners.lugo also described the physical form in which the heroin and crack were sold.he identified various locations at which the narcotics were prepared for sale,the places where the narcotics were stashed,and the steps taken by estrada to enforce his territorial primacy in the locations where his runners sold drugs.
in his detailed testimony,lugo provided the names of many of the members of the estrada organization as well as the part each played in the activities of the organization.among others,he identified hector june bug gonzalez,the name by which he knew appellant.at one point,according to lugo,june bug was in charge of all the lieutenants,ma d e sure that they was doing their job.lugo gave further testimony describing the importance of gonzalez in the operation of the organization.lugo recalled that he was present with estrada and gonzalez in the summer of when gonzalez insisted on going to new york city to replenish the organization supply of heroin.although estrada was reluctant to do so,he gave gonzalez a bag of cash to make the purchase.when estrada learned that gonzalez had been arrested in new york in the sting cocaine sale arranged by agents of the dea on june,he immediately proceeded to gonzalez apartment and removed a safe.estrada told lugo that the safe contained cash,and they transported it to an apartment at another location.
lugo testified that gonzalez was released on bond after his arrest in new york and resumed his participation in the activities of the estrada organization,although he was required to wear an electronic monitoring device on his leg as a condition of his bond.apparently,gonzalez continued his activities in the organization up to the time when he began to serve his sentence of incarceration.in the course of his extensive testimony before the grand jury,lugo also revealed that the cocaine sold by the organization was packaged in slabs or small plastic bags containing cocaine base.based on information furnished by lugo and others,the grand jury in connecticut returned a third superseding indictment on june.that indictment,insofar as it pertains to gonzalez,is the subject of the double jeopardy ruling by the district court presently before us.the third superseding indictment charged frank estrada and persons associated with his organization in sixteen separate counts alleging racketeering racketeering conspiracy violent crime in aid of racketeering murder accessory after the fact to violent crime in aid of racketeering murder use of firearm in relation to violent crime two counts witness two counts conspiracy to engage in witness hobbs act violation violent crime in aid of racketeering assault conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute heroin conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base continuing criminal enterprise criminal forfeiture and bank fraud.not all the defendants named in the indictment were charged in all counts.
although gonzalez was described in the connecticut indictment as a member of the enterprise headed by frank estrada,he was not charged in either the racketeering or racketeering enterprise counts,or in any of the other counts except for count twelve,entitled heroin conspiracy,covering the period,and count thirteen,entitled cocaine base or crack conspiracy,covering the period.frank estrada and eighteen others in count twelve and eleven others in count thirteen were charged along with gonzalez.in a december motion to dismiss these two counts as to him,gonzalez claimed that his right to be free of double jeopardy would be violated if he were to be prosecuted on these two counts.the basis for this claim is that the conduct alleged is the same as the conduct subject of the new york indictment to which he pled guilty.in denying the motion to dismiss for double jeopardy,the district court determined,in an unpublished february,ruling,that gonzalez had met his initial burden of showing that his double jeopardy rights were implicated by the two indictments.noting that the burden therefore shifted to the government to establish distinct conspiracies,the district court concluded that the government had overwhelmingly met that burden as to count twelve.underlying that determination was the court finding that count twelve charged a heroin conspiracy while the new york indictment charged a distinct cocaine conspiracy and that gonzalez was purchasing cocaine at the time of his arrest.
with regard to count thirteen,the district court determined that it would be improper to conclude that gonzalez attempted purchase of cocaine as alleged in the new york indictment was a distinct conspiracy from the overarching single venture to procure cocaine to be converted and sold as cocaine base as alleged in count xiii of the connecticut indictment.however,the district court denied dismissal of count thirteen for double jeopardy,holding 
a lthough count of the connecticut indictment charges the same conspiracy as that charged in the new york indictment,and prosecution of count would,as a consequence,ordinarily be barred,dismissal is not appropriate because the government did not know,and could not reasonably have known,of the facts supporting the charges in count of the connecticut indictment at the time it charged gonzalez in the new york indictment.
discussion 
we review de novo as a question of law the denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds.united states morgan,cir.
the protection against double jeopardy is enshrined in the fifth amendment of the united states constitution,which provides that never shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb,amend.under this clause,once a defendant is placed in jeopardy for an offense,and jeopardy terminates with respect to that offense,the defendant may neither be tried nor punished a second time for the same offense.sattazahn,d.
the double jeopardy clause confers its protections in three different there is a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal of that offense where there is a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction of the offense and where there are multiple punishments for the same offense.schiro farley,d.the purposes served by the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy include protection against the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for the same offense preservation of the finality of judgments and deprivation of an opportunity for the prosecution to supply evidence at a successive trial that it failed to present the firs
