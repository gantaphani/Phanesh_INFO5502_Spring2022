reyes sought to have both statements suppressed,arguing that he had not been given miranda warnings prior to the questioning.the government argued against suppression,claiming that the public safety exception to the miranda rule,set forth in new york quarles,d,was applicable.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york lynch,granted reyes motion,finding the public safety exception inapplicable.the government now appeals pursuant to.
we conclude that the arresting officer asked reyes questions necessary to secure his own safety and was not trying to elicit incriminating evidence.quarles,at.as such,the public safety exception applies.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of reyes motion to suppress.
background 
ramon reyes was arrested and charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,distributing heroin,in violation of,b c,and carrying or using a firearm in relation to a narcotics offense,in violation of c.
reyes arrest was based,in part,on the cooperation of a ci.the ci told the nypd that reyes regularly sold narcotics he carried a firearm.in consultation with the nypd,the ci arranged to buy glassine envelopes of heroin from reyes.
reyes agreed to meet the ci and an undercover officer,who posed as the money guy,at a bodega in the bronx across the street from a school.upon reyes arrival at the store,the ci got into reyes car and saw that reyes was carrying narcotics but he could not tell whether reyes was armed.officers were then directed to move in and arrest reyes.
before handcuffing reyes or reading the miranda warnings,the arresting officer asked reyes if he had anything on him that could hurt the officer or anyone on the field team.reyes responded that he had a gun in his pocket.the officer removed the loaded revolver from reyes pocket and handcuffed him.before conducting a and search,the officer again asked whether reyes had anything inside his pocket that could hurt the officer.this time,reyes responded that he had drugs in his car.almost glassine envelopes containing heroin were recovered from reyes car.
before trial,reyes moved to suppress the firearm removed from his pocket and the heroin seized from his car the statements made during his arrest regarding the gun and the narcotics and a statement made at the station house that the jacket in which the gun was found belonged to the undercover officer.
at a suppression hearing,three nypd detectives testified that they knew reyes was a narcotics trafficker who planned to engage in a substantial heroin transaction with the ci.one officer stated that he had been informed that reyes usually carried a gun on his person and a shotgun in his car.the other officers were aware that reyes usually carried a gun.
the district court orally denied reyes motion to suppress the physical evidence and the station house statement.in a written opinion,the court granted reyes motion to suppress the statements made during his arrest,concluding that they violated miranda and that the public safety exception set forth in new york quarles,d,did not apply.see united states reyes,d.
in so ruling,the district court acknowledged that the government had plausibly argued that the arresting officer questions were necessary to secure his own safety.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court stated,however,that a generalized fear of sharp objects would not render admissible statements made in response to a question as broad as whether he had anything on him that can hurt me or anyone on my field team.id.at.additionally,the court found that reyes was not merely in custody,but rather was physically overpowered,forcibly bent over a car,and was urgently and repeatedly asked what harmful objects he ha d on him.id.at.noting that reyes had a limited command of the english language,the court concluded that he quite naturally did not interpret the question as limited to sharp objects.id.
the government now appeals solely the suppression of reyes statements during his arrest regarding the gun and the narcotics.
discussion 
in reviewing a district court ruling on a suppression motion,we review factual findings for clear error and questions of law de novo.united states yousef,cir.the reasonableness of police action is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed de novo.see ornelas united states,d holding that determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause are mixed questions of law and fact that should be reviewed de novo united states reilly,cir the determination of exigent circumstances is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.
in this case,the government does not challenge any of the district court factual findings,nor does it dispute that the officer questioning constituted interrogation within the meaning of miranda.the government sole contention is that the statements should have been admitted under the public safety exception to the miranda rule.
under miranda arizona,d,statements made by a suspect in custody in response to police interrogation are inadmissible,unless certain now famous warnings preceded the statements.id.at.in dickerson united states,d,the supreme court reaffirmed this ruling and made clear that the miranda rule is of constitutional magnitude.id.at.in quarles,however,the supreme court earlier announced a public safety exception to the per se rule barring admission of statements made without miranda warnings.at.the question is whether that exception applies here.
public safety exception 
in quarles,a woman informed the police that she had been raped at gunpoint.id.at.she provided a description of her attacker.id.the police entered a nearby supermarket and spotted a man fitting her description.id.at.after a brief pursuit,the officers caught the suspect and discovered that he was wearing an empty shoulder holster.id.before advising him of his miranda rights,the officers asked the suspect where his gun was.id.the suspect nodded in the direction of some empty cartons and responded,the gun is over there.id.
reversing the state court suppression of both the statement and the firearm,the supreme court held that miranda warnings need not precede questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety or for the safety of the arresting officers.id.at.
although the court cautioned that the public safety exception was narrow,id.at,it emphasized that the purpose of the exception was to allow officers to follow their legitimate instincts when confronting situations presenting a danger to the public safety,id.at,because spontaneity is necessarily the order of the day,id.at.the court realistically observed that officers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.id.at.
the public safety exception permits questions reasonably prompted by a concern for safety and in each case will be circumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.id.at.like the reasonableness standard itself,the public safety exception is a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of the circumstances in a given case.united states banks,d.
