opinion of the court 
a jury convicted appellants christopher wright,ravinder ravi chawla,and andrew teitelman appellants of honest services fraud in violation of,inter alia,mail fraud referred to below as traditional fraud in violation of,inter alia,and conspiracy to commit these offenses in violation of.after sentencing,the supreme court decision in skilling united states,affected the law of honest services fraud.among other arguments on appeal,appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence and assert that skilling undermines their convictions.we agree that skilling requires a new trial on appellants honest services fraud convictions and that prejudicial spillover tainted their traditional fraud convictions.we thus vacate and remand.
background 
from through,wright was chief of staff to philadelphia city councilman john jack kelly wright was also a realtor.chawla owned the real estate firm world acquisition partners world acquisition,and teitelman,an attorney,did most of the firm legal work.teitelman was not a world acquisition employee,but his offices were in its office suite,and most of his work came from world acquisition.chawla and teitelman befriended wright when wright had an office in the same building.
this case concerns a series of gifts that chawla,teitelman,or both gave wright and a simultaneous series of official acts that wright took on behalf of world acquisition.wright received a free stint in an apartment,free legal services,and was promised commissions on world acquisition deals.at the same time,wright shepherded a bill that chawla favored through kelly office,arranged meetings about a world acquisition development,and communicated with city of philadelphia offices for world acquisition.
more specifically,wright received three main benefits.first,he lived at least in an apartment with a free parking space for months without paying rent.world acquisition had contracted to buy a building at delancey street in philadelphia,then sold its right to buy the building to another purchaser.meanwhile,wright was in divorce proceedings and struggled with alcohol abuse.teitelman,concerned for wright,helped him move into one of the building vacant units.the parties contest the extent to which chawla knew about this arrangement.the new purchaser agent soon discovered wright,who left the apartment months later after the new purchaser sought to evict him.
second,wright received free legal help from teitelman and his associate.when the delancey street building new owner attempted to evict wright,teitelman defended him.teitelman also took over negotiations with the lawyer for wright wife when wright could no longer afford his previous divorce lawyer.finally,teitelman defended wright in a bank foreclosure against wright marital home.for all that work,teitelman billed wright but,and did so only after teitelman learned that the fbi was investigating their relationship.as with the apartment,the parties contest chawla involvement.
third,wright was promised commissions in his capacity as a realtor.he occasionally brought deals to world acquisition in the same manner that any realtor could,but none of those deals succeeded,so wright never earned anything.on one occasion,world acquisition granted wright and his partner the exclusive right to approach a buyer for a million property.had wright succeeded in making the sale,he would have earned a commission of million,but that deal also fell through.chawla offered wright liaison work as well but wright declined that offer.
while he was receiving those benefits,wright took three sets of actions as councilman kelly chief of staff that tended to benefit world acquisition.first,wright helped kelly propose and pass a mechanical parking ordinance.philadelphia law required developers planning to install mechanical parking to get a zoning variance,a process.at teitelman behest,wright set up a meeting at which chawla and his partner suggested that kelly change that law.kelly,who usually took a stance,agreed.chawla and teitelman prodded wright to make the bill a priority,and kelly soon after introduced the bill.the city council passed it by a vote of.
second,wright helped chawla oppose an ordinance that would cripple a planned world acquisition project.chawla envisioned a large development called river city south and west of philadelphia logan square,where residences predominate.when the neighborhood association protested,wright arranged a meeting between chawla and association leaders.afterward,wright wrote chawla and teitelman advising that his role as jack chief of staff should be to focus city staff on river city benefits.nonetheless,in the face of continued opposition,the city council passed a restriction that thwarted the river city plans.kelly joined the vote.
third,wright worked with other city offices on world acquisition behalf.when the parking authority was selling a certain property,wright forwarded public information about its request for proposal process to chawla and teitelman.wright also arranged a walkthrough of the property.he obtained public information for world acquisition from philadelphia gas works through a official rather than through the main call center.finally,wright worked with the city department of licenses and inspections on a certification that the river city property was not encumbered with zoning violations.city council staff often did so for their constituents,though this certification was unusually complicated.
in,a federal grand jury returned a indictment against chawla,teitelman,wright,and chawla brother hardeep.the indictment charged honest services fraud,traditional fraud,conspiracy to commit both kinds of fraud,and bribery in connection with a federally funded program.after a jury trial,including five days of deliberations,the jury convicted chawla,teitelman,and wright on three counts conspiracy to commit honest services and traditional fraud count one honest services fraud for the apartment arrangement count ten and traditional fraud for the apartment arrangement count twelve.the jury further convicted chawla alone on one honest services count for offering wright liaison work count three.it acquitted on the other ten counts and acquitted hardeep chawla of all counts.
the district court sentenced wright to months imprisonment,chawla to months,and teitelman to months,followed in each case by two years of supervised release.it also imposed fines and special assessments on each person.after sentencing,they filed timely appeals to our court.the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.
appellants challenge their convictions on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to convict them on any count the jury instructions on honest services fraud constitute error after the supreme court intervening decision in skilling if the honest services fraud convictions are vacated for any reason,the traditional fraud convictions must be as well due to prejudicial spillover the government constructively amended the indictment the district court allowed inadmissible evidence and it improperly calculated appellants guidelines sentencing ranges.
we stayed the briefing schedule pending the supreme court decision in skilling.after that decision,all defendants were released on bail without the government objection.
ii.discussion 
honest services fraud sufficiency of the evidence 
honest services fraud has proven hard to define.we recently reviewed its history at length,see united states riley,cir,so a shorter treatment is sufficient here.the district court instructed the jury that it could convict for honest services fraud under either a conflict of interest theory whereby it is fraud for a public servant not to disclose a conflict of interest resulting in personal gain or a bribery theory whereby it is fraud for a public servant to accept benefits in exchange for taking an official action.at the time,this instruction properly stated our law.see united states panarella,cir.however,the supreme court later construed honest services fraud to exclude the theory,holding that this interpretation of the statute would render it unconstitutionally vague.skilling.at.the jury general verdict,encompassing both theories,could thus be defective.
appellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to convict them on the bribery theory alone,requiring that we vacate their convictions.this contention echoes their motion for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,which the district court denied.
the burden on a defendant who raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is extremely high.united states lore,cir quoting united states serafini,cir.we must affirm the jury verdict so long as there is substantial evidence that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,would allow a rational trier of fact to convict.united states lee,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
we thus turn to the definition of honest services fraud.the bribery theory,which is the only theory left standing to convict for honest services fraud in our case requires a quid pro quo,united states kemp,cir,that is,a specific intent to give or receive something of value in exchange for an official act.united states sun diamond growers of,emphasis in original.the supreme court has contrasted bribery with a gratuity,which is merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take,and may already have determined to take,or for a past act that he has already taken.id.at.the bribery theory does not require that each quid,or item of value,be linked to a specific quo,or official act.rather,a bribe may come in the form of a stream of benefits.united states bryant,cir.the public official need not even perform the official acts if he stood ready to do so having intended to accept a bribe.id.intent is the determinant.the key to whether a gift constitutes a bribe is whether the parties intended for the benefit to be made in exchange for some official action indeed,the government need not prove that each gift was provided with the intent to prompt a specific official act.kemp,at.
an honest services fraud prosecution for bribery after skilling thus requires the factfinder to determine two things.first,it must conclude that the payor provided a benefit to a public official intending that he will thereby take favorable official acts that he would not otherwise take.second,it must conclude that the official accepted those benefits with the intent to take official acts to benefit the payor.see bryant,at kemp,at.the intent of both parties may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.the quid pro quo can be implicit,that is,a conviction can occur if the government shows that the official accepted payments or other consideration with the implied understanding that he would perform or not perform an act in his official capacity under color of official right.united states antico,cir.
as noted,the jury convicted all three appellants on count one,conspiracy to commit honest services fraud in violation of.the specific elements of conspiracy to violate federal law are an agreement to commit an offense proscribed by federal law the defendants intentionally joining in the agreement and one of the conspirators committing an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states rigas,cir en banc.in the honest services fraud context,the government must prove overt acts in furtherance of a quid pro quo,such as mutual and contemporaneous benefits.
there were mutual and contemporaneous benefits in this case.teitelman provided wright a free place to live and free legal services.as we discuss below,chawla likely knew of their arrangement and could have encouraged it.that arrangement supported the convictions of all three appellants on count ten,a specific instance of alleged honest services fraud.chawla also was undeniably involved in extending wright his exclusive potential commission,and teitelman sent the email expressly granting that opportunity.in addition,chawla sent wright the email offering him liaison work,which was the basis for his conviction on count three.at the same time,wright helped chawla bring mechanical parking to kelly attention.thereafter,wright made sure that councilman kelly office quickly prepared a bill and had kelly introduce it.wright also set up meetings for chawla to persuade the logan square neighborhood association to support river city.he did so even though his boss,kelly,planned to vote for the city height restriction because logan square councilman supported it.finally,wright used his influence and knowledge to work with city agencies on world acquisition behalf more effectively than chawla or teitelman could.
intent,which the government must prove both for conspiracy in count one and for the specific frauds in counts three and ten,is the more difficult question.parties to a bribery scheme rarely reduce their intent to words,but the law does not require that.the official and the payor need not state the quid pro quo in express terms,for otherwise the law effect could be frustrated by knowing winks and nods.the inducement from the official is criminal if it is implied from his words and actions evans united states,kennedy,concurring in part and in the judgment.furthermore,count one is a conspiracy charge,and the very nature of the crime of conspiracy is such that it often may be established only by indirect and circumstantial evidence.united states brodie,cir.inferring mental state from circumstantial evidence is among the chief tasks of factfinders.we rely on the good sense of jurors and,where applicable,trial judges to distinguish intent from knowledge or recklessness where the direct evidence is necessarily scanty.
in this case,a reasonable jury could find that each appellant had fraudulent intent.therefore,appellants have failed to show that the evidence against them was insufficient,as a jury could find that the government had proven each of the elements of honest services fraud and conspiracy to commit it.we consider the inferences that a jury could have made about each appellant in turn.
first,consider wright.the language of some of his emails could persuade a jury that he intended to be influenced.for example,the information about the parking authority property that wright provided to chawla and teitelman was publicly available.but in advising chawla of a certain deadline,wright added that t he party must sign in and this will be a public record it would not be a good thing for me to sign for this rfp so you should do it or someone from world acquisition should do it.regarding river city,wright emailed chawla copying teitelman without prompting to offer his help.y ou need someone to contact and monitor city planning efforts,wright wrote.my role as jack chief of staff should be to keep city planning focus on what r iver c ity will bring to philadelphia tax for the next twenty years.
this is the language of collaboration and influence.in the spring of,the date of both emails,wright was living in the delancey street apartment and receiving teitelman legal help.mere simultaneity does not create an exchange,but,coupled with the emails,a jury could infer intent.in addition,the government presented other evidence that could indicate wright intent.in one heated exchange with kelly in the summer of,kelly told wright that he should be paying rent for the apartment and that wright relationship with world acquisition should be squeaky clean.though he knew it was an issue,wright lived in the apartment for a year thereafter without paying rent.
second,a jury could infer that chawla knew of and approved the benefits that wright received.the contract under which chawla sold his rights to buy delancey street,the site of wright free apartment,forbade chawla from putting new tenants there.wright presence before closing would risk the deal collapse.yet,sometime around the closing,a friend had told chawla that wright was happy and comfortable in the apartment.chawla,rather than being surprised or upset,was happy about that.chawla also conceded to kelly in mid that andy teitelman gives wright free legal advice.teitelman was chawla lawyer working in chawla office.as teitelman was representing wright in a divorce,a foreclosure,and an eviction,it is plausible that chawla approved of it.a reasonable jury could combine that knowledge with chawla emails to infer fraudulent intent.chawla told teitelman to chase chris on the mechanical parking issue,which teitelman promptly did.and when he learned unfavorable news about river city,chawla wrote wright,requesting simply chris please call andy or me asap.thanks.shortly thereafter,wright arranged for chawla to meet with the logan square neighborhood association.finally,in the email on which his count three conviction was based,chawla proposed that wright handle liaison work for world acquisition,though he declined.
third,it is plausible that teitelman intended to help influence wright.there is no dispute that teitelman got wright fourteen free months in an apartment with a parking space in an affluent neighborhood.when the agent of the delancey street building new owner found wright there,everyone passed the buck to teitelman,who promised to have wright moved out when the owner requested.instead,teitelman defended wright in the eviction attempt,drafting the answer to the eviction complaint referred to in count ten.and there is no dispute that teitelman acted as wright personal lawyer in other matters when wright could no longer afford one.teitelman himself sent many of the emails soliciting official acts from wright,and he teitelman was copied as a recipient on most others.a jury could infer that teitelman conferred these benefits on wright so that he would help the business of teitelman main client,chawla.
thus,drawing all possible inferences in the government favor,a reasonable jury could have found that chawla and teitelman conferred benefits on wright intending to secure his favors,and that wright accepted those benefits intending to aid chawla and teitelman.the evidence was therefore sufficient to convict appellants of honest services fraud,and conspiracy to commit that fraud,under the bribery theory alone.
honest services fraud erroneous jury instruction 
appellants also challenge their honest services fraud convictions in counts one,three,and ten on the ground that skilling rendered the district court jury instructions erroneous.both sides agree that the jury was instructed on multiple theories of guilt,one of which is improper.hedgpeth pulido,per curiam.in light of skilling,the jury should have been instructed on the bribery theory but not the theory.
this determination,however,does not necessarily require reversal of the honest services fraud conviction s errors of this variety are subject to analysis.skilling.at.we presume that such errors are not harmless unless it can be prove d beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.united states waller,cir quoting chapman california.that appellants objected to the district court honest services fraud instruction on other grounds suffices to preserve this issue for our review.see black united states,b y properly objecting to the jury instructions at trial,defendants secured their right to challenge those instructions on appeal.
we do not believe that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury instruction on the theory did not affect the honest services verdict.that theory required nondisclosure of a financial interest that could conflict with a public official duty to provide honest services.see panarella,at.there is ample evidence on which the jury could have convicted appellants under that theory.by contrast,the evidence supporting the bribery theory,while sufficient,is less than the overwhelming evidence needed to hold that an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states balter,cir.
in particular,the jury may have drawn inferences about appellants intent that would not sustain a verdict based on the bribery theory.in the context,we must draw all reasonable inferences in the government favor.without that constraint here,we believe that other inferences about appellants intent are plausible.as above,we will address the intent of each appellant in turn.
first,wright may have intended not to be influenced,but merely to do his job.by reputation and by his own trial testimony,councilman kelly favored developers and business interests.he also testified that constituent services advancing his policy goals were part of wright job.wright therefore could not pick and choose which developers he would assist.kelly no less than chawla encouraged wright to make mechanical parking a priority in his office.on,kelly approved of wright other official acts as within the scope of his job.kelly legislative assistant also testified that while chawla and his brother called a lot,they were among many constituents who did so.the president of the northeast philadelphia chamber of commerce,for example,testified that wright went personally to visit with its members and worked with many city departments on their behalf.when chawla requests extended beyond constituent services,as in his offer of liaison work,wright declined.on this evidence,the jury could have acquitted wright of honest services fraud under the bribery theory because he lacked the required intent to be influenced.
second,it is not clear beyond doubt that the jury found chawla seeking to bribe wright.the government presented little evidence that chawla directed teitelman gifts or even that he was closely involved with them.there was no direct evidence that chawla knew that wright stayed in the apartment for free until well after wright had performed the official acts at issue.this is a critical distinction because,were wright paying,his tenancy could not constitute a gift.the jury thus could have inferred that chawla knew only that teitelman had found wright a place to live.and while chawla knew of teitelman free legal services for wright,there is no evidence that he asked teitelman to perform them.chawla openly admitted knowledge of these legal services when kelly was asking him about his ties to wright in a conversation that the fbi instigated and recorded.moreover,chawla brief emails do not necessarily show sinister intent.executives are known for quick missives tapped out on mobile devices between meetings.the jury thus might have concluded that while chawla knew the possible ramifications of teitelman gifts to wright,he did not intend thereby to influence wright.
third,teitelman friendship with wright offers a motive for his generosity other than fraud.the evidence establishes,and the government does not dispute,that wright and teitelman were close friends.it is equally clear that wright was in dire personal straits at the time.his mother had just died of cancer,he was embroiled in a marital fight and divorce,he was essentially broke,and he was drinking heavily.teitelman was among wright few friends who intervened and helped him enter rehabilitation.those same friends agreed that wright should walk to work in center city philadelphia rather than drive to and from his brother home.while friendship is no bar to an honest services fraud conviction as the parties involved are often friends,these facts show a close friendship.here,the jury could have found that friendship,not fraud,motivated teitelman to find the apartment in center city and to act as wright lawyer.
in addition to these alternate inferences about appellants intent,the context of the trial suggests that the jury may have convicted based on the erroneous instruction.see virgin islands martinez,cir while many cases focus on the quantum of evidence against the defendants,analysis must,by necessity,take into account the totality of the circumstances.citation omitted.for example,the government insisted in its opening argument that public disclosure forms exist to ensure that public service is not being tainted.it also linked the pennsylvania ethics laws to bribery in its closing arguments.and the jury instructions themselves devoted about eight times more words to the theory than they did to the bribery theory.
considering these plausible alternate inferences about appellants intent and a trial environment that emphasized the theory,we can not say that the erroneous instruction did not contribute to the verdict.we therefore vacate appellants honest services fraud convictions and remand for a new trial.
traditional mail fraud sufficiency of the evidence 
appellants other convictions were for traditional mail fraud.in addition to charging a conspiracy to commit honest services fraud,count one charged that appellants conspired,in violation of,to commit traditional fraud.count twelve,the only specific instance of traditional fraud in the indictment,charged that appellants committed mail fraud in violation of,inter alia.the jury convicted on both counts.appellants challenge these convictions,as they challenged their honest services fraud convictions,on the ground that the evidence was insufficient.
our standard of review in the context,while technically plenary,is stringent.to repeat,we must affirm the jury verdict so long as there is substantial evidence that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,would allow a rational trier of fact to convict.lee,at quotation marks and citation omitted.this challenge thus places a very heavy burden on the appellant s.united states dent,citation omitted.
we read to contain three elements a scheme to defraud use of the mails to further that scheme and fraudulent intent.united states jimenez,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.we have elaborated that fraudulent representations,as the term is used in section,may be effected by deceitful statements or or the concealment of material facts and the devising of a scheme for obtaining money or property by such statements or concealments.united states olatunji,cir modification in original quoting united states allen,cir.
traditional mail fraud under involves defrauding a private party of money or property,whereas honest services fraud under involves defrauding the public of an official honest services.unlike honest services fraud,skilling did not disturb the law of traditional fraud.both count ten and count twelve were based on the same facts wright occupancy of the delancey street apartment and the answer that teitelman mailed in wright eviction case but whereas count ten charged that the scheme defrauded philadelphia citizens of wright honest services,count twelve charged that the scheme defrauded the building owner,pbrg,of rent payments.
we believe that,under the demanding standard of review applied here,we can not say the evidence was insufficient to convict appellants of traditional fraud.we consider each of the three elements of traditional mail fraud in turn.
the first element is that there was a fraudulent scheme.a reasonable jury could have found that appellants sought to defraud pbrg of wright rent.pbrg bought the building to renovate it and convert it to condominiums.for that reason,pbrg principal,robert guttman,testified that he certainly wanted to know how many units of the mostly vacant building were occupied.yet at the closing no one mentioned that wright had just moved in.that was not for want of opportunity.guttman had bought his right to purchase the building from chawla,and teitelman formed pbrg as an entity for the purpose of guttman and his brother buying buildings from world acquisition.moreover,at closing guttman was provided with a document that listed wright apartment as empty.the government presented no evidence that chawla or teitelman prepared that document.but it would be possible for a jury to infer that,because chawla had sold pbrg its right to purchase the building,he had to approve the list.
appellants contend that,far from concealing wright presence,as olatunji requires,they were forthright about it.when pbrg realtor found wright while inspecting the building,wright did not make up a story about his presence there or say that he was paying rent.the government also does not contest that wright complained to pbrg initial building manager about his apartment plumbing.ultimately,appellants argue,any scheme to conceal wright from pbrg failed,as pbrg served him with an eviction notice early in.
a reasonable jury need not have found these arguments persuasive.chawla knew that it was important to pbrg that the building be as vacant as possible.a jury could have concluded that wright absence on the closing documents constituted concealment of his presence there.it could also conclude that wright outreach to building managers was consistent with a scheme to defraud,as those managers may have assumed that pbrg had approved what wright was doing.
the second element of traditional mail fraud is that the mailing alleged for mail fraud purposes the answer that teitelman associate filed in wright eviction case furthered the alleged fraudulent scheme.appellants point out that a mailing can not be considered even incident to an essential part of the scheme when it occurs after the scheme has reached fruition.united states yusuf,cir.any scheme to defraud pbrg by concealing wright occupancy,appellants argue,must have ended by the time that teitelman associate mailed a public legal document admitting that wright was there.therefore,they contend,the sole alleged mailing could not have furthered the scheme.
a reasonable jury could have viewed the nature of the scheme differently,so that it did not end as soon as pbrg became aware of wright presence.the indictment alleges that the nature of the scheme was t o continue allowing wright the free use of the delancey street apartment and parking space the affirmative misstatement alleged toward that end was the claim,made in the mailed answer,that wright had pbrg permission to live in the building.viewing the scheme in this way,a jury could conclude that the mailed answer furthered the scheme.
the third element is that the defendant s knew about the alleged scheme and,therefore,could have had the requisite intent to defraud.chawla and wright each claim that,to the extent that any such scheme existed,he did not know about it.chawla asserts that there was no evidence that he knew of wright eviction,though he knew that wright was in the apartment and that teitelman was helping him with legal issues.wright similarly points to the lack of evidence that he knew about his exclusion from the closing documents or about any false statements made on his behalf during his eviction proceedings.
the government responds with two arguments that a reasonable jury could have found persuasive.first,the evidence was sufficient for the jury to make the necessary inferences.wright,as teitelman client,could have known what documents were being filed on his behalf.indeed,wright asked teitelman to handle the eviction complaint.and chawla told kelly in that he knew that wright was living in the building and that wright was tight on money.second,even if chawla and wright did not personally know of or intend a fraud,act as mutual agents for one another.see,united states pungitore,cir.as such,each becomes responsible for the acts of the other.on these grounds,a jury could have inferred not only that wright and chawla knew about the scheme to defraud but also that they intended it.
teitelman raises a fourth issue in his brief.he asserts that if appellants did conceal any information from pbrg,that information was not material,as the law requires.see neder united states,a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.quoting united states gaudin.teitelman argues that wright presence was not material because it did not impair pbrg ability to convert the building into condominiums.however,guttman testified that the presence of any renters or squatters in the building would have been material to him as,in effect,its purchaser.a reasonable jury could have determined,then,that information about wright presence might have changed guttman mind about the building value.
based on the evidence recounted above,a reasonable jury could conclude that appellants agreed on a scheme to defraud pbrg of payment for wright tenancy by concealing his presence,that the answer mailed in wright eviction case furthered that scheme,and that all three appellants knew of the scheme and intended that it succeed.therefore,a reasonable jury could have convicted appell
