fei yan zhu,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her motion to reopen her removal proceedings pursuant to.because the bia opinion did not reflect meaningful consideration of much of the evidence that zhu submitted in support of her motion,we will grant the petition for review,vacate the order denying the motion to reopen,and remand to the bia for further proceedings 
zhu is from changmen village,guantou town,lianjiang county,fujian province,china.she entered the united states in without proper documentation.during her interview with the immigration and naturalization service ins,she stated that she feared persecution because of her opposition to china population control policies.the ins determined that she met the credible fear standard,and she was paroled into the united states for a hearing before an immigration judge ij to determine her eligibility for asylum.
on february,zhu appeared before the ij,conceded her removability,and filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,based on a claim that she had been would be persecuted for having resisted population control measures.at the hearing,zhu testified that she had a heated exchange with birth control officials and that they tried to force her to wear an intrauterine device when they learned she and her boyfriend were living together.the ij found zhu testimony lacked credibility,denied her application,and ordered her removed to china.the bia affirmed the ij decision without an opinion.
in,zhu filed a timely motion to reopen,alleging that since the time of the ij decision she had married and given birth to a son,and that she would be forcibly sterilized if she returned to china.the bia denied the motion,noting that zhu only had one child,which was not in violation of chinese population control policies,and that she had not shown that a chinese national becomes automatically subject to punitive birth control measures if she has returned with a child or children born outside china.appendix app.
in,zhu filed a second motion to reopen,alleging that she had given birth to two more children and that conditions had changed in china because the chinese government now counted children born overseas when considering violations of its population control policies.she submitted,among other things,a notice from the family planning office of lianjiang county to zhu parents,indicating that zhu must submit to sterilization upon her return to china,and a letter from her mother,noting that the officials had learned that zhu had children.the bia denied the motion because zhu documentation showed no material change in country conditions,but rather reflected incremental increases in the enforcement of family planning policies in china that have been in existence for approximately years.app.
on january,zhu filed a third motion to reopen,this time with voluminous documentation that she asserts demonstrates a material change in china enforcement of its population control policies in her home region.see app.these documents purportedly come from the government,chinese government websites,chinese governmental entities or officials,and international media outlets.she contends that these documents show that the united states department of state may china profile of asylum claims and country conditions the profile,which the bia had previously relied upon concerning treatment of those who violate the population control policies,does not reflect current conditions in china.among other things,zhu asserts that these documents show that children now count for family planning purposes and new programs have been implemented in her home province that more strictly enforce population controls.zhu also provided an affidavit from an expert opining about the authenticity of four documents purporting to embody population control enforcement measures from changle city,which is approximately thirty kilometers from zhu hometown of guantou.on march,the bia denied zhu motion to reopen,concluding that she had failed to establish a material change in country conditions and had not demonstrated a prima facie case for cat relief.zhu thereafter filed a petition for review.
the bia had jurisdiction under to review zhu motion to reopen,and we have jurisdiction to review the bia decision pursuant to a.we review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.guo ashcroft,cir thus,the bia ultimate decision is entitled to broad deference,ezeagwuna ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and will not be disturbed unless it is found to be arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.guo,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted similarly,we review the bia evidentiary rulings deferentially.see cheng att y,cir.
with limited exceptions,a motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of the date of entry of a final administrative order.c.to obtain relief based on an untimely motion to reopen,zhu had to provide material evidence of changed conditions in china that could not have been discovered or presented during the previous proceeding.see c ii.here,the bia denied zhu motion to reopen her removal proceedings because it found h er evidence is not sufficient to establish a material change in circumstances or country conditions arising in the country of nationality so as to create an exception to the time and number limitations for filing another late motion to reopen to apply for asylum,and she has not demonstrated a prima facie case for protection under cat.app.
to determine if the bia abused its discretion in finding that zhu did not present evidence to establish a material change in country conditions,we must determine if the bia meaningfully considered the evidence and arguments zhu presented.zheng att y,cir.this does not mean that the bia is required to expressly parse each point or discuss each piece of evidence presented,id.at,but it may not ignore evidence favorable to the alien.huang att y.cir.to fulfill this requirement,the bia must provide an indication that it considered such evidence,and if the evidence is rejected,an explanation as to why it was rejected.
in this case,zhu presented more than documents,spanning over pages.with little explanation,the bia concluded that zhu failed to authenticate documents from china documents from places other than zhu hometown or county do not establish she is likely to be persecuted her expert opinion concerning the authenticity of four foreign documents was speculative evidence from components of the united states government did not show zhu would be subjected to sterilization and she did not show that the profile is now inaccurate or unreliable.we will examine the bia treatment of each category of evidence.
foreign government documents 
authentication generally 
we first address the authentication of documents from foreign sources.pursuant to official foreign records must be evidenced by an official publication or certified by an officer in the foreign service of the united states,stationed in the foreign country where the record is kept.attempting to comply with this provision,zhu attorney sent each chinese government document to the consulate general of the united states in guangzhou,china,and the fujian provincial foreign affairs office,asking for assistance in authenticating the documents,but he received no replies.
although failure to authenticate pursuant to does not result in automatic exclusion,liu ashcroft,cir,an unsuccessful effort to obtain such a certification does not excuse the proponent of the document from providing other grounds on which the bia could find that a document is what it purports to be.indeed,we have held that when an asylum seeker fails to comply with the certification procedure set forth in because of a lack of cooperation from government officials in the country of alleged persecution,that individual may attempt to prove the authenticity through other means.lin att y,cir citing liu,at.proponents of evidence have an obligation to lay a foundation from which a factfinder can conclude the evidence is what it purports to be and that it is trustworthy.the bia concluded that zhu had not established the authenticity of her foreign documents in another manner.app.other than its analysis of the expert opinion concerning a handful of local documents,the decision treats most of the foreign documents zhu submitted similarly,regardless of their alleged source,and does not address whether other efforts were made to authenticate the documents and,if so,why they failed 
although the federal rules of evidence do not apply to immigration proceedings,ezeagwuna,at,evidence is admissible if it is probative and its use is fundamentally fair so as not to deprive the alien of due process.see,lin dep t of justice,cir.exclusion of evidence is exceptional.ins lopez mendoza.nonetheless,the bia can reject evidence that it finds to be untrustworthy or irrelevant and can accept evidence that has significant indicia of reliability.
these significant indicia of reliability may be shown in various ways.for example,proponents could turn to the federal rules of evidence,even though they are not binding,for guidance.here,some of the documents zhu presented appear to come from chinese government websites indicated by.domain names.app.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,considering the same documents and relying on,held that documents from chinese government websites are presumptively authentic if government sponsorship can be verified by visiting the website itself.chen holder,cir.this is one example of how the federal rules of evidence may provide an avenue to authenticate documents 
in addition,proponents may provide other grounds upon which the bia could find the documents authentic.for instance,the proponent could provide information concerning how the document was obtained,identify the source of the information contained in the document,or show that there are consistencies between the information contained in the otherwise unauthenticated document and authenticated documents.a proponent could also offer an expert to testify about these topics and others,such as the use of government seals or the presence of official signatures with which the expert is familiar.the proponent could also offer forensic testing results or evidence from the united states department of state concerning foreign documents.liu,at reminding the bia that it may choose to order forensic testing of the original document,take additional testimony,and seek guidance from state department reports.we emphasize that the burden to make this showing of authenticity as well as relevance rests with the proponent of the document.the bia is not required to conduct an independent examination of a document where the proponent has provided no basis from which it could find the document is authentic or decipher its relevance.thus,if a proponent fails to make such a showing,then it is within the bia discretion to decline to rely on such evidence.if such a showing is made,then the bia must consider the evidence.see zheng,at.
documents from guantou town and lianjiang county 
turning to zhu evidence,we will first examine the bia treatment of documents from zhu hometown and county,which the bia either ignored,rejected,or discounted.these documents purport to describe recent population campaigns to meet quotas for sterilizations and abortions the court of appeals for the seventh circuit reviewed many of the same documents and noted that if the documents are genuine,they constitute strong evidence that harrowing practices are common in her hometown and county.ni,at.the bia did not specifically discuss these documents,so we do not know if it discounted them because they lacked authenticity or relevance,or for some other reason.thus,we are unable to evaluate whether the bia appropriately exercised its discretion.
because the documents from zhu hometown and county that she presented,if authentic,may be probative and other avenues may be available to authenticate them,and because we are unable to discern why the bia discounted them,we will remand to the bia for it to consider whether zhu has made a showing of authenticity and relevance concerning those documents.if the bia determines that such a showing has been made,then it may give whatever weight it deems appropriate to that evidence in light of all of the other evidence presented.liu,at t he bia may proceed on remand as it does with respect to any evidentiary question,evaluating issues of materiality,relevance,probity,and the general requirements of due process.
documents from fujian province 
we next examine the documents from neighboring areas within zhu home province,fujian.zhu offered documents that appear to come from fujian government website and other province level sources as well as internal government documents from other towns and counties within fujian that purport to describe population control campaign details and policies.the bia found documents outside zhu hometown and county inapplicable to zhu,and hence irrelevant.the bia treatment of this evidence is inconsistent with its past decisions wherein it allowed a petitioner to establish eligibility for relief based upon evidence that the births of her children violated family planning policies in that alien local province,municipality,or other area.in re j h s,bia shao mukasey,cir noting the bia acknowledges the local nature of family planning enforcement in china.moreover,the bia inexplicably found the information in these documents to be of no value yet found information in country reports describing activities in areas outside of zhu home region,as described below,worthy of consideration.because the bia did not explain why it did not consider zhu evidence from other areas within her home province of of which are within kilometers of her which may corroborate her claim,we will remand for the bia to consider whether the documents from zhu province are authentic and relevant,and,if they are,why they do not warrant reopening the proceedings 
we will,however,not disturb the decision to reject the expert opinion that zhu offered to authenticate four documents purportedly from the chang le city population and family planning leadership group,chinese communist party chang le city shou zhan township committee,and the shou zhan township population and family planning leadership group.zhu expert,flora sapio opined that the documents were authentic based on their language,style,format,and internal coherence.she identified two of the documents as notices,and concluded,based on their bureaucratic language and the persons to whom they are addressed,that one is from an organ of the state and one is from the party committee of shouzhan township in fujian province.she then explained that the other two documents are likely internal memoranda that administrative law enforcement officials used or possibly distributed to residents,given their simple language and terse tone.the bia discounted sapio expert opinion because it found it speculates as to the credibility of the authors and the circumstances under which the documents were created.app.
as stated earlier,we review the bia evidentiary ruling deferentially.cheng,at.under this deferential standard,we can not say that the bia abused its discretion in discounting the expert opinion.other than saying that she received the documents from zhu counsel,sapio does not provide any information concerning how or from whom the documents were obtained.moreover,while sapio explained why the presence or absence of serial numbers,the paper size,headings,interlinear spaces,margins,main body of text,official seals,filing information,and classification level suggest that they are authentic documents from government entities,she provided no statements that show she is familiar with official seals or serial numbers used by the purported sources of these documents such that a factfinder could determine that the document comes from the entity associated with the seal.thus,the bia had no information upon which to determine the source of these four documents other than the linguistic analysis on which sapio asked the bia to rely.unlike other evidence it inexplicably dis
