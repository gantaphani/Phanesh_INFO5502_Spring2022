walter raleigh johnson,johnson appeals his conviction for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine.he argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of a drug enforcement administration dea agent under federal rule of evidence rule and erred in admitting the testimony of a prior alleged drug customer under rule b.because we find that the court erroneously admitted testimony under rule and rule b,and that the errors were not harmless,we reverse johnson conviction and remand his case for a new trial.
the sheriff department of greenwood county,south carolina began conducting the drug investigation at issue in january.as part of that investigation,a drug informant collaborated with the sheriff department and the greenville,south carolina dea office to identify mayo pickens pickens as a source of cocaine in the area.after setting up phone calls and meetings and observing drug transactions between the informant and pickens,the dea obtained a wiretap for pickens cell phone.although hundreds of calls were intercepted from pickens phone over the period of the wiretap,only about of those calls were relevant to the drug investigation.out of the relevant calls,only eight were intercepted between pickens and johnson,all occurring between june,and july.based on the eight phone conversations between pickens and johnson,the dea concluded that johnson was one of pickens suppliers of cocaine.johnson was arrested in august,indicted in october,and charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of a,b a and.there were eleven codefendants charged as part of the same conspiracy,including pickens,yusef lateef holloway holloway and wayne edward hull hull.johnson and two other defendants in this case were the only parties who chose to go to trial.pickens,holloway and hull all pled guilty.
at trial,the government called four main witnesses in its case against johnson dea agent randy smith agent smith presented testimony on the wiretap investigation.holloway testified that he purchased cocaine from johnson for two years beginning in.hull,a drug customer of holloway,testified that holloway got his drugs from johnson.finally,khalil timpson timpson testified that he purchased drugs from johnson in.
agent smith was permitted to interpret four of the eight phone calls recorded between pickens and johnson during his testimony.after eliciting agent smith credentials,which included eighteen years experience as a dea agent,the government played excerpts of the various phone calls for the jury,while referring them to a transcript of the calls the government attorney would then refer agent smith to a particular phrase in the conversation and ask him to explain its meaning.for example special agent smith,close to the beginning of the call there is a line or there a phrase that used by johnson,i going to hit you and let you know what happening.before agent smith could offer his opinion,counsel for johnson objected on the grounds that the question called for speculation.the district court asked the government attorney to lay a foundation for testimony interpreting the calls.the government attorney did so in the following manner 
q special agent smith,how long have you been a dea agent 
a since april of.
q and how the course of that time you have with dea how many wiretaps have you participated in 
a approximately ten.
q and how many consensual calls have you monitored or participated in with informants 
a easily over a hundred.
q and how many cooperating defendants have you debriefed or interviewed 
a probably more than a hundred.
q have you many defendants have you debriefed or interviewed who were actually involved in this case 
a at least ten.
q have most of those interviews occurred before or after the initiation of the wiretap 
a most of them occurred after.
q are you familiar with the street terms i assuming they change from,but are you familiar with the street terms typically used by those involved in the drug trade 
a yes i am.
q all right.based on your investigation thus far,prior to the wiretap and now after the wiretap,what the did johnson part of the conversation midway down the page when they are talking about hitting ya,what did that mean to you 
over the defense counsel renewed objection,agent smith was permitted to answer he referring sic that when he is able to obtain cocaine,he let pickens know so they can purchase it or so he can purchase it.when asked how he knew that cocaine was the subject of the conversation,agent smith replied,j ust based on other calls.id.agent smith translated s omebody hit me on anything i let you know what happening,to mean when he johnson able to get cocaine and drugs,he will call pickens and let him know.despite continually premising agent smith testimony on his training and experience,the government never proffered agent smith as an expert witness.instead,the officer continued to offer his opinion regarding the nature of the phone calls between pickens and johnson.although he maintained that the conversations referenced drug deals,agent smith admitted that there was no information that pickens and johnson actually conducted a drug transaction during the time period that the phone calls took place.he further testified that he was not the officer who conducted the surveillance in the investigation and could not offer testimony regarding what the surveillance uncovered.
in addition to agent smith testimony,the government called holloway,a with an extensive prior record who pled guilty to conspiracy in the case,to testify against johnson.holloway testified that he had known johnson since,and that he began to buy drugs from him in anderson,south carolina in the summer of.though he pooled the purchase money with hull,another drug dealer in the area,holloway testified that he went alone to transact deals because johnson did not trust hull.holloway told the jury that over the next couple of years he purchased approximately forty to kilograms of cocaine from johnson,half a kilogram to four kilograms per transaction.the drug deals occurred in greenville,south carolina or atlanta,georgia and the surrounding area.holloway testified that the deals took place at a wendy parking lot on several occasions,as well as a red lobster parking lot and an apartment complex.during one deal in july,holloway and johnson had a conversation on the quality of the cocaine being supplied and the price.holloway alleged johnson drugs were bad because they did not yield as much product as expected and that the price per kilogram was too high,thereby harming his ability to make a profit on it.in december,during the last deal that took place between the two,holloway attempted to get his money back from johnson for a bad batch of cocaine but was unable to do so.holloway testified that he purchased drugs from a different supplier until his arrest in august.
hull,another,testified that he was supplied drugs by holloway and that holloway source was johnson.although hull asserted he never went along for drug transactions,he stated he had met johnson in the course of dealing cocaine in anderson,south carolina,and even went to a strip club in atlanta with holloway and johnson.hull therefore pooled drug purchase money with holloway to buy from johnson but was not permitted to buy directly from him.hull testified that despite complaints regarding the quality of cocaine johnson supplied,holloway continued to purchase drugs from johnson because he was the cheapest supplier 
dea agent jarvis agent reeder testified to further inconsistencies in the testimony given by holloway and hull.agent reeder,who conducted a interview with hull,and wrote a report based on that interview,testified that hull stated he taught holloway how to cook cocaine into crack,whereas holloway testified that johnson taught him how to reduce cocaine to crack.agent reeder also testified that hull stated in his interview that he and holloway met johnson in atlanta,but never mentioned meeting him in anderson,south carolina,as hull related in his testimony.
the final witness the government called against johnson was timpson.prior to his testimony,defense counsel objected pursuant to rule b,arguing that timpson testimony was inadmissible character evidence.the district court overruled the objection and gave the jury an instruction on the limited purpose of the prior acts testimony.for example,this evidence may properly be considered to prove the defendant motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake or accident.in this instance the government seeks to offer the testimony to prove knowledge and intent.
timpson is currently serving a prison sentence imposed in in north carolina for possession of crack cocaine.he testified that in november of he purchased a kilogram of cocaine per week from johnson.their drug transactions followed a pattern.timpson would deliver the purchase money to johnson at his rim shop,east cost wheels,in greenville,south carolina.johnson would then call timpson and arrange for delivery of the cocaine at bailey sports bar in greenville.this alleged pattern lasted for three to four months,until johnson moved to atlanta.timpson was arrested in january,and though he cooperated with the authorities at the time of his arrest,he did not tell the agents that johnson had been his drug supplier,and instead gave the names of two other individuals.after timpson testimony,the district court ruled his testimony admissible under rule b.
johnson called several witnesses to testify regarding his mode of employment.mark rice testified that johnson was a broker for his rehab real estate business in atlanta,and additionally sold household appliances in association with their business.gerald stitton testified that johnson was a broker for his car dealership,and would bring him clients on a regular basis for a referral fee.hansel little testified that he had purchased real estate,a car,and several appliances from johnson over the course of their friendship,and he had even employed johnson in his personal training business for several months.
johnson then took the stand in his own defense and asserted that not only had he never been involved with drugs before,but he had no prior record of criminal activity,and further had been employed as a united states marine,a south carolina state trooper,and an entrepreneur with several business ventures in the real estate and auto industry.johnson also called two close friends,thorpe jacob,his dentist,and alan forrest,a georgia state trooper,as well as his fiance,christina eschleman,a university administrator,and his mother,who owned a funeral home in south carolina,to testify regarding his lifestyle and character.
the jury convicted johnson on the sole conspiracy count and he was sentenced to imprisonment.this appeal followed.
on appeal,johnson argues that the district court erred in admitting the testimony of agent smith and timpson under rule and rule b respectively.we address each argument in turn.
this court reviews a district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.united states perkins,cir citing united states gray,cir.a court has abused its discretion if its decision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.brown nucor,cir quoting westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir 
evidentiary rulings are subject to harmless error review under federal rule of criminal procedure,such that in order to find a district court error harmless,we need only be able to say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.united states brooks,cir quoting united states heater,cir.
johnson argues on appeal that agent smith testimony was erroneously admitted by the district court.because agent smith was not proffered as an expert,johnson argues that his testimony was only admissible as lay opinion testimony.yet,johnson asserts that because agent smith opinions regarding the calls were not based on his own perception,but rather on his experience and training,his testimony can not be considered a lay opinion for purposes of rule.we agree.
rule permits lay opinion testimony where 
if the witness is not testifying as an expert,the witness testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are 
a rationally based on the perception of the witness,
b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of a fact in issue,and 
c not based on scientific,technical or other specialized knowledge within the scope of rule.
this court explored the line between rule and in perkins.we held lay opinion testimony must be based on personal knowledge.perkins,at.in order to adequately build a foundation for lay testimony,it must be based on the perception of the witness.emerson,cir citing.a critical distinction between rule and rule testimony is that an expert witness must possess some specialized knowledge or skill or education that is not in possession of the jurors.certain underwriters at lloyd,london sinkovich,cir citation omitted.therefore a t bottom rule forbids the admission of expert testimony dressed in lay witness clothing.perkins,at.
here,we have exactly what rule forbids.the government called agent smith to testify regarding his interpretation of the wiretapped phone calls between pickens and johnson.in response to the defense objection,the government elicited testimony on smith credentials and training,not his observations from the surveillance employed in this case.furthermore,agent smith admitted that he did not participate in the surveillance during the investigation,but rather gleaned information from interviews with suspects and charged members of the conspiracy after listening to the phone calls.his assessments can not be credited as a substitute for the personal knowledge and perception required under rule.
the government reliance on perkins to support its argument in this case is misplaced.in perkins,we found no abuse of discretion where the district court admitted the testimony of police officers regarding whether a fellow officer use of force was reasonable at a particular crime scene.though the court acknowledged that the line between lay opinion testimony under rule and expert testimony under rule is a fine one,at,the basic mandate that rule testimony be based on personal knowledge remained a guiding principle.in that instance,where the testifying officers were at the scene in question,their opinions were based on their contemporaneous perceptions and therefore satisfied the personal knowledge requirement of rule.id.at.by contrast,other officers who did not witness the officer use of force could not provide lay testimony about whether or not it was reasonable,as they would be rendering expert opinion based on information.id.
one of our sister circuits has considered this issue in an analogous case.in united states peoples,cir,the eighth circuit found that the officer in question was erroneously permitted to give her opinion regarding the meaning of plain english words and phrases when she gave a narrative gloss that consisted almost entirely of her personal opinions of what the conversations meant.id.at.importantly,the court found that the agent lacked firsthand knowledge of the matters about which she testified.her opinions were based on her investigation after the fact,not on her perception of the facts.id.at.
here,agent smith did not testify to directly observing the surveillance or even listening to all of the relevant calls in question.instead,much of his testimony was what should have been considered that of an expert,as he consistently supported his interpretations of the phone calls by referencing his experience as a dea agent,the interviews he conducted,and statements made to him by.none of this information qualifies as the foundational personal perception needed under rule.as such,the district court abused its discretion in admitting agent smith testimony as a lay witness under rule.
the government argues that even if the district court erred in admitting agent smith testimony under rule,that error is harmless because the testimony could have been admitted under rule,and there was sufficient evidence of johnson guilt independent of the agent testimony.we disagree.
rule permits expert testimony where it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine the fact in issue.experts must have specialized knowledge that will assist the trier of fact,and the knowledge,skill,experience,training and education that qualifies them on the subject of their testimony.id.the testimony must be based on sufficient facts or data,and the witness must use reliable principles and methods,and apply those principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.id.it is well established that narcotics officers can be appropriately designated as experts on the drug market and drug jargon.see united states hopkins,cir affirming introduction of expert testimony about drug trade.
this court outlined the appropriate manner by which narcotics officers should be qualified as experts in united states wilson,cir.in that case,the defendant objected at trial to a detective being designated an expert witness where he failed to provide adequate support and methodology regarding his opinions on drug jargon and code.the court found that the detective had adequately stated his methodology for deciphering the code used by the targets of the drug investigation.id.at.in affirming the district court,we noted that the detective pointed to a pattern that emerged over time regarding certain words that were used out of the context of their dictionary meanings.id.although most of the detective testimony was found to be properly admitted,we cautioned,
a lthough the district court erred in failing to exclude seabolt testimony when that testimony either interpreted language that needed no interpretation,or when seabolt did not adequately explain his methodology in reaching a questionable interpretation,the net effect was harmless because the overwhelming majority of seabolt expert testimony was properly admitted.
in the case at bar,it is clear that agent smith had sufficient expertise to qualify as a person knowledgeable in the field of narcotics.on two occasions,he enumerated his experience both as a dea agent and in conducting wiretap investigations.however,the supreme court has made clear that in addition to having the requisite specialized knowledge,the expert testimony must be the reliable product of reliable principles and methods that are reliably applied to the facts of the case.id.at quoting.advisory committee note see also,kumho tire carmichael,citing daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.although agent smith repeatedly indicated that he had the expertise to testify regarding drug jargon and the drug trade generally,he provided virtually no methodology or guiding principles that would enable him to decode the wiretapped phone calls in this case.
as such,we can not say with any fair assurance that agent smith testimony would have been admitted as expert testimony.see brooks,at.by the government own admission,the phrases smith interpreted were not typical drug code and did not have common meaning in the drug world,resp t br.internal quotation marks omitted,which highlights the need for more information as to how smith experience in drug enforcement would qualify him as an expert in interpreting uncommon slang.in these circumstances,the government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the district court would have admitted this somewhat unique testimony under rule based on agent smith general experience alone.see united states curbelo,cir f or nonconstitutional errors,the government must demonstrate that the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
beyond arguing the district court error was harmless under rule,the government argues that there was sufficient evidence,in addition to agent smith testimony,which supported johnson conviction.however,because agent smith testimony leant critical credibility bolstering the government reliance on the testimony of three convicted drug dealers who often contradicted themselves,we can not agree,and find the district court error was not harmless.
in order for an evidentiary ruling to be harmless,we must find that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.see brooks,at.often in criminal cases where there is a significant amount of evidence which inculpates a defendant independent of the erroneous testimony,the error is considered harmless.see united states banks,cir.however,in this instance,the evidence against johnson can not be viewed independently from agent smith testimony.
both holloway and hull,in this case,testified against johnson.each of them has a criminal history dating back over ten years,and each sought sentencing consideration for their cooperation in testifying.though holloway offered direct testimony regarding johnson alleged involvement in the conspiracy,his testimony was contradicted by hull on several points.for example,holloway testified that he always went alone to meet johnson and that johnson prices were expensive.by contrast,hull testified that he and holloway took a trip to atlanta with johnson and that holloway dealt with johnson because he was the cheapest supplier.hull also testified that he did not have direct knowledge of johnson alleged drug involvement because he never witnessed a transaction take place.furthermore,agent reeder testimony highlighted further inconsistencies,such as whether hull or johnson taught holloway to cook crack,and whether or not hull ever met johnson in anderson,south carolina.
timpson testimony was also questionable.although he claimed to have cooperated with the authorities regarding his drug involvement when he was sentenced in,he did not name johnson as one of his suppliers.instead,he named two other individuals,despite allegedly purchasing drugs from johnson on a weekly basis for at least three months.
furthermore,the government offered no direct evidence that linked johnson to the charged conspiracy aside from the testimony of holloway.no drugs were found,no financial evidence was presented and there was no surveillance that captured johnson engaging in illicit activity,despite the extensive investigation mounted by the local dea.
thus,where three witnesses had considerable credibility issues in a case with little additional evidence,agent smith testimony leant credence to their claims because his wiretap interpretations supported their testimony that johnson was in fact involved in drug dealing.had agent smith testimony been excluded,the jury would have weighed the testimony of johnson,a veteran and former law enforcement officer with no criminal record,against that of a convicted drug dealer and two with long rap sheets.where agent smith testimony buttressed evidence against johnson that was otherwise weak,we can not conclude that the evidence was unimportant or was not a substantial factor in the jury verdict.united states grinage,cir see also peoples,at holding the rule error was not harmless where the jury may have found the testimony of a inadequate to support a guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt had it not been buttressed by the agent supporting information and opinions.
we thus can not find that admission of agent smith testimony was harmless where it bolstered the scant,conflicting,and not entirely credible evidence against johnson.
johnson next argues that timpson testimony was not properly admitted under rule b because it was not relevant to nor necessary to prove johnson intent or knowledge in the case.he further argues that this error was not harmless due to the paucity of evidence before the court linking him to the conspiracy.we agree.
rule rule b provides 
evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.it may,however,be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident
