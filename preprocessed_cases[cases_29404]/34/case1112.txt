felix dejesus and ricardo rosario appeal from judgments entered on september,and october,respectively,in the district court for the district of connecticut underhill,sentencing dejesus principally to two concurrent terms of months imprisonment and rosario to months imprisonment.appellants were convicted after a jury trial of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute,respectively,grams of heroin and grams of crack cocaine,and grams of heroin,in violation of a,b a,and.in a concurrently filed summary order,we address appellants challenges to the district court rulings on a motion to suppress,a number of evidentiary issues,including limitations on of cooperating witnesses,a motion under,and application of the sentencing guidelines.here,we hold that the public safety exception to the miranda rule rendered admissible dejesus statement that he had a gun in his jacket,made at the time of his arrest in response to a police question that preceded the miranda warnings.we also hold that a district court policy of not permitting impeachment of witnesses with the statutory names of a witness offenses of conviction violates.a but that the error was harmless in this case.
background 
we recite only the facts pertinent to the issues addressed in this opinion.
motion to suppress 
before trial,dejesus moved to suppress as the product of an illegal custodial interrogation statements made in his apartment at the time of his arrest on february,before the arresting officers gave him his miranda warnings,and the gun and narcotics that were seized at that time as a result of the statements.the district court held a suppression hearing on august,and subsequently made the following findings of fact.
on february,a team of the connecticut fugitive task force executed an arrest warrant for dejesus at an apartment in bridgeport,connecticut.the warrant had been issued in connection with two probation violations,and the team was aware of dejesus criminal record,which included two assault convictions.dejesus was already lying on the floor when sergeant juan gonzalez,one of the arresting officers,first saw him.as gonzalez was standing over and attempting to handcuff him,dejesus said,in substance,she got nothing to do with this and i have a gun or i got a gun in my pocket,gesturing with his face toward a jacket on a chair.having handcuffed dejesus,gonzalez found a gun and a quantity of heroin in the jacket pocket.
at the conclusion of the suppression hearing,the district court denied dejesus motion,finding that the evidence had been seized pursuant to a valid search incident to a lawful arrest.the district court did not,however,address dejesus claim that the statements indicating the location of the gun should be suppressed pursuant to miranda,instead treating the motion as having raised only a fourth amendment claim.
on appeal,the government concedes that dejesus statement to gonzales was made in response to questions posed by another officer without miranda warnings.the government adopts the testimony of special agent randy jarvis at the suppression hearing that another officer asked dejesus,without having given miranda warnings,whether there were any weapons in the apartment.
ii.the impeachment rulings 
at trial,the government called a number of cooperating witnesses.when defense counsel first proposed impeaching cooperator jose lugo with a burglary conviction,the district court judge explained his general approach,stating that,for a conviction that goes to credibility,conviction for fraud,that type of thing,then you can bring out the nature of the conviction.if it simply a felony conviction,the fact of the conviction is i think what you bring out.the district court reasoned that t he fact that it was burglary does seem to have any independent relevance,and therefore limited cross examination on lugo burglary conviction to the fact of an unnamed felony conviction.considering witness ismael padilla larceny convictions,the district court judge indicated that whether larceny is crimen falsi depends on the underlying facts and permitted extended in camera questioning of the witness about his larceny convictions.at the conclusion of this examination,the district court judge stated that he had not heard an argument for the probative value here unless it is a crime of falsity or deceit that goes to untruthfulness.the district court judge then indicated that,for crimes not bearing directly on veracity,it the fact and presumably the date,if you want to get it in,that goes to credibility,and the credibility of the witness is not further attacked if it,you know,crime a versus crime he explained that he was not aware of any judge in this district that lets in the nature of the conviction rather than simply the fact and the date.
the court then demonstrated the kind of questions defense counsel could pose in june,you were convicted of a felony,right and in october,you were convicted of another felony.the district court judge reiterated that his approach was consistent with practice in this district.the district court applied the same analysis to cooperator william rodriguez felony drug convictions and his murder conviction,finding none of these convictions to bear on truthfulness.finally,following extended in camera questioning of witness joseph butler,the district court found that butler robbery,escape,and manslaughter convictions did not go to the question of truthfulness or veracity and limited impeachment for each offense to the fact of an unnamed felony conviction and its date.
discussion 
public safety exception 
the district court denied dejesus motion to suppress statements and physical evidence,challenged as the product of an illegal custodial interrogation,on the sole ground that the physical evidence was seized pursuant to a valid search incident to a lawful arrest.the district court thus treated dejesus motion as stating only a fourth amendment claim and did not consider the fifth amendment argument raised by dejesus that the physical evidence was the product of a custodial interrogation not preceded by miranda warnings.however,we may affirm the denial of the suppression motion on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,including grounds upon which the district court did not rely.united states tropiano,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.to the extent that the government addresses dejesus miranda claim on appeal,it does not dispute that the officers questioned dejesus within the meaning of miranda before informing him of his rights,but argues that dejesus statements were admissible under the public safety exception to the miranda rule.where the public safety exception applies,a defendant the physical evidence recovered as a result of that be admitted into evidence at trial.see new york quarles,d.
although statements made by a suspect in custody in response to police interrogation are typically inadmissible unless preceded by miranda warnings,see miranda arizona,d,the supreme court has recognized a public safety exception to that rule.quarles,at.in quarles,a woman informed the police that she had been raped at gunpoint and that the man,whose appearance she described,had just entered a nearby supermarket.id.at.the police located a man in the supermarket that fit the description and discovered that he was wearing an empty shoulder holster.id.at.after handcuffing him but before advising him of his miranda rights,the police asked the man where the gun was.id.the man responded the gun is over there,and the police recovered a loaded caliber revolver from an otherwise empty carton in the area to which the defendant had pointed.id.the supreme court reversed the state court suppression of both the statement and the firearm,holding that there is a public safety exception to the requirement that miranda warnings be given before a suspect answers to police questions may be admitted into evidence.id.at.the court cited the danger posed by a gun hidden in a supermarket an accomplice might make use of it or a member of the public might come upon it.id.at.the court characterized its holding as a narrow exception to the miranda rule,indicating that police officers can and will distinguish almost instinctively between questions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.id.at.we have had relatively few opportunities to address the public safety exception.see united states newton,cir united states reyes,cir united states khalil,cir.
in khalil,the appellant raised a limited question for our consideration.in that case,an informant told police that his roommate had bombs in their apartment and planned to detonate them soon in a subway or bus terminal.at.during a raid on the apartment,police officers grappled with two occupants,one of whom crawled toward a black bag the officers believed might contain a bomb.id.the officers shot and wounded both men,who were then handcuffed and taken to a hospital.after discovering pipe bombs in the bag and observing that a switch on one of the bombs had been flipped,raising a concern that the bombs would detonate before they could be disarmed,officers questioned one of the men at the hospital about the bombs without giving him miranda warnings.while the officers first four questions were prompted by the concern that the bombs would explode and elicited information about how they could be disarmed,the final question was not of this nature.id.the district court ruled that the public safety exception covered all five of the questions and answers.id.at.on appeal,the defendant challenged only the district court failure to suppress his response to the last he had intended to kill himself in detonating the that this question was unrelated to public safety.id.we reasoned that whether he would survive his attempt to detonate the bomb had the potential for shedding light on the bomb stability,concluding,in any event,that the admission of the defendant response at trial was harmless error at worst.id.
reyes more closely resembles the instant case.reyes was arrested following a narcotics sale to a confidential informant and an undercover officer.at.before the arresting officer handcuffed reyes or gave him miranda warnings,he asked reyes if he had anything on him that could hurt the officer or anyone on the field team.id.alterations in original.after reyes indicated that he had a gun in his pocket,and the officer removed it,the officer again asked whether reyes had anything in his pocket that could hurt the officer.id.at.reyes then stated that he had drugs in his car.id.before trial,the district court denied reyes motion to suppress the physical evidence while granting his motion to suppress the statements.id.we reversed the district court suppression of the statements,holding that the public safety exception applied.id.at.we reasoned that because reyes was a known drug dealer and weapons are tools of the drug trade,the officers had specific information that reyes routinely carried a firearm,and the arrest took place in the afternoon across the street from a school,there was a graphic tableau of danger to both the officers and the public,and the arresting officer had an objectively reasonable belief that reyes had a weapon on his person.id.at.satisfied that the officer questions were sufficiently limited in scope such that they were not designed to elicit incriminating evidence,id.at,we nonetheless acknowledged the risk that the public safety exception might be distorted into a per se rule as to questioning people in custody on narcotics charges,id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,and emphasized that it could not become a matter of course to precede every miranda warning with the questions that were put to reyes.id.we reiterated that the purpose of the public safety exception is to allow officers to follow their legitimate instincts when confronting situations presenting a danger to the public safety,id.quoting quarles,at,noting that t here has to be some flexibility in situations where the safety of the public and the officers are at risk.id.
we considered the public safety exception to the miranda rule most recently in newton.there,police officers received a report that a parolee had threatened to kill his mother and his mother husband,in whose apartment he was staying,and that he kept a gun in a shoe box by the door.at.arriving at the apartment,the officers roused newton and handcuffed him without advising him of his miranda rights,explaining that he was being restrained for his own safety and the safety of the officers.id.one of the officers then asked whether newton had any contraband in the apartment,and newton replied only what is in the box a caliber automatic firearm.id.at.we held that the question fell within the public safety exception and that newton statement was thus properly admitted at trial,reasoning that because the officers knew that newton possessed a gun and had recently threatened to kill his mother and her husband,they had an objectively reasonable belief that he was dangerous.id.at.although newton was in handcuffs when the officer posed the question,we considered the presence of others in the apartment and the hostility of what was a volatile domestic dispute in concluding,even with newton restrained,that the unlocated gun posed a deadly risk to everyone on the premises.id.finally,we found that while the officer question about contraband could include items not presenting immediate safety concerns,the question plainly encompassed weapons,and the defendant response indicated that he understood it along those lines.id.at.as a result,we concluded that the question breadth did not defeat application of the miranda public safety exception.
our cases addressing the public safety exception distill to three principles.first,we have observed that miranda warnings need not precede questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety or for the safety of the arresting officers,reyes,at quoting quarles,at,so long as the questioning relate s to an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from any immediate danger.newton,at quoting quarles,at.alteration in original emphasis added.while the facts in quarles raised the specter of danger to the public,the public safety exception clearly encompasses questions necessary to secure the safety of police officers.quarles,at.see also united states lackey,cir it is irrelevant that the principal danger in this case was the risk of injury to the officers rather than ordinary members of the public.second,the exception is limited by the fact that questions,while framed spontaneously in dangerous situations,newton,at,may not be investigatory in nature or designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect.quarles,at.as we acknowledged in newton,however,a question need not be posed as narrowly as possible,because p recision crafting can not be expected in the circumstances of a tense and dangerous arrest.at.thus,a question that plainly encompasses safety concerns,but is broad enough to elicit other information,does not necessarily prevent application of the public safety exception when safety is at issue and context makes clear that the question primarily involves safety.see id.at.third,we expressly have not condoned the questioning of suspects as a routine matter.rather,recognizing the need for flexibility in situations where the safety of the public and the officers are at risk,reyes,at,we have described the public safety exception as a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of the circumstances in a given case.id.at quoting united states banks,d.
here,the arresting officers knew that dejesus had convictions for a misdemeanor and a felony assault the officers also knew dejesus to be a drug dealer,testifying at the suppression hearing that h e was well known in the narcotics field and noting in their affidavit in support of an arrest warrant that he was a target of an investigation into a major narcotic trafficking operation.a confidential informant had told the officers that dejesus kept his drugs at the apartment where he was arrested.the arresting officers also knew that a woman received mail at the address,and a woman was present in the apartment at the time of the arrest.
in light of these facts,the arresting officers had an objectively reasonable need to protect themselves from immediate danger.the officers had ample reason to fear for their safety.first,considering dejesus assault convictions,the officers had reason to believe that dejesus was capable of violence.second,the informant statement that dejesus kept drugs in the apartment gave rise to a reasonable belief that he also kept a gun there.we have often recognized that firearms are tools of the drug trade that are commonly kept on the premises of major narcotics dealers.see,reyes,at.finally,the fact that another person was present in the apartment at the time of dejesus arrest contributed to and compounded the threat the officers faced,making their concern for their safety objectively reasonable.
we are also persuaded that the officer questions whether there were any guns in the apartment were narrow in scope,directly targeting the safety concern,and were not posed to elicit incriminating evidence.rather,given that the apartment had not been secured at the time of the questioning,the questions were aimed at controlling a potentially dangerous situation and relieving an immediate threat to the officers safety.there is no suggestion or facts in this case to indicate that the questions were a subterfuge for collecting evidence and were thus investigatory.that the questions elicited a response that led to the discovery of drugs in dejesus jacket pocket with the gun does not render the public safety exception inapplicable.the focused questions posed little risk of eliciting,incriminating answers and,in fact,did not elicit any such answers.that dejesus had drugs in his jacket with the gun was mere happenstance.moreover,the physical evidence discovered following dejesus response to the questions likely would have been produced in any event by a search of the jacket,which the officers used to cloak dejesus while transporting him to the police department.
on the facts presented here,the officer questions were prompted by an objectively reasonable need to protect the arresting officers from danger,and the discovery of the narcotics was merely incidental to recovering the gun.we therefore hold that the quarles public safety exception applies to the facts presented here and that,as a result,dejesus statements,the gun,and the drugs were properly admitted as evidence at trial.united states edwards,cir applying public safety exception where police officer asked a suspected drug dealer whether he was armed because drug dealers are known to arm themselves and the officers had an objectively reasonable need to protect themselves.we reiterate,however,that the exception must not be distorted into a per se rule as to questioning people in custody on narcotics charges,reyes,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,and emphasize that the exception will apply only where there are sufficient indicia supporting an objectively reasonable need to protect the police or the public from immediate harm.
ii.scope of impeachment under.
dejesus claims that the district court decision to limit the scope of impeachment of the government witnesses,as a matter of policy,to the fact and date of their felony convictions without permitting inquiry into the statutory names of their offenses of conviction violated the confrontation clause and.dejesus also claims that the district court erred by characterizing ismael padilla larceny convictions as subject to rule a rather than as crimen falsi automatically admissible under rule a.we reject appellant contention that the district court misapplied rule a as to padilla larceny convictions.we agree with appellant,however,that the district court misapplied rule a although we do not believe that the district court ruling violated the confrontation limiting impeachment to the mere fact of an unnamed felony conviction,but we find the error in this case to be harmless.
application of rule a 
we first address dejesus claim that padilla larceny convictions constitute crimes of dishonesty that are automatically admissible for impeachment purposes under rule a,which provides that evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement,regardless of the punishment.a.with respect to convictions for larceny,we have held that we will look beyond the elements of the offense to determine whether the conviction rested upon facts establishing dishonesty or false statement.united states payton,cir.in payton,this court found that the witness larceny conviction qualified as a rule a crime,involving dishonesty and false statement,because she had unlawfully received food stamps after falsely stating in a sworn application that she qualified for welfare.id.in the instant case,by contrast,defense counsel established outside of the presence of the jury that padilla had several larceny convictions for shoplifting and that he had taken elusive action to avoid detection.the district court did not err,having looked beyond the elements of the offense to the underlying facts,in determining that the circumstances of padilla larceny convictions did not involve falsity or deceit such as to fall within the ambit of rule a.see united states hayes,cir noting that crimes of force,such as armed robbery or assault,or crimes of stealth,such as burglary or petit larceny,do not come within rule a internal citations omitted united states sellers,cir c rimes such as theft,robbery,or shoplifting do not involve dishonesty or false statement within the meaning of rule a.while much successful crime involves some quantum of stealth,all such conduct does not,as a result,constitute crime of dishonesty or false statement for purposes of rule a.see hayes,at stating that congress limited the crimes covered by rule a because of the rule inflexibility and noting that a conviction that involved nothing more than stealth could not be introduced automatically under rule a united states brackeen,cir en banc distinguishing between the broad meaning of dishonesty as a lack of integrity or principles and its narrow meaning under rule a as a disposition to deceive.the district court thus did not abuse its discretion in treating padilla larceny convictions as rule a crimes rather than as crimen falsi automatically admissible under rule a.
scope of under rule a and the confrontation clause 
the district court misapplied rule a by limiting the scope of impeachment of the government witnesses,as a matter of policy,to the fact and date of their felony convictions without permitting inquiry into the statutory names of the witnesses offenses of conviction.the court,however,did not violate the confrontation clause by restricting in this manner.
this court begins its de novo review of whether rule a requires district courts to admit evidence of the statutory names of a witness offenses of conviction by looking at the language and structure of the rule.united states,cir reviewing district court interpretation of.de novo.the rule states that evidence that a witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted,subject to rule.a emphasis added.the question raised by the district court interpretation of the rule is thus whether the evidence of a prior felony conviction referenced in the rule necessarily includes the statutory name of the offense and any other information,or whether the mere fact of conviction of an unnamed felony,the sentence imposed,and the date of conviction suffice.
both rule a and a contemplate admitting evidence of a witness convictions for impeachment purposes the language of both provisions is identical with respect to the generalized description of the evidence of a witness convictions that is to be admitted.the presumption under rule a as recognized by the district that the essential facts of a witness convictions,including the statutory name of each offense,the date of conviction,and the sentence imposed,are included within the evidence that is to be admitted for impeachment purposes.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence at ed.we see no reason why the presumption should be different under rule a.the only difference between the two provisions is that evidence of convictions for crimes involving dishonesty or false statement,whether felonies or misdemeanors,must be admitted under rule a as being per se probative of credibility,while district courts,under rule a,may admit evidence of a witness felony convictions that do not constitute crimen falsi,subject to balancing pursuant to rule see.advisory committee note the admission of prior convictions involving dishonesty and false statement is not within the discretion of the court.such convictions are peculiarly probative of credibility and,under this rule,are always to be admitted.we see nothing in this distinction between the two provisions that would justify the conclusion that the evidence of a witness convictions contemplated by rule a is automatically more circumscribed than the evidence that is automatically admissible under rule a.
the overwhelming weight of authority supports this conclusion and suggests that,while it may be proper to limit,under rule a,evidence of the underlying facts or details of a crime of which a witness was convicted,inquiry into the essential facts of the conviction,including the nature or statutory name of each offense,its date,and the sentence imposed is presumptively required by the rule,subject to balancing under rule.see united states howell,cir finding that evidence of the number and nature of felony offenses is ordinarily required under rule a because a witness convictions bear to differing degrees on credibility depending on these characteristics united states burston,cir holding that the probative value of prior felony convictions varies with their nature and number campbell greer,cir concluding in a civil case that the crime must be named because the jury can not evaluate a witness credibility if all it is told is that the witness was convicted of a felony charles alan wright victor james gold,federal practice and procedure evidence,at stating that the mere fact approach,under which only the fact of a felony conviction is admitted,is difficult to justify with the language and structure of rule weinstein berger at to stating that the impeaching party is usually limited to establishing the name of the offense,the date of conviction,and the sentence,and that it may be improper to limit impeachment to the mere fact of a prior conviction,without allowing the impeaching party to specify the nature and number of offenses involved christopher mueller laird kirkpatrick,evidence at ed discussing the relevance of the nature of a a felony to the jury assessment of a witness credibility.
this interpretation of rule is consistent with both the rule structure and the insight that different felonies,even those that do not constitute crimen falsi,bear on credibility to varying degrees.district courts must thus undertake an individualized balancing analysis under rule a before excluding evidence of the statutory name of a witness crime.applying a generalized heuristic is simply improper.in short,the balancing requirement incorporated into rule a presumes that some details of a witness felony convictions will be considered.see united states figueroa,cir finding that the version of rule a required district courts to assess probative value against prejudicial effect before admitting evidence of a defendant prior convictions for impeachment purposes.in conformity with rule,unless the risk of unfair prejudice,confusion,or delay substantially outweighs the probative value of a felony conviction,it is the jury function to assess the probative value of a witness specific conviction or convictions as part of its overall evaluation of the witness credibility.this approach is consistent with this court acknowledgment in united states ortiz,cir,in which we considered the admissibility of an accused prior convictions under the originally enacted rule,that many factors are relevant to a district court exercise of discretion under rule a,p rime among them being whether the crime,by its nature,is probative of a lack of veracity.id.at.rule a thus contemplates that district courts will admit evidence of the nature of a witness prior felony convictions,including the statutory name of the offense,the date of conviction,and the sentence imposed,subject to rule.
district courts,in applying rule a,are thus required to examine which of a witness crimes have elements relevant to veracity and honesty and which do not.rule a presumes that all felonies are at least somewhat probative of a witness propensity to testify truthfully.see united states lipscomb,en banc concluding that congress believed that all felonies have some probative value on the issue of credibility.district courts under rule a are to consider the relative probative worth of a witness specific offenses of conviction,however,in light of the factors listed under rule,when determining whether to admit evidence of those convictions for impeachment purposes.see howell,at noting that a fter conducting the rule balancing,the court may determine that evidence of the conviction,or certain aspects of evidence of the conviction,are properly excluded.
when performing the rule analysis under rule a,district courts are admonished to consider that rule a crimes,which do not bear directly on honesty such as to be automatically admissible under rule a,may nonetheless be highly probative of credibility.see hayes,at if a conviction may not be automatically admitted under the second prong,it may still be admitted in the court discretion if it meets the criteria of the first.we believe that felonies not involving dishonesty or false statement such as to fall within the scope of rule a nonetheless bear on credibility to varying degrees.see weinstein berger b at although rule a addresses convictions for crimes that do not involve dishonesty or false statement,some felonies are more related to veracity than are others.we agree,therefore,with those of our sister circuits that have reasoned that all rule a felonies are not equally probative of credibility but that many are significantly probative of a witness propensity for truthfulness.see howell,at burston,at campbell,at.
an influential case from the court of appeals for the district of columbia that the federal rules distinguished between crimes that reflect adversely on a person integrity,and which therefore bear on as those involving deceit,fraud,and acts of violence,which may result from a short temper,a combative nature,extreme provocation,or other causes,and generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty and veracity.gordon united states.the gordon court thus stated a rule of thumb to be that convictions which rest on dishonest conduct relate to credibility whereas those of violent or assaultive crimes generally do not.see also wright gold at c rimes of impulse or carelessness have little probative value since they say little about the propensity to engage in calculated like perjury.weinstein berger b at and noting that crimes of violence generally have limited probative value concerning the witness credibility and that theft crimes have greater impeachment value.we find the distinction enunciated in gordon to have substantial analytic value.while many felonies exemplifying untruthful behavior fall within the ambit of rule a,many crimes that do not fit that provision are nonetheless quite probative of veracity.
this distinction between crimes falling outside rule a but nonetheless ranking high on the scale of probative worth on credibility,including,for example,theft and escape crimes,and those ranking low on that scale,including crimes of violence,appears in cases from numerous jurisdictions.see hayes,at discussing crimes that rank relatively high on the scale of crimes,although not so high as to fall clearly within the second prong of rule a internal citation omitted mueller kirkpatrick at.similarly high on the scale are crimes that involve evasions of responsibility or abuse of trust,a category that includes smuggling or failure to register or report when required,and at least sometimes drug importation and even sexual abuse of children in the witness care.mueller kirkpatrick at.many drug crimes and crimes involving public morality,such as prostitution,may be less probative of veracity.id.we hasten to add,however,that crimes requiring planning or preparation bear more strongly on veracity than violence alone suggests because planning indicates deliberate and injurious violation of basic standards rather than impulse or anger,and usually it involves some element of deceiving the victim.id.at see also wright gold at v iolent crimes involving premeditation are relatively higher in probative value because they suggest the witness is willing to break the law when it furthers his interests.we also note that the gravity of an offense may bear on truthfulness,to the extent that more serious offenses indicate a stronger willingness to ignore the law.mueller kirkpatrick at.but see wright gold at noting that for particularly depraved and offensive acts,such as wanton violence or sexual immorality,the jury is likely to draw the prejudicial inference that the witness is a bad person while at the same time the jury may derive little probative value from the conviction since these crimes say little about credibility while acknowledging that particularly heinous crimes may be high in probative value insofar as they reflect a rejection of social mores.
in light of the foregoing,we agree with the observation,about an earlier iteration of rule,that i t is implausible that congress believed that crimes falling on one side of the rule a line are so probative of credibility that they should be admitted regardless of prejudice but that crimes falling just on the other side of the line may in some cases not be probative at all.lipscomb,at.we find equally persuasive the point that m ore likely,congress anticipated that crimes of stealth,smuggling,burglary,while not quite crimes of dishonesty or false statement,do reflect lack of credibility and should be admitted unless significantly prejudicial.id.we thus find the gradations among rule a crimes,in terms of their bearing on truthfulness,to lie at the heart of the rule analysis that district courts must undertake when determining whether to admit for impeachment purposes evidence of a witness convictions,including their statutory names,under rule a.
we also emphasize that district courts should consider,when undertaking the balancing analysis under rule a,whether the witness is testifying for the defendant or the government.as originally enacted in,rule a provided for weighing the prejudicial effect against the probative value of a witness conviction only with respect to the defendant and thus required evidence of a witness prior felony convictions to be admitted for impeachment purposes if there was no harm to the defendant.advisory committee note the danger of prejudice to a witness other than the defendant such as injury to the witness reputation in his community was considered and rejected by the conference as an element to be weighed in determining admissibility.it was the judgment of the conference that the danger of prejudice to a nondefendant witness is outweighed by the need for the trier of fact to have as much relevant evidence on the issue of credibility as possible.the amendments changed the rule,reflect ing the view that it is desirable to protect all litigants from the unfair use of prior convictions,and that the ordinary balancing test of rule is appropriate for assessing the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment of any witness other than a criminal defendant.advisory committee note.
the amendments thus rejected the view that rule a gives no protection for government witnesses,and the advisory committee stated that 
t here are cases in which impeachment of government witnesses with prior convictions that have little,if anything,to do with credibility may result in unfair prejudice to the government interest in a fair trial and unnecessary embarrassment to a witness.
advisory committee note.the advisory committee noted,however,that t he probability that prior convictions of an ordinary government witness will be unduly prejudicial is low in most criminal cases.since the behavior of the witness is not the issue in dispute in most cases,there is little chance that the trier of fact will misuse the convictions offered as impeachment evidence as propensity evidence.id.the committee went on to note that 
trial courts will be skeptical when the government objects to impeachment of its witnesses with prior convictions.only when the government is able to point to a real danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes will the conviction be excluded.
wright gold at w here conviction evidence is offered against a witness other than the accused,the balance usually should be struck in favor of admissibility w here an accused offers conviction evidence to impeach a prosecution witness,courts weighing probative value against prejudice usually should err on the side of admitting the evidence.thus,
although the proponent of the admission of evidence of a prior conviction is the accused who seeks to impeach the government witnesses,the government bears the burden of protecting its witnesses from such impeachment by demonstrating to the court,pursuant to rule exclusionary rule,that the probative value of the conviction at issue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,or the other grounds for exclusion noted in rule.
united states tse,cir.
the advisory committee notes make clear that while the prior convictions of a government witness are unlikely to inflame the jury or invite a propensity inference,they may cause unfair prejudice to the government interest in a fair trial or unnecessary embarrassment to the witness.while these are important concerns,the notes emphasize that impeachment evidence relating to a government witness should be excluded under rule a only when there is a real danger that such prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of a witness felony convictions as they relate to his or her propensity for truthfulness.we add one caveat,noting that the impeachment of cooperating witnesses with crimes committed in furtherance of the same conspiracy with which a defendant is charged may result in prejudice to the defendant and,under all circumstances,that prejudice must be carefully considered in the rule balance.
here,by following a policy that presumptively excluded the statutory names of the cooperating witnesses rule a convictions,the district court essentially applied a per se rule that all felony convictions not determined to be crimen falsi for purposes of rule a are equally probative of credibility.by permitting to go before the jury only evidence of an aseptic,unnamed felony conviction for rule a crimes of which government witnesses had been convicted,the district court acknowledged the generic probative value of felony convictions.by interpreting the rule to require nothing more,however,the district court failed to undertake the balancing prescribed by the rule,which requires assessment of the probative value of a particular conviction on a witness propensity for truthfulness in light of the risk of prejudice,confusion,and delay.rather,the district court the balancing prescribed by the rule,determining first whether a crime fell under rule a or a and,if the former,foreclosing the typical rule analysis by admitting evidence only of an unnamed felony.
equally important,the district court approach implicitly determined that it would not exclude evidence of prior felony convictions under rule a.while the district court indicated that the fact of a witness felony convictions was admissible under rule a unless there is a balancing problem,it obviated the need for such balancing by scrubbing the convictions of any factors that would be relevant to a rule analysis.the rule requires district courts to admit the name of a conviction,its date,and the sentence imposed unless the district court determines that the probative value of that evidence
