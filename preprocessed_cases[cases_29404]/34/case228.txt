vincent chaney appeals the denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized from him in the raid of a motel room in which chaney was a guest.placed on the floor and handcuffed in the wake of his host arrest on drug charges,chaney consented to a search of his pants pocket to locate identification the search turned up seven small bags of crack cocaine.a dozen rounds of caliber ammunition were later discovered in the pocket of his jacket.
after unsuccessfully moving to suppress this evidence,chaney entered a conditional guilty plea to charges of simple possession of cocaine and possession of a firearm after a prior felony conviction.on appeal,chaney argues that the police exceeded the scope of his consent by removing cocaine,rather than identification,from his pocket that his consent was the product of a coercive atmosphere and hence not voluntary and that all evidence seized was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest.finding no reversible error in the district court rulings,we affirm.
the events giving rise to this appeal took place in the course of a police raid on a manchester,new hampshire motel room in late.in reciting the facts,we draw on the district court oral findings of fact at chaney suppression hearings as well as testimony taken at those hearings.
on november,state and federal law enforcement officials in possession of a federal arrest warrant for a man named peter boyd,suspected of distributing crack cocaine,went to the queen city inn in manchester,new hampshire.past experience flagged the motel as a likely choice for local drug dealers looking for temporary lodging.shown a picture of boyd,a clerk at the queen city inn confirmed to an investigating united states marshal that a man of boyd appearance was staying in a room at the motel.the marshal summoned four additional federal and local law enforcement officers to the motel to aid in executing the warrant.
the motel room in which boyd was staying was registered in the name of brigit hebert,a woman familiar to the authorities as the subject of several past arrest warrants.unbeknownst to the officers,also present in hebert motel room was vincent chaney.according to his testimony at the suppression hearings,chaney had come the previous night from virginia,hoping to visit two of his daughters who were living with their mother in manchester.arriving too late to visit with his daughters,chaney went to a bar and happened upon boyd,an old acquaintance.boyd offered to put chaney up for the night in the room he was sharing with hebert at the queen city inn.boyd,hebert,and chaney were thus all present in hebert motel room when the officers arrived early in the afternoon of the next day to execute boyd arrest warrant.
two local detectives were dispatched to cover the rear door to hebert motel room while three marshals approached from the front,knocking on the door and announcing their presence.the door opened to reveal boyd,wearing pajama pants but shirtless and without shoes.boyd was taken into custody,and the marshals entered the room with their weapons drawn to perform a protective sweep.they found the room darkened and clothing scattered across the floor,with hebert lying in bed and chaney,whom the officers did not recognize,standing next to it.the marshals told hebert to get out of bed and put her hands up,which she did.chaney was less compliant,edging toward the corner of the bed despite repeated commands to stop moving and lie on the ground.after six or more warnings,chaney acquiesced and was handcuffed on the floor.the marshals completed their sweep of the main room,the space underneath the bed,and the bathroom,finding in plain view two bags of what appeared to be marijuana sitting on a windowsill,three crack pipes on the windowsill and on a chair,and a number of rounds of caliber ammunition located in a clear bag in the closet 
as the protective sweep was being conducted,the marshals opened the rear door of the motel to admit the local detectives.detective brian newcomb approached chaney,patted him down for weapons,and then attempted to learn his identity.chaney was not immediately forthright,telling detective newcomb only that his name was vincent and providing him with several false dates of birth.after the local dispatch reported that it was unable to find a match for the dates of birth in their database,newcomb asked chaney if he had any identification.chaney indicated that he did,and that it could be found in his back pocket.detective newcomb asked for and was granted consent to retrieve the identification from chaney back pocket,but the pocket turned out to be empty.asked if the identification might be located elsewhere,chaney suggested that it might be in his left front pocket.chaney again consented to have newcomb search his pocket for the identification.
detective newcomb placed his hand in chaney left front pocket and removed first a plastic bag that held seven individual plastic bags,each of which contained a chunky substance he then reentered chaney pocket and removed a social security card newcomb believed the substance in the bags to be crack cocaine,having seen the substance in his prior law enforcement experience some fifty to one hundred times a field test later confirmed his suspicions.newcomb informed chaney that he was under arrest for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.after learning from dispatch that the social security card found in chaney pocket,which bore the name vincent earold chaney,belonged to a boy newcomb again asked chaney for his date of birth.chaney provided the correct date this time,and a search of police records confirmed his identity and revealed an outstanding warrant for his arrest in massachusetts for a probation violation.
as detective newcomb was escorting chaney to a police car outside the motel,chaney asked newcomb to retrieve a backpack and jacket chaney had left in the room.newcomb retrieved a backpack and jacket matching the description provided by chaney.after chaney confirmed that they belonged to him,newcomb searched both items,locating in the jacket pocket a plastic bag containing twelve rounds of caliber ammunition.
chaney was eventually indicted in the district court on two counts arising out of the incident one count of simple possession of cocaine base,in violation of a,and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm after a prior felony conviction,in violation of and a chaney moved to suppress all of the evidence seized in the course of his detention and arrest.
the district court held two evidentiary hearings to evaluate possible grounds for suppression.the first,held by judge diclerico on september,addressed chaney argument that the search of hebert motel room was unlawful due to the absence of a valid search warrant.after testimony from chaney and three of the police officers who conducted the search and arrest,judge diclerico ruled that chaney lacked standing to challenge the search of the motel room.the judge also found that chaney had consented to a search of his pockets,and that the search of chaney jacket before turning it over to him had been reasonable in light of officer safety concerns.
a second hearing was held before judge barbadoro on september,after brief supplemental testimony from two of the officers,chaney counsel presented arguments that the search of chaney pockets occurred during an unlawful de facto arrest and that chaney consent to the search was invalid because it was the product of coercion.judge barbadoro rejected the arguments,ruling that chaney detention was not a de facto arrest,being limited in duration and reasonable in scope,and that chaney consent was voluntary.at the close of the hearing,the judge confirmed that all of the issues concerning chaney detention and consent were preserved for appeal 
it preserved for purposes of appeal that the entry was illegal.it preserved for purposes of appeal that the scope of the detention after the entry was improper,and it preserved for purposes of appeal that any consent given was not valid and does not justify and make lawful the seizure that followed.i think you presented every possible suppression argument that can be presented.
chaney subsequently entered into a conditional plea agreement by which he reserved his right to appeal the district court suppression rulings.subject to that agreement,chaney pled guilty to one count of simple possession and one count of possession of a firearm after a felony conviction.judgment was entered against chaney in april,and this timely appeal followed.
in evaluating the district court denial of chaney suppression motion,we review the court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.united states larios,cir.chaney raises three challenges to the district court ruling.first,he argues that the removal from his pocket of plastic bags containing cocaine exceeded the scope of his consent,which,he asserts,was limited to a search of his pocket to locate identification.second,he argues that,even if he consented to a general search of his pants pocket,the consent was involuntary because of an unduly coercive atmosphere.third,he argues that the consent was the fruit of an unlawful,de facto arrest,and thus any evidence found in the course of the search must be excluded.we address each of chaney contentions in turn.
scope of consent 
it is a fundamental principle of fourth amendment law that a warrantless search may be conducted with the voluntary consent of a person authorized to give such consent.see united states stierhoff,cir citing schneckloth bustamonte.a warrantless search may not,however,exceed the scope of the consent granted.united states marshall,cir.the scope of the search is generally defined by the expressed object of the search,which is measured by a test of objective reasonableness what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and subject id.at quoting florida jimeno.
the united states raises a threshold objection to our consideration of chaney argument,contending that the issue is forfeited due to chaney failure to squarely raise it in the suppression hearings there may be some force to the government argument,as the argument chaney presses on appeal does not appear to have been made below.see united states torres,cir forfeiture applies not only when a defendant has failed altogether to make a suppression motion but also when,having made one,he has neglected to include the particular ground that he later seeks to argue.on the other hand,chaney raised generally the issue of the adequacy of his consent before the district court,and the court assured him that it was preserved for purposes of appeal that any consent given does not justify and make lawful the seizure that followed.because we may readily dispose of chaney argument on the merits,we sidestep the government claim of forfeiture and address the issue.see stierhoff,at.
according to testimony from detective newcomb,who performed the search of chaney pocket,chaney stated that the detective could go through his left front pocket and find chaney identification.chaney argues that the expressed object of this search was retrieval of identification,and thus the removal of the plastic bags from his pocket fell outside of the scope of his consent.we disagree.
the tight confines of a pants pocket leave a searching hand little room for maneuvering and distinguishing between various objects that may be contained therein.given consent to retrieve an object from such a cramped space,it is objectively reasonable to assume that the consent extends to the removal of items that either may constitute the object of the search and can not be immediately identified or that obstruct further access to other items in the pocket.nothing in chaney exchange with detective newcomb suggests that he intended to withhold consent for these sorts of practical measures that are reasonable incidents to the search of a pocket.chaney argument appears to be that,absent explicit permission to remove items other than evidence of identification,the detective was required to fish around in the pocket until he located an item that he could positively identify to be some form of identification and that could be removed without dislodging other items.the typical reasonable person would not so interpret chaney exchange with the officer 
because it was objectively reasonable for detective newcomb to believe that the scope of consent extended to the removal of plastic bags from chaney pocket in the course of searching for identification,we find no unconstitutional excursion beyond the boundaries of chaney consent.see jimeno,at the fourth amendment is satisfied when,under the circumstances,it is objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that the scope of the suspect consent permitted the challenged search.
voluntariness of consent 
chaney next raises a more fundamental challenge to the consent search of his pocket,arguing that the coercive atmosphere of the police raid rendered his consent involuntary.whether a suspect consent to a warrantless search was truly voluntary or,instead,the product of coercion is a question of fact to be determined from an examination of the totality of circumstances.marshall,f d at.among the factors we will consider in making that determination are the suspect age,education,experience,knowledge of the right to withhold consent,and evidence of coercive tactics.id.upon close review of the record,we can find no clear error in the district court finding that chaney freely and voluntarily consented to the search of his pants pocket.
chaney draws on a number of factors in trying to paint a picture of coercion.first,chaney highlights the officers show of force in entering the motel room with guns drawn.setting aside the fact that his consent was given after all occupants of the room were handcuffed and the excitement of the initial entry had passed,neither the number of officers who entered the room five nor the readiness of their weapons suggests an overwhelming show of force.see united states jones,cir finding the fact that ten to fifteen officers entered hotel room with guns drawn insufficient to void voluntariness of consent.chaney notes as well that the occupants of the room were asleep when law enforcement arrived at the motel room.the evidence is mixed as to whether chaney,who was standing and fully clothed when the officers entered the room,was actually awakened by the officers arrival.regardless,the mere fact of having been recently asleep does not necessarily affect one capacity to voluntarily grant consent.although chaney cites the officers failure to advise him of his right to refuse consent to the search,a factor that is certainly relevant to voluntariness of consent,w e have repeatedly held that the failure to advise a defendant of his right to refuse consent does not automatically render such consent invalid.id.
importantly,this was not chaney first encounter with law enforcement.he had been arrested on more than a dozen prior occasions and convicted of a comparable number of criminal offenses.it is reasonable to infer that a veteran of the criminal justice system will be less likely than most to be intimidated by the agents show of force.united states barnett,cir quoting united states cepulonis,cir.moreover,chaney conduct during the police raid betrayed no evidence of intimidation to the contrary,he ignored repeated commands from the police to stop moving when they first entered the motel room.
in short,on this record,we can discern no clear error in the district court finding that chaney voluntarily consented to the search of his pocket 
de facto arrest 
chaney alternatively contends that the evidence seized from him was the fruit of an unlawful de facto arrest while the period of detention leading to the discovery of crack cocaine in chaney pocket certainly bore some typical indicia of an arrest,we concur with the district court conclusion that the circumstances did not rise to the level of a de facto arrest.
any detention of an individual by a police officer constitutes a seizure and,to be lawful,must be adequately justified under the fourth amendment.morelli webster,cir.the contours of the showing necessary to satisfy the fourth amendment depend on the nature of the detention arrests,whether fo
