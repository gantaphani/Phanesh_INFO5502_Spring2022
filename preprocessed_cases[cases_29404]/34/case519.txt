a jury convicted gary brown of possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute.on appeal,the defendant challenges his conviction on two grounds,one relating to the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress and the other relating to the exclusion of certain evidence at trial.he also challenges his mandatory minimum life sentence,raising an apparent issue of first impression as to whether,for purposes of b,attempt offenses are considered felony drug offenses and,therefore,may count as predicate offenses on which to base a recidivist sentencing enhancement.discerning no error in the district court handling of these various matters,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
we rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this appeal in perspective.
on july,kevin cashman,a lewiston police officer assigned to the maine drug enforcement agency mdea,received a tip about an imminent narcotics transaction.although cashman confidential informant the ci had been cooperating with the mdea for less than a week,he already had provided cashman with trustworthy information about sellers,transporters,and users of drugs in the portland area.
the substance of the tip was as follows.the ci told cashman that a black male known as pink traveled weekly by bus from new york city to maine to peddle between ten and twenty ounces of crack and powdered cocaine.he further stated that pink usual praxis was to stay in a hotel off the maine turnpike.the room that he used would be rented under the name of tanguay david or peter.the ci explained that david tanguay was currently incarcerated and that his brother,peter,sometimes used david identification.other than skin color,the ci provided no physical description of the putative drug peddler.
the ci subsequently advised cashman that pink had arrived in portland and was staying in a hotel near the maine turnpike.cashman and another officer proceeded to the ramada inn,off former exit of the maine turnpike,and learned that room had been rented in the name of david tanguay.comparison of the signatures on the registration form and the identification used in renting the room revealed marked discrepancies.
cashman called a police dispatcher and corroborated david tanguay current status as a federal prison inmate.the officers then obtained access to a room diagonally across from room and conducted a.while they observed a black man go in and out of room,limitations on their surveillance capabilities rendered them unable to identify the man.
three weeks later,the ci told cashman that pink was en route to portland on board a vermont transit bus from new york city.he said that the wayfarer would arrive that afternoon and would be picked up at the bus station by peter tanguay.tanguay would be driving an old green truck,plate number,belonging to the ci.the ci assured cashman that pink would be transporting his wonted wares.he explained that he was privy to this information because he had spoken with peter tanguay when the latter asked to borrow his truck.
in response to this lead,cashman called in a fellow officer,who searched both the ci and his truck to ensure the absence of any preexisting contraband.the ci drove away and the officers tailed the truck.they saw peter tanguay enter it.after the truck made several stops,tanguay drove away alone.the officers continued to follow the truck until it reached the bus terminal.
at,the officers saw a vermont transit bus arrive from new york city.they watched a black man alight carrying two large duffel bags.the man walked to the truck,placed the duffel bags in the cab,and climbed aboard.
by prearrangement,two portland police cruisers converged on the truck a short distance from the bus terminal.officer robert bickford directed the passenger to disembark,frisked him,and asked for his name and date of birth.the passenger identified himself as anthony green,gave a date of birth,and claimed to be from boston.he appeared older than the proffered date of birth suggested.moreover,he professed to have no identification and,when asked how to spell his name,he hesitated.
bickford tried unsuccessfully to verify the passenger stated identity using the computer in his cruiser.he eventually asked the man for his social security number,but green said that he did not remember it.when cashman showed up,he inquired as to the ownership of the duffel bags.tanguay claimed ownership and green,in an apparent effort to substantiate that claim,stated that the bags had been in the truck when he arrived.the surveilling officers knew that statement to be untrue.
the officers whom the magistrate judge credited asserted that throughout this exchange green was constantly looking around,as if looking for a way to escape.when asked a second time for identification,he tried to peer into bickford notebook,as if trying to recollect the name that he had given.
a canine unit arrived at the scene around thirty minutes after the stop was effected.a trained drug dog reacted to a scent emanating from the cab of the truck and,later,alerted to one of the duffel bags.the bag was found to contain grams of crack cocaine as well as numerous small bags of marijuana.a search of the truck glove compartment revealed additional cocaine.both the driver peter tanguay and the passenger were arrested.police subsequently identified the passenger as gary brown.
on august,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging the defendant with possessing grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base on july,with intent to distribute,in violation of a.early in the case,the defendant moved to suppress all the evidence acquired at the scene of the roadside stop.the district court referred that motion to a magistrate judge.
after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge found the stop,the ensuing searches,and the defendant arrest justified.see united states brown,crim,wl,at.in his view,the information provided by the ci possessed sufficient indicia of reliability to support stopping the truck,id.at the defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of either the truck or the duffel bags,id.at and the police had probable cause to effect a warrantless arrest,id.at.
the defendant objected to the magistrate judge factual findings and legal conclusions.the district court nonetheless adopted the report and recommendation and denied the motion to suppress.united states brown,crim,wl.
following a trial,a jury found the defendant guilty.the court sentenced him to life in prison as a career offender.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the defendant assigns error to the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress,the exclusion of certain evidence at trial,and the sentence imposed.we consider these assigned errors sequentially.
motion to suppress.
when reviewing a district court disposition of a motion to suppress,we accept the court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous and subject its conclusions of law including its ultimate conclusions as to constitutionality to de novo review.ornelas united states,d united states coplin,cir.here,the suppression motion challenged the constitutionality of both the initial traffic stop and the subsequent arrest.consequently,we address those two components separately.
the stop.the fourth amendment protects persons from unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.the protection against unreasonable seizures extends to investigatory stops,including vehicle stops.see delaware prouse,d united states chhien,cir.passengers in a motor vehicle subjected to a traffic stop are deemed seized for fourth amendment purposes and,thus,are entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the stop.see brendlin california,d.
in terry ohio,d,the supreme court established the baseline test for determining the constitutionality of such detentions.police officers may lawfully effect an investigatory stop as long as they can point to specific and articulable facts which,taken together with rational inferences from those facts,reasonably warrant such an intrusion.id.at.see united states romain,cir.
while the reasonable suspicion standard requires more than a visceral hunch about the presence of illegal activity,it requires less than probable cause.chhien,at.by the same token,reasonable suspicion can flourish in the absence of a direct evidentiary link between the suspect and the suspected crime.see united states cortez,d.in practice,then,the constitutional validity of a stop must be evaluated through a consideration of all the attendant circumstances.see florida royer,d chhien,at.in this process,the circumstances underlying the stop must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars,but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.cortez,at.
here,the defendant contends that the police lacked a reasonable and articulable basis for the roadside stop because they relied exclusively on a tip provided by an unproven informant.courts have paid close attention to the use of informants tips.even though such tips comprise an important weapon in the armamentarium of law enforcement,see,illinois gates,d,their use entails a risk that police action may be predicated on malicious or unfounded reports.thus,if informant information is to provide reasonable suspicion sufficient to ground an investigatory stop,it must possess adequate indicia of reliability.alabama white,d.
the reliability the reasonable suspicion inquiry be made in light of the totality of the circumstances.gates,at.while an informant veracity,reliability,and basis of knowledge are all highly relevant in determining the value of an informant report,these elements should not be understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.id.
in this instance,the ci was not a model sported a criminal record and unresolved state criminal charges were looming.the defendant asserts that the police knew little or nothing more about the ci.he adds that,although no money had been offered or explicit promises made,the ci obviously expected a good reference from the officers to the local district attorney as a quid pro quo for the tip.
this assertion understates what the police knew and when they knew it.for one thing,the ci was not anonymous since he was known to the police,he could have been held accountable if his information proved inaccurate or false.adams williams,d suggesting that informant reliability was buttressed by the fact that he risked prosecution should he make a false report.for another thing,at the time of the tip that prompted the arrest,the ci had been cooperating with the authorities for approximately one month.during that period,cashman had several interactions with him.moreover,even prior to july,the ci had provided trustworthy information and had demonstrated his knowledge of the drug trade in the portland area.thus,by july the ci had compiled some record of reliability.
to be sure,factors like an informant prior criminal record and desire to advantage himself with respect to pending criminal charges are to be considered in evaluating his reliability.but such considerations are not dispositive.the fact of the matter is that those who possess information about the inner workings of the drug trade are unlikely to be persons of impeccable moral integrity.while the source general credibility must be considered,all that the law requires is that,when all the pertinent considerations are weighed,the information reasonably appears to be reliable.see gates,at.
there is no point in beating a dead horse.in this case,the character,quality,and subsequent corroboration of the tip made it sufficiently reliable to provide a specific and articulable predicate for the investigatory stop.terry,at.
central to this conclusion is the fact that the ci provided a plethora of details about the alleged drug trafficker modus a tip that describes the criminal activity in detail is more likely to be reliable.see spinelli united states,d united states barnard,cir the credibility of an informant is enhanced to the extent he has provided information that indicates knowledge.
to illustrate,the ci specified the type and quantity of the drugs in transit,the transporter method of travel,what bus line he would patronize,and the name of one of his confederates peter tanguay.he also specified the date,time,and place of the suspect arrival in portland,the identity of the person who would meet him there,the exact vehicle that would be deployed,and the suspect intended destination.in short,the tip was sufficiently laden with details to demonstrate that the ci had inside knowledge of the events that he was describing.
the defendant attack on this panoply of facts is impuissant.as framed,that attack places undue emphasis on the ci inability to provide a detailed physical description of the alleged drug trafficker.although vague or ubiquitous descriptions may raise fourth amendment concerns,see,united states hudson,cir,everything depends on context.
in this instance,we believe that the ci description,viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances,was constitutionally sufficient to justify reasonable suspicion.even though he did not recount the precise physical characteristics of the alleged drug trafficker,he specified the suspect datum that the police regularly use to facilitate identification,see wayne lafave,search and seizure,a treatise on the fourth amendment g,at ed and he supplied pertinent details about the suspect whereabouts,associates,activities,and destination.as a result,the police were not simply looking for a black man they were looking for a black man getting off the afternoon bus from new york city on july,at the vermont transit bus terminal in portland,carrying illegal drugs,and being met by peter tanguay in the ci green truck.we find that description constitutionally sufficient.
the defendant asseveration that the police failed adequately to corroborate the tip is equally unavailing.the record,fairly read,suggests the opposite.in terms of corroboration,the authorities need not totally eliminate the risk that an informant is providing erroneous information.that would be an unrealistically heavy burden,and the law does not impose it the police need only act with due diligence to reduce the risk of a mendacious or misguided informant.see united states winchenbach,cir.
in the case at hand,the police adequately discharged this duty through direct surveillance and.see united states jordan,cir.although they were frustrated in their efforts to make a positive identification in consequence of the july tip,they were able to corroborate that certain events had taken place exactly as the ci had predicted,that a hotel room had been rented in the name of david tanguay and that david tanguay was incarcerated at the time.with respect to the july tip,the police corroborated virtually every aspect of the account given by the ci.no more was exigible.
to continue along this line would be to paint the lily.the district court,after an evidentiary hearing,determined that the tip constituted reliable information justifying an investigatory stop.on this record,that determination was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.
the arrest.having verified the constitutionality of the investigatory stop,we turn to the constitutionality of the ensuing arrest.
it is common ground that a warrantless arrest must be based on probable cause.see,united states watson,d united states figueroa,cir.if a warrantless arrest is effected without probable cause for an arrest,evidence obtained as a result of the arrest is normally inadmissible against the arrestee.see,brown illinois,d wong sun united states,d.probable cause for an arrest exists when the arresting officer,acting upon apparently trustworthy information,reasonably concludes that a crime has been or is about to be committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one of the perpetrators.acosta ames dep t stores,cir see beck ohio,d.
the defendant endeavors to ground his challenge to the existence of probable cause on the ci unreliability.that endeavor is hopeless we already have upheld the lower court reliability determination and its corollary determination that the tip created reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the roadside stop.see supra part ii a.the defendant conc
