after a lengthy trial,a north carolina jury convicted rae lamar wiggins,rae carruth carruth of conspiracy to commit the murder of his pregnant girlfriend,cherica adams,use of an instrument to destroy their unborn child,and discharge of a firearm into occupied property.carruth failed to obtain reversal on appeal,see state wiggins,disc.denied,cert.denied,or any relief in state court.he then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus.carruth maintains that the state trial court decision to admit evidence of certain statements made by adams before she died mandates habeas relief.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of the writ.
we first set forth the facts as recounted by the north carolina court of appeals,wiggins,then briefly summarize the procedural history of the case.
on the evening of november,carruth and years old and pregnant with carruth to a movie together at a theater in charlotte,north carolina.after the movie,the two rode together to carruth house to pick up adams car.at his house,carruth used his cell phone to call michael kennedy and told kennedy that he and adams were about to leave.carruth and adams then drove separate cars toward adams home.
the murder unfolded on rea road,a residential street.carruth led in his car,and adams followed in hers.kennedy,accompanied by passengers stanley abraham in the front seat and van brett watkins in the backseat,followed adams in a rental car.as the three cars drove down the street,carruth slowed or stopped his large sport utility vehicle in front of adams car,forcing her to slow or stop her car.kennedy then drove his rental car beside adams car,and watkins fired five shots into her car,wounding her once in the neck and three times in the back.carruth and kennedy vehicles fled the scene in different directions.
the shots did not kill adams immediately.rather,at a,she called from her cell phone and spoke to an emergency dispatcher for over twelve minutes until an ambulance arrived.during that call,adams told the dispatcher that she was eight months pregnant and had been shot while driving her car she had been following her baby daddy,rae carruth,on rea road carruth had called somebody from his house before they left carruth slowed his car down in front of her another car then pulled up beside adams car somebody from that other car shot her and after she was shot,carruth just left the scene of the shooting.
at around,mecklenburg police officer peter grant arrived on the scene.officer grant conducted an interview with adams in which she identified carruth as the driver of the vehicle that slowed in front of her.at,an ambulance delivered adams to the carolinas medical center.there,in an interview with officer grant,adams gave a chronology of the events,explaining that she and carruth went to the movies together and returned to carruth house to retrieve her car she followed carruth down rea road carruth came to a stop and she could go around carruth on the rea road.when officer grant asked adams if your boyfriend did this to you,she nodded her head y es.
at,doctors moved adams to a trauma intensive care unit.at,adams had an endotracheal tube inserted into her throat.traci willard,the attending nurse at the time,asked adams if she remembered what had transpired.adams nodded and motioned the nurse to bring her a pen and paper.in her own handwriting,adams again described that night events,including carruth actions.soon after communicating with nurse willard,adams went into a coma until she died a month later on december.her baby son survived but suffered brain damage.
on november,the state arrested carruth and charged him with offenses related to the shooting carruth posted bond and was released on bail on the condition that he remain in the city.when carruth learned of adams death on the afternoon of december,however,he fled.the state then issued a warrant for carruth arrest on murder charges.the fbi found carruth the next day in the trunk of a friend car in tennessee.
the state charged carruth with first degree murder of adams,conspiracy to commit that murder,discharging a firearm into occupied property,and using an instrument to destroy an unborn child.the state also charged kennedy,watkins,and abraham with crimes related to the murder of adams.carruth was tried alone before a jury.the trial continued over six weeks and consumed more than trial days.
in its case in chief,in addition to adams statements detailed above,the state offered numerous exhibits and the testimony of over twenty witnesses,including michael kennedy,to establish carruth orchestration of adams murder.through,the defense attempted to establish that adams was shot because of carruth coconspirators rage when he refused to finance a drug deal.the defense offered witnesses who testified that carruth had good character and a gentle nature,that he was looking forward to the birth of his and adams child,and that his bright career as a professional football player with the carolina panthers gave him the means to pay child support.in rebuttal,the state offered the testimony of two of carruth former girlfriends.both testified as to carruth anger when each of them became pregnant with carruth child,his unwillingness to pay child support,and his threats of violence to them.
after two and a half days of deliberations,the jury indicated in a note to the trial judge that it was divided on all charges and wished instruction.in model language,not challenged by carruth and less coercive than that approved in allen united states,the judge instructed the jury to deliberate further.after another day,it returned its carruth of first degree murder but finding him guilty of conspiracy to commit murder,discharge of a firearm into occupied property,and use of an instrument to destroy an unborn child.the court sentenced carruth to months imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction plus two consecutive terms of to months for the remaining two convictions.
on appeal,the north carolina court of appeals found error in the trial court decision to admit into evidence adams handwritten notes to nurse willard.wiggins,at.but,g iven the nature and extent of the state evidence implicating defendant involvement in the shooting,the state appellate court concluded that such error was harmless and upheld the conviction.id.at.the state supreme court denied discretionary review and the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari.see wiggins,cert.denied.
carruth filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in state court,claiming that the trial court admission of adams statements to officer grant in addition to those to nurse willard violated his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.the mar court agreed,finding that the trial court had erroneously admitted all three of these statements in violation of carruth constitutional rights under the confrontation clause.but the mar court held that such violations were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and so upheld the conviction.the north carolina court of appeals denied carruth request for review.
carruth then filed this habeas petition in federal court,reprising,among other claims,the confrontation clause challenge.the district court denied habeas relief but granted a certificate of appealability as to the confrontation clause claim.carruth asked us to expand the certificate of appealability to consider whether blakely washington,should be applied retroactively to his sentence we denied that motion.accordingly,the sole issue before us is whether the confrontation clause error requires the grant of habeas relief.
we initially recognize the extent and limit of the asserted constitutional error at issue here.on one hand,carruth does not contend before us that admission of the call both playing the recording and publishing the transcript violated his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.see davis washington.on the other hand,the state does not contend before us that admission of adams two statements to officer at the crime scene and one at the her handwritten notes to nurse willard did not violate carruth sixth amendment rights.see crawford washington.because it makes no difference to our resolution of this case,we assume without deciding that carruth and the state accurately assess the constitutionality of adams statements,i,that admission of her statements to officer grant and nurse willard amounted to constitutional error but admission of the call did not.
of course,as carruth correctly recognizes,such error does not automatically entitle a petitioner to a grant of a writ of habeas corpus.instead,a habeas court reviews such error for harmlessness.see gutierrez mcginnis,cir sotomayor,see also delaware van arsdall.the supreme court explained in brecht abrahamson that,in determining the harmlessness of a state court constitutional error in a criminal trial,a federal habeas court asks whether the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,quoting kotteakos united states.
courts have recently disagreed as to whether enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,changes that standard.some courts have concluded that aedpa requires a federal habeas court to apply both brecht and the deferential standard of review contained in aedpa to a state court harmless error determination others have held that the brecht standard alone governs habeas review.compare johnson acevedo,cir with ruelas wolfenbarger,cir.we have recently held that,in light of fry pliler,even,a federal habeas court need only apply the brecht standard to evaluate the harmlessness of constitutional error in a state trial.see bauberger haynes,at cir.
carruth vigorously contends that the crawford error in his case meets the brecht standard.indeed,he contends that the three improperly admitted statements which consumed less than a day of this lengthy trial,in which the jury properly considered adams call and evidence of numerous admissions by carruth constitute the centerpiece of the state case.appellant br.at.according to carruth,the state primary evidence included and flowed from the improperly admitted evidence.id.at.accordingly,carruth maintains that the state can not carry its burden of proving that the decision to admit the challenged statements did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.appellant br.at emphasis added see also id.at.
we note at the outset that carruth misstates the governing standard of review.the supreme court has deliberately refused to phrase the brecht standard in terms of burden of proof.mcaninch.instead,a court must ask,do we,the judge s,think that the error substantially influenced the jury decision id.if a court finds itself in grave doubt about whether a trial error is harmless,it must grant habeas relief.id.at.a grave doubt exists when in the judge mind,the matter is so evenly balanced that he or she feels in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness of the error.id.at.if a habeas court finds itself without any grave doubt as to the harmlessness of error,it must deny habeas relief.
applying the correct standard in assessing harmlessness in cases involving confrontation clause error,we consider a host of factors.van arsdall,at.these include the importance of the improperly admitted witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and,of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.id.
with these principles in mind,we turn to analysis of carruth contentions.in doing so,we consider the factors set forth in van arsdall to determine if the three statements erroneously admitted in violation of carruth confrontation clause individually and taken the grant of habeas relief.
as to the importance of the improperly admitted statements,carruth contends that they formed the focal point of the prosecution case.appellant br.at.in support of this contention,he maintains that the prosecution heavily relied on these statements in its opening and closing statements by describing adams role as an eyewitness to the crime and her testimony as a voice telling her message.id.at.this argument ignores the most critical evidence in this case,the extremely powerful and unchallenged account provided by adams in her actual voice.id.carruth himself now not only fails to dispute that the trial court properly admitted the call but also concedes that it had great visceral impact.id.at.
in the call,immediately after being shot,adams related 
adams police,i been shot.i been shot.
you been shot where are you at 
adams i passed calvary church on the 
calvary church 
adams ah,no 
you where talk,i 
adams on rea road 
medic okay.how did this happen 
adams i was following my baby daddy,rae carruth the football player.
medic so you think he did it 
adams he slowed down.and,a car pulled up beside me.
medic and then shot at you 
adams and before we left,he called somebody from his house.
medic where your husband at 
adams i do have one.
medic or your boyfriend the one that you said was with you.where he at 
adams he was in the car in front of me and he slowed down and somebody pulled up besides me and did this.
medic and then where he go 
adams he just left.
medic okay.all right.what his name 
adams rae carruth,he plays for the panthers.
medic okay.all right.you got an officer close.speaking to the medic did you hear what she said about that boyfriend 
repeating what adams told her i got his name was rae carroso sic.he in a white expedition.with a tag mary sam nora,something,something.
i hate to do this to you.but,when you last saw this ford,when you last saw this car,which way was it going what road 
adams straight down rea road.
thus,adams call offered the state an extremely powerful account of the crime by the victim herself.the state proceeded to make full use of this abundant testimonial resource.the prosecutor began his opening statement with a description of the call and a promise to the jury that it would hear adams herself hold on and use her cell phone to call and tell the operator about the attack on her.at trial,the prosecutor made good on this promise.at the very outset,before introduction of any of the improperly admitted statements,the state focused on the crucial call.the prosecutor properly authenticated the tape of the call through testimony from both the operator and the medic dispatcher.then,after the trial court admitted the tape into evidence,the prosecutor played the call to the jury in open court.finally,the prosecutor distributed a transcript of the call to the jurors.
the statements to officer grant and nurse willard were only admitted later,in less than a day,in this lengthy trial.they may have enhanced adams testimony,but the substantial focus on,and probative weight of,the call overwhelmed the importance of these statements.it was the call that turned adams into the important eyewitness that she was,a person who gave a voice to the night tragic events.
moreover,the record belies carruth contention that the improperly admitted evidence was not cumulative.standing alone,without these improperly admitted statements,the call established the critical elements of the state case against carruth before carruth and adams left his house,carruth called somebody adams followed carruth down rea road,with carruth driving his white ford expedition in front of her smaller car carruth slowed down a car pulled up beside adams car and somebody shot her and then after she was shot,carruth just left the scene.
additionally,the state called adams cousin and roommate to testify that she received a call from adams just prior to the shooting,at around.in the call to her cousin,adams said that she and carruth were on their way over to the apartment,would be there in minutes,and asked that the apartment be straighten ed up because adams had not expect ed him to come over.
furthermore,michael kennedy testified at length,without the benefit of a plea agreement,to all of the facts and much more set forth in the improperly admitted statements.according to kennedy,after he met carruth in january or february,he socialized with carruth and visited carruth home a lot of times.some hours before the shooting,carruth elicited his assistance in the plan to kill adams.carruth told kennedy that he had got adams pregnant,that she was trying to juice him for money,and that he was already paying like five thousand dollars in child support,and he did want to pay another in child support.carruth explained that he had previously paid van brett watkins to beat up adams so that she would lose the baby,but watkins had done it yet.according to kennedy,carruth was telling me that he was gon na take adams to the movies,and for me to stay in the area and await carruth phone call.upon receiving that call,kennedy was to follow adams car watkins was to do the rest.carruth then gave kennedy and told him to take watkins to get the gun.
kennedy testified that,at,carruth called to tell him that he and adams left the movies.at,kennedy received another call from carruth in which carruth told him we getting ready to leave the house.a short time later,after following adams who in turn was following carruth down rea road,kennedy testified that 
rae carruth went over a hill and then down in the dip.then,he stopped his car she stopped behind his i stopped behind her.then,watkins told me to pull up beside her car.so,i pulled up beside her car and he started shooting in her car.
all the while,according to kennedy,carruth remained in a stopped position.after the shooting,kennedy testified,carruth went straight on rea road,just as adams told the dispatcher.
adams father also offered evidence duplicating the improperly admitted evidence and corroborating kennedy testimony that carruth stopped his car to facilitate the shooting adams father testified that when he asked adams at the hospital whether carruth had a legitimate reason to stop,due to a stoplight or stop sign,adams shook her head no that no stoplight or stop sign caused carruth to stop.
in addition,a friend of carruth,candace smith,also presented testimony duplicative of the improperly admitted evidence.smith related that,in the early morning of november,at the hospital,just after adams had been shot,carruth told her that he wished that adams would die.when smith asked carruth if he was involved,carruth went into like a deep trance and,he would even look at me.according to smith,carruth said that he hit his brakes,in his car,to slow adams car down and witnessed the shooting.afterwards,carruth told smith,he just drove off and went to a friend home 
in sum,the improperly admitted statements,though of course supportive of the state case,constituted mere drops in the sea of evidence offered by the state to show carruth guilt and were cumulative of the call and other evidence.
next,we assess the extent and nature of corroborating or contradicting evidence as compared with the improperly admitted evidence.close examination of the record leaves us with the firm conclusion that the same evidence that makes the improperly admitted statements cumulative corroborates nothing in the record contradicts this corroborating evidence.
carruth asks us to disregard kennedy and smith testimony.we have reviewed the extensive of both witnesses,in which defense counsel effectively explored their biases,their histories,and the inconsistencies between their testimony and prior statements.for example,counsel focused on kennedy bias as a seeking favor from the state in exchange for his testimony and highlighted several inconsistencies in kennedy effort to place all the blame on carruth who assertedly forced kennedy to participate.similarly,defense counsel stressed kennedy access to all the trial testimony,providing him an opportunity to tailor his testimony to the theory that carruth designed the whole scheme.as for smith,defense counsel pointed to her potential bias and receipt of use immunity in exchange for her testimony,her delay in coming forward suggesting a fear of criminal liability for her involvement in the murder,and her failure to relate carruth asserted admissions at the hospital to the defense private investigator in a interview.
we have considered all of these efforts at impeachment and can find no basis for holding that the jury could not credit kennedy and smith testimony.indeed,we have found nothing in the record contradicting the critical portions of their testimony.moreover,other evidence corroborates their testimony to a significant extent.for example,the state offered,for corroboration purposes only,an audiotape replaying a police investigator early interview of kennedy.in that interview,kennedy explained,consistent with his testimony at trial,the plan as carruth originally conceived it.cell phone records additionally corroborate kennedy testimony.furthermore,kennedy testimony accorded with adams call.his testimony completes adams story by admitting that he drove the car that adams witnessed pull up beside hers,and that watkins pulled the trigger.it also confirms adams statement,reinforced by her father uncontested testimony,that carruth slowed his car unexpectedly,with no stop sign or stoplight in sight.
additionally,we examine the extent of or impeachment of the improperly admitted statements.carruth insists that the trial court admitted the three statements not only without,but also unimpeached.appellant br.at.again the record belies carruth claims.of course,because she had been murdered,defense counsel could not cross examine adams at trial.but the defense could elicit considerable testimony that the shock caused by the gun wounds,pharmacological sedatives,and volatility of memory formation associated with traumatic events rendered adams improperly admitted statements unreliable.
defense counsel questioned nurse willard as to adams mental capacity in the hospital.the nurse elaborated on adams precarious state,recalling her continuous treatment with versed and medication and painkiller,may have caused a synergistic effect on adams central nervous system.on doctor orders,the nurse eventually put adams to sleep with these narcotics,highlighting their potency.
later in the trial,the jury heard testimony from.adams treating physician in the the effects of these drugs.thomason explained that studies have not conclusively determined the retrograde amnesia effects of is,disruption of existing memories formed prior to taking the medication.thomason also acknowledged that these medications affect the awareness and wakefulness of a patient and increase the risks of suggestibility and confirmed that adams suffered from shock.the defense was thus able to argue that even though adams did not lapse into total unconsciousness,she was suffering from certain cognitive impairments that undermined her capacity to accurately recount the shooting.
defense counsel called loftus,a memory expert,to cast doubt on the improperly admitted statements.loftus identified specific indications that adams statements to officer grant and to nurse willard revealed a faulty recollection of the shooting.the doctor explained how the shock of the shooting caused adams to misreport a fact like the color of carruth expedition.the doctor also testified that an atmosphere of suggestion and suspicion may have contaminated the improperly admitted statements.
through these witnesses,the defense offered evidence challenging the improperly admitted statements.carruth counsel thus drew the jury attention to adams unstable condition at the time of those pregnant woman wounded by gun shots,sedated by medication,suffering from shock,and exposed to the atmosphere of suspicion emanating from the police and her family.accordingly,we do not find that the lack of forecloses a finding of harmlessness.
although not specifically mentioned in van arsdall as relevant,carruth argues that given the continual emphasis placed on the improperly admitted statements throughout carruth trial,the importance of those statements at trial,the substantial impeachment of the state other witnesses,and the strength of the defense,the course of jury deliberations and the compromise verdict demonstrate that the state can not carry its burden of proving that the admission of these statements did not substantially affect the verdict.appellant br.at.
this argument rests on two faulty premise
