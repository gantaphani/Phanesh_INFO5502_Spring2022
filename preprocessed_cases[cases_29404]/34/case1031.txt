background 
on a gelid night in february,residents along the block of sperling drive,a residential street in wilkinsburg,pennsylvania,were startled by the ringing sound of gun shots.one resident who rushed to see what had happened saw two people shooting into a ford bronco parked alongside the street.another observed a car darting away from the scene immediately after the shooting ceased.but neither was able to describe the shooters in detail.
once the commotion passed,one of the residents approached the ford bronco.inside she found the bodies of joel moore,timothy moore,and robert james.law enforcement was called,a crime scene was established,and an investigation immediately ensued.
the indictments that followed charged appellants with operating a violent criminal organization that existed for the purpose of,among other things,enriching its members by trafficking in cocaine and cocaine base in new york and pennsylvania.because the government sought the death penalty against bobby and michael for their roles in the triple homicide,they were tried separately from xavier on a superceding indictment that charged fifteen counts racketeering,in violation of c count one racketeering conspiracy,in violation of d count two conspiracy to murder in aid of racketeering activity,in violation of a counts three and four murder in aid of racketeering activity,in violation of,a counts five through seven conspiracy to distribute narcotics,in violation of count eight murder while engaged in a narcotics conspiracy,in violation of and e counts nine through eleven use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime or crime of violence,in violation of,j counts twelve through fourteen and conspiracy to launder money derived from narcotics trafficking,in violation of h count fifteen.the jury found bobby and michael guilty on all counts except counts three and four but determined that they should not receive the death penalty.bobby and michael were sentenced principally to life imprisonment.
xavier was tried on a superceding indictment charging fourteen counts that matched bobby and michael indictment through count thirteen,omitted one of the firearm counts,and charged the money laundering count as count fourteen instead of fifteen.upon the government motion,the district court dismissed counts five,six,seven,nine,ten,eleven,and twelve.the jury found xavier guilty on all remaining counts except count four.he was sentenced principally to life imprisonment.
the remaining facts and procedural history are provided as necessary for our analysis of the specific issues addressed in this opinion.
discussion 
admission of bobby statements 
prior to the trial of bobby and michael,the government requested permission to introduce,against both defendants,statements bobby made to carol johnson,earl baldwin,and julian brown about his involvement in the triple homicide.michael objected and moved for exclusion and,in the alternative,requested a severance pursuant to.after hearing from both sides,the district court denied the severance and allowed johnson and baldwin,but not brown,to testify about bobby statements,finding their testimony admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements against penal interest.see.b.the district court also found no confrontation clause impediment to the admission of johnson and baldwin testimony.
at trial,baldwin testified that bobby admitted to him on two separate occasions that he participated in the triple homicide.bobby first told baldwin that timothy moore was killed because the dude owed money.the second time,bobby,speaking about himself and michael,stated w e gave it to them niggers.w e walked up to the truck,each of us on a side of the truck and gave it to them niggers.johnson,echoing much of baldwin account,testified that bobby told her that the victims were shot because of their debts.she then explained that bobby told her that michael shot the man in the driver seat while bobby shot at least one of the other passengers.johnson testimony did not account for the shooting of the third victim.
in this challenge to the district court pretrial ruling,michael argues again that the admission of bobby statements violated both rule b and the confrontation clause.we review the district court admissibility determination under rule b for abuse of discretion and its confrontation clause analysis de novo.united states tropeano,cir.
admissibility under rule b 
admission of a statement under rule b hinges on whether the statement was sufficiently against the declarant penal interest that a reasonable person in the declarant position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.williamson united states,d quoting rule b.whether a challenged statement is sufficiently can only be answered by viewing it in context.id.at.thus,this determination must be made on a basis.see tropeano,at.
we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to admit the challenged statements under rule b.the first of bobby statements to baldwin was plainly selfinculpatory,and it did not on its face implicate michael.the second of bobby statements to baldwin and his statement to johnson were also sufficiently as they described acts that he and michael committed jointly.see united states saget,cir finding that the bulk of confessor statements were because they described acts that the defendant and the confessor committed jointly.moreover,the context of these statements shows that bobby was not attempting to minimize his own culpability,shift blame onto michael,or curry favor with authorities.williamson,at.to the contrary,in his second statement to baldwin,bobby was boastful regarding his participation in the murders,and in his remark to johnson he claimed an equal role,asserting that he and michael each killed one of the three victims.
confrontation clause analysis 
the confrontation clause states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.in crawford washington,d,the supreme court held that the confrontation clause prohibits the admission of testimonial statements against a criminal defendant,unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to the declarant.crawford per se bar on such testimonial statements displaced that much of the indicia of reliability standard of ohio roberts,d,that had allowed into evidence,as not violative of the confrontation clause,hearsay statements that fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or contained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.crawford,at.saget,at explaining that under roberts,a ny statement was constitutionally admissible so long as it fell within an exception to the hearsay rule or,if that exception was not firmly rooted,the court found that the statement was likely to be reliable.
while crawford per se bar did away with roberts reliability analysis for testimonial statements,it left unclear whether the admission of nontestimonial statements would still implicate confrontation clause concerns because crawford did not explicitly overrule roberts on that score.see saget,at crawford leaves the roberts approach untouched with respect to nontestimonial statements accordingly,while the continued viability of roberts with respect to nontestimonial statements is in doubt,we will assume for purposes of this opinion that its reliability analysis continues to apply to control nontestimonial hearsay.however,in davis washington,d,the court was required to decide whether the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsay.id.at emphasis added.answering that question in the affirmative,the court explained that crawford,even if it did not expressly so hold,pointed the way 
the text of the confrontation clause reflects this focus on testimonial hearsay.it applies to witnesses against the other words,those who bear testimony.testimony,in turn,is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.an accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.
id.a limitation so clearly reflected in the text of the constitutional provision,the court continued,must fairly be said to mark out not merely its core,but its perimeter.id.
following davis,we stated in united states feliz,cir,that roberts reliability analysis plays no role in a confrontation clause inquiry.see id.at.it is plain from davis that the right to confrontation only extends to testimonial statements,or,put differently,the confrontation clause simply has no application to nontestimonial statements.feliz,at see tom lininger,reconceptualizing confrontation after davis,whereas crawford called into question the reasoning of roberts,davis sounded the death knell.the davis court indicated plainly that the protections of the confrontation clause are limited to testimonial hearsay.
now,after crawford and davis,indicia of reliability play no role in the confrontation clause analysis.rather,the inquiry under the confrontation clause is whether the statement at issue is testimonial.if so,the confrontation clause requirements of unavailability and prior apply.if not,the confrontation clause poses no bar to the statement admission.
michael does not,nor could he,contend that bobby statements were testimonial they bear none of the hallmarks of testimonial statements identified in crawford.see at.identifying as testimonial ex parte testimony,extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions,and statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also saget,at identifying as testimonial under crawford a declarant knowing responses to structured questioning in an investigative environment or in a courtroom setting where the declarant would reasonably expect that his or her responses might be used in future judicial proceedings.instead,relying on roberts and its progeny,michael asserts that the statements lack particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.because the confrontation clause does not bar such nontestimonial statements,whatever their guarantees of trustworthiness,michael argument fails and our confrontation clause inquiry is at an end.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court neither abused its discretion in admitting bobby statements under rule b nor violated the confrontation clause in doing so.
ii.the government firearms identification expert 
spent bullets,cartridge casings,and bullet fragments were recovered from the scene of the triple homicide and the victims bodies.a subsequent search of michael apartment in pittsburgh,pennsylvania turned up two handguns,one of which was a bryco semiautomatic pistol.shortly thereafter,this and other ballistics evidence was turned over to michelle kuehner,a firearms examiner in the forensic laboratory division of the allegheny county coroner office the forensic lab.upon comparing the ballistics evidence recovered from the crime scene and the victims bodies with bullets and cartridge casings produced from a test firing of the bryco,kuehner concluded there was a match.
before trial,the government placed bobby and michael on notice that it intended to call kuehner as an expert witness.michael moved for a pretrial daubert hearing to challenge kuehner testimony contending that the government had yet to establish its admissibility under.
in an order dated december,the district court denied the motion without a hearing.it reasoned 
judge marrero of this court has recently upheld the use of ballistics as reliable under rule.see united states santiago,d.the supreme court has likewise cited ballistics as a proper subject of expert testimony because it aids the jury in understanding the evidence.see united states scheffer,d unlike expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the juror knowledge,such as the analysis of fingerprints,ballistics,or dna found at a crime scene,a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion,in addition to its own,about whether the witness was telling the truth see also united states foster,d,stating that,i n the years since daubert,numerous cases have confirmed the reliability of ballistics identification,and collecting cases united states,wl,at,the field of ballistics is a proper subject for expert testimony and meets the requirements of rule.defendants have not offered any reason for us to depart from the reasoning of these cases.accordingly,the request for a daubert hearing to challenge the government proposed ballistics evidence is denied.
williams,wl,at.
at trial,the government called kuehner as an expert.she testified first about her background.kuehner stated that she had served as a firearms examiner within the firearms section of the forensic lab for approximately twelve years.she testified that,in addition to the training she received from her section supervisor,robert levine,she attended seminars on firearms identification,including annual workshops put on by the association of firearm and toolmark examiners the afte where firearms examiners from the united states and the international community gather to present papers on current topics within the field.kuehner also explained that she and levine published a paper in the afte journal matching a bullet to the cartridge case from which it was discharged.kuehner further stated that she has given presentations on the subject of firearms analysis at several afte meetings and for duquesne university forensic science and law programs.in addition,kuehner testified that she had examined approximately different types of firearms and provided expert testimony on between and occasions.
after establishing her background,training,and experience,kuehner went on to testify that she uses a firearms identification methodology that is a subset of a broader forensic discipline referred to as toolmark identification.toolmark examiners are trained to examine the marks left by tools on a variety of surfaces in an attempt to match a toolmark to the particular tool that made it.firearms,she explained,are simply the tools that impart marks on bullets and cartridge cases 
kuehner then testified as to how the methodology enables her to determine whether a given sample of ballistics component was fired from the same gun.she starts by examining the components class characteristics.a spent bullet class characteristics include its caliber,the number of its land and groove impressions the twist of its land and groove impressions,and the width of its land and groove impressions.class characteristics,kuehner explained,allow her to narrow the universe of firearm possibilities to certain types of guns made by certain manufacturers.for example,a spent bullet exhibiting six land and groove impressions could only have been expelled from a firearm with a gun barrel that has six lands and grooves.
once kuehner narrows the firearms possibilities by class,she looks for specific random,microscopic imperfections in the barrel caused by changes in the manufacturing tool as it makes each barrel on the production line.these impe
