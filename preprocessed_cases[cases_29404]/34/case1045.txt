background 
the government evidence included extensive proof of the nature and structure of the gambino organized crime family,which had been headed by defendant peter gotti brother,john gotti,until the latter was convicted and imprisoned in part through the testimony of the former family underboss salvatore gravano,who cooperated with the government.at the trial of the appellants,members of the gambino family cooperated with the government and testified to the blood oath taken by all members to kill any member who violated the oath of loyalty.they testified that after the conviction of john gotti,the operations of the family were taken over by a ruling panel,which included the defendant peter gotti,who assumed the rank of acting boss.thomas carbonaro was a soldier in the family.the evidence,seen in the light most favorable to the government,see jackson virginia,d,showed the following.
i.the conspiracy to murder salvatore gravano 
when peter gotti visited john gotti in prison in september,john ranted against the treachery of gravano and urged peter to kill gravano,saying,that a bill that got ta be paid.peter gotti,then acting boss,charged family members carbonaro and eddie garafola to kill gravano.gravano,in the meantime,had moved to arizona,where he had assumed a new identity through the federal witness security program.his location,however,had been disclosed by a newspaper article.the evidence showed elaborate preparations made by carbonaro and others to kill gravano,including numerous trips to arizona,assumption of disguises,scouting of the locations where gravano was likely to be found,and extensive planning of the manner in which the killing would be carried out.the plan was foiled because gravano was arrested for drug dealing in february.according to carbonaro,peter gotti,who had financed the trip,complained that the plan to kill gravano had cost too much money and wanted the equipment they had purchased,including a handgun.
ii.the conspiracy to murder frank hydell 
in early,there were rumors in the family that frank hydell was cooperating with the government and providing information about matera and about carbonaro nephews.carbonaro told michael dileonardo,who was a captain in the family,that hydell was a rat and had to be killed.on april,matera lured hydell to a nightclub on staten island.in the early morning hours he was shot and killed as he stepped outside the nightclub.in early,several years following hydell murder,michael dileonardo heard that there might be an arrest related to the hydell murder.dileonardo warned carbonaro,who told him that he,carbonaro,was the driver on that hit and that matera brought hydell to the strip club to set him up.
iii.the construction industry extortion 
the gambino family,with peter gotti as acting boss,used its control of labor unions to extort the construction industry.dileonardo estimated that the gambino family made tens of millions of dollars extorting construction companies.in exchange for money,the construction companies were permitted to hire workers without trouble from unions.if the contractor or union official resisted,either he would be hurt or there would be a strike,or work on a construction job would be stopped.in addition to money,the construction companies also gave the gambino family cushy no work jobs.carbonaro nephew and peter gotti son received such jobs.in a conversation peter had in with his brother john in the marion prison,where john was serving his sentence,peter told john that peter son was a shop steward and,although he wished his son could stay in the job forever,the government,they got a big thing,a big investigation.carbonaro participated in the family extortion of the industry by accompanying eddie garafola,a gambino soldier,to collect payments from contractors and officials.
discussion 
evidentiary challengesa.prior uncharged crimes 
defendant gotti,joined by carbonaro,contends that the receipt of evidence of uncharged murders committed by members of the gambino family was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.we reject the contention.
prior to the trial of peter gotti and carbonaro,the government gave notice of intention to offer evidence of crimes not specifically alleged in the indictment.the government justified this evidence as proof of the existence of the gambino family as a criminal enterprise in which the defendants participated,which was an essential element of the various racketeering charges under the rico statutes.with the court approval,over the objections of the defendants,the government then introduced evidence of various crimes committed by gambino family members,including the participation of john gotti in the murders of louie milito,louie dibono,and robert dibernardo.the court gave protective instructions to the effect that the jury may not conclude that a defendant is guilty of participating in criminal conduct merely from the fact that he was associated with other people who were guilty of wrongdoing.
the defendants contend that the receipt of this evidence violated federal rules of evidence b and.rule b,sometimes described as the other crimes rule,provides evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.the district court correctly ruled that this evidence did not violate rule b.the evidence was not offered to show any character trait of any defendant or that a defendant acted in accordance with such a trait.it was offered to prove an essential element of the rico crimes existence of a criminal enterprise in which the defendants participated.the court conclusion that there was no violation of rule b was consistent with numerous prior rulings of this court in which criminal acts of,including killings,were received to prove the existence of the criminal rico enterprise in which the defendant participated.see united states miller,cir uncharged acts admissible to prove the existence of the rico enterprise alleged in the indictment united states thai,cir uncharged acts admissible as evidence of the existence and structure of the rico enterprise.
more pertinent is the defendants contention that the receipt of this evidence violated rule.rule bars the receipt of evidence which is unduly prejudicial in that its capacity for unfair prejudice outweighs its probative value.see.although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.under this rule,the mere fact that evidence is relevant to an issue in dispute does not ensure its admissibility,if its capacity for unfair prej
