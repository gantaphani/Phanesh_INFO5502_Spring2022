background 
the present prosecution grew out of an investigation by a joint terrorism task force jttf comprising agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi and detectives from the new york city police department nypd collectively the agents.medunjanin came to the attention of the task force after he traveled from his home in new york city with najibullah zazi and zarein ahmedzay to pakistan in august,intending to fight with the taliban against american forces in afghanistan,and instead was persuaded to receive training from and return to the united states to participate in coordinated suicide bombings in the new york city subway system.these events culminated in medunjanin arrest in january after he,fearing he was about to face charges that included conspiracy to commit murder,drove to the whitestone expressway in queens,new york,and deliberately caused a collision with another car,attempting to trigger an explosion that would kill himself and others.
after his arrest,medunj anin made certain incriminating statements to law enforcement officers.he moved to suppress those statements on the grounds that the questioning by the agents,who knew he had an attorney,violated his rights under the fifth and sixth amendments to the constitution.following a hearing at which the district court heard testimony from a dozen witnesses,including eight law enforcement officers and two members of medunj anin family but not medunjanin himself,the court denied the motion.the following description of the events is taken largely from the decision of the district court,which found the testimony of the government witnesses credible,convincing,and for the most part uncontroverted.few of the court factual findings are disputed.
a.the events in september 
on september,jttf agents,in pursuit of materials and plans for making improvised explosive devices,executed a search warrant for the queens,new york apartment where medunjanin lived with his parents and his sister.while the search was going on,medunjanin agreed to speak with fbi special agent farbod azad and nypd detective angel maysonet.to avoid the distraction of the search,the agents interviewed medunjanin on the street a short distance from his home.they told him the interview was entirely voluntary and that he was not under arrest.medunjanin could easily have left he instead stayed and talked,calmly,with azad and maysonet for about hours.
medunjanin spoke about islam,american israeli and american islamic relations,and the attacks on new york city.he said he had traveled to pakistan with zazi and ahmedzay seeking a wife but had found the requested dowry too high.medunjanin vouched for zazi character he said he and zazi were close friends and conversed about once a month.when the agents said they could check telephone records,medunjanin admitted that he and zazi spoke about times a month.
on september,medunjanin agreed to accompany the same agents to the united states attorney office in brooklyn to be interviewed again.he went voluntarily and was not restrained at any time.this interview lasted approximately hours,with breaks for medunjanin to eat,use the bathroom,and pray.he was again cooperative and spoke freely about religion,islam,his background,and how he had become more religious but he was evasive about his trip to pakistan with zazi and ahmedzay.medunjanin denied that he had engaged in any kind of weapons training there and again said he had gone to pakistan on a failed mission to get married.he signed a form for a dna swab,fingerprints,a voice exemplar,and shoe prints when the interview ended,he agreed to speak with the agents again.
on september,zazi was arrested.medunjanin thereafter met with attorney robert gottlieb,and on september,retained gottlieb to act as his attorney in connection with the jttf investigation.gottlieb notified agent azad and assistant united states attorney ausa jeffrey knox that gottlieb was representing medunjanin and asked that medunjanin not be interviewed unless gottlieb was present.the agents made no further attempts to question medunjanin in.medunjanin remained,however,under surveillance.
b.the arrest and questioning of medunjanin in january 
on january,between and,azad and maysonet executed a new search warrant at medunjanin home,this one for his united states and bosnian passports.medunjanin asked whether his attorney had been contacted azad said he had not but that medunjanin could contact the attorney if he wished.medunjanin did not do so while the agents were there.after the passports were produced,maysonet asked medunjanin whether he had signed his name as muhammad,which law enforcement agents had learned was medunjanin alias or kunya.medunjanin did not answer and was visibly shaken by the question.
as soon as the agents left,medunjanin did an internet search with respect to the criminal code sections cited in the search warrant upon seeing that one section referred to homicide,he tried to reach gottlieb.when gottlieb returned medunjanin call,he said,inter alia,that he would call azad.
gottlieb spoke to azad,who confirmed that medunjanin passports had been seized pursuant to the search warrant.azad referred gottlieb to ausa knox for further information about the investigation.gottlieb was unable to reach knox by telephone but left a message for him.knox did not return gottlieb telephone call until the next day.
in the meantime,medunjanin remained upset by maysonet use of his kunya and by the seriousness of the charges listed in the search warrant.between and,medunjanin left home and drove from his building onto the whitestone expressway,driving at some.he wove in and out of traffic,crossing several lanes,planning to cause an explosive collision.in order to make clear that this would not be viewed as an ordinary rush hour accident,medunjanin called,identified himself,and proclaimed we love death more than you love life hearing transcript tr.at see id.at and,as translated from arabic,there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messenger,repeating the latter several times.medunjanin then turned and sped directly into another car.
immediately after the crash,medunjanin attempted to run from the scene but was stopped and handcuffed by one of the agents who had followed him from his home.medunjanin was shaken and complained of elbow,shoulder,and neck pain,but was not seriously injured.when first asked how he was,his reaction was to ask whether the inquiring agent was jewish and then to lecture the agent calmly about problems with judaism as a religion.medunjanin was taken to a queens hospital,where he was examined by a triage nurse and physicians.ct scans of his head and neck were negative,and no medication was administered or prescribed.
while medunjanin was at the hospital,he was questioned by several agents.azad arrived first with nypd detectives michael carney and robert murphy,members of the jttf,and they confirmed with hospital staff that medunjanin was alert and had not been medicated.they removed medunjanin handcuffs azad introduced the detectives and they all shook hands with medunjanin.azad acknowledged that medunjanin had an attorney but said that,even so,the agents would like to speak with medunjanin if he was willing.they talked with him for about minutes before administering miranda warnings.medunj anin was told that it was up to him to decide whether or not to talk to the agents,that he could avoid such topics as he wished,and that he could stop at any time.murphy told medunj anin that murphy was a father,that he would want to know the truth if one of his children was being investigated by the fbi,and that,whatever the truth,he would love his child.medunj anin told the agents he wanted to fire his attorney because the attorney was expensive and was not accomplishing anything for him.medunjanin family had already paid gottlieb more than in fees.azad and murphy said they could not give medunjanin advice with respect to his attorney,though they agreed the attorney was expensive.
medunjanin read and signed a miranda waiver form,following which he was questioned by the agents for about hours.medunjanin admitted that he had traveled to pakistan with zazi and ahmedzay,intending to fight with the taliban in afghanistan against the united states.medunjanin told the agents that when maysonet had used his kunya,muhammad,medunjanin realized he would be arrested and imprisoned for the rest of his life,and he thus sought to perform a final act of jihad when he called,made his proclamation,and caused the crash,hoping to spark an explosion that would kill other people.
when medunjanin was discharged from the hospital,leaving at about,the agents took him to jttf offices in manhattan.after medunjanin and the agents had dinner,the questioning continued.medunjanin described his trip to pakistan with zazi,the failed attempt to enter afghanistan to fight alongside the taliban,and their subsequent religious and weapons training at an camp.medunjanin was calm and almost boastful as he described the types of weapons he had been trained to fire.he became defensive and evasive when the agents asked about any impending attacks in the united states and whether he knew of,or was involved in,terrorist activity but he was otherwise cooperative and forthcoming,appearing to be generally relieved and eager to talk.
at about on january,medunjanin was presented with a form that indicated he was being charged with receiving training from,in violation of the form also contained a section for waiver of miranda rights.medunjanin was told that if he agreed to continue the interview,he would remain in the jttf office overnight if he wanted to end the interview,he would be processed,spend the night at the detention center,and be arraigned later in the day.medunjanin agreed to continue talking with the agents and signed the form waiving his right to a speedy arraignment and,again,his miranda rights.he also signed a form for his cellular telephone.he was allowed to perform ablutions and pray.the agents departed,leaving medunjanin with guards.another agent provided medunjanin with bedding,but medunjanin told the agent he was not ready to sleep and wanted to keep talking.those two then talked for nearly an hour about,inter alia,religion and military service,comparing the agent service with medunjanin experiences in pakistan.the agent ended the discussion so that medunjanin could sleep.
in the meantime,throughout the evening of january,gottlieb and medunjanin family attempted unsuccessfully to determine his whereabouts.they tried the hospital and learned that medunjanin had been discharged into the custody of officers from the precinct.at the precinct,gottlieb identified himself to the desk officer as medunjanin lawyer and said he did not want medunjanin questioned.gottlieb was told that medunjanin was not there and was in the custody of the jttf.despite calls to various law enforcement offices,gottlieb and his staff were unable to learn where medunjanin was.
gottlieb telephoned ausa knox again on the morning of january.several hours later,knox returned the call and told him that medunjanin would be arraigned that afternoon knox also said that medunjanin no longer wanted gottlieb to represent him.knox refused to disclose medunjanin whereabouts.
on the morning of january,medunjanin was taken to the fbi office for processing.he read and signed a third miranda waiver form around,and was questioned thereafter by azad and carney for about two hours and by another fbi agent for another hour.that afternoon,the grand jury returned an indictment charging medunjanin in two counts receiving training from,in violation of a,and conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country,in violation of a.azad learned of the indictment shortly after it was returned,met with ausas in brooklyn and was given a new form to present to medunjanin,and returned to the manhattan fbi office where medunjanin was being questioned.medunjanin was presented with the new form,which listed the two charges and included the following statement i have been advised that attorney robert gottlieb has requested to speak with me the form provided spaces for medunjanin to indicate by check mark whether or not he wanted to speak to gottlieb.medunj anin read the form,said he disagreed with the murder conspiracy charge because he did not believe they were going to commit murder,and checked the line that said he wanted to speak to gottlieb.the agents then ceased their questioning.
knox,who had earlier called gottlieb to ask him to come to the arraignment in order to have the matter of medunjanin representation clarified,called gottlieb again to tell him that medunjanin would not be arraigned until the next morning.gottlieb met with medunjanin on january before his arraignment.
c.the denial of medunjanin motion to suppress 
the superseding indictment included the nine counts against medunjanin described above.prior to trial,medunjanin moved to suppress the incriminating statements he made to jttf agents on january and,on the grounds,inter alia,that the postarrest questioning by agents violated his rights under the fifth and sixth amendments.he argued that by calling gottlieb just after azad and maysonet had seized his passports and departed on january,he intended to,and did,invoke his fifth amendment right to counsel that gottlieb had informed the government that he did not want medunjanin questioned and that the agents postarrest questioning of medunjanin thus violated his fifth amendment rights as set out in miranda and edwards arizona,d.he also argued that he did not thereafter knowingly or voluntarily waive his miranda rights because he was influenced by the agents statements that gottlieb services were too expensive and by what he viewed as threats by the agents to arrest members of his family if he did not sign the waiver forms.and he argued that the government tried to prevent him from having contact with gottlieb by telling him that gottlieb was too expensive,by refusing to reveal his whereabouts to gottlieb,and by questioning him without informing him that gottlieb wanted to speak with him and thereby unreasonably interfered with his sixth amendment right to counsel and his fifth amendment right to substantive due process.
in a thorough memorandum of decision dated march,see united states medunjanin,cr,wl may,the district court denied the motion.the court ruled that medunj anin call to gottlieb on january,after the agents had seized his passports and departed,did not constitute an invocation of his miranda rights because medunjanin was not in custody.see id.at.moreover,it found that medunjanin question to azad at the time of that search as to whether his attorney had been contacted about the new search warrant was not a request for counsel and when azad responded that gottlieb had not been contacted but that medunjanin could contact him,medunjanin did not do so until after the agents had departed.see id.at.
further,the district court found that even after medunjanin was arrested,he did not seek to exercise his right to counsel or decline to speak with the agents until late on the afternoon of january,after he was indicted.the court found that medunjanin was repeatedly given miranda warnings and that he executed three written waivers of his rights.it concluded,in light of the totality of the circumstances,that medunjanin waivers were knowing and voluntary.see id.at.the court rejected medunjanin contention that his will was overborne by the agents references to his family and to the expense of attorneys fees.it noted that,despite medunjanin initial argument that medunjanin believed the agents were threatening to arrest members of his family,medunjanin had abandoned that contention,and his attorneys argued instead that medunjanin had been manipulated into believing he had an obligation to family to waive his rights.the court rejected the new argument as contrary to the testimony of the law enforcement agents who had been present it found no evidence that the agents conduct was coercive.see id.at.the court also found that it was medunjanin who initiated discussion about whether his attorney was expensive,as he complained about the fees and said he wanted to fire his attorney.see id.
the court found that medunjanin first request for counsel came after he learned that the indictment counts against him included a murder conspiracy charge only then did medunjanin indicate unambiguously that he wanted to see gottlieb.and when he did so,the agents questioning ceased.see id.at.
the district court rejected medunjanin contention that,because he was not informed of gottlieb attempt to reach him,his miranda waivers were not made knowingly and his right to counsel was unreasonably impeded.it found that medunjanin was able to confer with gottlieb prior to arraignment and that the agents conduct had no serious effect on medunjanin relationship with counsel.see id.at.
following the denial of his motion to suppress,medunjanin was tried,and his statements were admitted against him.he was convicted on the nine counts described above and was sentenced as indicated.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,medunjanin seeks a new trial solely on the basis that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the postarrest statements he made to law enforcement agents on january and.he argues principally that the district court a erred as a matter of law in ruling that he could not invoke his miranda rights prior to being in custody,and b clearly erred in finding that he did not in fact invoke those rights when the january search warrant was executed and that the court erred in ruling that his postarrest waivers of his miranda rights were knowing and voluntary.medunjanin also argues that his choice to deal with the government through his attorney was clear that the government questioning of him without his attorney being present violated his substantive due process rights under the fifth amendment and that the government interference with his relationship with counsel prior to his indictment ripened into a violation of his rights under the sixth amendment upon his indictment.
in reviewing the district court ruling on a motion to suppress,we review its conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see,united states oehne,cir.we are not allowed to the factfinder credibility assessments,and w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson bessemer city,d.finding no errors in the decision here,we reject medunjanin contentions and affirm the judgment of conviction.
a.the sixth amendment right to counsel 
the constitution provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.the sixth amendment right to counsel exists to protect the accused during confrontations with the prosecutor.united states gouveia,d.the supreme court ha s long recognized that the right to counsel attaches only at or after the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings against the defendant.id.at see,kirby illinois,d plurality opinion citing cases,beginning with powell alabama.gouveia,at the view that the right to counsel does not attach until the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings has been confirmed by this court in cases subsequent to kirby.citing cases mcneil wisconsin,d sixth amendment right to counsel does not attach until a prosecution is commenced.

miranda and its progeny 
the fifth amendment to the constitution provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.adopting procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the fifth amendment not to be compelled to incriminate himself,miranda,at,the miranda court ruled that 
after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way,p rior to any questioning,the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent,that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him,and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney,either retained or appointed,
