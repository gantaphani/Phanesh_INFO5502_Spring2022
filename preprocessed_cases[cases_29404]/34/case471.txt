a jury convicted nadine griffin of filing a false income tax return for in violation of.the district court initially sentenced griffin to months imprisonment and a year of supervised release.over a month later,the court resentenced griffin,reducing her term of incarceration to months.
before us are an appeal and a.in the appeal,griffin challenges her conviction.she argues that the court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of and in admitting certain evidence.in the,the government contends that the district court did not have the authority to resentence griffin because,under the terms of federal rule of criminal procedure a,the court either lacked jurisdiction or the initial sentence was not clear error.we affirm the conviction,vacate the sentence,and remand for the imposition of the initial sentence.
we rehearse the background facts here,reserving the discussion of other facts for our later examination of the appellate claims.we view these facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states turner,cir.
in each of griffin and tax returns she reported an annual income that did not exceed.neither of these returns reflected income griffin earned working as an salesperson for a company called global prosperity global.in that capacity,griffin made sales of over and netted a profit of about in.she made sales of nearly and netted a profit of about in.
global was a marketing company that sold a series of tapes as well as tickets to offshore seminars where lectures were given and additional products sold.the global products and lectures promoted various investment and tax avoidance strategies.as a salesperson for global,griffin sold these materials to customers.she eventually became one of global most successful salespeople and belonged to its top sales group.
griffin set up bank accounts in order to store her global proceeds and to manage her business with global and global customers.in addition to an offshore account,griffin opened two domestic accounts.these accounts were opened in the names of capital finance strategies cfs and angelica holdings ah.griffin,however,controlled the accounts and often drew money from them to finance personal expenditures.griffin filed forms with the irs when opening these accounts,indicating that both cfs and ah were foreign entities.
at some point,griffin told another salesperson at global that she did not plan to pay taxes on her income from global.consistent with this statement,griffin did not report her global income when meeting with the individuals who prepared her and tax returns.she did,however,report income she received for her work as a salesperson for two other marketing companies.these companies,unlike global,had sent form to both the irs and griffin that reflected griffin gross sales 
despite filing returns in and that reflected a relatively modest income,when griffin applied for a mortgage and car loan she reported a significantly higher income.her mortgage application reflected an annual income of and her car loan application an annual income of.
ultimately,griffin financial situation drew the government attention.in july,she was indicted and charged with two counts of filing a false tax return in violation of.the jury convicted her of one count,but did not reach a unanimous verdict on the other.the court initially sentenced griffin to months imprisonment and a year of supervised release.over a month later,however,it resentenced griffin to months imprisonment with the same period of supervised release.
ii.discussion 
griffin presents two arguments on appeal.her first,and primary argument,is that the court erroneously instructed the jury regarding the elements of.her second is that the court erred in admitting certain evidence.we consider both arguments in turn 
jury instructions 
provides,in part,that any person who 
w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter shall be guilty of a felony.
we have established that this offense has four elements 
that the defendant made or caused to be made,a federal income tax return for the year in question which he verified to be true that the tax return was false as to a material matter that the defendant signed the return willfully and knowing it was false and that the return contained a written declaration that it was made under the penalty of perjury.
united states boulerice,cir.
at the close of the defendant case,the district court instructed the jury on these four elements.of relevance are the court instructions regarding the second and third elements,materiality and willfulness.the court instructed 
material means that it makes a difference.it makes a difference as to the actual tax liability,the amount owed willful means an intentional violation of a known duty t he language i want you to use here is,willful means an intentional violation of a known duty.no one can be convicted of filing a false tax return because they made a mistake or because they were careless or because they had a genuine,but mistaken,belief in the requirements of the tax code.
at the government request,the court supplemented its instruction on the willfulness element with a willful blindness instruction.this instruction stated 
she can not,however,be what we call willfully blind to the duty to know.what do we mean by that we mean she can not willfully,that is intentionally,blind herself to what a reasonable person would understand was the very strong probability that taxes were owed on the proceeds.
griffin argues that the court instructions were erroneous for three reasons the court failed to instruct the jury accurately on both materiality and willfulness and the court instruction did not specify that the government had to prove griffin made false statements with the intent of inducing reliance.
because griffin failed to object to the court jury instructions at trial,our standard of review is plain error.accordingly,griffin must show an error that was plain,obvious and clear under current law,prejudicial,affected the outcome of the district court proceedings,and that seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.sears roebuck de,cir.this standard is exceedingly difficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases.united states,cir.we review jury instructions as a whole determining if they adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on controlling issues.id.
materiality 
griffin argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that a statement is material if it could have influenced the irs,not as it did,that m aterial means that it makes a difference to the actual tax liability,the amount owed.
the court instruction on materiality was not plainly erroneous.we have said that a material matter is one that affects or influences the irs in carrying out the functions committed to it by law or one that is likely to affect the calculation of tax due and payable.boulerice,at citing united states dirico,cir.if anything,the court instruction that a false statement is material if it makes a difference as to the amount owed was more narrow than necessary and increased the government burden of proof.a false statement may be material even if it was only likely to influence the calculation of tax due and payable.id 
willfulness 
griffin lodges four complaints against the district court instruction on this element.first,she contends that the trial court made various statements throughout the trial that tainted the instruction on willfulness.she cites two statements in particular.one was the court statement that,
what the government must prove here is that the things she did either knowing that they violated,actually knowing in her own mind,or willfully,which means with reckless disregard,willful blindness,uncaring whether she was following the law or not.
the other was the court statement that,the government does not have to prove that a person knew they were violating a specific law.second,griffin argues that the court failed to inform the jury that,in order to convict her,the jury must conclude that she knew the statements on her tax returns were false when she filed them.third,she asserts that the court should not have delivered the supplementary willful blindness instruction specifically,she argues that the government did not present evidence meriting such an instruction.fourth,she argues that,even if the willful blindness instruction was merited,the instruction itself was erroneous.
in analyzing griffin claim that the court statements during trial corrupted the willfulness instruction,we start with the definition of willfully.willfully,for purposes of this statute,means a voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty.boulerice,at quoting united states monteiro,cir quoting united states pomponio,d.the court instructed the jury that,w illful means an intentional violation of a known duty.the court instruction repeated the accepted definition of willfulness virtually verbatim it is true,as griffin points out,that at points during the trial the jury heard from the court that the government could prove that griffin acted willfully by showing she acted recklessly.the judge,however,took affirmative steps to correct this misstatement of the law during its jury instructions.the court instructed the jury to d isregard my earlier references to reckless disregard.you can see the judge actually at work here.in addition,in instructing on willfulness,the court informed the jury that,no one can be convicted of filing a false tax return because they made a mistake or because they were careless or because they had a genuine,but mistaken,belief in the requirements of the tax code.these statements sufficed to correct any misimpression the jury may have had,and we presume that juries follow instructions.see united states,cir.
the appellant second attack on the willfulness instruction is that the court failed to explicitly instruct the jury that griffin had to know that her statements were false in order to be convicted.this claim fails,because the court instruction did adequately advise the jury.the court instruction informed the jury that in order to find griffin guilty it had to conclude that griffin knew that she had a legal duty to report her income truthfully,and that she intentionally chose not to do so.thus,the court instructed the jury that the government had to prove that griffin knew that her statements were not truthful or,stated differently,that griffin knew that her statements were false.the court was not bound to use the willfulness formulation griffin insists upon in order to instruct the jury accurately.see united states mcfarlane,cir within wide margins,the district court maintains discretion in the precise manner that it explains legal concepts to the jury.citation omitted.
we now turn to the third and fourth claims relating to willfulness.these challenge the court willful blindness instruction.griffin argues that the government did not present evidence supporting such an instruction.a willful blindness instruction is appropriate if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge,the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance,and the instruction,taken as a whole,can not be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.united states coviello,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted united states singh,cir.
griffin focuses on the requirement that the facts suggest deliberate ignorance.she suggests that,as a general matter,there can not be evidence supporting both a conscious course of deliberate ignorance and actual knowledge.she also argues that where the government alleges that a defendant has actual knowledge,the case here,it can not request a willful blindness instruction.
the court did not commit error in issuing a willful blindness instruction.evidence presented at trial may support either a finding of actual knowledge or a finding of willful blindness.see united states cassiere,cir see also united states gabriele,cir.such evidence was presented in this case.when filing her and tax returns,griffin reported sales income she received from two marketing companies.despite griffin apparent awareness of a duty to report sales income,the government introduced evidence that she neither discussed sales income she received from global with her various tax preparers nor inquired as to whether she had a legal duty to report this income.
on the one hand,this evidence supports the theory that griffin deliberately avoided discussing her income from global in order to avoid actual knowledge of her legal obligation to report.see united states picciandra,cir noting court may instruct jury on willful blindness where the evidence suggest s that the defendant consciously chose not to ask about what he had reason to believe he would discover citation omitted.on the other hand,this evidence is also consistent with the theory that griffin knew of her legal obligation to report this income but simply chose not to report it.these theories can coexist.see united states carrillo,cir i t does not follow that evidence must be placed in either an actual knowledge category or a deliberate ignorance category.it is permissible for the government to present evidence supporting both theories and some of the government evidence might be relevant to both actual knowledge and deliberate ignorance.internal citation omitted.
moreover,the government did not forfeit its right to request a willful blindness instruction where the evidence supported such an instruction simply because it contended at trial that griffin had actual knowledge.see cassiere,at although the government main contention at trial was that all three defendants were knowing participants in the scheme,the government presented evidence from which the jury could have concluded that if they did not know what was going on,it was only because they chose to turn a blind eye.
the final willfulness issue,whether the willful blindness instruction itself was erroneous,however,presents a closer question.griffin argues that the instruction was erroneous for three reasons first,the instruction failed to inform the jury that griffin willful blindness had to be motivated by a desire to preempt prosecution.second,the instruction failed to include an actual belief caveat.the actual belief caveat informs the jury that a showing of mistake,negligence,carelessness,or recklessness could not support a finding of willfulness and that,although knowledge may be inferred from willful blindness to the existence of a fact,the jury must find the defendant had actual knowledge.third,the instruction inappropriately made reference to a reasonable person.in referring to reasonableness,griffin stresses,the court articulated an objective standard rather than the required subjective one,and therefore allowed the jury to convict on a finding of recklessness.
the first two contentions are hopeless.although we have said that a willful blindness instruction is proper when the government presents evidence that a defendant willful blindness was motivated by a desire to preempt prosecution,we have never required that courts instruct juries that the defendant willful blindness must have been motivated by such a desire.griffin cites no case remotely suggesting that the rule is otherwise.thus,there can not be plain error.
as for the second contention,the court did not commit plain error in failing to include the specific actual belief caveat that griffin insists upon.the court did not commit an error,let alone a plain one,by not instructing the jury that the jury must find the defendant had actual knowledge in order to convict under a willful blindness theory.we have never required that willful blindness instructions contain such a statement.see coviello,at approving instruction which informed jury they may infer that a defendant had knowledge but did not contain mandate that jury must find the defendant had actual knowledge united states brandon,cir same see also united states lizardo,cir same.
additionally,it is unlikely the court committed error simply by failing to include within the willful blindness instruction itself an instruction that a showing of mistake,negligence,carelessness,or recklessness could not support a finding of willfulness.the court had already communicated the point.earlier it instructed the jury that,no one can be convicted of filing a false tax return because they made a mistake or because they were careless or because they had a genuine,but mistaken,belief in the requirements of the tax code.see united states bailey,cir jury instructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge.quoting jones,at.in any event,if there was error it was not prejudicial,in light of the court instruction on mistake,carelessness and genuine belief.see united states cunan,cir rejecting defendant argument that court willful blindness instruction was plainly erroneous because it failed to include a statement that mere recklessness or negligence is not enough to support a finding of willful blindness where instruction as a whole adequately conveyed proper standard.
griffin third complaint about the willful blindness instruction,in which she criticizes the instruction use of the phrase reasonable person,is more substantial.as a general matter,the use of such language could cause a jury to conclude erroneously that it need only find negligence in order to convict under a willful blindness theory.see cassiere,at caution is necessary in giving a willful blindness instruction because of the possibility that the jury will be led to employ a negligence standard and convict a defendant on the impermissible ground that he should have known an illegal act was taking place.citations omitted.as the seventh circuit noted in carrillo,the use of reasonable person language invites a jury to conclude that,because a reasonable person in the defendant shoes would have had to deliberately blind himself to avoid knowledge,the particular defendant must have deliberately blinded himself to avoid knowledge.at.the focus of the willful blindness instruction must be on the particular defendant and not on the hypothetical reasonable person id.
ultimately,however,the use of the phrase reasonable person,did not amount to plain error because it did not prejudice griffin.as noted above,the court instructed the jury that it could not convict griffin if she was mistaken,careless,or genuinely believed she was not required to pay taxes on her global income.this earlier instruction likely negated any damage the reasonable person phrase may have caused.see united states moran,cir noting that under plain error review defendant must show improper instruction affected the outcome of the trial.moreover,had the court omitted any reference to the reasonable person,we are confident the jury would still have convicted griffin.the government presented a significant amount of evidence indicating that griffin either knew of a legal duty to report her global income that she intentionally violated or that she willfully blinded herself to facts strongly suggesting she had such a duty.the government produced evidence that griffin reported sales income she received from other marketing companies she worked for,that she told a fellow salesperson that she did not intend to pay income taxes on her global proceeds,and that she did not discuss her global income with her tax preparers.see united states,cir even if the court instruction was incorrect,sufficient evidence was introduced to convict the defendants without any reliance on the potentially incorrect segment of the jury instruction.as there was no prejudice,griffin is unable to satisfy the plain error standard.
intent to induce reliance 
griffin final claim of instructional error,closely related to her materiality argument,is that the court should have instructed the jury that,in order to prove a violation of,the government must demonstrate that the defendant intended to induce government reliance on the false statements.on the contrary,the intent to induce government reliance on a false statement or to deceive the government is not an element of.see boulerice,at 
griffin argues that the court should have excluded certain evidence under federal rule of evidence because its probative value was substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial impact because she did not object on rule grounds at trial,our review is for plain error united states wallace,cir.
the evidence griffin claims was improperly admitted falls into two categories.the first involves items that griffin sold as a global salesperson.the court admitted into evidence global tapes and allowed witnesses to testify both about the of these tapes and about other products sold at global seminars.the tapes instructed listeners how to pull themselves out of the system,so they could stop paying taxes and that silver coin is the only real currency.the tapes also described the social security number as the mark of the devil and referenced the bible as authority for a number of their positions.the second category of evidence includes testimony about griffin standard of living.witnesses testified that griffin paid for her boyfriend to accompany her on trips to and from bermuda and that she had a penchant for gambling,jewelry,and fine foods.
in admitting the global tapes,the court informed the jury that griffin was not charged with saying something or counseling something that unlawful and that 
whatever you think of what people were saying on the tapes,you do hold it against griffin for the saying of it.the reason you have it in evidence,is to consider whether defendant was part of this global prosperity operation and obtained from it income.
when allowing testimony about griffin interest in gambling,the court informed the jury that,t here no suggestion here about any impropriety in gambling.you just entitled to know the full picture and there no suggestion that any gambling casinos were illegal where these things took place.
the district court did not commit error,let alone plain error,in admitting this evidence.first,the tapes,besides connecting griffin to a source of income she did not report,were probative of griffin state of mind when reporting her income.griffin was a salesperson for a company that instructed people how to avoid paying taxes.this evidence certainly made it more likely than not that griffin acted willfully in declining to report her global income.see united states turano,cir noting that what defendant did to encourage people not to file tax returns was probative of defendant own state of mind in not filing tax return.second,the testimony regarding griffin spending habits was highly probative as to whether griffin tax returns,which reported annual incomes of less than,were false.see united states zanghi,cir see also united states simonelli,cir.finally,when admitting the evidence which held the greatest potential to prejudice griffin unfairly or to confuse the jury,the global tapes and the testimony about griffin interest in gambling,the court issued cautionary instructions.
on january,the district court sentenced griffin to months imprisonment.after this initial sentencing,the supreme court decided cunningham california,d.believing the case placed limits on its ability to find facts that could increase a defendant sentence,the court,acting sua sponte and five days after the initial sentencing,vacated the sentence and scheduled a resentencing hearing.on february,more than a month after issuing the first sentence,the court resentenced griffin to months imprisonment.
the government argues that the court erroneously vacated its original sentence for two reasons.first,it contends that the district court did not have jurisdiction when it acted.the government says that,under federal rule of criminal procedure a,the district court has a strict window in which it can resentence a defendant the district court resentencing of griffin more than a month after the initial sentencing,it continues,fell outside that window.the government argues in the alternative that even if rule a did not prevent the court from revisiting the initial sentence,a court can only resentence a defendant under the rule if the initial sentence was clear error
