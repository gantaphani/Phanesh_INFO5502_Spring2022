a petit jury convicted mamadou diallo of intentionally trafficking in goods and knowingly using a counterfeit mark on or in connection with those goods in violation of a.the goods were handbags bearing a counterfeit lv logo.the counterfeit lv logo was substantially indistinguishable from the genuine lv logo owned by the louis vuitton malletier corporation,a designer of luxury handbags.diallo contends that his conviction should be set aside because the evidence was insufficient in that it failed to establish his use of the counterfeit mark.alternatively,diallo asserts that his conviction should be vacated because the jury instruction defining the term use was incorrect.for reasons explained below,we will affirm.
on july,pennsylvania state trooper timothy callahan stopped diallo van on because the license plate was not illuminated.during the traffic stop,trooper callahan observed numerous sealed plastic bags in the van.after the traffic stop was concluded,trooper callahan explained to diallo that he was free to go,but proceeded to mention that is a corridor for the transportation of drugs from new york.he asked if diallo had any drugs or firearms in the van.when diallo denied possession of any such items,trooper callahan asked him what was contained in the plastic bags.diallo replied that the bags contained clothes.when trooper callahan asked to see the clothes,diallo opened the rear of the vehicle,pulled out a plastic bag,and opened it.what trooper callahan observed were numerous handbags bearing the lv mark.knowing that louis vuitton handbags were an exclusive item sold only by louis vuitton stores,trooper callahan asked diallo to whom the bags belonged.diallo admitted they belonged to him and showed trooper callahan a business license from indianapolis.unimpressed,trooper callahan arrested diallo.
a grand jury for the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania subsequently returned a indictment against diallo,charging him with violating a a jury trial commenced on april.the witnesses presented by the government in its case in chief included trooper callahan,diallo passenger,housseinou diakhaby,expert witnesses who explained that the handbags were not genuine products of the louis vuitton malletier corporation,and a previous customer of diallo indianapolis store who related how she discovered that handbags she had purchased were not genuine louis vuitton handbags.
diallo submitted his proposed jury instructions on the second day of trial.relying upon the supreme court decision in bailey united states,d,and its interpretation of the word uses in c,diallo argued that the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he actively employed the counterfeit mark on or in connection with the handbags by displaying or offering them for sale.consistent with this theory,diallo moved for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.he claimed that because the handbags were sealed in bags in the back of his van they had not been displayed or offered for sale.the district court reserved ruling on this motion.
during closing arguments,diallo counsel conceded that all but one of the elements of the offense were element of use.he argued that use required active employment of the mark by showing or displaying the goods bearing the counterfeit mark.on rebuttal,the government argued that use begins when diallo bought them in new york,carried them along the highway for purposes of using them at his commercial venture to sell.the prosecutor explained to the jury that diallo uses them when he buys them as inventory,as stuff he is going to take to his business in indianapolis,and put up on all of those racks.
the court instructed that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
first,that the defendant trafficked or attempted to traffic in goods.
second,that such trafficking or attempt to traffic was intentional.
third,that the defendant used a counterfeit mark on or in connection with the goods.
and fourth,that the defendant knew the marks used on the goods were counterfeit.
the court defined traffics and counterfeit mark in accordance with their statutory definitions.because the statute does not define use,however,the jury instructions did not elaborate on the meaning of that term.during its deliberations,the jury submitted a question to the court 
what is the definition of use as it pertains to this trial and the and elements of the charge is it pertaining to a physical exchange or use of one or more senses 
the district court excused the jury for the night,and the following morning provided counsel an opportunity to respond to the question.defense counsel,again relying on the supreme court decision in bailey,urged that the instruction should say affirmative acquisition is not enough to prove that the defendant used a mark on or in connection with the goods,that possession is not enough,that possession with intent to sell is not enough,and that trafficking,as defined by statute,is not enough to prove use 
after considering counsel arguments,the district court distinguished the supreme court decision in bailey and declared that 
the prudent course is to provide the jury with a dictionary definition of the word use both from black law dictionary and the webster third new international dictionary,unabridged version,and the court will reduce that instruction into writing and make it part of the record 
the instruction to the jury stated that the definition of the word use is t o make use of,to put into action or convert to one service,to avail oneself of,to have recourse to or enjoyment of,to employ.defense counsel objected to the portion of the definition that said to have recourse to or enjoyment of.following this instruction,the jury deliberated briefly before finding diallo guilty of violating a,diallo renewed his rule motion for judgment of acquittal,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for the element of use 
the district court denied diallo renewed rule motion.it determined that there was sufficient evidence that diallo used the counterfeit mark on or in connection with goods,stating that 
diallo knowing,intentional acquisition of handbags emblazoned with spurious marks for sale at a profit at his store was more than sufficient evidence to prove that he had used counterfeit marks because he avail ed him self of or ha d recourse to or enjoyment of them on or in connection with goods or services for which the genuine marks are actually registered.
thereafter,the district court sentenced diallo to probation for a term of three years,with a six month term of electronically monitored home detention.in addition,diallo was directed to pay restitution of to the louis vuitton malletier corporation.
this appeal followed.diallo contends that the district court erred in denying the rule motion because the evidence was insufficient to establish the use required by a.in addition,diallo contends that the court instruction on the element of use was error because it deprived diallo of his theory of the defense that his constructive possession of the handbags contained in sealed bags within his van did not constitute a use of the counterfeit mark on or in connection with the handbags.

diallo claim that the jury instruction was erroneous and his contention that there was insufficient evidence both concern the statutory interpretation of the term uses in a.the role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent because it is presumed that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language,every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.rosenberg xm ventures,cir citations omitted.section a makes it a crime to intentionally traffic in goods or services and knowingly use a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services a emphasis added.the plain language of the statute,therefore,requires that the government prove not simply that a defendant has knowingly used a counterfeit mark or in connection with a good or service,but also that the defendant intentionally trafficked in the goods or services.thus,the government must demonstrate both trafficking in goods and use of the counterfeit mark on or in connection with goods.united states giles,cir see also united states song,cir pointing out that t he use of the conjunctive and preceding the term counterfeit mark indicates congressional intent to prosecute one who traffics in goods and who uses a counterfeit mark in connection with those goods.use for purposes of a,however,is not defined by the statute.in the absence of a statutory definition,we give the words used their ordinary meaning.moskal united states,d quoting richards united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
according to diallo,his conviction must be overturned because the district court erred in its interpretation of the term uses in because it failed to heed the guidance of the supreme court in bailey united states,that use must connote more than mere possession and that the government must show active employment of the firearm.at.in bailey,the supreme court considered the meaning of the term uses in c,which sets forth certain penalties for any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm id.at.the court observed that the term u se draws meaning from its context,and it look ed not only to the word itself,but also to the statute and the sentencing scheme,to determine the meaning congress intended.id.at.in addition,the court instructed that 
we start,as we must,with the language of the statute.the word use in the statute must be given its ordinary or natural meaning,a meaning variously defined as t o convert to one service,to employ,to avail oneself of,and to carry out a purpose or action by means of.we consider not only the bare meaning of the word but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context 
id.at.internal quotations marks and citations omitted.consistent with these instructions,the court noted that the various definitions of use imply action and implementation,id.at,and pointed out that the statute applied to two types of conduct with a firearm uses or carries,id.mindful that congress intended each of the statutes terms to have meaning and that judges should hesitate to treat as surplusage any statutory terms,id.at,the court reasoned 
we assume that congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular,nonsuperfluous meaning.while a broad reading of use undermines virtually any function for carry,a more limited,active interpretation of use preserves a meaningful role for carries as an alternative basis for a charge.
id.at.it rejected the interpretation that use was synonymous with possession and determined that the term uses meant that congress intended uses in the active sense of to avail oneself of.id.at.the court acknowledged that this understanding of use included brandishing,displaying,bartering,striking with,and most obviously,firing or attempting to fire a firearm,as well as the offender reference to the fact that he possesses a firearm.id.at.although this reading of the term use was restrictive,the bailey court concluded that it was consistent with both the context of the term and congress intent.id.at.
the supreme court revisited the meaning of use in c in watson united states,d,which considered whether a defendant swap of his drugs for a firearm constituted use of the firearm during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime.id.at quoting c.again the court noted that in the absence of a statutory definition or a definitive clue,the meaning of the verb uses has to turn on the language as we normally speak it.id.at.the court looked for everyday meaning revealed in phraseology that strikes the ear as both reasonable and normal.id.quoting smith united states,d.the court agreed with the defendant that the ordinary meaning and the conventions of english meant a person did not use a firearm when he received it in exchange for drugs.id.at.
diallo cites to watson as support for his contention that the district court erred in defining use.focusing on the prosecution closing argument that diallo use began when he purchased them as inventory,diallo argues that watson illustrates that his mere receipt in trade of the handbags is insufficient to establish use of the counterfeit mark in connection with the goods.diallo argument is flawed.it assumes that the critical moment for purposes of this prosecution was the commercial transaction in new york when he purchased the handbags.the focus of this prosecution,however,was on what diallo did with the handbags bearing the counterfeit louis vuitton mark after he purchased them.in other words,diallo purchase is relevant only to the extent that at that point in time he acquired ownership and control over the handbags.
relying on bailey interpretation of the word uses in c,diallo asserts that uses in a requires active employment of the counterfeit mark by displaying or offering the handbag for sale.in united states ex rel.chicago,new york boston refrigerator interstate commerce commission,the supreme court acknowledged that because words used in one statute have a particular meaning they do not necessarily denote an identical meaning in another and different statute.in the context of a,the use is of the counterfeit marks.as the district court pointed out,there is little similarity between the use of counterfeit marks as contemplated by a and the use of firearms pursuant to c.the very nature of a firearm makes the concept of its use as active employment readily understandable.the use of a mark in connection with goods does not.thus,while bailey interpretation of the word uses may be informative,it is in no way controlling in the context of a.
although we find that factual distinctions render bailey and watson inapposite to our inquiry,we follow bailey regimen for statutory interpretation and begin with the language of the statute.bailey,at.section a provides that whoever intentionally traffics in goods or services,and knowingly uses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services commits a crime.a.the statutory definition of the term traffic is broad,meaning transport,transfer,or otherwise dispose of,to another,as consideration for anything of value,or make or obtain control of with intent so to transport,transfer,or dispose of e.uses,however,is not defined by the statute.the term appears in the statutory definition of counterfeit mark,and each time use appears it is in conjunction with a reference to either a spurious mark or a genuine mark registered with the united states patent and trademark office.
on its face,the statute refers to trafficking in goods,and using the counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods.giles,at.the government must prove two distinct actions trafficking in goods and using the counterfeit mark on or in connection with goods.the definition section of the statute reiterates that the act of trafficking pertains to the goods or services,and that the act of using relates to the counterfeit mark.the use is of the counterfeit mark,not the goods.this distinction is reinforced by the fact that the phrase use of the counterfeit mark must be on or in connection with such goods.indeed,in giles,the tenth circuit emphasized that criminal liability under a would lie only if the use of the counterfeit mark was in connection with the goods being trafficked.that court concluded that the mere act of trafficking in patch sets or counterfeit labels which are unconnected to any goods did not violate the statute that was in effect in.at.
therefore,unlike c in bailey which proscribes more than one type of conduct involving a firearm,the using or carrying of a firearm under certain circumstances,at,does not present a statutory scheme proscribing multiple types of conduct involving the same object.rather,addresses only one type of conduct involving the counterfeit mark,the use of it in connection with a good.it is unnecessary,therefore,to restrict the meaning of the expansive term uses in as occurred in bailey.see bailey,at.see also smith,at.noting that c language sweeps broadly,and is expansive,and id.at.scalia,dissenting characterizing use as elastic.
were we to adopt the meaning for the term uses urged by diallo,which focuses on displaying and offering the goods bearing the spurious marks for sale,we would be rewriting the text of the statute from uses the counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods to uses the counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods in a sales transaction.yet,neither the words sale nor sell appears in.instead,the statute more broadly references a commercial component by incorporating the word traffics,and without limiting that term to the point of sale.see e defining traffics.because the supreme court has instructed that o n matters of statutory interpretation,o ur task is to apply the text,not to improve on it,bd.of educ.of westside cmty,schools mergens by and through mergens,d quoting pavelic leflore marvel entm t group,d,we decline to read into a a requirement that use,by itself,requires either a potential,or an actual,sales transaction.
in our view,an ordinary and natural reading of uses gives effect to congress intent to control and prevent commercial counterfeiting by reaching a stream of illegal commerce and not simply its point of sale.see,stat.july,specifying in its anticounterfeiting consumer protection act of the purpose of the act.regardless of whether the goods bearing the counterfeit marks are physically located in a kiosk at a shopping mall or in a remote warehouse,the trafficker may still be prosecuted if he knowingly uses the mark on or in connection with a good.diallo reading,however,would limit enforcement to prosecuting vendors who have the counterfeit goods displayed and ready for sale.
we find support for this reading of the term uses in a in united states farmer,cir,and united states song,at.in each case,the defendant conviction for violating a was affirmed even though the goods bearing the counterfeit marks were neither displayed for sale nor physically located at a store or shop.for example,in farmer,the fourth circuit upheld the defendant conviction under a based on his warehousing of thousands of shirts bearing counterfeit brand name logos of nike and adidas.at.in song,the seventh circuit affirmed song conviction on five counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods based on not only her displaying counterfeit gucci watches at her flea market stand,but also because she had watches bearing four other counterfeit marks stored in her van.
we conclude,based on the statutory text of a,that we need not restrict the expansive statutory term uses as diallo suggests.accordingly,because the commercial aspect of a defendant conduct is encompassed in the element of trafficking,we reject diallo argument that the term uses in a means that the government must show active employment of the counterfeit mark at a point of sale.
having concluded that an ordinary and natural reading of uses is appropriate in the context of,we consider the definition crafted by the district court in response to the jury inquiry.because diallo contends the instruction was legally incorrect,we exercise plenary review.united states zehrbach,cir.in conducting our review,we must be mindful that a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.cupp naughten,d.in reviewing the charge as a whole,we consider whether the instruction regarding the meaning of use strikes the ear as both reasonable and normal as required by watson.at.
consistent with the bailey court consultation of dictionaries,at,the district court considered definitions from black law dictionary ed,and webster third new international dictionary ed.black law dictionary defines the term as t o put or bring into action or service to employ for or apply to a given purpose.id.at.the black definition further explicates the term in a n sense,such that t he use of a thing means that one is to enjoy,hold,occupy,or have some manner of benefit thereof.id.among the numerous entries explaining the word use in webster third new international dictionary is the definition to put into action or service have recourse to or enjoyment of employ.id.at.based on these definitions,the district court combined the two dictionary definitions to fashion the definition it provided to the jury to make use of,to put into action or convert to one service,to avail oneself of,to have recourse to or enjoyment of,to employ.
diallo takes issue only with the language to have recourse to or enjoyment of,which were not part of the definition of use considered by the bailey court.at.in his view,this language renders the definition overly broad and beyond any ordinary use of the word,as it allowed the jury to find him guilty of the offense based on his constructive possession of the goods bearing the counterfeit mark.as noted,watson instructs that we should consider whether the definition used by the district court strike s the ear as reasonable and normal.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in our view,the definition crafted by the district court from black law dictionary and webster third new international dictionary is reasonable and normal in describing the use of trademarks,a form of intellectual property.
the intended purpose of a trademark,be it genuine or spurious,is to convey that the good meets the design and manufacturing specifications of the lawful owner of the trademark,not only at the time the mark is first affixed or attached to the good,but throughout the lifetime of that good.see defining trademark and specifying that it is to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product,from those manufactured or sold by others.this purpose informs our analysis.here,the counterfeit lv logo was used on or in connection with a good by being affixed to it,by being attached to a handbag.the lv logos were converted to diallo service,and employed by being attached,sewn,embossed,imprinted or connected to the handbags in order to distinguish them as genuine louis vuitton merchandise.the merchandise in the back of the van that diallo had recourse to and could avail himself of was not simply handbags,but handbags bearing the exclusive louis vuitton lv logo.as a result,even though these handbags bearing the counterfeit lv logos were not yet in diallo indianapolis store,they were a part of his inventory.diallo ownership of the handbags bearing the lv logos enabled him to represent to he owned genuine louis vuitton handbags.diallo was able to enjoy having an inventory that contained seemingly authentic louis vuitton handbags,knowing that they would command a greater purchase price than a bag not bearing the counterfeit mark.
these explanations,which each draw on the definition provided to the jury in diallo case,are consistent with the natural and ordinary meaning of the term use as it pertains to trademarks.accordingly,we can find no error in the district court definition of use and we conclude that the jury charge,taken as a whole,accurately submitted the issues to the jury.the district court refusal to delete the language recourse to and enjoyment of in its definition of the term use did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
with the district court definition of use in mind,we turn to whether there was sufficient evidence of diallo use of the coun
