after a jury trial,darryl tavares and eddie jones were both convicted under of conspiracy to knowingly transport an individual in interstate commerce with the intent that such individual engage in prostitution,in violation of count one.tavares was also convicted of knowingly transporting a minor,across state lines to engage in prostitution,in violation of a count nine,and of sex trafficking of a child,in violation of count ten.jones also was convicted of aiding and abetting the transportation of a minor,across state lines to engage in prostitution,in violation of a count nine,and of knowingly transporting a minor,in interstate commerce with the intent that she engage in prostitution,in violation of a count fourteen.the district court sentenced both tavares and jones to months imprisonment and to three years supervised release.they have timely appealed their convictions and sentences on various grounds for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
on may,a grand jury indicted tavares,jones and four other individuals for various offenses involving the transportation and trafficking of individuals for prostitution they were indicted for conspiring to knowingly transport individuals in interstate commerce with the intent that those individuals engage in prostitution.in addition,tavares was charged with two counts of sex trafficking of children,and jones was charged with one count of transporting a minor to engage in prostitution.the four other individuals pleaded guilty tavares and jones chose to go to trial.
at trial,the government established that tavares and jones were pimps who,over several years,prostituted young women,including girls.the government presented five principal witnesses,women who had worked as prostitutes for tavares,jones or both.four of these five women worked for one or both defendants as prostitutes when they were under eighteen.
the government evidence demonstrated that tavares and jones worked closely together.the testimony recounted one incident in which tavares and jones,along with an associate,took a young girl from her home in maine to become a prostitute in boston,massachusetts.travel such as this was common another woman testified that she had worked for jones as a prostitute in several cities along the east coast boston,massachusetts,atlantic city,new jersey,philadelphia,pennsylvania and washington.the government also presented evidence that tavares and jones had used violence and coercion against their victims.for instance,on one occasion,tavares took a young woman to another pimp,assisted in assaulting her and then offered to take her back with him.
tavares and jones were sentenced separately.tavares received an organizer or leader enhancement.the district court then imposed an sentence of months imprisonment,to be followed by three years supervised release.the district court determined that jones was a career offender and imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,to be followed by three years supervised release.
discussion 
tavares and jones were tried together,but sentenced separately.their consolidated appeal contains only one common issue.thus,for clarity and ease of discussion,we shall address first their joint trial on the merits,beginning with the common issue and then turning to each defendant claims.finally,we shall discuss their respective sentencing claims.
trial on the merits 
the common issue voir dire 
tavares and jones each have nicknames.tavares is stallion or young stallion jones is young indian.these nicknames were included on the docket sheet posted outside of the courtroom during jury selection.
voir dire of the prospective jurors lasted three days.at the beginning of the proceeding,the district court informed the jurors of the nature of the charges.the court then made some general inquiries to ascertain if any member of the venire had read or seen anything about the case or if any member was related to or knew the attorneys or witnesses.the court then pointedly admonished the prospective jurors that they were under an order not to talk about the case and not to guess what the case is about beyond what the court had told them 
the court then undertook an individual examination of each prospective juror.counsel were permitted an allotted time to question each prospective juror.during that questioning,defense counsel often inquired about the jurors views of pimps and prostitutes,and the relationship between the two.defense counsel questioned some prospective jurors concerning their views about prostitutes who were minors.during this process,three prospective jurors reported that some members of the jury pool had discussed the district court instructions about the case and the significance of tavares and jones nicknames in the jury room.they also said that there had been speculation about the nature of the case.they reported that several prospective jurors had laughed and joked about the nicknames,including one comment that the nicknames might indicate gang membership.
after listening to the jurors accounts and considering the argument of counsel,the district court denied tavares motion to disqualify all jurors who had been in the jury room since the first report of discussion about the case and the nicknames.tavares and jones then asked to question prospective jurors who already had been preliminarily qualified.this request also was denied the district court stated that it was not going to order the return of all preliminarily qualified jurors for additional questioning.it then explained that it was fairly confident that all that was involved was speculation about what the court instructions were and speculation about what the defendants nicknames meant.the court also noted that,in any event,the nicknames would be revealed at trial and that the early revelation of the nicknames pales in comparison to what defense counsel told the jurors about the defendants work as pimps 
when subsequent prospective jurors were called for examination,the district court asked each potential juror whether he or she had discussed the case.one prospective juror,who admitted to joking about the nicknames,was challenged for cause and dismissed.after empaneling the jury,the court gave a general instruction to the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone,including each other,until all evidence was presented.however,no specific instruction was given about the nicknames or the earlier discussions.
tavares and jones submit that the district court response to the discussion of the defendants nicknames was inadequate.they maintain that the court committed reversible error when it refused to permit questioning of the entire jury pool.alternatively,they contend that,upon learning of the discussion,the court should have dismissed the entire jury pool.
the parties variously cast the problem presented here as one of juror taint on the theory that prospective jurors were exposed to material outside the record,or of premature deliberation because prospective jurors speculated among themselves about the significance of facts that eventually would be before them,if they were selected for service on the chosen jury.neither of these characterizations is a precise description of the rather unique situation that confronted the district court.in any event,choosing between these characterizations is not an essential part of the analytical task facing a district court,or this court,when dealing with juror misconduct.our cases make clear that when faced with a allegation of any sort of juror misconduct,the district court must engage in a analysis.see united states diaz,cir united states tejeda,cir.first,the court must determine whether misconduct occurred.if no misconduct occurred,no further action is required.m isconduct allegations that are frivolous do not trigger any duty of inquiry and do not require that a hearing be held.united states mikutowicz,cir alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,if any misconduct did occur,the court must proceed to assess the magnitude and extent of any prejudice caused and,if necessary,take remedial measures.tejeda,at.if no curative measures appear adequate,the court may grant a timely motion for mistrial.id.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court handling of juror misconduct.diaz,at the and often delicate task of assessing such situations,which often requires the assessment of witness credibility,counsels that a district court must enjoy broad discretion in addressing potential juror misconduct.id.therefore,normally we will not reverse unless the judge choice among the various avenues available was patently unreasonable.united states lemmerer,cir.
here,our colleague in the district court followed the process of assessment prescribed by our case law.the court undertook an examination of the rather unique circumstances surrounding the incident.the court realized that the misconduct took place at a very early stage of the proceedings and also gave appropriate weight to the fact that the defendants nicknames would indeed be before the selected jury as evidence during trial.finally,the court determined that any harm caused by the discussion of the nicknames had been negated significantly by defense counsel own statements to jurors about tavares and jones activities.having made this assessment,the district court determined that admonishing the empaneled jury not to discuss the case or to form ultimate conclusions until all evidence had been presented was the appropriate course.
on the basis of our study of the trial transcript,we can not accept the contention that the district court was obliged to conduct a more extensive inquiry.while not protracted,the inquiry here was measured but sufficiently thorough.the court observed and evaluated firsthand the potential jurors reports of the discussions.it took note of the conversations content,the point in the proceeding when they took place and the fact that the matter discussed by the prospective jurors would be covered thoroughly at trial.the court then concluded that any harm from the violation of its initial instruction not to speculate about the trial could be cured by an appropriate cautionary instruction.this approach was certainly well within the options from which a thoughtful district court could be expected to choose,and we shall not the course taken by the court here.
issues raised by tavares 
tavares raises several challenges to his convictions.we address these count by count.
conspiracy count one 
count one of the indictment charged tavares with conspiring to knowingly transport an individual in interstate commerce,intending that she engage in prostitution.in support,the indictment alleged overt acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.among these was overt act j,which alleged that i n or about february,after assisting in the assault of by covering her head with a garbage bag and securing it with duct tape,darryl tavares negotiated with another male to have return to work for him as a prostitute.
a young woman who worked as a prostitute at various times for tavares and for another pimp named jungle,was a witness at trial.she testified about an incident when tavares brought her to her,jungle.she said tavares was with jungle when they tied her hands behind her back with rope.she further testified that while jungle put the bag over her head,he asked tavares for help,but,because of the bag,she could not hear or see who participated in her subsequent beating.after the assault,tavares offered to take back,but jungle refused because had to work for him first.tavares counsel extensively 
admission of testimony 
although tavares does not appeal the admission of evidence concerning the other overt acts,he does challenge the admission of testimony about overt act j.he challenges testimony only as irrelevant under rule of the federal rules of evidence and unfairly prejudicial under rule.we shall address these arguments in turn 
we review the district court admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.united states upton,cir.under federal rule of evidence,evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.
tavares objected at trial,and presses here on appeal,that t.testimony was not relevant and is therefore inadmissible because it primarily inculpated jungle the government submitted at trial,and the district court agreed,that testimony was relevant because it explained the relationship between tavares and,a fact germane to whether tavares transported for prostitution.further,tavares offering to take off jungle hands suggests that she worked for him as a prostitute,also germane to whether tavares trafficked her for sex count ten.we certainly can not discern any abuse of discretion in the district court ruling.the events to which testified certainly have a tendency to make a fact that tavares transported and trafficked her for sex more probable than it would be without the evidence.furthermore,whether tavares transported her and prostituted her is of consequence in determining the action.id.
federal rule of evidence provides that although relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.we do not disturb the district court balancing of probative value and risk of unfair prejudice absent extraordinarily compelling circumstances.freeman package mach,cir.we see no such extraordinary circumstances here.
in tavares view,even if testimony is relevant,it still should have been excluded because its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.according to tavares,prostitution and sex trafficking of children are not violent crimes.thus,he concludes,any mention of violence inherently poses a risk of prejudice substantially outweighing probative value and inviting jurors to decide the case purely on emotion.we accept neither tavares premise nor his conclusion.violence,abuse and other forms of human degradation are part and parcel of sex trafficking.it is not at all surprising that evidence of such acts is offered to establish a conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking.moreover,evidence of these violent acts was particularly probative of the defendants relationship with the women because it directly demonstrated the control that the defendants exercised over the women in their prostitution operation.specifically,with respect to tavares,the evidence showed that the violent episode also entailed negotiations with jungle to get back to work for him.the testimony was also relevant to and probative of tavares knowledge and intent with respect to count ten,charging him with recruiting and transporting to engage in a commercial sex act.
here,the district court considered tavares arguments several times and concluded that the probative value of testimony was not substantially outweighed by any risk of unfair prejudice.that decision was certainly among the options from which a reasonable judge could be expected to choose.the record contains no basis that would justify our overturning the district court decision.
ii.prejudicial variance 
testimony concerning the incident with jungle indisputably is at variance with the language of the indictment and the government identical proffer to the district court.the government expected to testify that tavares put the plastic bag over her head.however,testified that jungle,not tavares,put the bag over her head.her testimony otherwise conformed to the indictment she indicated that tavares assist ed in her assault and negotiated with another male jungle to have return to work for him as a prostitute.
not every variance calls for reversal.united states seng tan,cir.tavares must show that the variance prejudiced him.id.prejudice in this context is found when,for example,the variance le ft the defendant so in the dark about the charge against h im that he could not prepare a defense or plead double jeopardy to stop a second prosecution for the same crime.id.
here,tavares faces an additional hurdle.because he did not object in the district court to this variance,our review is for plain error.id.thus,tavares must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected his substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states savarese,cir.
tavares can not establish any prejudice from the variance between the indictment language and testimony at trial.tavares conspiracy conviction did not depend on overt act j being proven.evidence was admitted concerning the other overt acts charged in the indictment the evidence supporting his and jones conviction was overwhelming.thus,any error in admitting testimony concerning overt act j was harmless.
the variance between the indictment and testimony was not prejudicial and affords no basis for reversal.
transportation of a minor count nine 
tavares was convicted of knowingly transporting a minor,in violation of a.a great part of the evidence on this count came from own testimony.in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states alfonzo reyes,cir.
at trial,testified that,when she was seventeen,tavares and peeples,a who pleaded guilty,picked her up at her high school in maine.tavares and peeples then took her to her sister home.jones was at the home.the group talked about g oing to boston to make money.tavares,jones and then drove from maine to massachusetts with some other people.testified that in the car she was told to pick her future pimp from among tavares,jones and another man she chose tavares.
during the ride,sat on tavares lap while he explained the rules of prostitution,including forbidding her from talking to other pimps and dictating how she should speak to him.she testified that she did not speak with jones at her sister apartment or on the drive to boston.immediately upon arrival in boston,tavares took to the streets to work as a prostitute.she worked there for a considerable period of time.
tavares raises two challenges to his conviction for transporting insufficient evidence and an erroneous jury instruction.he contends that the government did not prove that he transported with the intent that she engage in prostitution and that the government failed to prove that he knew was under eighteen at the relevant time.tavares assertion that the government proof of his knowledge of underage status was insufficient is closely linked to his challenge of the jury instruction on this count.
sufficient evidence of intent 
in order to convict tavares of transporting,the government was required to prove,among other things,that he had the intent that she engage in prostitution.a.this element requires proof that criminal sexual activity was one of the several motives or purposes not a mere incident of the trip or trips,but instead was at least one of the defendant motivations for taking the trip in the first place.united states ellis,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we reverse only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,could not have persuaded any trier of fact of the defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states paradis,cir.we do not weigh evidence or assess credibility.see united states downs moses,cir.
tavares maintains that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he transported with the requisite intent.according to tavares,a jury could not draw a reasonable inference that he intended that engage in prostitution until they had arrived in boston,after transportation was completed.in support,he relies on the fact that only participation in an escort service,not prostitution,was discussed explicitly in maine.
the record shows that the government met its burden at trial.the jury reasonably could infer from testimony that tavares purpose in bringing her from maine to boston was that she work for him as a prostitute.the discussion about g oing to boston to make money reasonably can be understood as relating to prostitution.this interpretation is especially justifiable because tavares is an admitted pimp,he picked up with another pimp peeples and took her to discuss mak ing money with a third pimp jones.
even disregarding this statement,tavares conduct during the ride from maine to boston clearly evidenced his intent in taking the trip.en route from maine to boston,tavares instructed to choose a pimp for whom to work and told her his rules for the prostitutes working for him.furthermore,the jury was not limited to considering testimony in assessing tavares intent.for example,an fbi agent testified that tavares told him that peeples was sister pimp but peeples could handle both sisters and so they tavares and peeples had made arrangements to bring down to the boston area.
tavares contention that no intent reasonably could be inferred from this evidence is unavailing.the evidence produced at trial was more than sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that tavares had the requisite intent at least during,if not before,transportation.
ii.sufficient evidence of knowingly 
tavares also challenges the sufficiency of his conviction on count nine by contending that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew was under eighteen at the time he transported her.this claim is linked closely to his contention that the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict him on this without finding that he knew was under eighteen.therefore,we address the instructional issue first.
title of the united states code,section a criminalizes transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.it provides that 
a person who knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the age of years in interstate or foreign commerce,or in any commonwealth,territory or possession of the united states,with intent that the individual engage in prostitution,or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than years or for life.
id.the district court instructed the jury that,in order to convict tavares,it had to find that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that tavares knowingly transported in interstate commerce,with the intent that engage in prostitution and was under eighteen years old at the time of the transportation.the district court applied the knowingly requirement only to the act of transportation,not to the age of the individual transported.
we review de novo claims of legal error in jury instructions.figueroa alejandro,cir.although we have not addressed whether a requires knowledge of the victim underage status,all six circuits to consider the issue have concluded that it does not 
tavares,relying on the supreme court decision in flores figueroa united states,d,urges that we break with our sister circuits and extend the knowledge requirement to the victim underage status.in flores figueroa,the court construed a,which penalizes a person who knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person.the court found that the statutory language required applying knowing to two elements the means of identification and of another person.id.at.tavares contends that flores figueroa represents an emerging trend in the supreme court jurisprudence of applying the scienter requirement to every statutory element.thus,he concludes,this court should extend knowingly to the victim underage status.
the sixth and seventh circuits have considered and rejected this argument.see united states daniels,cir united states cox,cir.these circuits agree that the context of a compels a reading of the statute that does not require knowingly to be applied to the victim age.daniels,at.the court in daniels held that this reading 
is consistent with congressional intent that minors need special protection against sexual exploitation.we agree that this context justifies requiring a defendant who would presumably know he is treading close to the line in transporting a young person to engage in illicit sexual activity to bear the risk that the person transported is underage.
id.quoting cox,at.in addition to context,the court noted that 
under the mann act,a defendant commits a crime any time he transports an individual for the purpose of prostitution.therefore,age in a is not a factor that distinguishes criminal behavior from innocent conduct,but rather serves to justify a harsher penalty when a victim is underage.in contrast to the statute at issue in flores figueroa,when a defendant violates the mann act,he knows a real victim is involved,even if he does not know that victim is a minor.
id.citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.
there is further reason to doubt that the supreme court intended such a modification of existing case law interpreting a.in flores figueroa,justice alito,noting the importance of context in legislative interpretation,suggested in a concurring opinion that the majority principles of interpretation would not extend the scienter requirement in a to the underage status of the victim.at alito,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment as the seventh circuit noted in cox,at,the majority in flores figueroa did not take explicit issue with justice alito caution and,indeed,appeared to endorse it.see flores figueroa,at.for these reasons,we are persuaded by the reasoning of our sister circuits,and we see no need to depart from it.
our construction of the term knowingly in the statutory language is fatal to tavares second sufficiency challenge and to his claim that the jury instruction was infirm.even assuming,for the sake of argument,that the government had not produced sufficient evidence of tavares knowledge of age,such a failure is irrelevant.the government was under no obligation to prove that tavares knew was underage.
issues raised by jones 
jones challenges his convictions on counts nine and fourteen.we address these challenges in turn.
aiding and abetting transportation of a minor count nine 
jones was convicted of aiding and abetting tavares transportation of,in violation of a.he contends that the government did not prove that he participated in tavares transportation of rather,he maintains,the government established that he was merely present while tavares committed a crime.
to convict jones of aiding and abetting,the government was required to prove that he participated in the illegal venture and sought by his actions to make it succeed.downs moses,at.p roof of sufficient participation in the crime,as well as knowledge of it,is required to convict.united states guerrero,cir.mere presence at the scene of the crime,even with knowledge that a crime is being committed,is generally insufficient.united states campa,cir.
we conclude that the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to convict jones of aiding and abetting the transportation of.the government established that jones was a pimp and that he worked as one with tavares.it also established that jones was party to the discussion at sister home about g oing to boston to make money,which a jury reasonably could infer was a discussion about prostitution and one in which jones participated.a jury could conclude that jones participation in such a discussion was part of an effort to recruit to be a prostitute,either for him or for tavares.given that the group left for boston soon after,a jury further reasonably could infer that jones accompanied them as part of the scheme to bring into the prostitution ring.
also testified that she was instructed on the ride to boston to choose a pimp for whom to work from among the men in the car,including jones.a jury could draw at least two reasonable inferences from this testimony,both supporting jones conviction.first,a jury reasonably could infer that jones stood to benefit financially from transporting because there was a chance she would work for him.second,it could infer that tavares indication of jones as a potential pimp for demonstrates jones association with tavares plan to transport for prostitution.indeed,had chosen differently,jones could have been principally liable.
jones stresses testimony that she did not speak to him either at her sister home or during the car ride.this argument is unavailing.considering testimony as a whole and jones working relationship with tavares,such lack of conversation between jones and does not raise a reasonable doubt about jones aiding and abetting liability.jones presence at the discussion about making money in boston and on the subsequent car ride permitted the jury to conclude that jones had more than a coincidental association with tavares criminal venture and,indeed,had joined the illegal enterprise.
we therefore conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to justify jones conviction on count nine.
due process and voluntariness of testimony count fourteen 
jones also was convicted of knowingly transporting a minor,k,in interstate commerce with the intent that she engage in prostitution,in violation of a.jones alleges that testimony was coerced and that its admission into evidence violated his fifth amendment right to due process.he also claims,in the alternative,that the district court erred by failing to investigate sua sponte allegations of coercion.
was a government witness.she testified that she met jones when she was sixteen and began working for him as a prostitute.in this capacity,she worked for jones in boston and traveled with him on several occasions to work as a prostitute in other cities.in addition to boston,jones prostituted in atlantic city,new jersey,in philadelphia,pennsylvania and in washington.after ending her relationship with jones,worked as a prostitute for tavares.
on direct examination,admitted that she did not want to testify,but was doing so under a subpoena.jones counsel conducted a full of.during that,she agreed with defense counsel that she had been threatened by fbi agents and a federal prosecutor with remaining in jail after she was arrested for failing to appear as required by a summons and with losing custody of her daughter if she did not do what they wanted her to do.she also agreed she was just going to tell the prosecution what they wanted to hear so she could move on with her life.on redirect,stated that she had been threatened by the fbi and federal prosecutors when she had been required to appear before the grand jury four years earlier and admitted that she had not told the district court that she had been threatened.
jones did not object to testimony at trial.accordingly,we review his challenges to testimony for plain error.united states matos quiñones,cir.
jones claim is very similar to the one we rejected in united states hall,cir,and that case provides substantial guidance.according to the testimony in that case,agents told one witness that she faced prosecution if she did not tell them what they wanted to hear.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.another witness testified that an agent told him that if he did not cooperate,the government would take his home.in light of this testimony,the defendant in hall contended that the government had violated his fifth and sixth amendment rights by threatening certain witnesses with severe consequences if they did not testify on the government behalf.id.in assessing this claim,we noted that a due process violation can occur when witnesses are discouraged from testifying through threats or other coercion.notably,we distinguished those cases from situations where the government has to press unwilling witnesses to provide testimony that they are reluctant to give.id.at.therefore,unlike government efforts to prevent the testimony of certain witnesses,t here is no blanket rule against inducements by the government to witnesses to produce truthful testimony.id.at.while making this distinction,we nevertheless recognized the possibility that,in extreme circumstances,government misconduct could occur through improper efforts to shape testimony to the government liking.id.however,we determined that hall presented no such circumstances,and,in any event,no constitutional violation had occurred because there was conflicting testimony as to whether the government actually threatened the witnesses and defense counsel was allowed to on the issue,leaving it to the jury to evaluate witness credibility in light of the evidence concerning the alleged threats.id.
upon examination of the circumstances here,we must reach the same conclusion as the one that we reached in hall there is no constitutional violation.to be sure,did not want to testify against jones.indeed,she threw away a summons to appear before the grand jury and subsequently failed to appear as required she testified at trial only because she had been subpoenaed and she stated several times that she did not want to testify against jones what jones counsel characterized as the government threats,are more accurately viewed as lawful coercion of a reluctant witness to testify as required by law.such threats are the legal consequences for failing to appear pursuant to a summons.additionally,as in hall,jones counsel fully on this issue.there was ample testimony in the record to permit the jury to evaluate credibility in light of all these circumstances.
nor can we say,as suggested by jones,that the district court committed plain error in not conducting an evidentiary hearing prior to admitting the testimony.jones contends that these threats trigger the analysis set forth in lafrance bohlinger,cir.in that case,we determined that the circumstances surrounding a witness statement were so indicative of its involuntariness as to require a hearing.specifically,a witness had recanted a prior sworn statement while testifying he claimed that the prior statement was a police fabrication that he had been forced to sign while under the influence of drugs.id.at.there,we stated that i t is unthinkable that a statement obtained by torture or by other conduct belonging only in a police state should be admitted at the government behest in order to bolster its case.id.at.because the surrounding circumstances raised a substantial claim that the statement was legally involuntary,see lego twomey,d jackson denno,d,we held that the trial court had an obligation to investigate,through an evidentiary hearing,whether the testimony was voluntary.lafrance,at.
there is a material and qualitative distinction between the prosecutorial misconduct at issue in lafrance and the situation before us today.lafrance dealt with police extraction of a statement from a witness,by means which we described as police threats and other blatant forms of physical and mental duress.id.in her testimony,related on instances of lawful pressure.she was apprised of the lawful consequences of her failing to testify,which she was legally required to do.the purpose of informing her of those legal consequences,moreover,was to ensure that she fulfilled her obligation to testify,not to ensure that she give particular testimony.
given the nature of the government pressure and the full picture of the surrounding circumstances rendered by the robust to which was subject,we conclude that the district court had no duty to inquire further into the voluntariness of testimony.there was no error,and certainly no plain error,in the district court admission of this testimony.
sentencing 
tavares sentencing 
tavares presentence report psr calculated that he had a total of fourteen criminal history points,which corresponds to a criminal history category of vi.the psr noted that tavares had one state criminal conviction and eight offenses,including two juvenile adjudications.because the united states sentencing guidelines section c provides that a maximum of four prior offenses can be included in a criminal history points calculation,the psr assigned only four points for these convictions.
at sentencing the district court heard arguments from the government and from tavares concerning the psr criminal history category calculation,the imposition of several sentence enhancements and the a factors.the government submitted that tavares criminal history category was vi tavares maintained that the appropriate criminal history category was v.the district court never determined which criminal history category was correct.
the district court imposed organizer or leader and obstruction of justice enhancements for one of tavares conduct groups group.given these enhancements and their differing views on the appropriate criminal history category,the government and tavares disagreed on the correct guidelines sentencing range.the government guidelines sentencing range calculation was to months.tavares guidelines sentencing range calculation was to months.the government asked that the district court impose a sentence of months imprisonment,a sentence in excess of the government own calculated guidelines sentencing range.
the district court never chose between the government proposed guidelines sentencing range and tavares.during argument on sentencing enhancements,the court stated e ssentially i will sentence in a way that it will make the guidelines sentencing range calculation not matter.after considering both potential ranges,the district court decided that it would impose a sentence above either range and so it was unnecessary to decide between the two.the court ultimately imposed a sentence of months imprisonment on tavares.
the court explained that it imposed this sentence for several reasons.first,it viewed tavares crime as a crime of intentionality,a lifestyle crime,a choice tavares made.second,the court reasoned that this is a crime that can be deterred because it the lifestyle choice,and if the cost of this lifestyle is years in prison,then it seems that others will pause.the court also stated that the testimony of tavares victims concerning the violence to which he subjected them during the crimes of conviction was about the most disturbing testimony that it had heard.thus,it reasoned,a month sentence serves all the purposes of sentencing but notably and candidly retribution,retribution for the women who were victimized,retribution for the violence they suffered.the court concluded that its chosen sentence fully satisfie d the purposes of sentencing,particularly general deterrence,specific deterrence,retribution,public safety,indeed incapacitation.
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error.united states cortés cabán,cir.we review the reasonableness of a criminal sentence under an standard.united states rivera moreno,cir citing gall united states,d.review of a sentence under this standard generally involves a process first,we determine whether the district court committed procedural error second,if there was no procedural error,we determine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable.see gall,at.we review for plain error tavares claims that he raises for the first time on appeal.see united states ríos hernández,cir.
calculation of tavares guidelines sentencing range 
tavares correctly points out that the district court never conclusively determined his guidelines sentencing range.it considered both the government calculation and tavares,but never determined which was correct or stated upon which it relied.this lapse is clearly a significant procedural error.the district court is required to calculate the defendant guidelines sentencing range before exercising its discretion.see gall,at stating that a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range citing rita united states,d.f ailing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range is a significant procedural error.gall,at.the supreme court has made clear that t he guidelines provide a framework or starting point for the judge exercise of discretion.freeman united states,d.
under the particular circumstances of this case,however,we are convinced that the district court failure to calculate definitively the operative guidelines sentencing range was harmless.the record disclosed that the district court understood the position of the parties on the applicable guidelines range.it is also apparent that the court understood that the only point of disagreement between the parties was the applicable criminal history category.there is,moreover,no basis to conclude,and neither party suggests,that the proper guidelines sentencing range was other than one of those suggested and discussed at the sentencing hearing.the court imposed sentencing enhancements,the sole purpose of which is to alter a defendant guidelines sentencing range,and considered both resulting guidelines sentencing ranges the record makes equally clear,however,that,having been apprised of these considerations,the district court determined that a sentence within the guidelines range as calculated by either party was not an appropriate sentence.the court stated e ssentially i will sentence in a way that it will make the guideline sentencing range calculation not matter.therefore,regardless of whether tavares guidelines sentencing range was that calculated by the government or by tavares,the district court was of the view that a sentence of months was warranted.
although the district court failure to calculate conclusively tavares guideline sentencing range is a serious procedural error,such an error does not necessarily require remand for.the supreme court held in williams united states that remand is required only if the sentence was imposed as a result of the error,d internal quotation marks omitted.if the district court would have imposed the same sentence even without the error,it was harmless.id.we routinely apply williams analysis to procedural errors at sentencing whether the district court commission of a significant procedural error,here its failure to calculate tavares guidelines sentencing range,is subject to analysis under williams is a question of first impression in this circuit.our colleagues in the sixth circuit have confronted squarely the issue of whether williams applies to a failure to calculate definitively the guidelines sentencing range and have held that it does.see,united states lanesky,cir performing analysis where the sentencing court did not calculate an applicable guideline range at all other circuits,while not confronting precisely this issue,have held that other serious procedural sentencing lapses are subject to williams and to analysis 
the reasoning of our sister circuits is persuasive.the fact that gall designated failure to calculate the guidelines sentencing range as serious procedural error does not preclude application of williams analysis.as our colleagues on the eighth circuit have concluded,w e see nothing in gall that undermines williams or makes analysis inapplicable to procedural sentencing errors.united states henson,cir.we note,furthermore,that the supreme court in united states booker,d,noted the continued validity of analysis in procedural error cases.the court stated that in cases not involving a constitutional violation,whether resentencing is warranted or whether it will instead be sufficient to review a sentence for reasonableness may depend upon application of the doctrine.id.at.
an error is harmless if it did not affect the district court selection of the sentence imposed.williams,at.however,even if we are satisfied that an error did not affect the district court determination of the sentence,we still must review the sentence for substantive reasonableness.see id.if the party defending the sentence persuades the court of appeals that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the erroneous factor,then a remand is not required and the court of appeals may affirm the sentence as long as it is also satisfied that the departure is reasonable.united states marsh,cir reviewing the district court discussion of a factors after determining that any error in the district court sentencing was harmless.
with these principles in mind,we first consider whether the district court error was harmless.as we noted earlier,the district court clearly stated that it would sentence tavares in such a manner as to render the guidelines sentencing range irrelevant.it also engaged in a lengthy colloquy with the parties concerning various enhancements to tavares sentence.ultimately,the district court calculated tavares guidelines sentencing range assuming a criminal history category of v and then assuming a criminal history category of vi.immediately before sentencing tavares,the court stated,i just want to identify again the sentencing guideline range which was,even accepting the defense calculations,the guideline range is to months.i described why,taking the government calculations it still to at a category.with both of these potential guidelines sentencing ranges in mind,the court then stated,i am going to accept the government recommendation here,and here why this is a crime of intentionality.this is a lifestyle crime.this is a choice tavares made.
this is just the type of harmless error in sentencing envisioned in united states rodriguez,cir.in rodriguez,we stated 
certainly there are situations in which a judge might make clear that a dispute about a guidelines calculation did not matter to the sentence.this might be a different case if,for example,the district judge had been faced with an explicit choice between the two sets of guidelines,and thus understood the magnitude of the difference between them,when he said the choice did not affect the sentence.
id.at.disagreement over tavares criminal history category separates tavares calculation from the government.the district court understood this disagreement and chose not to decide between the two proposed guidelines sentencing ranges because the severity and nature of tavares crimes of conviction made doing so unnecessary.indeed,in its statement of reasons,the district court wrote that criminal history category is v or vi.the district court therefore did not fail completely to calculate tavares guidelines sentencing range or impose his sentence without any consideration of the guidelines.rather,it determined that whether tavares criminal history category was v or vi did not impact its sentencing decision.the district court clearly understood the options within the possible guidelines calculations and clearly rejected all of them as yielding too lenient a sentence.the district court evident intent to sentence tavares to months imprisonment regardless of whether his criminal history category was v or vi is sufficient to demonstrate that the district court failure to determine tavares guidelines sentencing range did not affect the sentence it imposed.
this situation is not materially different from situations that we and our sister circuits have encountered with respect to other procedural errors.for example,in marsh,the district court stated that it would impose the same sentence as a sentence under a.at.we held that the defendant claim of procedural error is not one we need to resolve because the district court stated that it would have imposed the same sentence as a sentence.id.at.this statement was sufficient for us to conclude that an alleged guideline error would not have affected the district court sentence.see also united states ortiz,cir holding that b ecause the district court stated that even in the absence of these departures under the sentencing guidelines,the district court would have impose d the same sentence,any procedural error was harmless as a matter of law alterations in original united states teague,cir holding that the district court erroneous determination that the defendant was a career offender under the guidelines was harmless because the district court stated that it found the career offender enhancement undue or excessive and so did not rely on the enhancement in sentencing 
we therefore conclude that the district court failure to choose between the two proposed guidelines sentencing ranges and determine definitively which applied is harmless error.we must therefore review the substantive reasonableness of tavares sentence.see infra.
since vacated state conviction 
during the pendency of this appeal,tavares massachusetts criminal conviction,which was given a score of three in the psr,was reversed and its verdict set aside.see commonwealth tavares.according to the psr,tavares criminal history category was vi had this conviction not been counted,it would have been v.he contends that the inclusion of this state conviction in his guidelines sentencing range calculation requires resentencing.
as we have noted earlier,tavares sentence was not imposed as a result of his guidelines sentencing range calculation his criminal history category did not affect the district court sentencing.because failing to determine tavares guidelines sentencing range is harmless error,any error in calculating the guidelines sentencing range,such as improperly including a prior conviction,is harmless.
we have recognized that,in some cases,an erroneous calculation or designation can be influential even if not treated as controlling.united states mcghee,cir.in mcghee,the district court had classified the defendant as a career offender under the guidelines but the case on which it relied to do so subsequently was overruled.we therefore were required to treat that designation retrospectively as error.id.at.moreover,in explaining the defendant sentence,the district court made ambiguous remarks concerning its rationale for the sentence length.as a result,we held that we think the transcript is less clear than it was in teague that the career offender designation was entirely irrelevant.id.at.in teague,we concluded that the district court had made clear that its erroneous designation of the defendant as a career offender had not mattered to its sentencing only the circumstances of prior crimes and the defendant role in the crime of conviction had been considered.at.therefore no remand was required.id.at.
this case is not like mcghee.we do not believe that the record supports the view that the district court was influenced materially by the inclusion of tavares conviction in his psr.on the contrary,the record indicates that the district court considered only tavares crimes of conviction in imposing his sentence,not his conviction.after initially stating its chosen sentence,the district court explained its rationale 
i believe that this is a crime that can be deterred because it the lifestyle choice,and if the cost of this lifestyle is years in prison,then it seems to me that others will pause.
i going to accept the government recommendation because i sat through the testimony of women that was about the most disturbing testimony that i heard since i been on the bench.
the court repeatedly connected trial and tavares in his crimes of conviction to his sentence of months.tavares conviction was not mentioned by the district court and there is no evidence in the record that the district court was in any way relying on,or influenced by,this conviction or the psr guidelines sentencing range calculation which included it.as we have noted earlier,the district court did not view tavares criminal history as operative in the determination of the sentence.it made clear that it would have imposed the same sentence had tavares criminal history category been v its focus was the nature and the circumstances of the crimes of conviction.see teague,at affirming the defendant sentence where the district court erroneously believed that the defendant was a career offender under the guidelines and then used its discretion to depart downward from the guidelines sentencing range after considering the defendant role in the crime of conviction.
we therefore conclude that the inclusion of tavares conviction in his psr was harmless error.
organizer or leader enhancement 
the district court imposed a organizer or leader enhancement on tavares sentence under united states sentencing guidelines section c.evidence produced at trial established that tavares had a prostitute collect money from his other prostitutes,drive around his other prostitutes and inform him when a prostitute had misbehaved.the district court found that tavares was the top of this organization,stating that t here no question that he was in a leadership role in committing the offenses of conviction 
united states sentencing guidelines section c provides for a enhancement if the defendant was an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in any criminal activity other than a criminal activity involving five or more participants.under this provision,therefore,the defendant must exercise leadership over fewer than five participants.a participant is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,but need not have been convicted.cmt.
tavares contends that the prostitutes he employed can not be participants within the meaning of section c because they received immunity from prosecution.their immunity,he argues,prevents them from being criminally responsible for the offenses of conviction.we can not accept this argument.the guidelines commentary notes that a participant need not be convicted of the offense.that a participant can be unindicted is clear from the plain language of the guideline.see,united states scott,cir a participant,in turn,must be criminally responsible for the commission of the offense even if he or she was not charged or convicted.quoting cmt.united states messervey,cir rejecting defendant assertion that the district court erred when it found that those the defendant exploited to his advantage in his fraud schemes were participants in the offenses because the psr described these people as victims see also introductory cmt.the determination of a defendant role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.
we have not had occasion to consider whether a grant of immunity precludes designation as a participant.the only appellate court to have addressed the issue has concluded that a grant of immunity does not preclude such a designation.see united states anderson,cir united states jackson,cir.in light of our sister circuit reasoning and the clear language of the guideline,we also hold that a participant can be an immunized witness against the defendant.the district court did not err in imposing an organizer or leader enhancement.
juvenile adjudications 
tavares also challenges the inclusion of two juvenile adjudications in his psr,each scored as one point under united states sentencing guidelines section d b.he raises two issues on appeal,neither of which he raised in the district court.thus,our review is for plain error.
first,tavares contends that the government failed to meet its burden of showing that his juvenile offenses were punished by at least sixty days confinement.tavares misapprehends the legal standards governing the inclusion of his juvenile adjudications in the psr.the psr scored each adjudication under section d b.under this section,the government only need establish that the relevant juvenile sentence was imposed within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense it does not have to establish any length of confinement.tavares erroneously cites the standard required to score an adjudication as two points,see d a,which the psr did not do.because tavares alleges that the government failed to meet the requirements of a standard it did not apply,his argument fails.
second,tavares urges us to reject the consideration of juvenile adjudications in sentencing on policy grounds.tavares notes that his main contention is that since the sentencing guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory it is open to him to argue that countervailing policies counsel against use of juvenile adjudications in federal sentencing.the guidelines specifically provide for certain juvenile adjudications to be considered in evaluating the defendant criminal history.united states gonzalez arimont,cir citing d.we consistently have upheld scoring juvenile adjudications under the guidelines certainly,there is no plain error in considering tavares juvenile adjudications.in any event,as we have noted earlier,tavares sentence would have been the same even if the juvenile convictions had not been considered.moreover,tavares has eight prior convictions which were each scored one.tavares does not challenge the calculation of any of the remaining six convictions.because the guidelines provide in section c that the maximum number of prior offenses that can be counted in the criminal history category is four,eliminating two of these offenses still leaves six,more than the four permitted.the exclusion of tavares juvenile adjudications,therefore,would not alter his criminal history category calculation and so would not alter his sentence even if the district court had based tavares sentence on his criminal history category,which it did not.therefore,we decline to consider tavares policy argument concerning the use of juvenile adjudications.
sentencing memorandum 
when sentencing above the guidelines range,the district court is required to articulate its reasoning for the upward departure.see c.this requirement is met when the district court sets forth its reasoning in a written statement of reasons attached to the judgment.see,united states vargas dávila,cir.the district court statement of reasons includes a copy of tavares sentencing transcript in which the court explained the imposition of his sentence.
tavares makes much of the fact that on the statement of reasons,the district court wrote sentencing memo to follow in the space provided to justify the imposition of an sentence.no separate memo was ever produced.we see no error here.the district court adequately explained tavares sentence in the sentencing transcript and incorporated that transcript in the statement of reasons.the district court decision to incorporate the sentencing transcript,which contained the required information,rather than to write its reasoning in the space provided,adequately fulfilled the requirement that the reasons for the imposition of the sentence be stated and is not reversible error.
adequate explanation of section a factors 
tavares also maintains that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the mandatory a factors,especially tavares background and characteristics.
the district court believed that a term of imprisonment of months fully satisfie d the purposes of sentencing.our review of the record makes clear that the district court considered the mandatory a factors.while the court ordinarily should identify the main factors upon which it relies,its statement need not be either lengthy or detailed.united states turbides leonardo,cir.we conclude that the district court explanation is adequate.the court specifically mentioned tavares background several times including his psychological report and family history the sentences of,deterrence and the violent nature of the crimes of conviction given the record,we must conclude that the district court did not fail to consider the a factors or fail to adequately explain the chosen sentence.gall,at.
therefore,we conclude that tavares sentence was procedurally correct and substantively reasonable.
jones sentencing 
jones challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.he specifically challenges the use of his two prior convictions for resisting arrest as predicates for a career offender classification under the guidelines and the district court consideration of the a mandatory sentencing factors.he also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court gave insufficient weight to the report of jones forensic psychologist.we address these issues in turn.
career offender classification 
the district court classified jones as a career offender under united states sentencing guidelines section based on his prior massachusetts convictions for resisting arrest.thus,jones offense level was set at,resulting in an increased guidelines range.we review de novo a determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for the purposes of the career offender guideline.see united states almenas,cir.
united states sentencing guidelines section a classifies a defendant as a career offender if he was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the offense of conviction,the instant offense is a crime of violence and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of a crime of violence.jones urges that his convictions for resisting arrest can not be the basis for his career offender classification because resisting arrest is not a crime of violence.we consistently have rejected this argument.in almenas,we held that resisting arrest under massachusetts law is a crime of violence within section a.at.we reaffirmed this conclusion recently in united states grupee,cir,and united states davis,cir.
jones attacks almenas and its progeny as inconsistent with the supreme court decision in chambers united states,d,decided after our decision in almenas.however,we rejected this claim in united states weekes,cir.therefore,the district court did not err in classifying jones as a career offender under the guidelines.
remaining challenges to jones sentence 
a reviewing court must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error assuming that the district court sentencing decision is procedurally sound,the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an standard.gall,at.accordingly,o ur first task is to determine whether the district court made any procedural errors if the district court has committed no such procedural error,we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed and review the sentence for abuse of discretion.marsh,at internal quotation marks omitted.w e afford the district court wide discretion in sentencing.id.at.here,because jones did not object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence before the district court,we review for plain error.see mato,at.
jones submits that the district court committed significant error by failing to consider the mandatory a factors,to make explicit reference to those factors and otherwise to explain adequately his sentence.
the record demonstrates that the district court explicitly considered the a factors.it identified the main factors upon which it relied in sentencing jones,emphasizing the connection between the sentence imposed and the nature and circumstances of the offense,the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense and the avoidance of unwarranted sentence disparities.although the district court discussion of these factors was brief,we do not require the court to address those factors,one by one,in some sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing decision.marsh,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also addressed adequately jones history and characteristics.it discussed his psychologist report detailing his family background,his history of restraining orders and his statement to the court.however,after considering all of the relevant factors,the district court found that the gravity of the offense trumped any weight that might otherwise be given to jones background.the district court stated 
while i have read the report that jones counsel handed up,there are frankly certain offenses that are so serious that even if there an explanation for it in someone background and history and even if you can draw a straight line from who they were to who they are now,and if you can understand it,there are some offenses that ca be explained,ca be justified.this is one of them.
in jones view,this statement indicates the district court refusal to consider his history and mandatory factor under a.we can not accept this argument.the district court considered jones history and characteristics,but after reviewing these factors,still believed that the nature of the offense and surrounding circumstances required the sentence imposed.the district court committed no procedural error in making that determination.
we now address the substantive reasonableness of jones sentence.
jones faults the district court for failing to give significant weight to the report of his forensic psychologist the district court stated that it considered this report jones contends,however,that,because the district court relied on his treatment of the victims in determining his sentence,the district court also should have considered the mitigating circumstances in his background that may have caused his behavior.we can not accept this contention.that the sentenc
