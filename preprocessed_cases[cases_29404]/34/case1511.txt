zachary foster entered a conditional guilty plea to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm,reserving the right to challenge the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence recovered after a.foster argues that the district court erred because the police lacked reasonable suspicion.we disagree and therefore affirm.
around on august,police in wheeling,west virginia,received a call reporting a gunshot near a jogging trail by coleman fish market.officers eric burke and rachel boyer were dispatched to the scene.
driving separately,the two officers arrived within minutes to the area in question,which was associated with theft,vandalism,and the production of methamphetamine.with boyer trailing him,burke rounded a corner and saw foster just standing there,looking around in an alley between two businesses that,like all others in the area,were closed.when burke spotted foster,the officers were about three or four blocks away from coleman fish market.foster was the only person burke and boyer had encountered since arriving in the area.
both officers left their cars and approached foster,with burke holding a rifle in the low ready position.burke informed foster that he and boyer were investigating a report of a shot fired in the area.foster did not respond and avoided eye contact.boyer believed that foster was under the influence of drugs because his eyes appeared glassy,he did not respond to her or burke,and h e did have the alertness that most people have when police officers approach them.burke thought foster might possibly be under the influence of drugs because of how unresponsive he was.
next,burke asked foster if he had any weapons.foster then began to put his right hand in his right front pocket.burke and boyer interpreted this as a security check an instinctual movement in which,upon being asked if they are carrying any weapons,suspects reach to ensure that a concealed weapon is secure,burke then told foster to keep his hands out of his pockets,and foster complied.subsequently,burke told boyer to frisk foster.boyer first patted the outside of foster right pocket,touching an object that felt like a firearm.ultimately,boyer discovered three guns.
foster was indicted for one count of being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of g,a.arguing that he was stopped and frisked without reasonable suspicion,foster moved to suppress the evidence that boyer and burke recovered.
after a hearing,a magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant foster motion.the judge reasoned that the following factors together did not create reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify the 
defendant was spotted in the area where a caller reported that one shot was recently fired the gunshot was reported late at night and the area was considered a area by the officers defendant did not respond to any questions by the officers the officers believed defendant was under the influence of illegal drugs and during questioning,defendant moved his right hand toward his front right pocket.
upon the government objection,the district court declined to adopt the magistrate judge report and recommendation and denied foster motion to suppress.the court placed particular emphasis on the security check,noting that b ecause the underlying principle for a terry frisk is officer safety,this court finds the defendant hand movements to be especially significant.
the court,however,gave no weight to the officers observation that foster may have been under the influence of drugs because burke the officer who ordered the testified merely that foster possibly appeared to be intoxicated.additionally,the court g ave little weight to foster lack of eye contact with the officers because he did not show signs of nervousness,but rather stood there silently.
subsequently,foster entered a conditional guilty plea,reserving the right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to suppress.foster was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.
this appeal followed.
on appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo,united states green,cir,as long as the relevant issues were properly raised in the district court,see fed.crim.b united states olano.because the government prevailed below,w e construe the evidence in the light most favorable to it.green,at.
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.although brief encounters between police and citizens require no objective justification,united states black,cir,a brief investigatory stop is impermissible unless the officer action is supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot,united states bumpers,cir.quoting terry ohio.
an antecedent question to whether an investigatory stop comports with the fourth amendment is whether there was such a stop at all that is,whether the police seized a suspect.black,at see also united states slocumb,cir.to determine this,we consider whether,in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident,a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.slocumb,at quoting united states gray,cir.
if a person was seized,courts move on to consider whether the seizure was justified by reasonable suspicion.th is level of suspicion must be a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.black,at quoting united states griffin,cir.
to determine if the officer had reasonable suspicion,courts look to the totality of the circumstances.slocumb,at.while a mere hunch is insufficient,reasonable suspicion is less demanding than probable cause and may well fall considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.united states massenburg,cir.alteration in original quoting united states arvizu.seemingly innocent factors,when viewed together,can amount to reasonable suspicion.see slocumb,at.that said,we are skeptical of government attempts to spin largely mundane acts into a web of deception.see united states foster,cir.accordingly,the government can not rely upon post hoc rationalizations to validate those seizures that happen to turn up contraband.id.at.
even if an investigatory stop is justified by reasonable suspicion,a subsequent frisk of a suspect for weapons is not necessarily permissible.united states sakyi,cir.explaining that an officer must have justification for a frisk or a beyond the mere justification for the traffic stop.instead,a frisk must be supported by reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous.united states george,cir.quoting arizona johnson,see also terry,at.
on appeal,foster presents two principal arguments.the first is that he was seized before he reached for his right pocket and that this seizure was not supported by reasonable suspicion.foster second argument is that even if he were seized after he reached for his pocket,the police still lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him.we address these arguments in turn.
before us,foster argues that he was seized before he reached for his pocket and that this supposed seizure was not justified by reasonable suspicion.we reject this contention.
foster legal theory relies on a version of the facts that differs from the findings of the magistrate judge and district court.foster says that after burke informed him that there was a gunshot reported in the area,the officers told him that he would be detained and frisked.according to foster,only after this did he reach for his right pocket upon being asked if he was carrying any weapons.
in pressing this version of the facts,foster relies on a portion of boyer testimony from the hearing.appellant br.at quoting.after testifying that burke told foster that the police were responding to a report of a shot fired in the area,boyer stated,at that point we told foster that we were going to detain we were just going to pat him down to see if he had weapons on him,because he was the only person in the area at the time and all the businesses were closed.then,boyer testified that the police asked foster if he was carrying weapons at a later time.because the parties agree that foster reached for his right pocket after being asked if he was carrying any weapons,this portion of boyer testimony suggests that the police ordered foster to submit to a before he reached for his pocket.
based on this excerpt of boyer testimony,foster argues that when the officers told him that they were going to detain him and pat him down,he was subject to an investigatory stop.because this took place before foster reached for his right pocket,his security check would not be considered in a analysis.
foster,however,failed to make this argument in the district court.instead,foster accepted the version of the facts ultimately found by the magistrate judge and the district court and effectively conceded that the security check was a relevant consideration by including it in his analysis.indeed,foster stated in his response to the government objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation that t he basic facts of this case are not in dispute,and he described the relevant facts in the following sequence the officers asked foster if he had weapons,foster reached toward his pocket,and then the officers ordered him to put his hands in front of him and conducted the pat down.
a theory presented for the first time on appeal is generally considered waived or forfeited.see united states robinson,cir.discussing waiver and forfeiture united states rendelman,cir.an appellate contention that was not preserved in the trial court is reviewed for plain error only.curiously,however,the government has not pressed waiver or forfeiture on appeal.see united states,cir.holding that the government waived its waiver argument.accordingly,we think it fair to proceed by determining if the district court clearly erred in failing to find facts consistent with the version of events that foster presents on appeal.
clear error is demonstrated when the reviewing court,considering all of the evidence,is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states jackson,cir.quoting united states breza,cir.but,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,we will not reverse the district court finding simply because we have become convinced that we would have decided the fact s differently.united states stevenson,cir.first alteration in original quoting anderson bessemer city.we also,as previously noted,review the facts in the light most favorable to the government because it prevailed below.green,at.
a district court commits clear error when it makes findings without properly taking into account substantial evidence to the contrary.united states francis,cir.quoting miller mercy,cir.here,however,the portion of boyer testimony to which foster refers is not the sort of substantial evidence to the contrary that must be explicitly accounted for by the district court.indeed,neither party thought it significant enough to bring to the court attention.moreover,as the government points out,the officers incident reports,burke testimony,and boyer testimony viewed as a whole all support the district court findings accordingly,we reject foster version of the facts as well as his accompanying legal argument that he was seized before he reached for his pocket 
we next consider foster argument that even if burke and boyer stopped him after he reached for his pocket,they lacked reasonable suspicion.
there are five relevant factors supporting the presence of reasonable suspicion that foster was or had been engaged in criminal activity 
the call that reported a gunshot 
shortly after the officers were dispatched,foster was the only person they encountered in the area in which the gunshot was reported 
the stop occurred late at night in a part of the city described as a high crime area 
foster did not respond to the officers questions and avoided eye contact and 
foster reached for his right pocket after being asked if he was carrying a weapon.
the government also points to the fact that officers burke and boyer suspected that foster was under the influence of illegal drugs.appellee br.at.like the district court,we give this no weight.
in evaluating the officers suspicion that foster was on drugs,the district court explained that courts must not simply aggregate the knowledge of all officers involved in a stop instead,they should substitute the knowledge of the instructing officer or officers for the knowledge of the acting officer.quoting massenburg,at.the court found that no testimony indicates that officer boyer communicated her concern to officer burke that foster may have been under the influence of drugs.thus,only burke knowledge was relevant.
with regard to his knowledge,the court explained that burke merely thought foster could possibly be under the influence of drugs because of how unresponsive he was.quoting.based on this,the court found that officer burke report and testimony do not support a finding that he suspected the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.the district court therefore concluded that it should not consider foster suspected drug use in its inquiry.we find no error in the district court analysis.
nonetheless,based on the remaining factors,we conclude that the stop was justified.
the first relevant factor is the call.foster argues that we should discount it in our analysis because it was anonymous and unreliable.
a,anonymous tip,standing alone,is insufficient to justify a terry stop.united states elston,cir.quoting florida.but,the police may rely on an anonymous tip to establish reasonable suspicion if it is suitably corroborated so as to exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability,at quoting alabama white,massenburg,at.
by itself,the tip here falls far short of supplying the officers with reasonable suspicion,as our decision in massenburg makes clear.there,the police received a vague,anonymous tip that shots were possibly fired in a particular area.massenburg,at.while we noted that the fact that the tipster disclosed her basis of knowledge increased the call reliability,the anonymous report was still insufficiently reliable to support reasonable suspicion absent further corroboration.id.at.the tip here is similar,and thus we must determine whether any other circumstances increase its reliability to justify stopping foster 
we next consider the fact that,minutes after the officers were dispatched,foster was the only person they encountered in the area in which the gunshot was reported.
in massenburg,we explained that when a tip lacks sufficient indicia of reliability,presence in the area identified by the tip does not generate reasonable suspicion.id.at.similar to foster,massenburg and his companions were the only people encountered when the police responded to a report of gunshots about fifteen minutes after receiving an anonymous tip.id.at.additionally,like foster,massenburg was found four blocks away from the site of the alleged gunfire.id.at.we concluded that the government would need to point to further circumstances to meet the threshold.see id.at.here,given the similarity of the facts at hand to massenburg,we must conclude the same.
adding to the mix that the officers encountered foster at night in what they perceived to be a area also fails to push the needle across the threshold.
both the reputation of an area and the late hour of a police encounter can contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion.see,slocumb,at george,at.but here,even when combined with the factors described above,they are insufficient to justify an investigatory stop.
massenburg,once again,makes this clear.there,in addition to the previously discussed similarities to foster case,massenburg was encountered at night in a area known for drug activity as well as random gunfire.massenburg,at.we reasoned that the reputation of the area add ed little to the anonymous tip and d id little to support the claimed particularized suspicion as to massenburg.id.at.ultimately,we concluded that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion.id.at.
here,the reputation of the area is of even less value to the government than it was in massenburg.the area in which the police stopped foster was not known specifically for incidents,unlike the area in question in massenburg.consequently,we can not find reasonable suspicion based on the factors discussed thus far.
next,we address the extent to which foster failure to respond to or make eye contact with the officers supports reasonable suspicion.
with respect to foster silence,the supreme court has said that when an officer,without reasonable suspicion or probable cause,approaches an individual,the individual has a right to ignore the police and go about his business.illinois wardlow.thus,a refusal to cooperate,without more,does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.id.quoting florida bostick.here,because foster did not have to respond to burke and boyer,we do not find his silence significant.
as for foster lack of eye contact,we have explained that while the failure of a suspect to make eye contact,standing alone,is an ambiguous indicator,the evidence may still contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion.george,at citation omitted.we are hesitant,however,to afford lack of eye contact much weight because it is no more likely to be an indicator of suspiciousness than a show of respect and an attempt to avoid confrontation.see massenburg,at.
massenburg is once again instructive.there,the police pointed to the defendant allegedly suspicious and nervous behavior,namely that he avoided eye contact,stood back from the group of people he was with,and took a step back away from a police officer,and then began pantomiming a self search.id.at.we concluded that this behavior was not g enuinely suspicious,but rather a mild reaction to requests to consent to a voluntary search.see id.at.such unremarkable evidence of nervousness could not suffice to create reasonable suspicion without terry reasonable suspicion requirement becoming meaningless.see id.accordingly,it was clear that reasonable,particularized suspicion of criminal activity d id not exist.id.
here,while foster failure to make eye contact with the police is not irrelevant,george,at,it is too mild a reaction to deserve much weight in our analysis,especially in light of the district court finding that foster did not appear to be nervous.
based on the factors discussed thus far,this case is not meaningfully distinguishable from massenburg.accordingly,we turn to consider whether the security check is sufficient to tip the scales in the government favor.
a security check by a suspect can contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion that the suspect was engaged in criminal activity.see united states humphries,cir.pointing to a security check as a factor supporting a finding of probable cause see also,united states briggs,cir.explaining that a suspect grabbing at his waistline was relevant to a analysis because it suggested that he might be carrying a weapon united states oglesby,cir.finding reasonable suspicion for a frisk where,among other factors,the suspect repeatedly lowered his right hand toward the right pocket of his pants because such action reasonably indicated to the officers that he might be carrying a weapon.
foster argues,however,that his hand motion should carry little or no weight because it merely indicated that he may or may not have been carrying something in his pocket.appellant br.at.he points to other innocent explanations for the movement for instance,foster says he could have been reaching for a cell phone.id.
while we have no doubt that there are possible innocent explanations for foster movement,it must be rare indeed that an officer observes behavior consistent only with guilt and incapable of any innocent interpretation.united states moore,cir.quoting united states price,cir.see also black,at a reasonable suspicion need not rule out all innocent explanations.burke and boyer were investigating a report of a gunshot and the one person they encountered at the scene reached for his pocket when asked if he was carrying a weapon.it was not unreasonable under these circumstances for the officers to have concluded that foster might have a weapon.
foster also contends that west virginia law allows the open and concealed carry of firearms,so the fact that foster might have been carrying a firearm did not suggest any evidence of criminal conduct.appellant br.at.this argument fails because burke and boyer stopped foster not merely because he might be armed,but because he might have been the source of the reported gunshot 
having established that we can properly include the security check as a factor in our analysis,we now combine all of the factors supporting reasonable suspicion to consider the totality of the circumstances the whole picture.united states smith,cir.quoting united states cortez.
although the circumstances observed or known by the police before foster reached for his pocket were not enough to support reasonable suspicion,the security check tied all of the factors into a coherent whole that justified an investigatory stop.burke and boyer were investigating a reported gunshot,in a area,at night.because foster was the only person in the area where the gunshot was reported,the police justifiably had some suspicion that he might have been the individual who fired the shot.indeed,we found reasonable suspicion under similar circumstances in united states moore,though in that case a police officer was responding to a burglar alarm rather than an anonymous call.see at concluding that there was reasonable suspicion for a terry stop where a police officer responded quickly to a silent burglar alarm in a area at night,the officer saw only the defendant in the area,the defendant was about to yards from the building in question,and the defendant was moving away from the scene of the crime,though the silent nature of the alarm may have given him no cause to hurry.
by performing a security check,which suggested that he could be armed,foster gave the officers further cause to suspect that he was the source of the gunshot.the check also gave the officers an additional reason to trust the caller report not only was there a person near the scene of the reported gunshot at an otherwise quiet hour,but there was reason to believe that person was armed.under the circumstances in which burke and boyer found themselves,the fourth amendment d id not require them to simply shrug their shoulders and allow a crime to occur or a possible criminal to escape.id.at quoting adams williams.instead,they could justifiably perform a terry stop because they had reasonable suspicion that foster committed a crime associated with discharging a firearm.
our decision in united states sims further supports finding reasonable suspicion in this case.cir.there,the police received an anonymous report that a black male wearing a and blue jeans had just fired a pistol in a particular area.id.at.an officer arrived minutes later and saw a person matching the description in the report standing behind a house in a crouched position,peeking around the corner,who then jerk ed right back behind the house when the officer made eye contact with him.id.at alteration in original.the officer then stopped the suspect and frisked him.id.at.
the suspect argued that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion under florida.id.in that case,an anonymous tipster reported that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun,at.police then arrived at the scene and found,who matched the description in the anonymous tip,along with two other people.id.other than the tip,the officers had no reason to suspect any of the three of illegal conduct.id.the police did not see a firearm,and made no threatening or otherwise unusual movements.id.nevertheless,the police stopped and frisked him.id.the court concluded that the police lacked reasonable suspicion because outside of the anonymous tip,there was no evidence that had done anything illegal.id.at,see sims,at explaining that in,the supreme court held that t
