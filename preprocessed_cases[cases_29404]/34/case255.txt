pedro michael goncalves appeals from his conviction on drug and gun counts and from his sentence.the appeal presents two issues of some significance one relating to the search of a car parked in a driveway and the other to the fair sentencing act of,stat.and a host of other claims that require little time to resolve.we begin with a bare sketch of the background events and proceedings,reserving factual detail for the discussion of specific claims.
in february,a confidential informant told scott sullivan a pawtucket police detective working with a joint island state police task force that goncalves was selling large amounts of crack cocaine in the providence and pawtucket areas.the informant reported that goncalves used a apartment at pomona avenue in providence to store and distribute crack kept additional crack in his bedroom at his mother house at west avenue in pawtucket used a white lincoln continental for drug deliveries and was armed with a handgun.
sullivan conducted surveillance and record checks in march and april to verify the informant information.he confirmed that goncalves regularly visited the providence apartment that the white lincoln registered to his girlfriend julia baptista was regularly parked there and that goncalves visited his mother pawtucket house and used that address for his cell phone subscription.sullivan also discovered that goncalves had a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon and a arrest and state charge for cocaine trafficking,and that police had found a large amount of cash in goncalves pawtucket bedroom in an unrelated investigation.
in march and april,sullivan oversaw two controlled purchases by the informant of crack cocaine from goncalves.goncalves drove the lincoln to the first purchase,and the second purchase occurred within walking distance of the providence apartment.based on his corroboration of the informant information and evidence from the second purchase,sullivan obtained warrants authorizing searches of the providence apartment,the pawtucket house,and goncalves person.
on may,sullivan planned to make a traffic stop of goncalves in his car after he left the providence apartment however,goncalves noticed the surveillance as he drove away and,ignoring red lights and reaching speeds of miles per hour,led the police on a chase through various streets and on interstate.reaching his mother house in pawtucket,he crashed the car in her driveway,locked the driver door,ran,and was apprehended.on searching goncalves,police found in cash and two cell phones one in the name of eugene fernandes sic an associate of goncalves but no car keys,drugs,or gun.in the lincoln,police discovered hidden in the gas tank cap grams of powder cocaine and hidden under the hood a loaded and cocked caliber pistol.in goncalves bedroom in the pawtucket house,police found two bags of crack cocaine,totaling grams,and a cardboard box addressed to him containing over ninety needles and syringes.in the providence apartment,police found in the kitchen pantry and cupboards grams of crack cocaine,a small digital scale,chemicals,and other materials useful in making and selling crack they found elsewhere in the apartment papers and photographs connecting goncalves to the apartment and to fernandez.
goncalves was indicted on five counts three for possession with intent to distribute,a,b a c,relating to the crack found in the providence apartment,the crack found in the pawtucket house,and the powder cocaine found in the lincoln,and two counts relating to the gun found in the lincoln being a felon in possession,g,and gun possession in furtherance of a drug crime,id.c.after failing in a motion to suppress the evidence,goncalves was tried,rapidly convicted by a jury on all five counts,and sentenced as described below.he now appeals.
goncalves challenges the sufficiency of the government case on all of the charges,pointing to evidence that the providence apartment was rented in fernandez name and paid for and used by fernandez and a man named mike the latter name,however,also used by goncalves,and that the car belonged to baptista.as for the crack cocaine found in the pawtucket house,goncalves admitted ownership but said that it was for personal use.these are appropriate jury arguments,but the adverse evidence is so powerful that a rational jury could reasonably and readily convict on all five counts.
the bare bones of the adverse evidence have already been set forth the association of goncalves with both premises where drugs and items were found,his use of the lincoln and the presence of drugs and a weapon concealed within,and his flight from arrest.and there was considerably more evidence filling in the chinks whether any single event in isolation would convict him of any one of the charges might be debated but the ensemble of pieces fit together and the jury could rationally conclude that all of the drugs belonged to goncalves and were part of his trade.
nor was there any difficulty in the jury inference that the gun under the hood belonged to goncalves and was kept in aid of his drug dealing.the car was used by him for drug dealing,guns are a regular accessory in drug dealing,and this one was wedged under the hood loaded and cocked where it could be retrieved with a single movement once the hood was popped open.see united states robinson,cir.his flight from the police and his locking the car and apparently tossing away the key supported the inference that drugs or guns here,both were knowingly concealed within.
this brings us to goncalves claim that the gun and powder cocaine obtained in the search of the lincoln should have been suppressed.suppression would have blocked both gun convictions and one of the drug counts,and it would have barred evidence,useful if not essential,for the other two drug counts.sullivan warrants covered the searches of the providence apartment and pawtucket house,but they did not include the vehicle.a search presumptively requires a warrant,maryland dyson,per curiam,but as usual there are exceptions actually,a great many of them.see generally lafave,search and seizure b,at ed.
in this case,the relevant exception is for searches of automobiles.reaching back to carroll united states,current law is that a search of a vehicle is not unreasonable if based on facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant,even though a warrant has not actually been obtained.united states ross.the question is whether probable cause exists to believe that a vehicle contains contraband or evidence of criminal activity.california acevedo,see also gant.at.
the district court held that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of drug dealing would be found in the car,which the police knew was regularly used by goncalves and had in fact been used for a prior drug delivery to the informant superintended by the authorities.further,sullivan had been told by the previously reliable informant that goncalves was selling crack in providence and pawtucket,possessed a handgun,and used the lincoln to make drug deliveries.the chase lent additional support but none is needed.
goncalves argues that even if the car interior were searchable,no probable cause justified searching the engine compartment and gas cap,where the handgun and cocaine were found.but i f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle,it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.wyoming.houghton,quoting ross,at,and adding emphasis.sullivan testified as to the use of such hiding places by drug dealers,and common sense would suggest this possibility anyway.
on appeal,goncalves for the first time makes new arguments for suppression not presented at the district court suppression hearing.these are forfeited,of course.b,e united states torres,cir,cert.denied,but the forfeiture may be forgiven where plain error exists under united states olano.see united states pierre,cir.
one new argument is that the police created a dangerous situation by allowing goncalves to drive off in the lincoln and so to flee at high speed when he sought to evade the police and that therefore the fruits of this tactic should be banned on public policy grounds.sullivan explained that,knowing from the informant that goncalves might be armed,the police thought it safer to block him in his car than to enter the providence apartment with goncalves inside.anyhow,courts are not in the business of suppressing evidence on generalized public policy grounds not required by the fourth amendment 
goncalves final new argument is the most serious one he argues that the automobile exception does not apply to a vehicle parked in a private driveway and unoccupied by anyone who might drive it away.this is a significant unresolved issue,primarily because,forty years ago,the supreme court held that the automobile exception did not justify the warrantless search of the defendant car parked in his own driveway.coolidge new hampshire.
just what to make of coolidge reach today is debatable.the court was fractured so there was no majority position on the driveway search issue,questions other than the carroll doctrine received primary attention,and most important the plurality opinion disallowance of the driveway search was highly,stressing circumstances that would easily distinguish our case.for example,the court stated 
in this case,the police had known for some time of the probable role of the pontiac car in the crime.coolidge was aware that he was a suspect in the mason murder,but he had been extremely cooperative throughout the investigation,and there was no indication that he meant to flee.he had already had ample opportunity to destroy any evidence he thought incriminating.there is no suggestion that,on the night in question,the car was being used for any illegal purpose,and it was regularly parked in the driveway of his house.the opportunity for search was thus hardly fleeting.the objects that the police are assumed to have had probable cause to search for in the car were neither stolen nor contraband nor dangerous.
coolidge,at emphasis added.
the contrast is striking between the case before us and the underlined points stressed in coolidge goncalves was far from cooperative,he did seek to flee,he had not had a chance to destroy or to remove the gun or drugs,his car was being used for the illegal purpose of transporting drugs and a concealed weapon,and the items being sought were both contraband and dangerous.
further,after coolidge,the court has distinguished between buildings and cars,emphasizing the significantly lesser expectation of privacy in the latter,south dakota opperman,based on the pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public highways,california carney.in various contexts,the court has been lenient in upholding searches under the automobile exception,pennsylvania labron,per curiam cardwell lewis,plurality opinion cady dombrowski.
finally,a number of circuits have upheld driveway searches with probable cause but no warrant three have squarely applied the automobile exception to permit searches of vehicles parked in the driveway of the defendant own residence while others including this one have permitted such searches of vehicles in private driveways that were not the defendant residence a few others have expressed doubts in light of coolidge,united states fields,cir,cert.denied,but no circuit appears to read coolidge as a per se rule against all driveway searches without a warrant.
here,it would be enough for us to uphold the search under the automobile exception on the grounds that goncalves had tried to flee with a car known to be used for carrying drugs,had been chased into a driveway,and then had fled so that probable cause certainly existed to believe that the car contained contraband and quite possibly a weapon.even if this were a close call,we are dealing with an unpreserved claim of error.there is certainly no plain error let alone anything remotely approaching the miscarriage of justice required under the olano standard.
the remaining issues on appeal concern goncalves sentence.at sentencing,the district court imposed concurrent sentences on each of the three drug counts,a,b a c,a concurrent sentence on the firearm count,g,and a consecutive sentence on the count charging gun possession in furtherance of a drug crime,id.c.thus,his current term of imprisonment is years.
our concern is with the count i sentence of twenty years imposed for the grams of crack stored in the providence apartment.at the time goncalves committed the crime,the governing federal statute,b a iii,imposed a mandatory minimum term for offenses involving over fifty grams of cocaine base a term that encompasses crack cocaine but the mandatory minimum increased to twenty years because goncalves had a prior felony drug conviction,and the government filed the necessary information,id.
goncalves was sentenced on march.on august,the president signed the fair sentencing act of the act or fsa,which reduced the mandatory minimums for specified drug crimes.under the act,the current mandatory minimum for grams of crack with a prior drug felony would be only ten years on the other two drug counts,no mandatory minimum would apply to goncalves violations.if the fsa governed here,goncalves could conceivably get a substantial reduction in sentence on remand.
the difficulty for goncalves lies with the general federal savings statute,which in pertinent part provides 
the repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty,forfeiture,or liability incurred under such statute,unless the repealing act shall so expressly provide,and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty,forfeiture,or liability.
section not only includes but was primarily enacted to cover criminal cases and to undo the rule abating prosecution upon the repeal of the statute.
incurred means to which one is subject not already imposed and so looks to the time of the conduct that makes the defendant liable rather than the date of conviction or imposition of sentence.united states reisinger,the savings statute clearly excepts offences committed before the passage of the repealing act.thus,if a new criminal statute supersedes an older one,conduct occurring under the superseded version can still be punished under the older version.this dovetails with ex post facto principles that allow the new statute to apply only to conduct.
congress can decide to narrow a statute so as to conduct or to lessen the penalty for illegal conduct occurring before the more lenient penalty was enacted.but,by the terms of the savings statute,the narrowed definition of the crime or the reduced penalty provided in the new statute benefits the defendant only where the repealing act shall so expressly provide,either in terms or by necessary implication.goncalves can point to no express provisions in the fsa that even arguably satisfy that test as to him 
goncalves argues that congress intent in the fsa is unclear because the act itself says nothing about the retroactivity issue,but this argument misses the point.the savings statute adopts a general rule that the penalty incurred is that provided by the statute in effect at the time of the conduct unless the superseding statute provides otherwise.section is not a presumption or indicator of subjective intent it is a binding rule that overturns abatement and governs the meaning that courts are to give to the superseding statute unless otherwise affirmatively directed.
the motivation for the fsa was to reduce the harshness of existing drug sentences,centrally by modifying the underlying ratio that punished quantities of cocaine base much more heavily than equivalent weights of powder cocaine.the legislative history of the fsa suggests that some who voted may have believed that the old ratio was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause and,were that true,the old ratio certainly could not be applied to persons who were convicted under prior law,at least if they were still to be sentenced or on direct appeal after sentencing.
but professions of individual legislators do not establish the view of congress,see garcia united states,still
