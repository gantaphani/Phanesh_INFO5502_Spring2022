direct award of federal grant to planned parenthood 
prior to,the department historically awarded title federal grants to new hampshire,which in turn dispersed a combination of federal and state funds through subgrants to various entities.title x federal grants assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services including natural family planning methods,infertility services,and services for adolescents.a.planned parenthood historically received one of these subgrants,including title x federal funds,from new hampshire.as of july,planned parenthood operated clinics in six different new hampshire municipalities manchester,derry,keene,exeter,west lebanon,and claremont.
in june,the new hampshire executive council chose not to award any subgrant to planned parenthood,expressing concern that taxpayer funds were being used to subsidize abortions new hampshire decision meant that unless a new provider received the funds,large portions of the state would no longer have access to title x services.in july,the department asked new hampshire for information on how it would ensure continued provision of title x services in areas previously served by planned parenthood.in,the new hampshire department of health and human services informed the department that they could not find a replacement provider for those areas.new hampshire then relinquished what would have been planned parenthood portion of the federal funds.
the department considered alternative options,including bypassing new hampshire executive council,and directly awarding title x funds to planned parenthood.on august,marilyn keefe,the deputy assistant secretary of the department office of population affairs opa,signed a memorandum titled,sole source justification for replacement grant in new hampshire.this memorandum request ed approval from the department office of the assistant secretary of health oash of a sole source replacement grant to planned parenthood for a period of months.the memorandum noted an urgent need to reinstate services in the affected areas with an experienced provider that is familiar with the provision of title x family planning services and applicable laws and has a history of successfully providing services in this area of the state.the memorandum explained that,upon approval of its recommendation,the opa will reach out to the proposed replacement grantee to determine if the organization is willing to take on this project as a directly funded federal grantee.the memorandum also stated that t he director of the oash grants management office has consulted with the office of the general counsel,which has determined that the use of the replacement grant process is legally justified in this case.the oash executive officer approved the opa recommendation by countersigning the memorandum on that very same day august.
on september,planned parenthood applied for the direct award grant.the department then prepared a technical review document,evaluating planned parenthood application.on september,the department announced,via its website,its intent to directly issue a replacement grant to planned parenthood.on september,the department formally provided a notice of grant award to planned parenthood.the notice required planned parenthood to submit to the department,by december,additional institutional files on a variety of policies and procedures.responding to this notice,planned parenthood submitted its manual of medical standards and guidelines manual as well as information on its fee schedule and personnel policies.
right to life foia challenge and district court decision 
on december,right to life filed a lawsuit under the foia,seeking documents related to the department decision to proceed with a direct award process,documents that planned parenthood submitted as part of its grant application,and documents related to the department decision to award that grant to planned parenthood.after being sued,the department released more than pages of documents.the department determined that some portions of the manual were exempt from disclosure under the foia,but intended to release the remainder,and so informed planned parenthood.planned parenthood responded by arguing that its entire manual constituted confidential commercial information,and thus was exempt from disclosure under the foia.see b.the department rejected this argument.planned parenthood countered by commencing an action in district court,seeking to enjoin the department from releasing any portion of the manual.
the district court remanded the matter to the department to reconsider its foia determination in light of additional information provided by planned parenthood about specific portions of the m anual,and produce a more comprehensive explanation for any determination that portions of the m anual are subject to disclosure despite planned parenthood objections.upon reconsideration,the department decided to withhold or redact additional portions of the manual.the department also continued to withhold various other documents or portions of documents,invoking foia exemptions,and.the department gave right to life a vaughn index,correlating withheld documents to particular foia exemptions right to life and the department then filed cross motions for summary judgment,see,to determine whether the department properly invoked these foia exemptions.
the district court partially granted and partially denied both parties motions for summary judgment.the district court found that the vast majority of documents were properly withheld under foia exemptions,but that the department did not meet its burden to justify withholding a few categories of documents.the district court found that exemption applied to the manual,the letter describing the manual standards and guidelines,the fees and collections policies,and a document titled steps in establishing our fee schedule.
the district court found that exemption applied to an chain between department employees and attorneys relating to the legality of the direct award process,an chain about the rationale for the replacement grant funding amount,and multiple drafts of a public announcement of the assistant secretary intent to issue a replacement grant to planned parenthood.the district court also found that the department met its burden for invoking the and work product privileges,as recognized by exemption,for various documents.

planned parenthood documents 
the department invokes exemption to prevent disclosing portions of the manual,a letter describing the manual,the fees and collections policies,and a document titled steps in establishing our fee schedule.in order to properly invoke exemption,the department must demonstrate that the information it seeks to protect is both commercial and confidential see id.b.the foia does not define the term commercial,so courts have given the term its ordinary meaning.see pub.citizen health research grp.food drug,am.airlines,mediation,cir noting that commercial in the foia context surely means pertaining or relating to or dealing with commerce.commercial information is confidential if disclosure is likely to impair the government ability to obtain necessary information in the future or to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.to org.for women office workers board of governors,cir quoting parks conservation ass morton,d.cir footnote omitted 
right to life makes two arguments for why exemption does not apply to the requested information planned parenthood,as a,can not possess commercial information and even if planned parenthood can possess commercial information,disclosure of the requested information poses no likelihood of substantial harm to planned parenthood competitive position.
may possess commercial information.
right to life argues that because planned parenthood is a organization,it can not be said to possess commercial information within the meaning of exemption.we disagree.if accepted,this argument would amount to a per se exclusion of nonprofit entities from protection under exemption.neither the language of the statute nor common sense lean in right to life favor here.the term commercial as used in the statute modifies information and not the entity supplying the information.see b.all sorts of hospitals,colleges,and even the national football league engage in commerce as that term is ordinarily understood.how the tax code treats income from that commerce is a separate issue that has no bearing on our inquiry here.
apart from arguing that can not possess commercial information,right to life does not claim that the information in the documents is somehow not otherwise commercial these documents the manual,the letter describing the manual,the fees and collections policies,and the steps in establishing our fee schedule document outline planned parenthood operations and fees.that is to say,they outline the amounts planned parenthood charges customers for its services,and how it produces those services for sale.these documents thus surely pertain or relate to commerce as that term is ordinarily understood.see,pub.citizen health research,at.
the subject documents are confidential.
we turn now to the question of whether this undoubtedly commercial information is also confidential under foia exemption.see to,at b.commercial information is confidential under exemption if disclosure is likely to either impair the government ability to obtain necessary information in the future or cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.to,at quoting parks,at.the department is not arguing the first prong.when evaluating the second prong,the court need not conduct a sophisticated economic analysis of the likely effects of disclosure.pub.citizen health research,at.but c onclusory or generalized allegations will not suffice.id.parties opposing disclosure need not demonstrate actual competitive harm instead,they need only show actual competition and a likelihood of substantial competitive injury in order to bring that commercial information within the realm of confidentiality.accord sharkey food drug,app x,cir lion raisins united states dep t of,cir utah united states dep t of interior,cir natural res.def.council,united states dep t of interior,civ.pae,wl,at.
for the purposes of awarding the grant in,both new hampshire and the department determined that planned parenthood was the only title x provider in the region.right to life contends that the department can not change positions and now argue against disclosure on the ground that planned parenthood would likely face substantial competitive harm.
right to life view of actual competition is myopic,focusing only on the,grant process that took place in.the district court aptly noted that planned parenthood faces plenty of competition from other entities for patients.many of planned parenthood services are also provided by hospitals and health clinics.further,the title x grant process in new hampshire will be open to other bids in the future.even in,a potential competitor the manchester community health center requested information from the department about applying for the same grant.although planned parenthood admittedly did not compete for the federal grant in,it certainly does face actual competitors community health clinics in a number of different arenas,and in future title x bids.this satisfies the actual competition requirement.see,utah,at.
having established that the documents contain commercial information,and that planned parenthood faces actual competition in a variety of contexts,we turn to the specific documents right to life wants disclosed,and whether disclosure of those documents would likely cause substantial competitive harm to planned parenthood 
the manual,and thus the letter that describes it,provides a model for operating a family planning clinic and for providing services consistent with planned parenthood unique model of care.the national medical committee of planned parenthood federation of america developed the manual,in collaboration with local affiliate chapters,like the northern new england branch.planned parenthood treated these documents as confidential information not generally available to the public.a potential future competitor could take advantage of the institutional knowledge contained in the manual,and the letter describing the manual,to compete with planned parenthood for patients,grants,or other funding.we therefore agree with the district court that the department met its burden for invoking exemption for the manual and medical standards,and the letter containing descriptions of the same vaughn index categories and.
the fees and collections policies and the steps in establishing our fee schedule documents contain information that identifies cost differentials between services,identifies all services provided,and sets forth the fee scale.planned parenthood treated these documents as confidential information not generally available to the public.pricing information like that contained in these documents is undoubtedly valuable information for competitors.nor is there any suggestion that competitors have access to this information other than perhaps anecdotally and incompletely.we th
