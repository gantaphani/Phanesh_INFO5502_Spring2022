awni shauaib zayyad was convicted of five felony counts relating to the sale of counterfeit prescription drugs.on appeal,zayyad raises two assignments of error.first,he contends that the district court erred in denying his attempts to introduce certain evidence about a gray market for prescription pills.second,zayyad argues that the government never established that he knew that the pills that he sold were counterfeit.
we affirm the judgment of the district court,as neither of zayyad arguments have merit.the district court appropriately limited zayyad evidence,and the government offered sufficient evidence of his knowledge that he sold counterfeit pills.
essam elasmar ran a counterfeit drug operation through his convenience store in charlotte,north carolina,where he peddled drugs that looked like viagra and cialis.unfortunately for elasmar,his illicit drug business ended when he sold an undercover department of homeland security dhs agent three bulk counterfeit drug orders.after a search following the drug buys found several hundred pills,elasmar agreed to cooperate with investigators.
elasmar turned over his supplier telephone number,which dhs traced to zayyad.then,at the authorities behest,elasmar twice ordered drugs from zayyad.in the first buy,elasmar bought viagra pills for a pill,a price well below wholesale.about a month later,dhs had elasmar place a second order this time for both viagra and cialis for pills at a pill.
when zayyad delivered the second batch of pills to elasmar,police detained him and discovered more than pills in the glove box and sunglasses holder of zayyad van.one set of pills was concealed in a brown paper bag,while another set was wrapped in a blue paper towel all were in plastic bags.the pills had the outward appearance of a genuine viagra or cialis pill,but they lacked any prescriptions,prescription bottles,product literature,lot numbers,or invoices.zayyad admitted to law enforcement that he had planned to resell hundreds of the pills to someone in charlotte,but refused to identify who supplied them to him in the first place.
police visited zayyad house on the same day as the traffic stop.when a woman answered the door,agents asked for permission to search the home.the woman consented,but only after she closed the door,stayed inside for ten minutes,and came back wearing a damp shirt.perhaps alerted by the woman wet clothing,agents searched a bathroom near the front of the house,finding a yellowish pill on the rim of a toilet equipped with an industrial strength flushing system.
as noted,some of the pills seized from zayyad van and home looked similar to genuine viagra and cialis pills,with the same shapes,colors,and imprints as genuine pills.but other pills did not have the right color tone,shape,or embossing.notwithstanding outward appearances,chemical analyses showed that the pills contained incorrect compositions and levels many of the counterfeit cialis pills also incorrectly contained the active ingredient of viagra.at trial,specialists from the food and drug administration,pfizer,and eli lilly testified that all the pills that they sampled were counterfeit.
a grand jury in the western district of north carolina initially indicted zayyad on seven counts one count of conspiracy to traffic in and dispense counterfeit drug products,three counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods,and three counts of selling and dispensing counterfeit prescription drugs.
at zayyad trial in december,the government relied principally on the nature of the transactions unpackaged pills from an illegitimate source to show that zayyad knew that the pills that he sold were fake.for his part,zayyad tried to suggest through that he believed the pills came from the gray market.in particular,zayyad government witnesses from pfizer,eli lilly,and dhs who conceded that pfizer and eli lilly manufactured and sold viagra and cialis abroad at cheaper prices.they also admitted that persons sometimes import pills into the united states.in addition,evidence at the first trial showed that zayyad told elasmar that the pills were real no evidence indicated that zayyad had ever said the pills were fake.
after the jury began deliberating,it asked the district court whether knowing that the pills were counterfeit was a requirement of the charge of violation in counts two through seven.the court reiterated that the offenses did include a knowledge element.the jury then deliberated further before announcing that it had deadlocked.a modified charge failed to break the deadlock,and the district court declared a mistrial.
after the mistrial,the grand jury issued a superseding indictment that narrowed the conspiracy count scope and eliminated two counts.the new indictment contained a conspiracy count,two counts of trafficking in counterfeit goods,and two counts of selling and dispensing prescription drugs.
before the second trial,the government moved to preclude zayyad from attempting to raise during the government,through or otherwise,any evidence or argument regarding an alleged diversion market or grey market for genuine,prescription medications.the government represented to the district court that the evidence would only be relevant if,for instance,the defendant were to testify during the defense case regarding his state of mind,that is,that he believed the viagra and cialis pills he sold were genuine pills from a specific diversion market or grey market channel.
zayyad responded that he should be permitted to use gray goods evidence to establish an affirmative defense,namely that the purported viagra and cialis pills at issue are gray goods.put differently,zayyad wanted to use evidence establishing a gray market for prescription pills to argue that some of the pills that police seized from him could be genuine.he contended that the vast majority of the more than purported counterfeit viagra and cialis tablets at issue ha d never been authenticated.and he argued that the government approach would impair his sixth amendment rights to confrontation and fifth amendment due process rights by forcing him to testify.
the district court granted the government motion in limine and determined the issue was not relevant under federal rule of evidence,as there was no evidence that shows that the defendant possessed any genuine pills.in addition,the court excluded the evidence under federal rule of evidence,concluding that concerns about confusion of the issues,misleading the jury,and considerations of waste of time would overwhelm the evidence probative value.
at the second trial,the government presented much the same basic evidence of zayyad knowledge as in the first trial he sold the pills cheaply,kept them in plastic bags,and made them available without a prescription.in response,defense counsel argued that zayyad intent was to sell real viagra and cialis,and there no evidence in this trial to the contrary.further,zayyad maintained that i t would take a forensic chemist,pharmacist,or some other person trained to look at any pill and be able to know that it counterfeit on sight.
upon closure of the evidence,zayyad moved for a judgment of acquittal,which the district court denied.the jury then convicted zayyad on all counts,and the district court sentenced him to months in prison.zayyad timely appeals,and we have jurisdiction under.
zayyad first argues that the district court erred in precluding him from introducing evidence about a gray market or diversion market in viagra and cialis pills.that evidence,zayyad contends,was relevant because it could have established that he reasonably believed that he dispensed real prescription drugs.he separately argues that the district court could not exclude the evidence under rule of evidence because it substantiated a central part of his case.
we note at the outset that zayyad frames his argument too broadly.the district court did not preclude zayyad from introducing all evidence concerning a gray market.the government motion in limine only requested a limit on,and the district court order granted that motion in limine.at oral argument,counsel for zayyad suggested that it would have been futile to try to introduce evidence during the defendant given the court ruling on the motion in limine.but zayyad never tried to introduce any evidence during his,never raised the possibility of doing so,and never made any proffer regarding evidence to the district court.therefore,we treat the district court order as what it was a limit on zayyad right to and nothing more.
before considering the merits of zayyad claims,we first examine the appropriate standard of review.
normally,w e review for abuse of discretion a trial court limitations on a defendant of a prosecution witness.united states ramos cruz,cir see also united states leeson,cir we review a district court ruling on the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.a district court abuses its discretion by resting its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact,or by misapprehending the law with respect to underlying issues in litigation.scott family dollar stores,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the initial question is whether this standard applies because zayyad preserved his present argument or whether the standard applies because he did not.see united states jones,cir we generally limit our review of claims not properly preserved in the district court to plain error.
to preserve an argument on appeal,the defendant must object on the same basis below as he contends is error on appeal.because he must state the specific ground upon which he objects below.a,an objection on one ground does not preserve objections on different grounds on appeal,united states massenburg,cir.so,even if a defendant invokes the same rule in both instances,he may still waive his claim if he fashioned his argument differently.see,united states pratt,cir reviewing for plain error where defendant objected below to use of statements under federal rule of evidence d e but pressed different aspect of the same rule on appeal.
we agree with the government that zayyad likely did not preserve his present argument below.before the district court,zayyad argued that evidence could raise doubts as to whether the pills were in fact counterfeit.indeed,even after the district court ruled on the motion in limine regarding,defense counsel stressed again that the evidence went to whether the pills were counterfeit.zayyad never raised any argument that the evidence went to show his knowledge that the pills were items.yet this argument is the claim that he makes on appeal and that it appears he did not preserve in the district court.
nonetheless,we need not decide that issue.even if we assume that zayyad preserved the argument that he now makes,it fails under the standard.see,united states palacios,cir assuming that defendant preserved evidentiary objections where arguments failed even under preserved error standard.
district courts may place limitations upon the of witnesses.united states janati,cir.they may impose these limits based on concerns including harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,repetition,or marginal relevance.united states turner,cir.they enjoy wide latitude in doing so.id.
the district court did not allow zayyad to government witnesses on the gray market in part because the court determined that such testimony would be irrelevant.a defendant can only a prosecution witness if the information sought to be elicited is relevant.united states maxwell,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also.irrelevant evidence is not admissible.we deem evidence relevant only if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.although this threshold for relevancy is relatively low,united states powers,cir,we rarely reverse relevancy decisions because they are fundamentally a matter of trial management,united states benkahla,cir.
zayyad contends that his would have been relevant to his principal defense that he did not know that he was peddling counterfeit pills.and indeed,both charged substantive offenses include a knowledge element.to obtain a conviction under a for using a counterfeit mark,the g overnment was required to prove that zayyad knew the mark on the pills was counterfeit.united states chong lam,cir.likewise,because the felony offense of dispensing counterfeit drugs requires that the defendant act with intent to defraud or mislead,a,the defendant must at least have knowledge that his drugs are mislabeled.see,united states vitek supply,cir to act with this intent to defraud or mislead,defendants must have had knowledge of the essential nature of the alleged fraud.internal quotation marks omitted.
but zayyad proposed was irrelevant because it did not connect to the knowledge element of the charged offenses.unless there is a connection between the external facts and the defendant state of mind,the evidence of the external facts is not relevant.united states curtis,cir.zayyad never suggested through his own testimony,testimony from other witnesses,documentary evidence,proffer,or otherwise that he believed he was selling drugs.nor did he establish his own awareness of the gray market.
we have previously recognized that a defendant can not distract the jury by introducing evidence concerning a potential defense that he never raised.relevance,after all,must be determined in relation to the charges and claims being tried,rather than in the context of defenses which might have been raised but were not.united states hedgepeth,cir.if the defendant wants to present a theory or belief that might have justified his actions,then he must present evidence that he in fact relied on that theory or belief.see,united states kokenis,cir the defendant offered no evidence that he actually relied on the pooling capital theory,so testimony about the theory would be irrelevant,confusing,and perhaps even misleading.havee belk,cir holding that account summary could not be used to prove the knowledge of debtor and transferees,where record contained no evidence that debtor or transferees saw the summary.otherwise,a defendant could introduce evidence that would invite the jury to speculate a defense into existence.
as the government notes,we often see these principles applied in tax evasion cases.in one such case,we affirmed a district court decision to limit that purportedly went to the defendants knowledge.see united states jinwright,cir.the defendants there wanted to lay witnesses concerning the witnesses beliefs that certain payments were gifts.id.but because the defendants did not establish that they relied on such a belief,we deemed the evidence irrelevant.accord united states powell,cir united states harris,cir see also united states dynalectric,cir upholding district court exclusion of evidence of economic conditions as irrelevant in case,where defendants were not shown to have relied on those conditions in making bid.just as in that case and the many cases like it,the record before us contains no evidence of any actual reliance on zayyad part that would justify the use of the explanatory evidence.the district court did not err in barring regarding that evidence,where there was no connection to the knowledge element and consequently no relevance.
zayyad objects that forcing him to summon other evidence in support of his contention raises constitutional concerns.he insists that we should not force him to waive his constitutional right not to testify before allowing him to present otherwise relevant evidence.
at bottom,zayyad complains of the burdens of presenting his chosen defense.a defendant may struggle with how to attack an element that involves his own state of mind,particularly when he lacks contemporaneous evidence of that state of mind.but a defendant rights would not be violated simply because he had to choose between not testifying and laying the required foundation.kokenis,at.evidence by its nature builds pressure to rebut it that what the adversary system is about.that the defendant faces a dilemma demanding a choice between complete silence and presenting a defense has never been thought an invasion of the privilege against compelled.united states kelly,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitte
