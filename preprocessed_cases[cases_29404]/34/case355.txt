after a trial,appellants emilio and geraldo were convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute certain narcotics as part of a drug point operating in the aristedes chavier public housing project in ponce,puerto rico see a,b a.was sentenced to a term of imprisonment,and was sentenced to a term.in this consolidated appeal,raises several challenges to his sentence,and argues that the cumulative effect of a number of trial errors requires a new trial.we affirm in all respects.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states,cir.
between november and november,approximately six drug points operated at the aristedes chavier housing project.appellant was in charge of one of the drug points,and appellant was a runner at that point,although he also sold drugs on occasion.drug point operated every day of the year,from or until,and had a large number of customers daily.the drug point sold cocaine base as well as other narcotics.
at trial,two government informants testified as to controlled purchases they had made from drug point,and the court admitted into evidence the audio recordings of those purchases.angélica,a lifelong resident of the housing project,testified that she had seen appellants selling drugs to others behind her house in the housing project.she stated that she had known appellants her entire life,although on,she clarified that she had known for three years.she began cooperating with the dea in early,and on february,she made a controlled drug purchase of six large packages,each of which contained to individual packages of cocaine base.although she and the seller,sergio martínez,had agreed the previous day that she would purchase fifteen large packages,he had only four packages available on february.martínez then called appellant to see whether had any additional drugs,and later that day brought two more packages of cocaine base.the parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the february transaction was grams.
another resident of the housing project,javier,had grown up with and had known him for most of his life,and had known for more than fifteen years.sold heroin and crack at drug point in the fall of,during which time also acted as a drug runner and seller.began cooperating with the dea in,and,on april,he made a controlled purchase of fifteen packets of heroin on may,made a purchase of eight packets of cocaine base from,whom he identified as one of sellers.was also present at this purchase,and the witness identified both and on the audio recording of the purchase.the parties stipulated that the net weight of the cocaine base purchased in the may transaction was grams.
the government also presented the testimony of eddie,a puerto rico police department agent in charge of the investigation conducted at the housing project.the district court accepted agent as an expert on drug trafficking.testified that drug point sold cocaine base in small plastic bags,each with a net weight of grams.he further testified,over defense counsel objection,as to the quantity of drugs sold during his surveillance of the drug point 
q okay.and during the times that you actually performed surveillance at the defendants drug point,how many buys of those little baggies did you see occur during the time period that you were looking at the drug point 
a well,so many that i could really count them.i would say in a period of minutes or half an hour that i would be surveilling the drug point,many more than,of these small bags containing crack would be sold in that period of time.
the jury found appellants guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and detectable amounts of cocaine and heroin in the housing project,within feet of a public school.see a,b a.at sentencing,the district court found accountable for in excess of kilograms of cocaine base,and sentenced him to a prison term of months.in a separate sentencing proceeding,the court found accountable for in excess of kilograms of cocaine base,and sentenced him to a term.
on appeal,challenges his sentence,and contends that his conviction should be reversed.we address each appellant claims in turn.
presentence investigation report psr recommended that he be held accountable for approximately six kilograms of cocaine base over a period.the psr did not explain how it reached this determination,but instead merely stated that the finding was based on the evidence presented at trial,and the testimony of drug expert eddie vidal.
filed objections to the psr,contending that the finding was incorrect because it was based on unreliable expert witness testimony from agent.at the sentencing hearing,after argument from counsel on this point,the district court adopted the psr recommendation and found that was responsible for in excess of kilograms of crack cocaine.like the psr,the district court did not explain how it reached its determination,but instead simply stated that its finding was based on the evidence presented at trial.
based on the finding that was responsible for in excess of kilograms of cocaine base,the district court assigned him a base offense level of.c.the court applied a enhancement because the offense was committed in a protected location,a,and a enhancement because was a leader in the criminal activity,b,for a total offense level of.combined with a criminal history category of i,this offense level resulted in a guidelines imprisonment range of months to life,and the court sentenced to a prison term of months.
calculating drug quantity 
under the sentencing guidelines,the base offense level largely depends upon the total drug quantities involved in the offense.c.if the quantity of drugs seized does not accurately reflect the scale of a conspiracy,the district court must approximate the total quantity of the controlled substance,cmt.because was convicted of conspiring to distribute controlled substances,he is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.united states santos,cir.
a district court finding as to drug quantity need only be by a preponderance of the evidence and is not required to be an exact determination but rather only a reasoned estimate.rodríguez,at see also united states laboy,cir holding that when it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes,a reasoned estimate will suffice.the sentencing court has broad discretion in determining which data are sufficiently dependable for sentencing purposes.united states,cir.although the court may rely on reasonable estimates and averages to reach its determination,those estimates must possess adequate indicia of reliability and demonstrable record support.id.at.we can not uphold a drug quantity calculation on the basis of hunch or intuition.united states,cir.
we review the district court factual finding as to drug quantity for clear error.rodríguez,at.in reviewing the court finding,our task is to determine whether the government presented sufficient reliable information to permit the court reasonably to conclude that was responsible for a quantity of drugs at least equal to the quantity threshold for the assigned base offense level.united states barnett,cir see also united states,cir holding that if a district court makes an erroneous factual finding under the sentencing guidelines,yet there is enough evidence to support the alternative explanation for the court finding,the error would be harmless and there would be no reason to remand to the district court when the result will be the same.
challenge to the determination 
argues that the district court erroneously found that he was individually responsible for more than kilograms of cocaine base.relatedly,he challenges the admission of agent testimony,which he claims provided the basis for the court determination.he argues that testimony was unreliable and not based on recognized scientific techniques,and therefore was improperly admitted as expert testimony.the government responds that,even if testimony was unreliable,an alternate calculation based on the stipulated quantities of cocaine base purchased in two controlled transactions adequately supports the district court kilogram finding.we agree with the government contention.because we conclude that the district court determination is sufficiently supported by reliable evidence independent of testimony,we need not reach the question of whether the district court erred in admitting testimony.see barnett,at see also,at.
at trial,the parties stipulated to the quantity of cocaine base recovered from each of two controlled purchases on february,purchased cocaine base with a net weight of grams,and on may,purchased cocaine base with a net weight of grams these controlled purchases were recorded on audio tape,and the audio recordings were admitted as evidence at trial.according to the testimony of and,residents of the housing project,was in charge of the drug point and was involved in the conspiracy from november until november.the drug point operated for at least sixteen hours every day,and a large number of people visited the drug point daily.
based on this evidence,it is reasonable to conclude that,over the course of the conspiracy,drug point made at least one cocaine base sale per day in an amount comparable to the controlled purchases.using the smaller controlled purchase of grams as a sample,kilograms of cocaine base are reasonably attributable to over the conspiracy grams of cocaine base sold per day,multiplied by days per year.using the larger controlled purchase of grams,he is accountable for kilograms grams of cocaine base sold per day,multiplied by days per year.even the more conservative estimate of kilograms is significantly more than the kilograms of cocaine base attributed to by the district court.the court finding as to drug quantity was not a mere hunch or intuition,see,at,but was a reasoned estimate based on reliable evidence in the record.see rodríguez,at.
relying on our decision in,contends that the quantity of drugs purchased in the two controlled buys does not provide a reasonable basis for the district court kilogram finding,and asserts that any estimate of drug quantity based on these two buys would not have been arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.we disagree.
in,we recognized that g enerally speaking,the smaller the sampling,the less reliable the resulting probability estimate,and an estimate of drug quantity may be unreliable if based on an extrapolation from too small a sample.id.at.we held that it was improper for the sentencing court to estimate the average drug transaction size using a very small sample of controlled buys over the course of a investigation.id.at.the sampling in that case was minuscule,twelve controlled buys drawn from a set of transactions transactions per hour,times hours per day,times days,and there was no evidence that the twelve controlled buys were representative of ordinary drug transactions at the drug point.id.at.furthermore,the other estimates upon which the total finding was based,including the average number of transactions per hour and average operating hours per day,were also unreliable,and therefore the risk of error was compounded by pyramiding unreliable inferences.id.at.we concluded that the sentencing court determination was not based on sufficiently reliable information,and remanded the case for resentencing.id.at see also united states culps,cir holding that an estimate of average drug quantity for transactions based on nine controlled buys was statistically and legally unreliable united states butler,cir rejecting an estimate of drug transactions per day based solely on a videotape of transactions occurring on a single day,where there was no evidence that single day was typical or average.
in this case,however,the sample used for calculating average drug transaction size is proportionately much larger,and therefore more reliable,than in two controlled buys drawn from a set of transactions one per day for a year,rather than twelve buys drawn from transactions.furthermore,unlike in,the other estimates upon which the total finding is based are reliable,even conservative.the estimate of one transaction per day,or transactions per year,is highly conservative in light of testimony that the drug point operated for sixteen to seventeen hours per day,days per year,and had a large number of customers daily.the district court ultimate finding that was accountable for in excess of kilograms of cocaine base is likewise conservative,given that even calculations based on the smaller of the two controlled buys would yield a figure of kilograms.the court finding,although not an exact determination of drug quantity,see rodríguez,at,is a reasonable estimate with demonstrable record support and adequate indicia of reliability.see,at 
in sum,because there is clear record support for the district court finding that was accountable for more than kilograms of cocaine base during the charged conspiracy,we affirm the sentence imposed.
contends that the cumulative effect of several errors requires a new trial.we disagree and affirm his conviction.
voice identification expert 
principal argument is that the district court erred in denying his request to retain a voice identification expert and his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert presence at trial.we review a denial of a request to fund expert services for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.the denial of a continuance is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.
prior to trial,upon defense counsel request,the district court ordered that the defendants and their counsel be permitted to listen on march,to the audio recordings of the controlled purchases.nearly two months later,on april,and other defendants filed a motion to continue the trial date set for may,citing ongoing investigations and plea negotiations.on may,submitted a sealed,ex parte motion requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert,asserting that it was not his voice on the incriminating audio recordings,and the only way he could present a defense against the evidence contained in the audio recordings was through such an expert.two days later,in an order denying the april motion for continuance of trial,the court referenced,but did not expressly rule on,ex parte request for a voice identification expert furthermore,defendants counsel listened to the united states evidence on march,and only now request s an expert on voice identification.
renewed his request for a voice identification expert in a second sealed ex parte motion on may.the following day,the court issued sealed orders denying both ex parte motions without prejudice pending completion of the government case in chief.the district court did not further explain the basis for its denial.on may,the day trial was scheduled to start,filed a motion again requesting funds to retain a voice identification expert and a continuance to ensure the expert availability for trial.the court orally denied the motion.at trial,audio recordings of the february purchase by government witness and the april and may purchases by government witness were admitted into evidence over defense counsel objections.
as an indigent,was entitled to the benefits of the criminal justice act cja.the cja provides that a person who is financially unable to obtain expert services necessary for an adequate defense may obtain them after demonstrating in an ex parte hearing that such services are necessary.e.generally,expert services have been found necessary when the proffered expert testimony was pivotal to the indigent defendant defense.united states manning,cir.for example,courts have appointed a fingerprint expert when a fingerprint,alleged to be the defendant,was the primary means of connecting the defendant to the crime,and a psychiatrist when the defendant sanity at the time of the offense was at issue.id.internal citations omitted.
we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court denial of ex parte motion for funds to retain a voice identification expert,or his related motion for a continuance to secure that expert presence at trial.proffered expert testimony was not pivotal to his defense.the audio recordings were not the primary means of connecting to the crime,see,but instead merely served as corroboration for the ample eyewitness testimony that had acted as a runner and seller for the drug point.
testified that she had known for three years,and had seen him acting as the runner at the drug point and selling drugs to others behind her house.she further testified that during the february controlled transaction,the seller,martínez,called to see whether he had any additional drugs,and brought her two more packages of cocaine base later that day.testified that he had known for more than fifteen years,and had sold drugs at drug point in late,during which time also worked as a drug runner and seller.also testified that he purchased cocaine base directly from in the may controlled transaction.in light of this eyewitness testimony,none of which depended on identification of voice on the audio recordings,the voice identification expert services were not critical or necessary to his defense.
moreover,as the district court noted,counsel had the opportunity to listen to the audio recordings at issue on march,but did not request a continuance until april and did not request funds to retain a voice identification expert until may,less than two weeks before his trial was scheduled to begin.contends on appeal,as he did in his motion to the district court,that his requests were delayed because he spent weeks trying to locate a voice identification expert available to come to puerto rico.however,he does not explain why he could not have made his requests for expert services and for a continuance prior to locating an available expert,and the district court could reasonably have found that the requests were unreasonably dilatory.in light of these facts,we can not conclude that the court abused its discretion in denying requests for a continuance and for funds to retain the proffered expert.
further contends that the district court erred in disclosing his ex parte request for a voice identification expert in its may,denial of his motion for a continuance.the government correctly concedes error on this point.see united states abreu,cir holding that district court erred in not handling entire application for expert services under e on an ex parte basis,and explaining that the manifest purpose of requiring that the inquiry be ex parte is to insure that the defendant will not have to make a premature disclosure of his case internal quotation marks omitted.however,voice identification was not pivotal to defense.even absent the audio recordings,the government presented overwhelming evidence of his guilt.therefore,we find that the court error in not handling his expert request on an ex parte basis was harmless.
alleged discovery violations 
further contends that the district court failed to remedy two alleged discovery violations by the government.
disclosure of photograph 
first,contends that the court erred in not ordering the government to produce a photograph shown to prior to trial,which he argues was subject to disclosure under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.we review the court determination under rule for abuse of discretion.united states,cir.we find no such abuse here.
testified that she had personally identified both defendants to dea agents while she and the agents were riding in an undercover car,and she had later identified in a photograph shown to her by dea agents.objected on the ground that,during discovery,he had asked the prosecution for information about any identification procedures used in the investigation,such as photographic,and the government had responded that no such procedures had occurred.contended that the government should have disclosed the photograph during discovery so that he could about her identification,and requested that the court order production of the photograph.the government argued that the photograph was irrelevant because knew from personal interactions,and did not identify him based on the photograph.the court denied request,accepting the government assertion that the photograph was not the basis for her identification of because she knew him personally.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order production of the pretrial photograph.rule requires disclosure of documents and objects within the government possession,custody or control upon a defendant request if i the item is material to preparing the defense ii the government intends to use the item in its at trial or iii the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.a e.contends that the photograph was material to his defense because it could have been used during of and could have formed the basis for a pretrial motion to suppress the reliability of her identification.however,nothing in the record indicates that identified on the basis of the photograph.to the contrary,she testified that she had known for three years and purchased drugs from him,and that,before being shown the photograph,she had identified him while riding in an undercover car with dea agents.thus,the photograph was not material and the government was not required to disclose it.
disclosure of audio recording 
contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a mistrial based on the government alleged failure to produce the april,audio recording during pretrial discovery.we review the court denial of a mistrial motion for a manifest abuse of discretion.united states van anh,cir.
at trial,after the audio recording of april controlled purchase was played for the jury,defense counsel moved for a mistrial,claiming that he had not received the recording during discovery.he stated that during pretrial discovery he had received a recording marked april along with a transcript,but the recording was inaudible.he then requested and received a second copy of the recording and transcript from the government,also marked april,but he claimed that this was not the recording played at trial.the government maintained that it had provided defense counsel with copies of the april recording and the transcript on two occasions well in advance of trial,and defense counsel should have notified the government if the recording did not match the transcript.the district court then listened to the recording at issue and denied motion,explaining that whatever the cd was mean,it was easily determined that was the proper cd by just looking at the transcript.
we find no abuse of discretion in the court ruling.the court reasonably concluded that,even if the incorrect recording was mistakenly provided,defense counsel could have easily discovered the error and requested the correct recording from the government.moreover,has not shown that he was prejudiced by the government alleged failure to produce the correct recording prior to trial.see united states devin,cir i n cases of delayed disclosure,a court principal concern must be whether learning the information altered the subsequent defense strategy,and whether,given timeous disclosure,a more effective strategy would likely have resulted.he contends that the government alleged discovery failure caused him to rely on the wrong trial strategy,because his strategy was to obtain suppression of the april recording because it was inaudible and therefore inadmissible.he further claims that if he had received the correct recording prior to trial,he might have accepted the government plea offer,since the strategy of having the tape excluded on inaudibility grounds would have been foreclosed.
claims of prejudice are not plausible.defense counsel conceded to the district court that after receiving the first recording,which he claimed was inaudible,he requested and received a second copy of the recording from the government.he did not claim that this second recording was inaudible instead,he conceded that he listened to the recording and understood that this transcript was not really right,that you could not really could not really hear what is in the transcript.in addition,defense counsel was permitted to listen to the government
