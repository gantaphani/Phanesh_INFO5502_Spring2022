this appeal addresses whether the joinder of defendants under federal rule of criminal procedure b rule b is proper when the overwhelming evidence presented at trial concerned proof of a conspiracy that involved some,but not all,of the named defendants.because the indictment alleged the existence of two conspiracies that shared a common plan or scheme and a substantial identity of facts or participants,we hold that joinder was permissible under rule b.we further hold that,in light of the relatively straightforward nature of the evidence at issue and the district court careful limiting instructions to the jury,defendants victor wexler and douglas brandon failed to meet the heavy burden of persuasion to reverse a trial court decision not to grant severance under federal rule of criminal procedure rule.
this appeal also raises an issue of whether the government violated brady maryland,d,when it failed to produce arguably exculpatory evidence with respect to brandon until the week of trial.although the government should have disclosed this evidence sooner,there is no reasonable probability that the delay affected the outcome of the case so as to require reversal of brandon conviction.we therefore affirm the defendants convictions 
background 
the facts of this case as they relate to each defendant are set forth more fully in the district court opinion,familiarity with which is presumed.see united states rittweger,d.
indictment 
defendants thomas rittweger rittweger,douglas brandon brandon and victor wexler wexler,together with richard blech blech and robert dehaven dehaven,were charged in a indictment returned on january.on april,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment the indictment against the defendants.blech,however,pled guilty to the original indictment and was named only as a in the superseding indictment.
ii.schemes alleged 
the indictment sets forth two schemes.counts one through eight allege the first scheme,which includes charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in violation of securities fraud in violation of b and,and and wire fraud in violation of,and.counts nine through thirteen allege the second scheme,which includes charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,wire fraud,and commercial bribery in violation of and using facilities of interstate commerce to carry on and facilitate commercial bribery in violation of a and.
as part of the first scheme,the indictment alleges that from about through about,rittweger and brandon,together with blech and other,participated in a scheme to defraud customers of credit bancorp,cbl a group of related united states and foreign business organizations that purported to provide financial engineering and investment at least by fraudulently inducing them to invest cash,securities,and other assets in two cbl investment programs the cbl insured credit facility and the cbl insured securities strategy.the customers did so in the expectation of receiving dividend payments and loans with favorable terms.the indictment asserts that cbl was actually a ponzi scheme,in which the proceeds from investments in the programs were paid to earlier investors to create the false appearance that the investments were profitable,thereby inducing additional customers to invest assets with cbl.
the indictment charges that in furtherance of the first scheme,rittweger and brandon,together with blech and other,made and caused others to make false and misleading representations to prospective customers.it further alleges that rittweger,brandon,and blech falsely represented that brandon would serve as a trustee on behalf of those customers who invested in the cbl insured credit facility and would hold the invested assets in custodial accounts under his control.according to the indictment,rittweger,brandon,and blech knew that brandon had neither control over the accounts into which the cbl customer assets were invested,nor the ability to fulfill his duties as trustee.rittweger and blech also allegedly misrepresented that assets invested in the cbl insured securities strategy would be placed in mutual funds and other financial instruments,when they knew that a substantial portion of the assets were used to pay for unauthorized business and personal expenses instead.
the second scheme involves rittweger,wexler,and dehaven,who was an officer of mitsui trust company mitsui,a japanese financial institution.dehaven worked in mitsui new york office and was responsible for mitsui participation in securities lending transactions.the indictment alleges that dehaven owed fiduciary and other duties of trust and honest services to mitsui.the indictment asserts that wexler,a personal friend of dehaven,referred potential customers to cbl in return for payments from cbl,and also managed a foreign exchange trading business affiliated with cbl.
with respect to the second scheme,the indictment further alleges that from about through,rittweger,dehaven,and wexler,together with blech and other,participated in a scheme to defraud customers by inducing them to invest cash,securities,and other assets in the cbl insured credit facility.in furtherance of this scheme,the conspirators allegedly made and caused others to make numerous false and misleading representations,including the claim that mitsui had invested securities worth approximately or more with cbl,when they knew that mitsui had made no such investment.
iii.jury verdict 
after a trial before the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,that ended on june,the jury returned the following verdicts rittweger was found guilty of counts one through thirteen relating to both the first and the second schemes brandon was found guilty of counts one and three through eight relating to the first scheme wexler was found guilty of counts nine through thirteen relating to the second scheme and dehaven was found guilty of counts nine through thirteen relating to the second scheme the jury was unable to reach a verdict with respect to count two against brandon,and the jury could not agree whether securities fraud was an object of the conspiracy charged in count nine.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
this appeal presents two issues first,whether the district court erred by denying defendants motions to sever under rules b and second,whether a brady violation occurred when the government failed to produce certain allegedly exculpatory evidence relating to brandon until the week of trial.we reject defendants challenges as to both issues.
joinder and the denial of severance 
brandon and wexler argue that the district court erred by failing to grant their motions for misjoinder severance under rules b and on the grounds that the indictment alleged unrelated conspiracies and that they suffered undue prejudice as a result.we disagree.
we review the propriety of joinder de novo.united states shellef,cir.t he propriety of rule joinder is subject to full appellate review,and where joinder should not have been permitted,a conviction must be reversed,unless failure to sever was harmless error.united states attanasio,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
rule b allows joinder of two or more defendants if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions,constituting an offense or offenses.b.we have interpreted the same series of acts or transactions language of rule b to mean that joinder is proper where two or more persons criminal acts are unified by some substantial identity of facts or participants,or arise out of a common plan or scheme.united states cervone,cir quoting attanasio,at.in this context,we also apply a commonsense rule to decide whether,in light of the factual overlap among charges,joint proceedings would produce sufficient efficiencies such that joinder is proper notwithstanding the possibility of prejudice to either or both of the defendants resulting from the joinder.shellef,at citing united states turoff,cir.
here,the indictment alleges that both the first scheme and the second scheme were efforts to induce cbl customers to invest cash,securities,and other assets in the cbl insured credit facility.further,the allegations describe rittweger and blech as key participants in both schemes.for example,as part of the first scheme,the indictment describes how rittweger,blech,and brandon fraudulently induced various customers to invest assets in the cbl insured credit facility by causing fictitious account statements to be sent to customers that falsely stated their assets had been used to purchase shares in mutual funds and other financial instruments.as part of the second scheme,rittweger,blech,and wexler fraudulently induced customers to invest cash,securities,and other assets in the cbl insured credit facility by making and causing others to make numerous false and misleading representations concerning a large financial institution investment in cbl.thus,the conspiracies evince a common plan or scheme,and there is a substantial identity of facts or participants,attanasio,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,to conclude that initial joinder was permissible under rule b.
brandon and wexler principally argue,relying on united states velasquez,cir,that as members of two distinct conspiracies,they should not have been joined as defendants in the same trial because the conspiracies were not and could not have been charged as a single conspiracy.see id.at the indictment need not charge a single overarching conspiracy,provided the separate conspiracies it charges arise from a common plan or scheme and so could alternatively have been charged as a single conspiracy.the language of rule b,however,does not require such a rigid application.see united states feyrer,cir upholding joinder of although neither party was charged in the conspiracy counts of the other.indeed,in united states marzano,cir,the seventh circuit distinguished its earlier decision in velazquez for essentially this reason,and affirmed the rule b joinder of members of two separate conspiracies.id.at clarifying that although the simplest case for joinder is where the defendants are charged with having conspired with each other,different conspiracies involving different defendants may be joined when they are part of the same series of illegal acts or transactions.accordingly,whether the joinder of defendants in two conspiracies is warranted must be determined on a basis.provided that the defendants are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction,or in the same series of acts or transactions,constituting an offense or offenses.b,members of two or more conspiracies may be joined as defendants even where the members have not been charged as participating in one overarching conspiracy.see,attanasio,at upholding joinder of defendants involved in separate conspiracies on the grounds that the conspiracies shared a common purpose and there was an overlap of participants and acts.
moreover,to the extent that brandon and wexler rely on the evidence or lack thereof adduced at trial to argue that they were improperly joined as defendants,their reliance is misplaced.under the plain language of rule b,the decision to join parties turns on what is alleged in the indictment.b.events that transpire at trial are thus not relevant to the rule b inquiry.see marzano,at the test set forth in rule b is what the indictment charges,not what the evidence shows.this understanding is confirmed by the supreme court decision in schaffer united states,d affirming rule b joinder based on what was charged in the indictment,and comports with our prior application of rule b,see,united states friedman,cir in evaluating the defendants claims of misjoinder under rule b,then,our task is limited simply to determining whether the indictment properly alleged their participation in a rico conspiracy.pacelli united states,cir what is necessary is that the defendants are alleged to have participated in the same illegal act or series of acts.
the question of whether brandon and wexler faced were in fact joinder under rule b presents the altogether separate inquiry of whether the trial of these defendants should have been severed under rule.see schaffer,at.petitioners overlook,however,that the joinder was authorized under rule b and that subsequent severance was controlled by rule see also united states werner,cir the question of the propriety of joinder under rule and of refusal to grant relief from prejudicial joinder under rule are quite different in nature,although some decisions tend to obscure this.we therefore turn to brandon and wexler claims that the district court abused its discretion by denying them a separate trial.
rule provides in relevant part if the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment,an information,or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government,the court may order separate trials of counts,sever the defendants trials,or provide any other relief that justice requires.a.the supreme court has instructed that the trial judge has a continuing duty at all stages of the trial to grant a severance if prejudice does appear.schaffer,at.such prejudice exists,the court explained,only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants,or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro united states,d.motions to sever under rule are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,united states chang,cir,and in seeking to overturn the denial of a rule motion,the defendant bears a heavy burden i n order to secure a reversal,he must show prejudice so severe that his conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice,united states rosa,cir see also united states salameh,cir per curiam noting that the district court discretion is virtually unreviewable.
in the present case,brandon and wexler can not meet this burden.in essence,they argue that the majority of the evidence introduced at trial was not admissible against them,but rather was relevant only to the other defendants.this,they claim,resulted in a spillover effect so prejudicial that they were denied a fair trial.we find this argument unpersuasive.
first,the fact that evidence may be admissible against one defendant but not another does not necessarily require a severance.united states carson,cir citations omitted see also united states losada,cir.second,the evidence with respect to each of the defendants was sufficiently straightforward that the jury could consider it without any significant spillover effect.see carson,at.indeed,the jury did not reach a unanimous verdict with respect to count two against brandon or the securities fraud object of count nine.see united states hamilton,cir w here the record indicates that the jury was able to distinguish between counts or between defendants,and to assess separately the evidence pertinent to each,we have found no basis for concluding that a new trial was warranted because of prejudicial spillover.the absence of such spillover is most readily inferable where the jury has convicted a defendant on some counts but not on others.finally,the district court gave limiting instructions throughout the trial explaining when evidence could not be considered against a particular defendant,and the jury charge carefully explained that the jurors must consider the case against each defendant separately.see zafiro,at.united states hernandez,cir rejecting a claim of confusion and spillover prejudice where trial court instructed jurors to consider the evidence against each defendant individually for each count.therefore,despite our concern that no connection existed between brandon and wexler,and that the connection between the two charged conspiracies was tenuous,we do not find that the district court abused its discretion in denying severance.
although,given the flexibility of the standard,we find no abuse in the district court exercise of its discretion,we question the government decision to try the two conspiracies together.as the government conceded at trial,wexler had no knowledge of or participation in the first scheme and brandon had no knowledge of or participation in the second scheme.given that evidence relatin
