opinion of the court 
defendant elliot cartwright cartwright appeals his conviction and sentence,following a jury trial,for conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of,aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine in violation of and,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c.the sole issue presented by this appeal is whether the evidence presented by the government at trial was sufficient to support cartwright conviction.we conclude that the evidence adduced at trial did not support an inference that cartwright knew he was participating in a transaction that involved a controlled substance,as opposed to some other form of contraband.because we have consistently held that such proof is necessary to support a conviction in cases such as this,we will reverse the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
on september,a drug dealer named prince muhammed el agreed to cooperate with agents from the pennsylvania office of the attorney general,bureau of narcotics investigation and drug control,in arranging for the controlled purchase of three kilograms of cocaine.muhammed el made the arrangements through his friend,rashine ellis,who in turn contacted her supplier,osiris jackson.muhammed el had contacted ellis through his handheld text messaging device during a recorded telephone conversation later that day,muhammed el and ellis negotiated the terms of the transaction.muhammed el agreed to purchase three kilograms of cocaine for a price of.the two also initially agreed that the sale would take place later that day at the houlihan or friday on city line avenue in philadelphia after the initial conversation,ellis changed the location of the transaction to the parking lot of the bala cynwyd shopping center in montgomery county,pennsylvania,just across the philadelphia city line.
before going to the shopping center parking lot,muhammed el first met ellis at a gas station in the east falls section of philadelphia.muhammed el was accompanied by james avery,an undercover narcotics agent with the pennsylvania attorney general office,who posed as muhammed el bodyguard and confidant.at the gas station,muhammed el got out of his car and entered ellis silver mitsubishi montero,a sport utility vehicle the suv.muhammed el then rode with ellis to the shopping center while avery followed them in muhammed el car.the two vehicles arrived at the shopping center parking lot at approximately ellis parked her suv about five to six car lengths from the front door of a foot locker store.agent avery parked in a space directly across from ellis suv.at that point,the parking lot was under government surveillance.
when they arrived at the parking lot,ellis contacted her supplier,osiris jackson,using her text messaging device.muhammed el then got out of ellis suv and went to agent avery,who remained in muhammed el car.muhammed el told agent avery that he would give a signal by lifting his hat as soon as he saw the cocaine.muhammed el then got back into ellis suv.at that point,law enforcement agents observed jackson,walking up to the suv and getting into the rear seat.while inside the suv,muhammed el,pointing to agent avery,told jackson that he had the money and asked if jackson had the cocaine.jackson said that he did have the cocaine and ellis pronounced that the deal is good.app.at.jackson then got out of the suv and walked through the breezeway at the corner of the mall that led to another parking lot located on the rear side of the mall.the rear parking lot was not under government surveillance.
several minutes later,jackson returned through the breezeway,carrying a blue and white paper shopping bag marked with the words denim.agent kenneth bellis,who was conducting surveillance for the controlled transaction,observed that as jackson walked through the breezeway leading back to the front parking lot and ellis suv,he was walking with defendant elliot cartwright.agent bellis observed that at one point,jackson and ellis were talking to each other,and he could tell that they were having some kind of conversation.app.at.jackson and cartwright walked together through the breezeway for approximately thirty feet and then began to separate.jackson walked out into the parking area towards ellis suv and cartwright continued to walk along a path that ran adjacent to the store fronts.cartwright stopped walking near the foot locker.his back was facing a wall that separated the foot locker from the store to its left.cartwright then leaned up against the wall and placed one foot up against it.he was also looking straight ahead,in the direction of ellis suv.the suv was located about to feet from the foot locker.
meanwhile,jackson crossed the parking lot and,after taking a loaded firearm from his waistband,entered the suv.jackson placed the blue and white shopping bag on its side in the suv,showing muhammed el three bricks of cocaine.muhammed el then gave the signal and law enforcement officers immediately converged on the suv.the agents recovered from jackson a loaded firearm with a round in the chamber,a motorola timeport text messaging device,the blue and white shopping bag containing the cocaine,and the keys to a subaru vehicle that was discovered in the rear parking lot and was registered in the name of jackson father.
as the agents converged upon ellis suv,agent bellis observed cartwright remove his foot from the wall and saw him going fairly quickly into the foot locker store.app.at.agent bellis radioed for another agent,edward rodriguez,to meet him at the foot locker.together,the two agents entered the foot locker approximately twenty to thirty seconds after cartwright.upon entering the foot locker,they saw cartwright with his back towards them,standing near clothes racks located in the middle of the store.they grabbed cartwright,patted him down,and recovered from him a loaded semiautomatic firearm with a round in the chamber,a cellular phone,in cash,and a motorola timeport text messaging device similar to the one recovered from jackson.cartwright was not in possession of any car keys.
at cartwright trial,the foregoing facts were developed through the testimony of muhammed el,agent avery,agent bellis,agent rodriguez,and two other law enforcement agents.in addition,agent bellis testified,as an expert in the field of drug trafficking,that drug dealers commonly used lookouts to conduct in drug transactions and that these lookouts could possess a firearm.the only witness to testify for the defense was bernard clark,the assistant manager of the foot locker,who told the jury that when cartwright first came into the store,he asked a saleswoman a question,then looked at some clothing,and then asked the saleswoman another question.
cartwright defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal under.after the close of the government case and again at the close of all evidence.the district court denied both motions,holding that sufficient evidence existed to send the case to the jury.cartwright was found guilty on all three counts.he was sentenced to a term of months of imprisonment,five years of supervised release,a fine of,and a special assessment of.cartwright filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under because cartwright was charged with offenses against the laws of the united states.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to because the district court judgment of conviction and commitment was a final decision.
iii.discussion 
cartwright argues on appeal that the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to support his conviction on any count.first,cartwright contends that the government failed to show that he was a lookout for osiris jackson and that all of the evidence presented to the jury was consistent with his innocence.alternatively,cartwright claims that even assuming that the government evidence was sufficient to support an inference he acted as a lookout for jackson,the government failed to show that he knew that the transaction involved a controlled substance.in reviewing cartwright challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,we apply a particularly deferential standard of review.united states cothran,cir quoting united states dent,cir.the verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence to support it.burks united states,d united states beckett,cir.it is not our role to weigh the evidence or to determine the credibility of the witnesses.cothran,at.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and sustain the verdict if any rational juror could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
under this standard of review,we have little difficulty concluding that the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that cartwright acted as a lookout for jackson.moreover,there is ample evidence in the record to suggest that cartwright knew he was involved in an illicit transaction of some sort.the evidence showed that cartwright and jackson had a conversation during a walk through the breezeway,after which cartwright was seen taking up a position next to the foot locker and watching the suv as jackson walked to it with the blue and white shopping bag.cartwright,like jackson,was armed with a weapon that was loaded and had a round in the chamber.cartwright and jackson also possessed similar text messaging devices.moreover,the jury heard expert testimony that lookouts are commonly used in drug transactions of this type.while there may have been an innocent explanation for cartwright activity t here is no requirement that the inference drawn by the jury be the only inference possible or that the government evidence foreclose every possible innocent explanation.united states iafelice,cir citing united states sandini,cir.accordingly,the evidence presented,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,is clearly sufficient to support a finding that cartwright was acting as a lookout for jackson.our cases dictate,however,that merely acting as a lookout is insufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to distribute,or aiding and abetting the distribution of,a controlled substance.see,united states salmon,cir united states wexler,cir.although this evidence may be sufficient to prove that cartwright knew he was participating in some sort of illegal transaction,these facts nonetheless are insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that cartwright knew the transaction involved drugs.
the elements of a conspiracy may be proven entirely by circumstantial evidence,but each element of the offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.wexler,at see also united states idowu,cir.one of the requisite elements the government must show in a conspiracy case is that the alleged conspirators shared a unity of purpose,the intent to achieve a common goal,and an agreement to work together toward the goal.wexler,at citing united states kates,cir see also idowu,at.in order for us to sustain a defendant conviction for conspiracy,the government must have put forth evidence tending to prove that defendant entered into an agreement and knew that the agreement had the specific unlawful purpose charged in the indictment.idowu,at quoting wexler,at applying this rule,w e have consistently held in cases of this genre that,even in situations where the defendant knew that he was engaged in illicit activity,and knew that some form of contraband was involved in the scheme in which he was participating,the government is obliged to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the particular illegal objective contemplated by the conspiracy.idowu,at citing united states thomas,cir wexler,at.accordingly,this court has consistently overturned convictions for conspiracy in drug possession and distribution because of the absence of any evidence that the defendant had knowledge that drugs were involved.united states mastrangelo,cir citing idowu,thomas,salmon,wexler,united states cooper,cir.
we also have overturned aiding and abetting convictions for parallel reasons.see,salmon,at wexler,at.a conviction on such a charge requires that another committed the substantive offense and that the one charged with aiding and abetting knew of the commission and acted with the intent to facilitate it.salmon,at citing united states dixon,cir see also united states bey,cir united states pearlstein,cir.a cting with intent to facilitate the substantive offense requires that one acted with the intent to help those involved with a certain crime.salmon,at quoting wexler,at emphasis in original.we have therefore held that a reasonable jury could not have had sufficient evidence to find that a defendant aided and abetted the possession distribution of drugs where the government did not prove that the defendant had knowledge of the drugs,had knowledge that the intended to distribute or possess drugs,or purposefully intended to aid others in committing the crime alleged.id.at quoting wexler,at.
based on this precedent,the proper question before us with respect to both the conspiracy and the aiding and abetting charges is whether there was sufficient evidence that cartwright knew that the subject matter of the transaction was a controlled substance,rather than some other form of contraband,such as stolen jewels or computer chips or currency.idowu,at.here,the government presented no direct evidence proving that cartwright knew he was involved in a drug transaction.we have recognized,however,that i nferences from established facts are accepted methods of proof when no direct evidence is available so long as there exists a logical and convincing connection between the facts established and the conclusion inferred.id.at quoting united states clemmons,cir see also salmon,at citing united states mcneill,cir.on the other hand,in the absence of a logical and convincing connection,where an inference as to a defendant knowledge is based upon speculation,our case law forbids us from upholding his conviction.see thomas,at.
the facts of this case undoubtedly evidence the existence of a conspiracy,at least among rashine ellis and osiris jackson,to distribute cocaine.there is also no question that a distribution of cocaine actually occurred.however,the government can point only to the following facts established at trial as a basis for inferring cartwright knowledge of a drug distribution cartwright made his first appearance in the breezeway at the same time that jackson was observed carrying the shopping bag containing the cocaine cartwright walked with jackson through the breezeway and the two were observed talking to each other cartwright possessed a firearm,a cellular phone,in cash,and a motorola timeport text messaging device and cartwright did not possess any keys to a vehicle of his own.there is simply no logical and convincing connection between these facts and the inference the government seeks to draw.rather,that inference is based solely on speculation about a possible prior relationship between cartwright and jackson,about how cartwright got to the mall,and about what cartwright was doing prior to being sighted with jackson,matters as to which there is no evidence.
our conclusion that the foregoing facts do not support the government inference follows a fortiori from thomas,and idowu.in thomas,a drug courier named lynch agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officers in conducting a planned drug transaction.at.lynch informed the officers that she had been directed by a man named petersen to take a suitcase carrying cocaine to a hotel room at the atlanta airport days inn,leave the suitcase in the hotel room,return the room key to the front desk in an envelope marked melvin smith or cousin melvin smith,and then leave the days inn for another hotel.id.lynch performed as directed and the officers set up surveillance of the days inn hotel room.defendant thomas then obtained the room key from the front desk,was observed entering the designated room,and was arrested upon exiting.thomas told the officers that he was to be paid to check on a suitcase at the hotel,but he denied having any knowledge that the suitcase contained cocaine.when thomas was arrested,he was in possession of a cellular phone,a pager,and a nine millimeter pistol.in addition,officers retrieved from thom
