background 
a jury convicted ness of one count of conspiring to commit three money laundering offenses and one substantive count of violating a b i transaction money laundering.the three objects of the charged conspiracy were violations of a monetary transaction in unlawful funds a b i and a b i transportation money laundering.following denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal,see united states ness,wl,ness was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment,with three years supervised release.
on appeal,ness argued,inter alia,that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction with respect to the element of concealment,which included both a transaction money laundering statute and transportation money laundering statute.specifically,these statutes proscribe certain financial transaction s in the case of a b i and the transportation,transmission,or transfer of certain funds in the case of a b i that are designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.the evidence showed that ness,who ran an armored car carrier business,received millions of dollars in narcotics proceeds from drug traffickers,which the government argued ness and his associates transported to destinations abroad at the traffickers behest.ness contended that the concealment element of the transaction and transportation money laundering statutes could be satisfied only when the transaction or transportation at issue was designed to cloak the unlawful proceeds with the appearance of legitimate wealth.he maintained that the government showed only that he received cash from drug transactions for shipment from one place to another and failed to show that such actions were designed to give the appearance of legitimate wealth.
we rejected ness arguments in light of our decision in united states gotti,cir.see united states ness,cir ness i.in gotti,we had upheld convictions under a b i against a sufficiency challenge with respect to concealment where the evidence showed that defendants participated in a system of tribute payments from lower to higher figures in an organized crime hierarchy,with the proceeds deriving from unlawful activity.id.at.we noted that the highly complex and surreptitious process through which the funds were coded language,the use of intermediaries,secretive handoffs,and cash to permit the inference that the deliveries had been designed in a way that would conceal the source of the moneys.id.at footnote reference omitted.
in ness i,we held that the level of secrecy that attended ness dealings with the traffickers was comparable to that noted in gotti,involving,for example,clandestine meetings to transfer large sums of concealed cash,the use of coded language,and the scrupulous avoidance of a paper trail.see at.with respect to the a offense,we declined to address ness sufficiency challenge because his conviction and sentence would still stand on the basis of the transaction and transportation money laundering convictions.see id.at.
on june,the united states supreme court vacated ness i and remanded for further consideration in light of regalado cuellar united states,d.see ness united states,d mem.
discussion 
a money laundering 
in cuellar,the defendant had been convicted of international money laundering under a b i after police officers found in narcotics proceeds during a search of his car.see id.at.the fifth circuit reversed the conviction after concluding that the evidence failed to show that the purpose of the transportation was to conceal or disguise unlawful proceeds and create the appearance of legitimate wealth.see id.at.the fifth circuit granted rehearing en banc and affirmed the conviction.see id.at.the court rejected cuellar argument that the government must prove that he attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.it held rather that cuellar extensive efforts to prevent detection of the funds during transportation showed that he sought to conceal or disguise the nature,location,and source,ownership,or control of the funds.see id.on certiorari,the supreme court rejected an interpretation of the statute that would require the government to prove that the defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.see id.at.however,the court concluded that the statute required evidence that the defendant purpose in whole or in part in transporting the funds was to conceal the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the funds.id.at.
therefore,a conviction under section a b i must be based on evidence that the defendant i attempted to transport the funds across the united states border ii knew that those funds represent ed the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and iii knew that such transportation was designed to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the funds.see id.at.with respect to this third prong,the court held that a showing that the defendant hid funds during transportation is not sufficient to support a conviction under the statute,even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money.see id.at.rather,the court,looking to the meaning of design in the phrase knowing that such transportation is designed to conceal or disguise,concluded that because design means purpose or plan in this context,a conviction requires proof that the merely the transportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the transported funds.id.at.as the court explained,t here is a difference between concealing something to transport it,and transporting something to conceal it that is,how one moves the money is distinct from why one moves the money,and e vidence of the former,standing alone,is not sufficient to prove the latter.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we turn now to the application of cuellar to the present matter.ordinarily,we might remand this issue to the district court to benefit from its views.that is unnecessary,however,because,subsequent to the cuellar decision,the district court stated its views in considering ness renewed motion for bail.see united states ness,wl.the district court concluded that the government had provided sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction.see id.at.the court relied upon evidence that the proceeds of the drug sales were being transported to people in europe and commingled with jewelry and other valuables that ness declared to be part of his business of transporting such valuables internationally.see id.the court concluded that t he transportation was designed to conceal or disguise the nature of that which was being transported,or its location among the valuables that ness was allowed to transport and move from one airplane to another at jfk airport,or that the source of the items being transported was ecstasy distributions.id.
the government echoes this reasoning on the remand.it contends that the evidence adduced at trial established two purposes behind ness transportation of the narcotics proceeds to ensure the concealment of the funds including concealment of their nature,location,source,ownership and control and to allow the transportation of the funds to other narcotics
