this is an appeal from a district court judgment revoking jori ferguson supervised release.the district court found that ferguson had violated the terms of his supervised release by,among other things,possessing marijuana.the district court finding relied in part on a laboratory report prepared by a forensic examiner who did not testify at the hearing.we hold that the district court erred by denying ferguson a chance to this forensic examiner.accordingly,we vacate ferguson sentence and remand.
jori ferguson has spent ten of the last thirteen years in prison and the remaining time on supervised release.he first lost his liberty when he was nineteen years old,so he has spent roughly one third of his life under varying levels of government supervision,including essentially all of the years he would have otherwise been adjusting to adulthood.
after serving nearly a decade in prison,ferguson began his first period of supervised release in,which was soon revoked after a series of violations,most related to drug use.after a second term in prison,ferguson entered supervised release again,but after initial success,he once more struggled to abide by the terms of his release.in,ferguson was convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia.the following year,ferguson failed a drug test for marijuana.in the same year,he was arrested twice and did not tell his probation officer.at the revocation hearing,ferguson admitted to these four violations.
in addition,ferguson was accused of two more serious violations which he contested at his revocation hearing,one of which is the crux of this appeal.on march,officer jonathan mcdonald of the chesterfield county police department received a report of a domestic dispute in a vehicle driven by ferguson.officer mcdonald pulled the car over,and when he approached,he smelled marijuana.officer mcdonald searched the car and found several plastic bags of a substance which,based on his experience,he presumed was marijuana,as well as in cash and an atm receipt for.in the squad car after being arrested,ferguson admitted that he was a marijuana dealer.
the marijuana was sent to a forensic laboratory,which confirmed the weight and nature of the substance.the analysis was conducted by analyst jennifer clary.clary did not testify at the revocation hearing.the lab report lacks any information regarding what kind of test was conducted,confidence intervals for the analyses performed,the measurement instruments used,clary background,or whether proper chain of custody procedure was followed.there is no information on the rate of false positives in the type of exam used,or on the rate of false negatives,both of which would be necessary to assess the reliability of the exam conclusions.the lab report was introduced during the revocation hearing by officer mcdonald during his testimony.however,officer mcdonald did not perform the analysis and has no expertise in chemistry.
the district judge found that the facts above established that ferguson violated his supervised release by possessing marijuana.based on this violation,the four additional violations that ferguson admitted to,and another incident of drug possession,the judge sentenced ferguson to months in prison.
ferguson filed a timely appeal.he argues that in the absence of a government showing of good cause for the chemist unavailability,it was a violation of federal rule of criminal procedure b c to admit a laboratory report without calling the chemist to testify 
we review a district court evidentiary ruling in a revocation hearing for abuse of discretion.united states doswell,f d,cir.revocation hearings are less formal than trials of guilt,where the full panoply of rights due a defendant are in effect.morrissey brewer.nonetheless,from the defendant perspective,trials and revocation hearings are similar in that the end result may be a loss of liberty.accordingly,some due process rights apply.id.at.in morrissey,the supreme court explicitly identified the right to confront and adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation as one of several minimum requirements of due process that apply to revocation hearings.id.at.these requirements are formalized in the federal rules of criminal procedure.under rule,defendants are entitled to an opportunity to appear,present evidence,and question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.b c.
our holding in doswell,wherein we announced a balancing test governing the application of rule b c,is directly on point and mandates reversal here.see at.in that case,the government sought to introduce a laboratory report without calling the chemist who wrote the report.id.at.the district court admitted the report as evidence.id.at.the government failed to provide good cause for the chemist absence.id.nonetheless,the district court concluded that the drug analysis report was reliable enough on its face to be admitted as evidence.id.on appeal,we reversed and held that rule b c specifically requires that,prior to admitting hearsay evidence in a revocation hearing,the district court must balance the releasee interest in confronting an adverse witness against any proffered good cause for denying such confrontation.id.at.we noted that the reliability of the evidence is a critical factor in the balancing test under rule.id.at.however,as the seventh circuit described,reliability can not be the beginning and end of the interest of justice analysis.united states jordan,cir joining this court in adopting a balancing test for hearsay evidence in revocation hearings.put simply,unless the government makes a showing of good cause for why the relevant witness is unavailable,hearsay evidence is inadmissible at revocation hearings.
in ferguson revocation hearing,the government introduced a laboratory report through officer mcdonald testimony,but it proffered no explanation for the laboratory expert absence.thus,there was zero showing of good cause.instead,the district court allowed officer mcdonald to read the laboratory report into evidence because the report was on official stationery with an official envelope and was signed by a forensic examiner from the commonwealth of virginia.in closing arguments,when ferguson renewed his objection to the introduction of the laboratory report,the district court clarified that other evidence corroborated the report.thus,the judge first explicitly ruled that reliability alone justified introduction of the report.then during closing arguments,the judge made an implicit harmlessness finding by concluding that other evidence sufficiently corroborated the report conclusions.either way,the district court committed legal error.
as we held in doswell,the district court must balance the releasee interest in confronting an adverse witness against any proffered good cause for denying such confrontation.doswell,at emphasis added.reliability is an important factor but not a dispositive one.relying on the stationery on which the report appears as evidence of reliability does not obviate the requirement to show good cause.similarly,the existence of corroborating evidence does not relieve the government burden of proffering a sufficient justification for the absence of the witness.because there was no evidence of good cause,as doswell requires,the introduction of the laboratory report was error.
the government argues that even if there was a clear legal error here given the rule stated in doswell,this error was harmless.echoing the district court implicit harmlessness finding made during closing statements,the government points out that ferguson was found to have committed other violations of his supervised release,and these violations could have supported the sentence that was ultimately imposed.further,officer mcdonald testified that he detected a marijuana odor in ferguson car and that ferguson admitted to selling drugs thus,even without the laboratory report,the government argues that adequate support exists for the district court sentence.
as a preliminary matter,we must define the correct harmless error standard
