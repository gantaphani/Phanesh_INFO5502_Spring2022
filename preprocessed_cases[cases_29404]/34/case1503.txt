following a trial,a jury convicted steven hale of transporting stolen property in interstate commerce,knowing the goods to have been stolen of conspiring to do the same of making false statements in his tax returns of failing to collect and pay employee taxes and of obstructing justice.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.
challenging his conviction on appeal,hale contends primarily that the evidence was insufficient to justify the district court decision to give the jury a willful blindness instruction and otherwise to support the jury finding that he knew the property at issue was stolen.he also challenges the admission of certain evidence the content of several jury instructions the sufficiency of the evidence as to whether an individual who worked for him qualified as an employee,as opposed to an independent contractor and certain statements that the government made to the jury during closing argument.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
a federal grand jury returned a indictment in charging hale with one count of conspiracy from at least through march to transport stolen property in interstate commerce,in violation of twelve counts of transporting stolen property in interstate commerce,and aiding and abetting the same,in violation of and three counts of making a false statement in his income tax returns,in violation of fourteen counts of failing to collect,account for,and pay over federal taxes on an employee wages,in violation of and one count of obstruction of justice,in violation of.at the heart of the charged conduct was the government allegation that,as part of an organized retail theft scheme,hale served as a fence engaged in the purchase and resale of stolen consumer products,goods and merchandise.specifically,the government alleged that professional shoplifters or boosters,as they were called had stolen millions of dollars worth of medications and products from the shelves of retail stores and then sold the goods to fences,who in turn sold the goods to hale,the sole owner and operator of a warehouse in denver,north carolina,doing business as double d distributing,llc.hale profited,according to the government,by selling the stolen goods to at least one fence.
the government investigation began in the fall of,when detectives with the gastonia,north carolina police department learned that heroin addicts in the area were routinely shoplifting large quantities of goods particularly medications and aids from local stores and selling them to get money to buy heroin on a basis.these boosters often operated in teams of two to four individuals and routinely stole to worth of merchandise in a matter of minutes.after some of the boosters identified a woman named bonnie bridges as their fence,officers set up surveillance that confirmed that numerous boosters were taking their shoplifted merchandise to bridges house on a daily basis.officers then saw bridges taking the merchandise to hale warehouse,which was a plain white metal building with no identifying signs.officers conducted further surveillance at the warehouse and eventually set up a pole camera across the street.
between october and march,their surveillance revealed that bridges,often accompanied by her sister,regularly delivered stolen merchandise to the double d warehouse.bridges two daughters and their husbands also made routine deliveries to the warehouse,as would a man named darryl brock.they all delivered their merchandise in plastic garbage bags,plastic storage bins,and boxes,and one officer who participated in the surveillance testified that he never saw anyone else,including any commercial trucks,make deliveries to the warehouse.on numerous occasions between october and march,hale was present at the warehouse when these individuals were paid cash for the stolen merchandise they delivered.
on october,investigating agents intercepted a fedex shipment from the double d warehouse to jeff telsey at jca enterprises in boca raton,florida.in that shipment were items that the officers had marked with an pen prior to having a cooperating booster sell the items to bridges.the shipment also contained merchandise marked with active security sensors and stickers identifying the retail store where the item was intended to be sold and a telephone number for people to call if the item was found elsewhere.this telephone number allowed people to find out if the product was stolen or if it was legitimately in the secondary market.
investigating agents executed a search warrant at the double d warehouse on march,where they found numerous shelves containing labeled boxes of merchandise and a cleaning station with different products used to remove stickers,sensors,and glue.sharon cooke,who worked at the warehouse,was present at the beginning of the search and agreed to make two recorded telephone calls to hale,who was in florida at the time.she told hale that the irs was around asking questions.during one of the calls,hale responded,well,you do know who we doing business with,and then repeated,you do know who the business is with,do you,even though cooke did in fact know the identities of both the business suppliers and customers.
on the same day that agents searched the double d warehouse,they also searched bridges residence and arrested bridges.after she was released from jail,she called hale to accuse him of throw ing us under the bus.hale responded that he had done anything that bridges and her family should have done him the way that they did and that he hoped they did turn on him.moreover,the same day that officers searched hale warehouse,hale called brock,warning him that bridges had gotten arrested for a bunch of stolen merchandise that the fbi was at his warehouse and that they would probably be coming after brock next.the next day,hale advised brock to get rid of his product and to take money out of his bank accounts before they were frozen by the police.consistent with the latter piece of advice,hale withdrew more than from a joint bank account that he shared with his wife,redepositing the money in a new account in her name only.
one week after the search,on april,hale listed his boat for sale with a broker in florida,asking more than.at some later point,however,hale took the boat title to a close family friend who was an auctioneer and signed the title over to his friend company.the friend had the boat on his car lot for a few weeks but,at hale request,moved it inside a building.sometime after june,when a court issued a seizure warrant for the boat,hale told his friend about the warrant and stated,if anybody asks you any questions,it your boat.sometime later,hale prepared a fraudulent promissory note reflecting that his friend had agreed to pay for the boat,which they backdated to may.
trial on the charges commenced in april and continued before a jury for seven days.in support of its case,the government introduced surveillance videos of activity outside of hale warehouse,the testimony from the investigating officers,and the testimony from several of hale alleged,including bridges,brock,cooke,and telsey.
bridges testified that she met hale in when she was selling medicines and aids at a flea market after buying them directly from shoplifters.at that time,hale approached her table and indicated that he might be interested in buying her products,particularly tylenol,advil,and stuff like that.thereafter,hale gave bridges a price list for the merchandise he wanted to buy and said he would pay cash for as much of that merchandise as she could deliver.for example,hale would pay for a bottle of aleve,less than the manufacturer wholesale price of,and for a package of prilosec,substantially less than the wholesale price of.hale told bridges that he would not accept goods that were damaged or within one year of their expiration date.based on hale price list,bridges told the boosters what goods she wanted and how much she would pay for those goods,usually setting her price so that she made at least one dollar on each item.as to the merchandise that hale would not accept,bridges sold it at flea markets,where she also continued to sell other miscellaneous items.
for the first five or six years that bridges and hale did business together,hale would send someone to pick up the merchandise at bridges house.eventually,however,hale gave bridges the address of his warehouse,and bridges started delivering the stolen merchandise to the warehouse on an almost daily basis.starting around or,her daughters and their husbands found their own boosters to buy from in order to make money by reselling stolen merchandise to hale.
at times,the shoplifters bridges bought from would get arrested,and,when hale or cooke would ask her why she was not bringing in as much product,she would respond that her people were on vacation.bridges testified that hale would not ask any more questions about that.at no point during the decade that bridges sold hale stolen merchandise did hale ever ask her for proof that the products she was selling to him were not stolen nor did he ever ask about the retailer stickers,which were on at least of the items that she sold to him.
brock testified that he first met hale in,when his father introduced them.at the time,brock and his father owned a fireworks store,but brock was also buying medicine and aids from boosters and selling the stolen merchandise at flea markets.brock father had previously sold stolen merchandise,and he told brock that hale was okay and was buying the health and beauty aid stuff which brock had.hale subsequently provided brock with a price sheet and started buying goods from him.in,brock was arrested after law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on a trailer located behind his fireworks store and recovered counterfeit items and boxes of stolen merchandise.while the charges were pending,brock asked hale if he could help him out,and hale gave brock a fraudulent receipt for banana boxes and a bunch of receipts from a walmart,leading police to drop the stolen property charge.
for several years after his arrest,brock stopped dealing in stolen merchandise,but he got back into the business after meeting bridges at a flea market in the spring of.when he approached her booth,he could almost immediately tell,from being in that business before,that her products were stolen goods.brock started buying goods from bridges regularly and eventually started selling some of those goods to hale.
in late,hale and brock had conversations about going into business together,with the idea that brock would operate a warehouse in south carolina.during these conversations,hale told brock that he made in a bad month and that he was getting about of his merchandise from bridges and the members of her family.hale advised brock that he should always pay his suppliers in cash because he would have to report it if he put it on the books,and he also told brock to make sure that he got everybody on tape saying that they do deal in stolen merchandise,even giving brock a voice recording pen device to be used for that purpose.he also gave brock a device that could be used to detect if someone was wearing a wire.
cooke testified that she first started working for hale in when her,who was already working for him,needed help.cooke and her worked together on a basis until her left in,and,from that point forward,cooke essentially ran the warehouse daily operations,although hale had an office there and was present about the time.bridges and the other suppliers called cooke about an hour before they arrived at the warehouse with an estimate of how many items they were bringing,so that bridges could go to the bank and withdraw cash from hale business account.cooke then received the merchandise as it was delivered and paid the suppliers cash for it,often in the thousands of dollars.cooke maintained a financial ledger of the transactions on which hale also made entries that identified the suppliers,at first by codenames such as fw for fireworks,the codename for brock,and bg for bonnie gastonia,the codename for bridges,who lived in gastonia,north carolina and later by symbols such as a star for one of bridges daughters and an asterisk for the other.after the suppliers left,cooke sometimes assisted by one of her family members unpacked the merchandise,checked it for damage and shelf life,cleaned it of any retailer stickers or sensors,and sorted it.once the merchandise was cleaned and categorized,cooke repackaged it and sent hale a list of the inventory that was ready to ship.after hale negotiated a deal with one of his purchasers,cooke put the boxes of cleaned merchandise on pallets for shipping and prepared bills of lading.
initially,hale paid cooke in cash every two weeks for her work,but he eventually increased her pay to in cash for every box of goods that she processed.cooke withdrew cash from hale bank account to pay herself and also to buy all of the warehouse supplies.while cooke decided what hours to work,she nonetheless worked full time and exclusively for hale for approximately a decade.with respect to cooke work,hale reported having paid around to sharon packaging for each tax year from through,but he never issued cooke either a or a tax form,nor did he withhold any of her income for taxes.
jeff telsey,who had been the owner and operator of jca enterprises,testified that he regularly bought stolen goods from hale in order to resell them to retailers.when a shipment arrived from hale,his operation inspected each item for damage,expiration dates,and stickers identifying the store where the item was supposed to be sold.he was concerned about such stickers which he sometimes found on items in hale shipments because any retailer receiving such products would know that this was obviously stolen property.telsey never called the phone numbers printed on the stickers because he already knew he was dealing in stolen property.telsey testified that he liked doing business with hale because hale sent him large quantities of the types of items that were the easiest for him to resell and hale prices were generally lower than telsey other suppliers.when telsey spoke with any of his suppliers,including hale,they never used the word stolen,but telsey took it for granted that everybody knew had to know it was stolen and that anyone with half a brain in their head would know it was stolen.hale stopped selling to telsey at some point in,telling cooke that telsey was being investigated for dealing in counterfeit razor blades and indicating that,as a result,they would probably be investigated for dealing in stolen product s.
representatives from bayer health care and procter gamble companies that manufactured some of the products at issue testified that there was no legitimate way to buy their company products for prices as low as the ones hale charged.similarly,the manager of cvs organized retail crime unit testified that there was no lawful way for loose goods with different expiration dates from different stores with stickers on them to come into the market.
after the government rested its case,hale made a motion for a judgment of acquittal on all counts,and the district court denied the motion.hale then presented testimony from several witnesses some of whom testified about the existence of a legitimate secondary market in medicines and aids.he then took the stand to testify in his own defense.
immediately prior to that point,hale counsel requested that the court preclude the government from asking hale about a prosecution that was brought against hale and more than ten other defendants for conspiring during the period from to to transport or receive stolen goods namely,drugs and aids.on appeal of the convictions in that case,this court overturned most of the convictions,including hale,on the ground that the evidence did not support that the defendants had been willfully blind to the fact that they were dealing in stolen property.see united states ebert,wl,at cir.may,unpublished table decision.the government agreed not to ask hale about these previous charges and the previous trial,but it argued that it should be able to him about his business dealings at that time with don thomas,the fence at the heart of that case.the court agreed,instructing the government to avoid referencing the fact that hale was previously charged but ruling that if he gained knowledge at that time and then used that to be willfully blind in an effort to pull this off,then that needs to come out.hale counsel agreed that such a question was fair game.
hale testified that he became involved in the secondary market business in,when he bought worth of merchandise at flea markets and gradually started identifying buyers.he stated that his business model involved dealing in depressed product,meaning product that is not in factory boxes and does not look factory new,and that he had bought product from every known source that you can buy from.he testified that in his ten years of dealing with bonnie bridges,he had never heard one word spoken about her being a fence,adding that nobody can run a booster operation ten years and deal with crackheads without getting caught that bridges was probably the most trusted buyer he had and that he never ever thought she was selling stolen goods.he later added that he checked her criminal background and also verified that she was at flea markets when she said she was going to be.
on cross examination,hale acknowledged that before he met bridges,he had been involved in the secondary market that one of the people from whom he had bought medicines and aides was don thomas and that he later learned that thomas had been getting his goods from boosters and fences.he acknowledged that when he got back in the business in,he knew that the presence of stolen property in the market was a great risk.he also admitted that he had previously done business with independent fences,but denied walking out of the room whenever boosters would show up at those fences places.in an attempt to refresh hale recollection,the government asked hale to read silently from a document that was not identified for the jury but that was a copy of this court unpublished opinion in ebert.after reading the passage,hale maintained that somebody had falsely said that he had purposefully left the room when boosters were present.
at the conclusion of all the evidence,hale renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal,and the district court again denied the motion.
in its closing argument,the government referred to evidence indicating that the boosters who stole merchandise and sold it to bridges were drug addicts,and it repeatedly emphasized,without objection,that most of the money that hale paid bridges ultimately went to the local drug dealers who were supplying the boosters with heroin and cocaine.
before the district court instructed the jury,hale objected to the court decision to provide the jury with a willful blindness instruction.hale counsel allowed,however,that if the court was going to give such an instruction,we do have any problem with the proposed instruction of the court.
the jury found hale guilty on all counts on april,and the district court sentenced hale to months imprisonment.from the judgment entered against him dated october,as amended february,hale filed this appeal.
for his main argument on appeal,hale contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the district court decision to provide the jury with a willful blindness instruction and otherwise to support the jury finding that he knew the property was stolen.hale also challenges the form of the willful blindness instruction that the court gave.
we begin with hale contention that the district court abused its discretion by instructing the jury on willful blindness in light of the evidence presented.
for a jury to convict hale of transporting stolen goods in interstate commerce and conspiring to do so,the government was required to prove that hale knew that the goods he was transporting were stolen.see.while the government could,of course,meet its burden by proving that hale actually knew the goods were stolen,it could also satisfy the knowledge element by presenting sufficient evidence that hale had made himself deliberately ignorant of the fact that the goods were stolen,which evidence would justify the court instructing the jury on willful blindness.the first question before us,therefore,is whether the government presented sufficient evidence of hale deliberate ignorance to justify the district court willful blindness instruction.
the principle that willful blindness will satisfy a knowledge element in criminal law is premised on the idea that defendants should not be permitted to escape the reach of criminal statutes that require proof that a defendant acted knowingly or willfully by deliberately shielding themselves from clear evidence of critical facts that are strongly suggested by the circumstances.appliances,seb,see also united states jinwright,cir.to allow the most clever,inventive,and sophisticated wrongdoers to hide behind a constant and conscious purpose of avoiding knowledge of criminal misconduct would be an injustice in its own right.but,to ensure that the willful blindness doctrine retains an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence,its application has two basic requirements the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.appliances,at.
to be sure,requests for willful blindness instructions should be handled with caution,jinwright,at,because of the risk that the instruction could mislead a jury into believing that it could convict the defendant for his mere negligence or recklessness with respect to a key fact making his conduct illegal,see united states lighty,cir.nonetheless,it is appropriate to instruct the jury on willful blindness when the defendant claims lack of guilty knowledge in the face of evidence supporting an inference of deliberate ignorance.id.at see also united states ali,cir.
in the record before us,there was ample evidence both direct and circumstantial from which to find first that hale subjectively believe d that there was a high probability that the goods he was buying and selling were stolen.appliances,at.in his testimony at trial,he acknowledged that he knew from prior experience that there was a very big risk that people selling medicine and aides at flea markets could be fences who had bought the goods at deep discounts from professional shoplifters.the jury could also have found that hale must have thought that it was highly likely that the only way that bridges could be supplying him with trash bags and plastic storage bins full of assorted loose goods at prices well below wholesale on an almost daily basis was for her to be running a booster operation.hale subjective awareness was also indicated by the evidence of his conduct in the aftermath of the search of his warehouse,when he attempted to coach cooke into denying that she knew with whom he was doing business told bridges not to turn on him and warned brock to get rid of his product because the police would likely come after him next.
the record also contains ample evidence from which to find that hale took deliberate actions to avoid confirming that the goods were in fact stolen.for example,the government showed that hale was careful never to ask bridges about who her people were or why so many of her goods were marked with stickers indicating that they belonged on the shelves of local stores.instead,he had such stickers removed.despite knowing from his earlier dealings of the very big risk that individuals selling these types of goods could be fences,he elected not to require his suppliers to ever provide receipts or other documentation showing that they were obtaining their goods through legitimate channels,and he structured his operation in a manner that minimized his direct contact with them.
in light of this and other evidence,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by providing the jury with a willful blindness instruction.see united states ruhe,cir.holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by giving a willful blindness instruction where the record included evidence that the defendant,charged with transporting stolen airplane parts,accepted the parts without the normal documentation and ignored that many of the part
